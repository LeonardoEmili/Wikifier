In  |physics|Physics|   the Lorentz force  is the combination of electric and magnetic  |force|Force|  on a  |point_charge|Point_Charge|  due to  |electromagnetic_fields|Electromagnetic_Field| . A particle of charge q moving with a velocity v in an  |electric_field|Electric_Field|  E and a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field|  B experiences a force of   :   q  + q         The -field is measured in  |amperes|Ampere|  per metre in SI units, and in  |oersteds|Oersted|  in cgs units.  sometimes called  |Laplace_force|Force_On_A_Current-Carrying_Wire| an aspect of  |Faradays_law_of_induction|Faradays_Law_Of_Induction| |relativistic|Special_Relativity|  form of the Lorentz force |charge_qinstantaneous_velocity|Charge_Qinstantaneous_Velocity| in  |SI_units|Si_Units|  all boldface quantities are vectorsEx + vy Bz - vz ByEy + vz Bx - vx BzEz + vx By - vy BxF in detail, if the fingers of the right hand are extended to point in the direction of v and are then curled to point in the direction of B, then the extended thumb will point in the direction of Fv × Bincluding the electric forcenonstandardvFvE |r_unit_3-volume[[charge_density]]|R_Unit_3-Volume[[Charge_Density]]| dFd  +      f  +      force per unit volumecharge per unit volumeJvF     +       dper unit volumef    tflow of energy per unit time per unit distanceJEf  -       PE  +   +    +   +  Fcgs  +      cgsq  B Fq2vBin 1885 and 1889see below |Ce.g._gravit|Ce.G._Gravit| such as an  |electron|Electron|  or  |ion|Ion|  in a  |plasma|Plasma| E+ v × B |ny-body_theo|Ny-Body_Theo| F  is,  |magnitude|Norm_Euclidean_Norm|  of v v cas opposed to the hypothetical test charge of infinitesimally-small mass and chargecalled the  |radiation_reaction_force|Abraham–Lorentz_Force| by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currentssometimes called the Laplace forceF  |lcul|Lcul| Fd or motional EMFqEone of the four modern  |Maxwells_equations|Maxwells_Equations| This is Faradays law of induction, see  |below|Lorentz_Forcelorentz_Force_And_Faraday.27S_Law_Of_Induction| .EMFE  ttttmagnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface, direction is  |orthogonal|Orthogonal|  to that surface patchthat is valid for a moving wire, for instance in a motortttE    d tE    t    t          t  t    t  tB  t      t    t    td  tvB  tsurface ∂Σ time-dependent |scalar|Scalar| E       t BA |themati|Themati| F    tv v has no dependence on position, so theres no need to use  |Feynmans_subscript_notation|Vector_Calculus_Identitiesspecial_Notations|   t   xy  yz  z       2nd EditionUKm2  A field, a particle moving with velocity v ṙ has  |potential_momentum|Potential_Momentum|  q  , so its potential energy is q  . For a ϕ field, the particles potential energy is q  .     The total  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy|  is then:     : Vq      and the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  is:     : T      hence the Lagrangian:     : LT-V      : L  + q - q      Lagranges equations are     :       . So calculating the partial derivatives:     :   & m      & m        & m  q          :   -q  q      equating and simplifying:     : m  q  -q  q      :   Fx & -q  + q      & qEx + q     & qEx + q     & qEx + qx         and similarly for the y and z directions.
