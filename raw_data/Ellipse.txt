               In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an ellipse is a  |plane_curve|Plane_Curve|  surrounding two  |focal_points|Focus| , such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. As such, it generalizes a  |circle|Circle| , which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity e, a number ranging from e  0  to e 1 .      |Analytically|Analytic_Geometry| , the equation of a standard ellipse centered at the origin with width 2a and height 2b is:   :   1 .     Assuming a ≥ b, the foci are  for c   . The standard parametric equation is:   :       0  t  2      Ellipses are the  |closed|Closed_Curve|  type of  |conic_section|Conic_Section| |cone|Cone|  with a  |plane|Plane|  . Ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections,  |parabolas|Parabola|  and  |hyperbolas|Hyperbola| , both of which are  |open|Open_Curve|  and  |unbounded|Unbounded_Set| . An angled  |cross_section|Cross_Section|  of a  |cylinder|Cylinder_Cylindric_Section|  is also an ellipse.     An ellipse may also be defined in terms of one focal point and a line outside the ellipse called the  |directrix|Ellipseeccentricity_And_The_Directrix_Property| |focus|Focus|  and the distance to the directrix is a constant. This constant ratio is the above-mentioned eccentricity:   : e     .     Ellipses are common in  |physics|Physics| ,  |astronomy|Astronomy|  and  |engineering|Engineering| . For example, the  |orbit|Kepler_Orbit|  of each planet in the  |solar_system|Solar_System|  is approximately an ellipse with the Sun at one focus point . The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems of two astronomical bodies. The shapes of planets and stars are often well described by  |ellipsoids|Ellipsoids| . A circle viewed from a side angle looks like an ellipse: that is, the ellipse is the image of a circle under  |parallel|Parallel_Projection|  or  |perspective_projection|Perspective_Projection| . The ellipse is also the simplest  |Lissajous_figure|Lissajous_Figure|  formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are  |sinusoids|Sine_Wave|  with the same frequency: a similar effect leads to  |elliptical_polarization|Elliptical_Polarization|  of light in  |optics|Optics| .     The name,  , was given by  |Apollonius_of_Perga|Apollonius_Of_Perga|  in his Conics.             An ellipse can be defined geometrically as a set or  |locus_of_points|Locus_Of_Points|  in the Euclidean plane:   : Given two fixed points F1, F2 called the foci and a distance 2a which is greater than the distance between the foci, the ellipse is the set of points P such that the sum of the distances  PF1 ,   PF2  is equal to 2a : E   .     The midpoint C of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the ellipse. The line through the foci is called the major axis, and the line perpendicular to it through the center is the minor axis. The major axis intersects the ellipse at the vertex points V1,V2 , which have distance a to the center. The distance c of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity. The quotient e  is the eccentricity.     The case F1F2 yields a circle and is included as a special type of ellipse.     The equation  PF2  +  PF1   2a can be viewed in a different way :   : If c2 is the circle with midpoint F2 and radius 2a , then the distance of a point P to the circle c2 equals the distance to the focus F1 :   ::  PF1  Pc2 .     c2 is called the circular directrix of the ellipse.  The German term for this circle is Leitkreis which can be translated as Director circle , but that term has a different meaning in the English literature . This property should not be confused with the definition of an ellipse using a directrix line below.     Using  |Dandelin_spheres|Dandelin_Spheres| , one can prove that any plane section of a cone with a plane is an ellipse, assuming the plane does not contain the apex and has slope less than that of the lines on the cone.              The standard form of an ellipse in Cartesian coordinates assumes that the origin is the center of the ellipse, the x-axis is the major axis, and:   : the foci are the points F1 ,  F2 ,   : the vertices are V1 ,  V2 .     For an arbitrary point the distance to the focus is     and to the other focus   . Hence the point is on the ellipse whenever:   :   +   2a  .     Removing the  |radicals|Radical_Expression|  by suitable squarings and using b2 a2-c2 produces the standard equation of the ellipse:   :   +   1,     or, solved for y:   : y           The width and height parameters a,  b are called the  |semi_major_and_semi_minor_axes|Semi_Major_And_Semi_Minor_Axes| . The top and bottom points V3 ,  V4 are the co-vertices. The distances from a point on the ellipse to the left and right foci are a + ex and a - ex .     It follows from the equation that the ellipse is symmetric with respect to the coordinate axes and hence with respect to the origin.         a ≥ b Linear eccentricity c Eccentricity e Semi-latus rectum l latus rectum. One half of it is the semi-latus rectum   . A calculation shows:   :     a       The semi-latus rectum   is equal to the  radius of curvature of the  |osculating_circles|Osculating_Circle|  at the vertices.       An arbitrary line g intersects an ellipse at 0, 1, or 2 points, respectively called an exterior line, tangent and secant. Through any point of an ellipse there is a unique tangent. The tangent at a point of the ellipse   +   1 has the coordinate equation:     :   +   1.     A vector  |parametric_equation|Parametric_Equation|  of the tangent is:   :   x     y1  + s      -y1 a2           x1 b2     with   s     .     Proof:   Let be a point on an ellipse and       y1  + s    v  be the equation of any line g containing . Inserting the lines equation into the ellipse equation and respecting   +   1 yields:   :     +   1      2s  + s2  0  .   : There are then cases:   :   +   0. Then line g and the ellipse have only point in common, and g is a tangent. The tangent direction has  |perpendicular_vector|Normal|    &   , so the tangent line has equation   +   k for some k . Because is on the tangent and the ellipse, one obtains k 1 .   :   +     0. Then line g has a second point in common with the ellipse, and is a secant.     Using one finds that   -y1a2 & x1b2   is a tangent vector at point , which proves the vector equation.     If and are two points of the ellipse such that   +   0 , then the points lie on two conjugate diameters .       If the standard ellipse is shifted to have center   , its equation is   :   +   1   .     The axes are still parallel to the x- and y-axes.                 In  |analytic_geometry|Analytic_Geometry| , the ellipse is defined as a quadric: the set of points of the  |Cartesian_plane|Cartesian_Plane|  that, in non-degenerate cases, satisfy the  |implicit|Implicit_And_Explicit_Functions|  equation           : AX2 + B X Y + C Y2 + D X + E Y + F 0     provided B2 - 4AC      .
