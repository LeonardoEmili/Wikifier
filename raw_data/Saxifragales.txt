     The Saxifragales or saxifrages are an  |order|Order|  of  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plant| . Their closest relatives are a large  |eudicot|Eudicot|  group known as the  |rosids|Rosids| , following the  |definition|Circumscription|  of the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  classification system. Saxifragales is one of the groups that compose the  |core_eudicots|Core_Eudicots| , which consists of the  |Dilleniaceae|Dilleniaceae| ,  |superasterids|Superasterids|  and  |superrosids|Superrosids| , the latter consisting of the Saxifragales and  |rosids|Rosids| .     The Saxifragales order is based upon the results of  |molecular_phylogenetic|Molecular_Phylogenetic|  studies of  |DNA_sequences|Dna_Sequence| . It is not part of any of the  |classification_systems|Systematics|  based on  |plant_morphology|Plant_Morphology| . The group is much in need of  |comparative_anatomical|Comparative_Anatomy|  study, especially in light of the recent expansion of the family  |Peridiscaceae|Peridiscaceae|  to include  Medusandra , a genus that before 2009 had usually not been placed in Saxifragales.     The order is divided into  |suprafamilial|Taxonomic_Rank|  groups as shown on the  |phylogenetic_tree|Phylogenetic_Tree|  below. These groups are informal and are not understood to have any particular  |taxonomic_rank|Taxonomic_Rank| .         The  |order|Order|  Saxifragales is extremely  |morphologically|Morphology| |diverse|Biodiversity|  . It includes  |trees|Trees|  , fruit bearing  |shrubs|Shrubs|  ,  |lianas|Lianas| ,  |annual|Annual_Plant|  and  |perennial_herbs|Perennial_Herbs| ,  |rock_garden|Rock_Garden|  plants ,  |ornamental_garden_plants|Ornamental_Garden_Plants| |succulents|Succulents|  , and  |aquatics|Aquatic_Plant|  . The  |flowers|Flowers|  demonstrate variation in  |sepal|Sepal| ,  |petal|Petal| ,  |stamen|Stamen| , and  |carpel|Carpel|  number, as well as  |ovary|Ovary|  position. This degree of diversity makes  |synapomorphy|Synapomorphy|  unclear, but partially fused bicarpellate  |gynoecia|Gynoecia|  , a  |hypanthium|Hypanthium| , and glandular leaf teeth are potential synapomorphies. Common traits include flowers that are usually radially symmetric, petals that are free, and seeds with abundant  |endosperm|Endosperm| . While the families of the woody clade are primarily woody, the primarily herbaceous families of Crassulaceae and Saxifragaceae exhibit woody features as a secondary transition.         With 15  |families|Families| , about 100  |genera|Genera|  and about 2,470  |species|Species| , Saxifragales is a relatvely small  |angiosperm|Angiosperm| |order|Order| .         Saxifragales was first described in 1820 by  |Berchtold_and_Presl|Berchtold_And_Presl|  in 1820 as a group of plants, Saxifrageae, with five genera, including  Saxifraga , an therefore bear their names as the  |botanical_authority|Botanical_Authority|  . At times, that authority has also been given to  |Dumortier|Dumortier| , due to a later publication . Dumortier first used the word Saxifragaceae. By the time of  |John_Lindleys|John_Lindley|  The Vegetable Kingdom , the term Saxifragales was in use, which Lindley called an Alliance, containing five families. Later, the Saxifragales were placed in the  |angiosperm|Angiosperm| |class|Class| |Dicotyledons|Dicotyledons| , also called  |Magnoliopsida|Magnoliopsida| .         The  |order|Order|  Saxifragales has undergone considerable revision in both placement and composition, since the use of  |molecular_phylogenetics|Molecular_Phylogenetics| , and the use of the modern  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  classification. They are identified as a strongly  |monophyletic|Monophyletic|  group.     In the initial APG publication , the Saxifragales were identified within the  |core_eudicots|Core_Eudicots| |clade|Clade|  but its relationship to other clades was uncertain. The core eudicots consist of the order  |Gunnerales|Gunnerales|  and a large clade of  |Pentapetalae|Pentapetalae|  , the latter representing about 70% of all angiosperms, with eight major lineages. Later the order was described as one of the major surprises of molecular phylogenetic analyses of the angiosperms , having elements previously placed in three or four separate subclasses based on morphology. This was eventually resolved in the third APG system placing Saxifragales as a  |sister_group|Sister_Group|  to the  |rosids|Rosids|  , within the Pentapetalae clade. This large combination has subsequently been given the name  |superrosids|Superrosids|  , representing part of an early diversification of the  |angiosperms|Angiosperms| . Among the rosids, they share a number of similarities with the  |Rosales|Rosales| , particularly  |Rosaceae|Rosaceae| , including a hypanthium, five part flowers and free floral parts. As circumscribed, Saxifragales account for 1.3% of eudicot diversity.                 Diversification among Saxifragales was rapid, with the extensive  |fossil|Fossil|  record indicating that the order was more  |diverse|Biodiversity|  and more  |widespread|Cosmopolitan_Distribution|  than an examination of the  |extant|Extant_Taxon|  members suggests, with considerable phenotypic diversity occurring early. The earliest fossil evidence is found in the  |Turonian|Turonian| - |Campanian|Campanian|  , suggesting a minimum age of 89.5   |Myr|Myr| . However, molecular  |divergence_time_estimation|Divergence_Time_Estimation|  suggest an earlier time of 102–108  Myr, into the early Cretaceous, for the  |crown|Crown_Group|  and  |stem_groups|Stem_Group|  respectively. Within the order Saxifragales, the molecular data imply a very rapid initial diversification time of about 6–8  Myr, between 112–120  Myr, with major lineages appearing within 3–6  Myr.     The ancestral state appears to be woody, as in Peridiscaceae and the woody clade, but also ancestral to Grossulariaceae. A number of independent transitions to a herbaceous habit in the ancestors of Crassulaceae, Saxifragaceae and the base of the Haloragaceae-Penthoraceae clade, the other two families in Haloragaceae s.l. remaining woody, while other taxa reverted to a woody habit, especially Crassulaceae. Most of Saxifragaleshave a superior ovary, but some families show frequent transition with inferior or subinferior position, particularly Saxifragaceae and to a lesser extent Hamamelidaceae. Almost all Grossulariaceae have an inferior ovary. The ancestral carpel number is two, with transition to higher numbers, such as four in Haloragaceae s.l. and Peridiscaceae with five in Penthoraceae. The ancestral number for Crassulaceae is two, decreasing to Kalanchoe, where it is synapomorphic, though the most frequent transition in this family is 6–10, but only where stamen number is increased above five. Some Macronesian taxa have 8–12, with up to 32 carpels for Aeonium.     The ancestral petal number is five, with three major transitions; 5 to 0, 5 to 4, 5 to 6–10. Increased petal number is seen in Paeoniaceae and Crassulaceae, particularly where stamen number is also increased. Cercidiphyllum + Daphniphyllum, Chrysosplenium and Altingia are examples of the complete loss of petals. The ancestral stamen:petal ratio is 1, with transitions characterising several clades, e.g. Paeonicaceae+woody clade              .
