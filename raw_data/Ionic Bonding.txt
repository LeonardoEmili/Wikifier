      Ionic bonding is a type of  |chemical_bond|Chemical_Bond| ing that involves the  |electrostatic_attraction|Coulombs_Law|  between oppositely charged  |ions|Ion| , and is the primary interaction occurring in  |ionic_compounds|Ionic_Compound| . It is one of the main bonds along with  |Covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond|  and  |Metallic_bonding|Metallic_Bonding| . Ions are atoms that have either gained or lost one or more  |electrons|Electrons| . Ions that have gained an electron are negatively charged. They are  |anions|Anion| . Ions that have lost an electron are positively charged. They are  |cations|Cations| . This transfer of electrons is known as electrovalence in contrast to  |covalence|Covalent_Bond| . In the simplest case, the cation is a  |metal|Metal|  atom and the anion is a  |nonmetal|Nonmetal|  atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e.g. molecular ions like  or . In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a  |metal|Metal|  to a  |non-metal|Non-Metal|  in order to obtain a full valence shell for both atoms.     It is important to recognize that clean ionic bonding – in which one atom or molecule completely transfers an electron to another cannot exist: all ionic compounds have some degree of  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond| ing, or electron sharing. Thus, the term ionic bonding is given when the ionic character is greater than the covalent character – that is, a bond in which a large  |electronegativity|Electronegativity|  difference exists between the two atoms, causing the bonding to be more polar than in covalent bonding where electrons are shared more equally. Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called  |polar_covalent_bonds|Polar_Covalent_Bond| .     Ionic compounds conduct  |electricity|Electricity|  when molten or in solution, typically as a solid. Ionic compounds generally have a high  |melting_point|Melting_Point| , depending on the charge of the ions they consist of. The higher the charges the stronger the cohesive forces and the higher the melting point. They also tend to be  |soluble|Solubility|  in water; the stronger the cohesive forces, the lower the solubility. Ionic Interactions in Natural and Synthetic Macromolecules, Editors: Alberto Ciferri, Angelo Perico, Wiley 2012, p 35-47;        Atoms that have an almost full or almost empty  |valence_shell|Valence_Shell|  tend to be very  |reactive|Chemical_Reaction| . Atoms that are strongly electronegative  often have only one or two empty orbitals in their valence shell, and frequently  |bond|Chemical_Bond|  with other molecules or gain electrons to form  |anions|Anions| . Atoms that are weakly electronegative  have relatively few valence electrons, which can easily be shared with atoms that are strongly electronegative. As a result, weakly electronegative atoms tend to distort their electron cloud and form  |cations|Cations| .       Ionic bonding can result from a  |redox|Redox|  reaction when atoms of an element , whose  |ionization_energy|Ionization_Energy|  is low, give some of their electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In doing so, cations are formed. An atom of another element with greater  |electron_affinity|Electron_Affinity|  accepts the electron to attain a stable electron configuration, and after accepting electron an atom becomes an anion. Typically, the stable electron configuration is one of the  |noble_gases|Noble_Gases|  for elements in the  |s-block|S-Block|  and the  |p-block|P-Block| , and particular  |stable_electron_configurations|Electron_Configuration|  for  |d-block|D-Block|  and  |f-block|F-Block|  elements. The electrostatic attraction between the anions and cations leads to the formation of a solid with a  |crystallographic_lattice|Crystallographic_Lattice|  in which the ions are stacked in an alternating fashion. In such a lattice, it is usually not possible to distinguish discrete molecular units, so that the compounds formed are not molecular in nature. However, the ions themselves can be complex and form molecular ions like the acetate anion or the ammonium cation.     For example, common  |table_salt|Table_Salt|  is  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride| . When  |sodium|Sodium|  and  |chlorine|Chlorine|  are combined, the sodium atoms each lose an  |electron|Electron| , forming cations , and the chlorine atoms each gain an electron to form anions . These ions are then attracted to each other in a 1:1 ratio to form sodium chloride .   : Na + Cl → Na + + Cl − → NaCl     However, to maintain charge neutrality, strict ratios between anions and cations are observed so that ionic compounds, in general, obey the rules of stoichiometry despite not being molecular compounds. For compounds that are transitional to the alloys and possess mixed ionic and metallic bonding, this may not be the case anymore. Many sulfides, e.g., do form non-stoichiometric compounds.     Many ionic compounds are referred to as salts as they can also be formed by the neutralization reaction of an Arrhenius base like NaOH with an Arrhenius acid like HCl     : NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H 2 O     The salt NaCl is then said to consist of the acid rest Cl − and the base rest Na + .          The removal of electrons from the cation is endothermic, raising the systems overall energy. There may also be energy changes associated with breaking of existing bonds or the addition of more than one electron to form anions. However, the action of the anions accepting the cations valence electrons and the subsequent attraction of the ions to each other releases energy and, thus, lowers the overall energy of the system.     Ionic bonding will occur only if the overall energy change for the reaction is favorable. In general, the reaction is exothermic, but, e.g., the formation of mercuric oxide is endothermic. The charge of the resulting ions is a major factor in the strength of ionic bonding, e.g. a salt C + A − is held together by electrostatic forces roughly four times weaker than C 2+ A 2− according to Coulombs law, where C and A represent a generic cation and anion respectively. The sizes of the ions and the particular packing of the lattice are ignored in this rather simplistic argument.          Ionic compounds in the solid state form lattice structures. The two principal factors in determining the form of the lattice are the relative charges of the ions and their relative sizes. Some structures are adopted by a number of compounds; for example, the structure of the rock salt  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride|  is also adopted by many  |alkali|Alkali_Metals|  halides, and binary oxides such as  |magnesium_oxide|Magnesium_Oxide| .  |Paulings_rules|Paulings_Rules|  provide guidelines for predicting and rationalizing the crystal structures of ionic crystals            For a solid crystalline ionic compound the  |enthalpy|Enthalpy|  change in forming the solid from gaseous ions is termed the  |lattice_energy|Lattice_Energy| .   The experimental value for the  |lattice_energy|Lattice_Energy|  can be determined using the  |Born–Haber_cycle|Born–Haber_Cycle| . It can also be calculated using the  |Born–Landé_equation|Born–Landé_Equation|  as the sum of the  |electrostatic_potential_energy|Electrostatic_Potential_Energy| , calculated by summing interactions between cations and anions, and a short-range repulsive potential energy term. The electrostatic potential can be expressed in terms of the interionic separation and a constant  that takes account of the geometry of the crystal. The further away from the nucleus the weaker the shield. The  |Born-Landé_equation|Born-Landé_Equation|  gives a reasonable fit to the lattice energy of, e.g., sodium chloride, where the calculated value is −756  kJ/mol, which compares to −787  kJ/mol using the  |Born–Haber_cycle|Born–Haber_Cycle| .

Principles and Methods in Supramolecular Chemistry ...   Wiley; Chichester, New York, Weinheim, Brisbane, Singapore, Toronto , 2000 The strength of salt bridges is most often evaluated by measurements of equilibria between molecules containing cationic and anionioc sites, most often in solution.  Equilibrium constants in water indicate additive free energy contributions for each salt bridge. Another method for the identification of hydrogen bonds also in complicated molecules is  |crystallography|Crystallography| , sometimes also NMR-spectroscopy.          |Ions|Ion|  in  |crystal_lattices|Crystal_Lattice|  of purely ionic compounds are  |spherical|Sphere| ; however, if the positive ion is small and/or highly charged, it will distort the electron cloud of the negative ion, an effect summarised in  |Fajans_rules|Fajans_Rules| . This  |polarization|Polarization|  of the negative ion leads to a build-up of extra charge density between the two  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus| , that is, to partial covalency. Larger negative ions are more easily polarized, but the effect is usually important only when positive ions with  |charges|Electrical_Charge|  of 3+ are involved. However, 2+ ions or even 1+ show some polarizing power because their sizes are so small . Note that this is not the  |ionic_polarization|Ionic_Polarization|  effect that refers to displacement of ions in the lattice due to the application of an electric field.       In ionic bonding, the atoms are bound by attraction of oppositely charged ions, whereas, in  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond| ing, atoms are bound by sharing electrons to attain stable electron configurations. In covalent bonding, the  |molecular_geometry|Molecular_Geometry|  around each atom is determined by valence shell electron pair repulsion  |VSEPR|Vsepr|  rules, whereas, in ionic materials, the geometry follows maximum  |packing|Close-Packing|  rules. One could say that covalent bonding is more directional in the sense that the energy penalty for not adhering to the optimum bond angles is large, whereas ionic bonding has no such penalty. There are no shared electron pairs to repel each other, the ions should simply be packed as efficiently as possible. This often leads to much higher  |coordination_numbers|Coordination_Number| . In NaCl, each ion has 6 bonds and all bond angles are 90°. In CsCl the coordination number is 8. By comparison carbon typically has a maximum of four bonds.     Purely ionic bonding cannot exist, as the proximity of the entities involved in the bonding allows some degree of sharing  |electron_density|Electron_Density|  between them. Therefore, all ionic bonding has some covalent character. Thus, bonding is considered ionic where the ionic character is greater than the covalent character. The larger the difference in  |electronegativity|Electronegativity|  between the two types of atoms involved in the bonding, the more ionic it is. Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called  |polar_covalent_bonds|Polar_Covalent_Bond| . For example, Na–Cl and Mg–O interactions have a few percent covalency, while Si–O bonds are usually ~50% ionic and ~50% covalent.  |Pauling|Linus_Pauling|  estimated that an electronegativity difference of 1.7  corresponds to 50% ionic character, so that a difference greater than 1.7 corresponds to a bond which is predominantly ionic. L. Pauling The Nature of the Chemical Bond p.98-100.   Ionic character in covalent bonds can be directly measured for atoms having quadrupolar nuclei . These nuclei are generally objects of NQR  |nuclear_quadrupole_resonance|Nuclear_Quadrupole_Resonance|  and NMR  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance|  studies. Interactions between the nuclear quadrupole moments Q and the electric field gradients are characterized via the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants   :QCC    where the eq zz term corresponds to the principal component of the EFG tensor and e is the elementary charge. In turn, the electric field gradient opens the way to description of bonding modes in molecules when the QCC values are accurately determined by NMR or NQR methods.     In general, when ionic bonding occurs in the solid state, it is not possible to talk about a single ionic bond between two individual atoms, because the cohesive forces that keep the lattice together are of a more collective nature. This is quite different in the case of covalent bonding, where we can often speak of a distinct bond localized between two particular atoms. However, even if ionic bonding is combined with some covalency, the result is not .
