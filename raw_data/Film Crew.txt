                A film crew is a group of people, hired by a production company, for the purpose of  |producing_a_film_or_motion_picture|Filmmaking| . The  crew  is distinguished from the cast as the cast are understood to be the  |actors|Actor|  who appear in front of the  |camera|Camera|  or provide voices for characters in the film. The crew is also separate from the producers as the producers are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the films  |intellectual_property_rights|Intellectual_Property_Rights| . A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and film-making cultures.     Motion picture projects have three discrete stages: development, production and distribution. Within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases — pre-production, principal photography and post-production — and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases. Distinctions are also made between  |above-the-line|Above_The_Line|  personnel who begin their involvement during the projects development stage, and the  |below-the-line|Below_The_Line|  technical crew involved only with the production stage.          A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. The director most often has the highest authority on a film set. Generally, a film director controls a films artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of film-making. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.     The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the films budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.         Production is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the films producers and executive producers and production office staff such as the production manager, the production coordinator, and their assistants; the various assistant directors; the accounting staff and sometimes the locations manager and their assistants.      Producer    :A film producer creates the conditions for film-making. The producer initiates, coordinates, supervises, and controls matters such as fund raising, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors. The producer is involved throughout all phases of the film making process from development to completion of a project. There may be several producers on a film who may take a role in a number of areas, such as development, financing or production.    Executive producer   :An executive producer is a producer who was not involved in the technical aspects of the film-making process in the original definition, but has played a financial or creative role in ensuring that the project goes into production. Today, however, the title has become ambiguous, particularly in feature films. Since the 1980s, it has become increasingly common for the line producer to be given the title of executive producer, while the initiating producer takes the produced by credit. On other projects, the reverse happens, with the line producer taking the produced by credit. So the two credits have become effectively interchangeable, with no precise definition.          Line producer    : The line producer is the liaison between the studio or producer and the production manager, responsible for managing the  |production_budget|Production_Budget| . The title is associated with the idea that they are the person who is on the line on a day-to-day basis, and responsible for lining up the resources needed.    Production assistant    : Production assistants, referred to as PAs, assist in the production office or in various departments with general tasks, such as assisting the first assistant director with set operations.          Production manager    : The production manager supervises the physical aspects of the production including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. It is the production managers responsibility to make sure the filming stays on schedule and within its budget. The PM also helps manage the day-to-day budget by managing operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The PM often works under the supervision of a line producer and directly supervises the production coordinator.    Assistant production manager    :The assistant production manager is the assistant to the production manager and carries out various jobs for the PM. Normally only big budget Hollywood feature films have an assistant PM.    Unit manager    : The unit manager fulfils the same role as the production manager but for secondary unit shooting. In some functional structures, the unit manager subsumes the role of the transport coordinator.    Production coordinator    : The production coordinator is the information nexus of the production, responsible for organizing all the logistics from hiring crew, renting equipment, and booking talent. The PC is an integral part of film production.         ;  |First_assistant_director|Assistant_Director|    : The first assistant director assists the production manager and director. The ultimate aim of any 1st AD is to ensure the film comes in on schedule while maintaining a safe working environment in which the director, principal artists and crew can be focused on their work. They oversee day-to-day management of the cast and crew scheduling, equipment, script, and set. A 1st AD may also be responsible for directing background action for major shots or the entirety of relatively minor shots, at the directors discretion.   ;  |Second_assistant_director|Assistant_Director|    : The second assistant director is the chief assistant of the 1st AD and helps carry out those tasks delegated to the 1st AD.

Normally in the American system 2nd 2nd ADs control big crowd extras and make sure if shooting on location none of the public get into shots.         ; Production accountant    : Production accountants manage the money and ensure the production comes in on budget and everyone gets paid. The industry is notorious for unusual accounting methods which are collectively labelled  |Hollywood_accounting|Hollywood_Accounting| . Production accountants are often assisted by assistant accountants, sometimes called clerks, responsible for accounts receivable, accounts payable and payroll.         ;  |Location_manager|Location_Manager|    : Oversees the locations department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the production manager or assistant director .

The assistant location manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the location manager continues pre-production from elsewhere on the upcoming locations.   ;  |Location_scout|Location_Scout|    : Does much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the location manager will do some scouting themselves, as well as the assistant location manager.   ; Location assistant   : Hired by the location manager to be on-set before, during, and after the filming process. General responsibilities include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming; fielding complaints from neighbours; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, making sure it seems as though the film crew was never there. There are generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.   ; Location production assistant   : This position exists generally on larger budget productions. The locations PA is the assistant who is almost never on-set, but instead is always prepping a location or wrapping a location; that is, when a location requires several days of setup and breakdown preceding and following the day of filming. A location production assistant is what a set production assistant is in Canada.         Since the turn of the 21st century, several additional professionals are now routinely listed in the production credits on most major motion pictures.   ; Unit publicist    : The publicist liaises between the film production and the media.

They make notes on every shot, and keep track of props,  |blocking|Blocking| , and other details to ensure continuity between shots and scenes. An important part of a script supervisors job is to make sure that actors movements, the directions they are looking in a shot, particularly when speaking to or responding to another actor, plus the positions of props they are using and every thing else matches from shot to shot. If there is an apparent mismatch, the director must be informed immediately so that it can be reshot before the lighting setup is changed or at least before the location is wrapped and the set is struck. Not only does the job of script supervisor require a great deal of awareness and meticulous note-taking skills, it also requires much diplomacy to advise the director that they may have a problem editing something just recorded. The script supervisor is also in charge of providing the official scene numbers and take numbers to the second camera assistant for the slate, as well as to the sound mixer, and to clearly note which take the director has chosen to be used in the finished product. All of this information is then relayed to the editor every day after shooting has wrapped in the form of copies made of both the script supervisors notes as well as their matching script pages.         ;  |Casting_director|Casting_Director|    :The casting director chooses the actors for the characters of the film. This usually involves inviting potential actors to read an excerpt from the script for an audition.   ; Cast PA   :The cast PA assists the actors of the film.

Typically, the director tells the DoP how they want a shot to look, and the DoP chooses the correct lens, filter, lighting and composition to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. The DoP is the senior creative crew member after the director.   : The term  Cinematographer  is usually synonymous with director of photography, though some professionals insist this only applies when the director of photography and camera operator are the same person.       ;  |Camera_operator|Camera_Operator|    : The camera operator uses the camera at the direction of the cinematographer, director of photography, or the film director to capture the scenes on film or video.

The 2nd AC is also in charge of overseeing the meticulously kept notebooks that record when the film stock is received, used, and sent to the lab for processing. Additionally, the 2nd AC oversees organization of camera equipment and transport of the equipment from one shooting location to another.   ; Film loader   : The loader transfers motion picture film from the manufacturers light-tight canisters to the camera magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places it back into the light-tight cans for transport to the laboratory. It is the responsibility of the loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.   ; Camera production assistant   : The camera PA,  camera intern or  camera trainee, assists the crew while learning the trade of the camera assistant, operator or cinematographer.   ;  |Digital_imaging_technician|Digital_Imaging_Technician|    :On digital photography productions the digital imaging technician, or DIT, is responsible for the coordination of the internal workings of the digital camera.

Although this is not a creative role, it is pivotal in ensuring that the films post-production budget is manageable and achievable, and that all deadlines are met. Because large amounts of money are involved, and most of a films budget is spent during production, the post-production period can often be difficult and challenging.       ; Negative cutter   : The negative cutter cuts and splices the negatives as directed by the film editor, and then provides the assembled negative reels to the lab in order for prints to be made.   ;  |Colorist|Color_Grading|    : With a photochemical process, the color timer adjusts the color of the film via printer lights for greater consistency in the films colors. With a  |digital_intermediate|Digital_Intermediate|  process, the colorist can use digital tools in manipulating the image and has greater creative freedom in changing the aesthetic of a film.   ; Telecine colorist   : A Telecine colorist is responsible for a grade – that is a look that has been created with a grading system, which adjusts brightness, contrast and color.          |Visual_effects|Visual_Effects|  commonly refers to post-production alterations of the films images. The on set VFX crew works to prepare shots and plates for future visual effects. This may include adding tracking markers, taking and asking for reference plates and helping the  |Director|Executive_Director|  understand the limitations and ease of certain shots that will effect the future post production. A VFX crew can also work alongside the  |Special_effects|Special_Effects|  department for any on-set optical effects that need physical representation during filming     ; Visual effects producer   : The visual effects producer works with the visual effects supervisor to break down the script into storyboards, and advises the director as to how s/he should approach the scenes. Together they determine which sequences are to be shot as live action elements, which would work well in miniature, and which should be computer generated.   ;  |Visual_effects_creative_director|Vfx_Creative_Director|    : VFX creative directors are very much like production designers, except they direct and supervise the creative side of the films visual effects. The position is particularly in demand for films with massive amounts of computer generated imagery and scenes.   ;  |Visual_effects_supervisor|Visual_Effects_Supervisor|    : The visual effects supervisor is in charge of the VFX crew, working with production and the films director to achieve the desired in-camera optical effects of the film.   ; Visual effects editor   : The visual effects editor incorporates visual effects into the current cuts of live action sequences, producing multiple versions of each shot. Altered scenes are then evaluated by the visual effects supervisor and creative director for aesthetic and technical direction, and by the producers for review and final editing.   ; Compositor   : A compositor is a visual effects artist responsible for  |compositing|Compositing|  images from different sources such as video, film, computer generated 3-D imagery, 2-D animations, matte paintings, photographs, and text.   ; Rotoscope artists/ paint artists   : Rotoscope & painters artists may  |rotoscope|Rotoscoping|  the footage, manually creating  |mattes|Matte|  for use in compositing. They may also paint visual information into or out of a scene, such as removing wires and rigs, logos, dust busting, scratch removal, etc.      ;  |Matte_painter|Matte_Painting|    : Matte painters draw/paint entire sets or extend portions of an existing set.         ;  |Sound_designer|Sound_Designer|    : The sound designer, or supervising sound editor, is in charge of the post-production sound of a movie. Sometimes this may involve great creative license, and other times it may simply mean working with the director and editor to balance the sound to their liking.   ;  |Dialogue_editor|Dialogue_Editor|    : The dialogue editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the dialog in the soundtrack.   ;  |Sound_editor|Sound_Editor|    : The sound editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the sound effects in the soundtrack.   ;  |Re-recording_mixer|Re-Recording_Mixer|    : The re-recording mixer balances all of the sounds prepared by the dialogue, music and effects editors, and finalizes the films audio track.   ;  |Music_supervisor|Music_Supervisor|    : The music supervisor works with the composer, mixers and editors to create and integrate the films music. In  |Hollywood|Cinema_Of_The_United_States|  a music supervisors primary responsibility is to act as liaison between the film production and the  |recording_industry|Recording_Industry| , negotiating the use rights for all source music used in a film.   ;  |Composer|Composer|    : The composer is responsible for writing the  |musical_score|Film_Score|  for a film.   ;  |Foley_artist|Foley_Artist|    : The foley artist is the person who creates the post-sync sound effects for a film. These sound effects are recorded in sync to picture and are mostly body movements, footsteps or object manipulations. The most common reason for recording these effects live to picture is the fact that such sounds are lost when the dialogue is removed to be replaced by a foreign language version. Unsatisfactorily recorded sync sound effects can also be replaced with foley effects. Foley artists are also known as foley walkers. Foley is named after its first known practitioner, an early hollywood sound editor named  |Jack_Foley|Jack_Foley| .     ; Conductor/ Orchestrator   : A conductor is supposed to be knowledable of special synchronization procedures to conduct the score to an orchestra. An orchestrator is someone who furthers the composers notes and symbols and fills out the intended notation for the film score.     ; Score Recorder/ Mixer   : A scores recorder is someone who recordes the film score and a scores mixer is someone who mixes the film score.     ; Music Preparation   : A music preparer is someone who prepares out the score for orchestra performers and who copies out the music.     ; Music Editor   : A music editor is someone who edits the film score and works with the composer to make sure it goes with the film.     ;   : Additional Orchestration people work with the conductor/ orchestrator and edit the film score.       Previs is the visual planning and design of feature films. They are brought in at an early stage to visualize in complex 3d animatics how scenes in the film might look like. They work with the Director, producers, VFX supervisor and production designer on conceptualising ideas. Once in a fully designed sequence, these animatics are used by stunts, filming units and production to plan and shoot the scenes - helping with planning, resourcing and costing these shots.          |Animation|Animation|  film crews have many of the same roles and departments as live-action films , but nearly all on-set departments were traditionally replaced with a single animation department made up of various types of  |animators|Animator|  . In  |traditional_animation|Traditional_Animation| , the nature of the medium meant that everything was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters, making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant. Because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive, animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated.     However, since the turn of the 21st century, modern  |3D_computer_graphics|3D_Computer_Graphics|  and  |computer_animation|Computer_Animation|  have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before. Many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians, grips, costume designers, props masters, set decorators, set dressers, and cinematographers. They make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts, but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set. There have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of  |hair|Hair| .
