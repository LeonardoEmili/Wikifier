   Foreign relations of Afghanistan are handled by the nations  |Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs|Ministry_Of_Foreign_Affairs| , which is headed by  |Salahuddin_Rabbani|Salahuddin_Rabbani| . He answers to, and receives guidance from, the  |President_of_Afghanistan|President_Of_Afghanistan| ,  |Ashraf_Ghani|Ashraf_Ghani| .     The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has close and friendly relations with a number of countries around the world, including:  |Turkey|Afghan–Turkish_Relations| ,  |United_States|Afghanistan_–_United_States_Relations| ,  |United_Kingdom|Afghanistan–United_Kingdom_Relations| ,  |Japan|Afghanistan–Japan_Relations| ,  |Germany|Afghanistan_Germany_Relations| ,  |Spain|Foreign_Relations_Of_Spain| ,  |South_Korea|Afghanistan_South_Korea_Relations| ,  |Italy|Foreign_Relations_Of_Italy| ,  |India|Afghanistan–India_Relations| ,  |China|Afghanistan–Peoples_Republic_Of_China_Relations| ,  |Canada|Afghanistan–Canada_Relations| ,  |United_Arab_Emirates|Afghanistan–United_Arab_Emirates_Relations|  and many others.       1980s  |Soviet_war|Soviet–Afghan_War| , Afghanistan pursued a policy of  |neutrality|Neutral_Country|  and nonalignment rein its foreign relations, being one of a few independent nations to stay neutral in both  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . In international forums, Afghanistan generally followed the voting patterns of Asian and African non-aligned countries. During the 1950s and 1960s, Afghanistan was able to use the  |Russian|Soviet_Union|  and American need for allies during the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  as a way to receive economic assistance from both countries. However, given that unlike Russia, America refused to give extensive military aid to the country, the government of  |Daoud_Khan|Mohammed_Daoud_Khan|  developed warmer ties with the  |USSR|Ussr|  while officially remaining non-aligned. Following the  |coup_of_April_1978|Saur_Revolution| , the government under  |Nur_Muhammad_Taraki|Nur_Muhammad_Taraki|  developed significantly closer ties with the Soviet Union and its communist  |satellites|Satellite_State| .     After the December 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistans foreign policy mirrored that of the Soviet Union. Afghan foreign policymakers attempted, with little success, to increase their regimes low standing in the noncommunist world. With the signing of the  |Geneva_Accords|Geneva_Accords| , President  |Najibullah|Mohammad_Najibullah|  unsuccessfully sought to end the  |Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistans|Democratic_Republic_Of_Afghanistan|  isolation within the Islamic world and in the  |Non_Aligned_Movement|Non_Aligned_Movement| .     Most  |Western_countries|Western_Countries| , including the United States, maintained small diplomatic missions in the capital city of  |Kabul|Kabul|  during the Soviet occupation. Many countries subsequently closed their missions due to instability and heavy fighting in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.     Many countries initially welcomed the introduction of the  |Taliban_regime|Islamic_Emirate_Of_Afghanistan| , who they saw as a stabilizing, law-enforcing alternative to the  |warlords|Warlord|  who had ruled the country since the fall of Najibullahs government in 1992. The Taliban soon became alienated of those countries positive feelings with knowledge of the harsh  |Sharia|Sharia|  law being enforced in Taliban-controlled territories spreading around the world. The brutality towards women who attempted to work, learn, or leave the house without a male escort caused outside aid to the war-torn country to be limited.     Following the  |October_2001_American_invasion|Operation_Enduring_Freedom|  and the  |Bonn_Agreement|Bonn_Agreement|  the  |new_government|Presidency_Of_Hamid_Karzai|  under the leadership of  |Hamid_Karzai|Hamid_Karzai|  started to re-establish diplomatic relationships with many countries who had held close diplomatic relations before the communist coup détat and the subsequent civil war.     The Afghan government is focused on securing continued assistance for rebuilding the economy, infrastructure, and  |military|Military_Of_Afghanistan|  of the country. It has continued to maintain close ties with North America, the  |European_Union|European_Union| , South Korea, Japan, Australia, India, China, Russia and the  |Greater_Middle_East|Greater_Middle_East|  as well as African nations. It also seeks to establish relations with more  |South_American|South_American|  or Latin nations. In late 2011, relations between Afghanistan and Dominican Republic were established.                                              During the Soviet occupation, the United Nations was highly critical of the U.S.S.R.s interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and was instrumental in obtaining a negotiated Soviet withdrawal under the terms of the  |Geneva_Accords|Geneva_Accords| .     In the aftermath of the Accords and subsequent Soviet withdrawal, the United Nations has assisted in the repatriation of refugees and has provided humanitarian aid such as health care, educational programs, and food and has supported  |mine_clearing|Demining|  operations. The  |UNDP|United_Nations_Development_Programme|  and associated agencies have undertaken a limited number of development projects. However, the UN reduced its role in Afghanistan in 1992 in the wake of fierce factional strife in and around Kabul. The  |UN_Secretary_General|Un_Secretary_General|  has designated a personal representative to head the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan and the Special Mission to Afghanistan , both based in  |Islamabad|Islamabad| .
