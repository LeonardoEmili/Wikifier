                     An earthquake  is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the  |Earths|Earth| |lithosphere|Lithosphere|  that creates  |seismic_waves|Seismic_Wave| . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those strong enough to destroy whole cities. The  |seismicity|Seismicity| , or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word tremor is also used for  |non-earthquake_seismic_rumbling|Episodic_Tremor_And_Slip| .     At the Earths surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the  |epicenter|Epicenter|  of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a  |tsunami|Tsunami| . Earthquakes can also trigger  |landslides|Landslide|  and occasionally, volcanic activity.     In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological  |faults|Fault|  but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and  |nuclear_tests|Underground_Nuclear_Testing| . An earthquakes point of initial rupture is called its  |focus|Focus|  or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.            Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a  |fault_plane|Fault| . The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and  |aseismically|Aseismic_Creep|  only if there are no irregularities or  |asperities|Asperity|  along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of  |stick-slip_behavior|Stick-Slip_Phenomenon| . Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the  |stored_energy|Potential_Energy| .  This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic  |strain|Strain| |seismic_waves|Seismic_Waves| , Vassiliou, Marius and Hiroo Kanamori : “The Energy Release in Earthquakes,” Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am. 72, 371-387. frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the  |elastic-rebound_theory|Elastic-Rebound_Theory| . It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquakes total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquakes energy is used to power the earthquake  |fracture|Fracture|  growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earths available  |elastic_potential_energy|Elastic_Potential_Energy|  and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the  |Earths_deep_interior.|Structure_Of_The_Earth|            There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an  |interplate_earthquake|Interplate_Earthquake| |dip|Strike_And_Dip|  and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being  |extended|Extensional_Tectonics|  such as a  |divergent_boundary|Divergent_Boundary| . Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being  |shortened|Thrust_Tectonics|  such as at a convergent boundary.  |Strike-slip_faults|Strike-Slip_Fault|  are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.     Reverse faults, particularly those along  |convergent_plate_boundaries|Convergent_Boundary| , are associated with the most powerful earthquakes,  |megathrust_earthquakes|Megathrust_Earthquake| , including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental  |transforms|Transform_Fault| , can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 30 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 900 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Geoscience Australia     This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures  and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earths crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about  flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes. Sibson R.H. Fault Zone Models, Heat Flow, and the Depth Distribution of Earthquakes in the Continental Crust of the United States , Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, Vol 72, No. 1, pp. 151–163 Sibson, R.H. Geology of the crustal earthquake source International handbook of earthquake and engineering seismology, Volume 1, Part 1, p. 455, eds. W H K Lee, H Kanamori, P C Jennings, and C. Kisslinger, Academic Press,  The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults are approximately . Examples are the earthquakes in  |Alaska|1957_Andreanof_Islands_Earthquake| ,  |Chile|1960_Valdivia_Earthquake| , and  |Sumatra|2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake_And_Tsunami| , all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the  |San_Andreas_Fault|San_Andreas_Fault|  , the  |North_Anatolian_Fault|North_Anatolian_Fault|  in Turkey , and the  |Denali_Fault|Denali_Fault|  in Alaska , are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.          The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.  Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can become  , making the most powerful earthquakes possible.     Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of  within the brittle crust.  Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about . Hjaltadóttir S., 2010, Use of relatively located microearthquakes to map fault patterns and estimate the thickness of the brittle crust in Southwest Iceland      In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress level in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.  This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that pushes the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force  equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass escapes in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.             Where plate boundaries occur within the  |continental_lithosphere|Continental_Crust| , deformation is spread out over a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the  |San_Andreas_fault|San_Andreas_Fault|  continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace . The  |Northridge_earthquake|1994_Northridge_Earthquake|  was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the  |Arabian|Arabian_Plate|  and  |Eurasian_plates|Eurasian_Plate|  where it runs through the northwestern part of the  |Zagros_Mountains|Zagros_Mountains| . The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself. This is demonstrated by earthquake  |focal_mechanisms|Focal_Mechanism| .      All tectonic plates have internal stress fields caused by their interactions with neighboring plates and sedimentary loading or unloading .  These stresses may be sufficient to cause failure along existing fault planes, giving rise to intraplate earthquakes.                The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate at the ring of fire in depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than  are classified as shallow-focus earthquakes, while those with a focal-depth between  are commonly termed mid-focus or intermediate-depth earthquakes. In  |subduction_zones|Subduction| , where older and colder  |oceanic_crust|Oceanic_Crust|  descends beneath another tectonic plate,  |deep-focus_earthquakes|Deep-Focus_Earthquake|  may occur at much greater depths .  These seismically active areas of subduction are known as  |Wadati–Benioff_zones|Wadati–Benioff_Zone| . Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted  |lithosphere|Lithosphere|  should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by  |olivine|Olivine|  undergoing a  |phase_transition|Phase_Transition|  into a  |spinel|Spinel|  structure.             Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by  |tectonic|Tectonic_Plates|  faults and the movement of  |magma|Magma|  in  |volcano|Volcano| es. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the  |1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens|1980_Eruption_Of_Mount_St._Helens| .  Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by  |seismometers|Seismometers|  and  |tiltmeters|Tiltmeter|  and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.        A tectonic earthquake begins by an initial rupture at a point on the fault surface, a process known as nucleation. The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than  while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.     Rupture propagation is generally modeled using a  |fracture_mechanics|Fracture_Mechanics|  approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity is a function of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70–90% of the S-wave velocity, which is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These  |supershear_earthquakes|Supershear_Earthquake|  have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the  |2001_Kunlun_earthquake|2001_Kunlun_Earthquake|  has been attributed to the effects of the  |sonic_boom|Sonic_Boom|  developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as  |slow_earthquakes|Slow_Earthquake| . A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the  |tsunami_earthquake|Tsunami_Earthquake| , observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the  |1896_Sanriku_earthquake|1896_Sanriku_Earthquake| .         |Tides|Tides|  may induce some  |seismicity|Seismicity| . See  |tidal_triggering_of_earthquakes|Tidal_Triggering_Of_Earthquakes|  for details.       Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.  Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.              An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. If an aftershock is larger than the main shock, the aftershock is redesignated as the main shock and the original main shock is redesignated as a  |foreshock|Foreshock| . Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced  |fault_plane|Fault|  adjusts to the effects of the main shock.          Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of  |aftershocks|Aftershock|  by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, so none has a notable higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at  |Yellowstone_National_Park|Yellowstone_National_Park| .  In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook  |Southern_Californias|Southern_California| |Imperial_Valley|Imperial_Valley| , showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.      Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to  |aftershocks|Aftershock|  but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the  |North_Anatolian_Fault|North_Anatolian_Fault|  in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.       Intensity of earth quaking and magnitude of earthquakes |strong-motion_accelerometers|Accelerograph|  that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated on the basis of the observed effects, as categorized on various  |seismic_intensity_scales|Seismic_Intensity_Scales| . Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the Earths crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions but also on the strength or magnitude of the rupture, and on its distance. .     The  |first_scale_for_measuring_earthquake_magnitudes|Seismic_Magnitude_Scalesrichter|  was developed by  |Charles_F._Richter|Charles_F._Richter|  in 1935. Subsequent scales  have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale. .     Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as Richter magnitude or Richter scale , standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquakes strength on the  |moment_magnitude|Seismic_Scalemw|  scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake. The USGS policy for reporting magnitudes to the press was posted at  , but has been removed. A copy can be found at .       It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.   Minor earthquakes occur nearly constantly around the world in places like  |California|California|  and  |Alaska|Alaska|  in the U.S., as well as in  |El_Salvador|El_Salvador| ,  |Mexico|Mexico| ,  |Guatemala|Guatemala| ,  |Chile|Chile| ,  |Peru|Peru| ,  |Indonesia|Indonesia| ,  |Philippines|Philippines| ,  |Iran|Iran| ,  |Pakistan|Pakistan| , the  |Azores|Azores|  in  |Portugal|Portugal| ,  |Turkey|Turkey| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| ,  |Greece|Greece| ,  |Italy|Italy| ,  |India|India| ,  |Nepal|Nepal|  and  |Japan|Japan| , but earthquakes can occur almost anywhere, including  |Downstate_New_York|Downstate_New_York| ,  |England|England| , and  |Australia|Australia| .    Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being  |exponential|Gutenberg–Richter_Law| ; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur in a particular time period than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.   In the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are:   an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10  years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100  years.  This is an example of the  |Gutenberg–Richter_law|Gutenberg–Richter_Law| .          The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey|  estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes and one great earthquake per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.    In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.  , USGS Science of Changing World. Retrieved 30 May 2014. More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey|  .      A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.  , Australian Geographic, March 14, 2011.     Most of the worlds earthquakes take place in the , horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the  |Pacific_Ring_of_Fire|Pacific_Ring_Of_Fire| , which for the most part bounds the  |Pacific_Plate|Pacific_Plate| .       Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the  |Himalayan_Mountains|Himalayan_Mountains| . Jackson, James, ,  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ,  Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 15 August 2006 vol. 364 no. 1845 1911–1925.     With the rapid growth of  |mega-cities|Megacity|  such as  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City| ,  |Tokyo|Tokyo|  and  |Tehran|Tehran|  in areas of high  |seismic_risk|Seismic_Risk| , some seismologists are warning that a single quake may claim the lives of up to three million people. . Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science.          While most earthquakes are caused by movement of the Earths  |tectonic_plates|Tectonic_Plate| , human activity can also produce earthquakes. Four main activities contribute to this phenomenon: storing large amounts of water behind a  |dam|Dam|  , drilling and injecting liquid into  |wells|Water_Well| ,  |coal_mining|Coal_Mining| , and  |oil_drilling|Oil_Well| .  Perhaps the best known example is the  |2008_Sichuan_earthquake|2008_Sichuan_Earthquake|  in Chinas  |Sichuan_Province|Sichuan_Province|  in May; this tremor resulted in 69,227 fatalities and is the  |19th_deadliest_earthquake_of_all_time|List_Of_Natural_Disasters_By_Death_Tollearthquakes| . The  |Zipingpu_Dam|Zipingpu_Dam|  is believed to have fluctuated the pressure of the fault  away; this pressure probably increased the power of the earthquake and accelerated the rate of movement for the fault.      The  |greatest_earthquake_in_Australias_history|1989_Newcastle_Earthquake|  is also claimed to be induced by human activity:  |Newcastle,_Australia|Newcastle,_Australia| , was built over a large sector of coal mining areas. The earthquake has been reported to be spawned from a fault that reactivated due to the millions of tonnes of rock removed in the mining process.           The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the  |Richter_magnitude_scale|Richter_Magnitude_Scale|  in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an events amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century.  |Seismic_waves|Seismic_Waves|  travel through the  |Earths_interior|Earths_Interior|  and can be recorded by  |seismometers|Seismometer|  at great distances. The  |surface_wave_magnitude|Surface_Wave_Magnitude|  was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The  |moment_magnitude_scale|Moment_Magnitude_Scale|  not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the  |seismic_moment|Seismic_Moment|  . The  |Japan_Meteorological_Agency_seismic_intensity_scale|Japan_Meteorological_Agency_Seismic_Intensity_Scale| , the  |Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik_scale|Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik_Scale| , and the  |Mercalli_intensity_scale|Mercalli_Intensity_Scale|  are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.     Every tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:   Longitudinal  |P-waves|P-Waves|    Transverse  |S-waves|S-Waves| |Surface_waves|Surface_Wave|  –     |Propagation_velocity|Propagation_Velocity|  of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx.  up to , depending on the  |density|Density|  and  |elasticity|Elasticity|  of the medium. In the Earths interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves . The differences in travel time from the  |epicenter|Epicentre|  to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the  |hypocenter|Hypocenter|  can be computed roughly.     In the upper crust, P-waves travel in the range  per second in soils and unconsolidated sediments, increasing to  per second in solid rock. In the lower crust, they travel at about  per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to about  per second. The velocity of S-waves ranges from  per second in light sediments and  per second in the Earths crust up to  per second in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earths mantle.     On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave times 8.  Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analyses of seismograms the Earths core was located in 1913 by  |Beno_Gutenberg|Beno_Gutenberg| .     S-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.      Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754  |Flinn–Engdahl_regions|Flinn–Engdahl_Regions|  , which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions.     Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its  |magnitude|Richter_Magnitude_Scale| , date and time of occurrence,  |geographic_coordinates|Geographic_Coordinates|  of its  |epicenter|Epicenter| , depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, a number of parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports , and a unique event ID.      Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurements could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the  |2011_Tohoku-Oki|2011_Tōhoku_Earthquake_And_Tsunami|  earthquake.              The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following:            Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake  |magnitude|Richter_Magnitude_Scale| , the distance from the  |epicenter|Epicenter| , and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce  |wave_propagation|Wave_Propagation| .  The ground-shaking is measured by  |ground_acceleration|Ground_Acceleration| .     Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the  |seismic|Seismic|  motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and to effects of seismic energy focalization owing to typical geometrical setting of the deposits.     Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earths surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as  |dams|Dams| , bridges, and  |nuclear_power_stations|Nuclear_Power_Stations|  and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.             Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel are attempting rescue.             Earthquakes can cause  |fires|Fire|  by damaging  |electrical_power|Electric_Power|  or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the  |1906_San_Francisco_earthquake|1906_San_Francisco_Earthquake|  were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.           Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated  |granular|Granular|  material temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a  |solid|Solid|  to a  |liquid|Liquid| . Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the  |1964_Alaska_earthquake|1964_Alaska_Earthquake| , soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.                Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake  |occurs_at_sea|Submarine_Earthquake| . In the open ocean the distance between wave crests can surpass , and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800  kilometers per hour , depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.      Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.            Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes, if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.      The terrain below the  |Sarez_Lake|Sarez_Lake|  in  |Tajikistan|Tajikistan|  is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the  |landslide_dam|Landslide_Dam|  formed by the earthquake, known as the  |Usoi_Dam|Usoi_Dam| , were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly 5  million people.             An earthquake may cause injury and loss of life, road and bridge damage, general  |property_damage|Property_Damage| , and collapse or destabilization of buildings. The aftermath may bring  |disease|Disease| , lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks, depression to survivors,  and higher insurance premiums.                  One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the  |1556_Shaanxi_earthquake|1556_Shaanxi_Earthquake| , which occurred on 23 January 1556 in  |Shaanxi|Shaanxi|  province, China. More than 830,000 people died.   . U.S. Geological Survey Most houses in the area were  |yaodongs|Yaodong| —dwellings carved out of  |loess|Loess|  hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The  |1976_Tangshan_earthquake|1976_Tangshan_Earthquake| , which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century. Spignesi, Stephen J. . Catastrophe!: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time.      The  |1960_Chilean_earthquake|1960_Valdivia_Earthquake|  is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960. Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the  |Good_Friday_earthquake|Good_Friday_Earthquake|  , which was centered in  |Prince_William_Sound|Prince_William_Sound| , Alaska.   The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been  |megathrust_earthquakes|Megathrust_Earthquake| ; however, of these ten, only the  |2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake|2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake|  is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.     Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create  |tsunamis|Tsunamis|  that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes.               |Earthquake_prediction|Earthquake_Prediction|  is a branch of the science of  |seismology|Seismology|  concerned with the specification of the time, location, and  |magnitude|Seismic_Scale|  of future earthquakes within stated limits. , following , who in turn followed  Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by  |seismologists|Seismologist| , scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month. . Ruth Ludwin, U.S. Geological Survey.              While  |forecasting|Forecasting|  is usually considered to be a type of  |prediction|Prediction| ,  |earthquake_forecasting|Earthquake_Forecasting|  is often differentiated from  |earthquake_prediction|Earthquake_Prediction| . Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades. , p. 1205. See also , p. 327. For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated. Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities in the San Francisco Bay Region, 2003 to 2032, 2003,        |Earthquake_warning_systems|Earthquake_Warning_System|  have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the systems range to seek shelter before the earthquakes impact is felt.            The objective of  |earthquake_engineering|Earthquake_Engineering|  is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings and other structures and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by  |seismic_retrofitting|Seismic_Retrofitting|  to improve their resistance to earthquakes.  |Earthquake_insurance|Earthquake_Insurance|  can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes  |Emergency_management|Emergency_Management|  strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences.     Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing  |water_heaters|Water_Heater|  and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a  |tsunami|Tsunami|  caused by a large quake.            From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher  |Anaxagoras|Anaxagoras|  in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to air in the cavities of the Earth.   |Thales|Thales|  of Miletus was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water. Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus blamed water in general for earthquakes.  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder|  called earthquakes underground thunderstorms .         In recent studies, geologists claim that  |global_warming|Global_Warming|  is one of the reasons for increased seismic activity. According to these studies, melting glaciers and rising sea levels disturb the balance of pressure on Earths tectonic plates, thus causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes.            In  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| , earthquakes were explained as the violent struggling of the god  |Loki|Loki| . When Loki,  |god|Aesir|  of mischief and strife, murdered  |Baldr|Baldr| , god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Lokis wife  |Sigyn|Sigyn|  stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl the poison dripped on Lokis face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.      In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| ,  |Poseidon|Poseidon|  was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a  |trident|Trident| , causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.      In  |Japanese_mythology|Japanese_Mythology| ,  |Namazu|Namazu|  is a giant  |catfish|Catfish|  who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth, and is guarded by the god  |Kashima|Kashima|  who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.        In modern  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture| , the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as  |Kobe_in_1995|Great_Hanshin_Earthquake|  or  |San_Francisco_in_1906|1906_San_Francisco_Earthquake| .  Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning. For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight ,  The Ragged Edge  or  Aftershock: Earthquake in New York  . A notable example is Heinrich von Kleists classic novella,  The Earthquake in Chile , which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647.  |Haruki_Murakamis|Haruki_Murakami|  short fiction collection  After the Quake  depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995.     The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical Big One expected of  |Californias|California| |San_Andreas_Fault|San_Andreas_Fault|  someday, as depicted in the novels  Richter 10  ,  Goodbye California  ,  2012  and  San Andreas  among other works. Jacob M. Appels widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent. JM Appel. A Comparative Seismology. Weber Studies , Volume 18, Number 2.     Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.  Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.   Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.  As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the  |2010_Haiti_earthquake|2010_Haiti_Earthquake| , it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.
