           The Snowy Mountains, known informally as The Snowies , is an  |IBRA|Interim_Biogeographic_Regionalisation_For_Australia| |_subregion|Bioregion|  and the highest mountain range on the continent of mainland  |Australia|Australia| . It contains the Australian mainlands highest mountain,  |Mount_Kosciuszko|Mount_Kosciuszko| , which reaches to a height of  above sea level. The range also contains the five highest peaks on the Australian mainland , all of which are above . They are located in southern  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales|  and are part of the larger  |Australian_Alps|Australian_Alps|  and  |Great_Dividing_Range|Great_Dividing_Range| . Unusual for Australia, the mountain range experiences large natural snowfalls every winter. Snow normally falls during June, July, August and early September, with the snow cover melting by late spring. The Tasmanian highlands makes up the other alpine region present in Australia.     The range is host to the  |mountain_plum_pine|Mountain_Plum_Pine| , a low-lying type of conifer. It is considered to be one of the centres of the Australian ski industry during the winter months, with all four  |snow_resorts|Ski_Resort|  in New South Wales being located in the region.      The  |Alpine_Way|Alpine_Way|  and  |Snowy_Mountains_Highway|Snowy_Mountains_Highway|  are the major roads through the Snowy Mountains region.            The mountain range is thought to have had Aboriginal occupation for 20,000 years. Large scale intertribal gatherings were held in the High Country during summer for collective feasting on the  |Bogong_moth|Bogong_Moth| . This practice continued until around 1865.      The area was first explored by Europeans in 1835, and in 1840,  |Edmund_Strzelecki|Paweł_Edmund_Strzelecki|  ascended Mount Kosciuszko and named it after the Polish patriot. High country stockmen followed who used the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months.  |Banjo_Patersons|Banjo_Paterson|  famous poem  |The_Man_From_Snowy_River|The_Man_From_Snowy_River|  recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area. Today these huts are maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or volunteer organisations like the  |Kosciuszko_Huts_Association|Kosciuszko_Huts_Association| .     In the 19th century  |gold|Gold|  was mined on the high plains near  |Kiandra|Kiandra_New_South_Wales| . At its height this community had a population of about 4,000 people, and ran 14 hotels. Since the last resident left in 1974, Kiandra has become a ghost town of ruins and abandoned diggings.      The  |Kosciuszko_National_Park|Kosciuszko_National_Park|  came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906. In 1944 this became the Kosciuszko State Park, and then the Kosciuszko National Park in 1967.      Recreational skiing began at Kiandra in the 1860s and experienced a boom in the 20th century following the commencement of the construction of the  |Snowy_Mountains_Hydro_Electric_Scheme|Snowy_Mountains_Hydro_Electric_Scheme|  between 1949 and 1976 which brought many European workers to the district and opened up access to the ranges.                 The discovery of gold at  |Kiandra|Kiandra|  , in 1859, briefly enticed a population of thousands above the snowline and saw the introduction of recreational skiing to the Snowy Mountains around 1861.  The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the township remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing for over a century. Australias first  |T_Bar|T_Bar|  was installed at Kiandra in 1957, but the ski facilities were finally shifted up the hill to  |Selwyn_Snowfields|Selwyn_Snowfields|  in 1978.  Steeper slopes and more reliable snows lie further to the south and in the 20th Century, the focus of recreational skiing in New South Wales shifted southward, to the  |Mount_Kosciuszko|Mount_Kosciuszko|  region. The history of skiing at Kiandra has been the subject of several studies, including 1959s Historic Kiandra , written by the Kiandra Historical Society and Kiandra Goldfields to Skifields by Norman W. Clarke     The Kosciuszko Chalet was built at  |Charlotte_Pass|Charlotte_Pass|  in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australias highest terrain.   In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the Worlds Longest  |Chairlift|Chairlift|  , designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility.   At , Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter.  The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at  |Smiggin_Holes|Smiggin_Holes|  around 1939, where horse-drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to begin the arduous ski to the Kosciusko Chalet.  It was the construction of the vast  |Snowy_Mountains_Hydro_Electric_Scheme|Snowy_Mountains_Hydro_Electric_Scheme|  from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of  |Thredbo|Thredbo|  and Perisher as leading Australian resorts.  The Construction of  |Guthega|Guthega|  Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957.       Skifields up by Kosciuskos side were also established during this period, though their existence is now little realised.  |The_Australian_Alpine_Club|Australian_Alpine_Club|  was founded in 1950 by  |Charles_Anton|Charles_Anton| . Huts were constructed in the Backcountry close to Mount Kosciusko, including  |Kunama_Hut|Kunama_Hut| , which opened for the 1953 season. A rope tow was installed on  |Mount_Northcote|Mount_Northcote|  at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an  |avalanche|Avalanche| , which also killed one person, in 1956.      Anton also recognised the potential of the  |Thredbo_Valley|Thredbo_Valley|  for construction of a major resort and village, with good vertical terrain. Construction began in 1957. Today, Thredbo has 14 ski-lifts and possesses Australias longest ski resort run, the 5.9  km from Karels T-Bar to  |Friday_Flat|Friday_Flat| ; Australias greatest vertical drop of 672  m; and the highest lifted point in Australia at 2037  m.       The last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of  |Mount_Blue_Cow|Blue_Cow_New_South_Wales|  in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss designed  |Skitube_Alpine_Railway|Skitube_Alpine_Railway|  opened to deliver skiers from  |Bullocks_Flat|Bullocks_Flat| , on the  |Alpine_Way|Alpine_Way| , to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987. The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the  |Southern_Hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere| .  In 2009 Perisher had 48 lifts covering 1,245 hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley, Blue Cow, Smiggin Holes and Guthega.               The Snowy Mountains also feed the  |Murrumbidgee|Murrumbidgee_River|  and  |Murray|Murray_River|  rivers from the  |Tooma_River|Tooma_River| ,  |Whites_River|Whites_River|  and  |Yarrangobilly_River|Yarrangobilly_River| . The range is perhaps best known for the  |Snowy_Mountains_Scheme|Snowy_Mountains_Scheme| , a project to dam the Snowy River, providing both water for irrigation and  |hydroelectricity|Hydroelectricity| .     The project began in 1949 employing 100,000 men, two-thirds of whom came from thirty other countries during the post-World War II years. Socially this project symbolises a period during which Australia became an ethnic melting pot of the twentieth century but which also changed Australias character and increased its appreciation for a wide range of cultural diversity.      The Scheme built several temporary towns for its construction workers, several of which have become permanent:  |Cabramurra|Cabramurra_New_South_Wales|  ; and  |Khancoban|Khancoban_New_South_Wales| . Additionally, the economy of  |Cooma|Cooma_New_South_Wales|  has been sustained by the Scheme. Townships at  |Adaminaby|Adaminaby| ,  |Jindabyne|Jindabyne|  and  |Talbingo|Talbingo|  were inundated by the construction of Lakes  |Eucumbene|Lake_Eucumbene| ,  |Jindabyne|Lake_Jindabyne|  and  |Talbingo|Talbingo_Dam| .   Improved vehicular access to the High Country enabled ski-resort villages to be constructed at  |Thredbo|Thredbo|  and  |Guthega|Guthega|  in the 1950s by ex-Snowy Scheme workers who realised the potential for expansion of the Australian ski industry.     By 1974,  of tunnels and  of aqueducts connected the sixteen dams, seven power stations , and one pumping station.  . Retrieved on 28 February 2008. The  |American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers|American_Society_Of_Civil_Engineers|  has rated the Snowy Scheme as a world-class civil engineering project .     The principal lakes created by the scheme include:  |Lake_Eucumbene|Lake_Eucumbene| ,  |Blowering_Dam|Blowering_Dam| ,  |Talbingo_Dam|Talbingo_Dam| ,  |Lake_Jindabyne|Lake_Jindabyne|  and  |Tantangara_Dam|Tantangara_Dam| .              The higher regions of the park experience an alpine climate which is unusual on mainland Australia. However, only the peaks of the main range are subject to consistent heavy winter snow. The climate station at  |Charlotte_Pass|Charlotte_Pass_New_South_Wales|  recorded Australias lowest temperature of -23.0  °C on 28 June 1994.             Part of the mountains known as  |Main_Range|Main_Range|  contains mainland Australias five  |glacial_lakes|Glacial_Lake| .  The largest of these lakes is  |Blue_Lake|Blue_Lake| , one of the headwaters of the  |Snowy_River|Snowy_River| . The other four glacial lakes are  |Lake_Albina|Lake_Albina| ,  |Lake_Cootapatamba|Lake_Cootapatamba| ,  |Club_Lake|Club_Lake|  and Headley Tarn.     During the  |last_ice_age|Quaternary_Glaciation| , which peaked about 20,000 years ago in the  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene| |_epoch|Epoch| , the highest peaks of the main range near Mount Kosciuszko experienced a climate which favoured the formation of  |glaciers|Glacier| , evidence of which can still be seen today.  |Cirques|Cirque| |moraines|Moraine| ,  |tarn_lakes|Tarn| ,  |roche_moutonnées|Roche_Moutonnée|  and other glacial features can all be seen in the area.  |Lake_Cootapatamba|Lake_Cootapatamba| , which was formed by an ice spilling from Mount Kosciuszkos southern flank, is the highest lake on the Australian mainland. Lake Albina, Club Lake,  |Blue_Lake|Blue_Lake| , and Hedley Tarn also have glacial origins. West,D., Kosciuszko Natural Heritage.     There is some disagreement as to exactly how widespread Pleistocene glaciation was on the main range, and little or no evidence from earlier glacial periods exists. The David Moraine, a one kilometre long ridge running across Spencers Creek valley seems to indicate a larger glacier existed in this area at some time, however the glacial origin of this feature is disputed. Galloway, RW , Glaciation in the Snowy Mountains: A Re-appraisal     There is evidence of  |periglacial|Periglacial|  activity in the area.  |Solifluction|Solifluction|  appears to have created terraces on the north west flank of Mount Northcote.  |Frost_heave|Frost_Heave|  is also a significant agent of  |soil_erosion|Soil_Erosion|  in the Kosciuszko Area.            The Snowy Mountains cover a variety of climatic regions which support several distinct  |ecosystems|Ecosystem| . The alpine area above the  |tree_line|Tree_Line|  is one of the most fragile and covers the smallest area. This area is a patchwork of alpine  |heaths|Heath| ,  |herbfields|Herbfield| ,  |feldmarks|Feldmark| ,  |bogs|Bog|  and  |fens|Fen| . The windswept  |feldmark|Feldmark| |_ecotope|Ecotope|  is endemic to the alpine region, and covers a mere . It is most vulnerable to the wandering footsteps of unmindful tourists.         Many rare or threatened plant and animal species occur within the Snowy Mountains.  The  |Kosciuszko_National_Park|Kosciuszko_National_Park|  is home to one of Australias most threatened species . The endangered  |mountain_pygmy_possum|Mountain_Pygmy_Possum|  and the more common  |dusky_antechinus|Dusky_Antechinus|  are located in the high country of the park.     By 2008,  |wild_horse|Brumby|  numbers in the National Park had reached 1,700 with that figure growing by 300 each year, resulting in park authorities coordinating their  |cull|Cull| ing and relocation.        The high country is dominated by alpine woodlands, characterised by the  |snow_gum|Eucalyptus_Pauciflora| .  |Montane|Montane_Forest|  and wet  |sclerophyll|Sclerophyll|  forests also occur across the ranges, supporting large stands of  |alpine_ash|Eucalyptus_Delegatensis|  and  |mountain_gum|Eucalyptus_Regnans| . In the southern  |Byadbo|Byadbo_New_South_Wales|  wilderness area, dry sclerophyll and  |wattle|Acacia|  forests predominate. Amongst the many different native trees in the park, the large  |Chinese_elm|Ulmus_Parvifolia|  has become naturalised.       In summer 2003, the Australian Alps experienced their largest bushfires for over 60 years with an estimated 1.73 million hectares burning. The bushfires burnt across Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory during a drought that ranks as one of the worst in 103 years of official Australian weather records  . Fires are a natural feature of the parks ecosystem, but it will take some time for the region to return to its pre-2003 condition.      In November 2004, a committee The Snowy Mountains Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was set up by the NSW State Premiers Department to help residents in the region recover from the fires. The Taskforce commissioned Louise Darmody from Sound Memories to produce a documentary involving 26 people from the Snowy Mountains to talk about their experiences  .
