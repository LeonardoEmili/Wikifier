Condensed matter physics is the field of  |physics|Physics|  that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of  |matter|Matter| . In particular it is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are  |solids|Solid|  and  |liquids|Liquid| , which arise from the  |electromagnetic|Electromagnetic|  forces between  |atoms|Atom| . Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using  |physical_laws|Physical_Law| . In particular, they include the laws of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| ,  |electromagnetism|Electromagnetism|  and  |statistical_mechanics|Statistical_Mechanics| .     More exotic condensed phases include the  |superconducting|Superconductivity|  phase exhibited by certain materials at low  |temperature|Temperature| , the  |ferromagnet|Ferromagnet| ic and  |antiferromagnet|Antiferromagnet| ic phases of  |spins|Spin|  on  |crystal_lattices|Crystal_Lattice|  of atoms, and the  |Bose–Einstein_condensate|Bose–Einstein_Condensate|  found in  |ultracold_atom|Ultracold_Atom| ic systems. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of  |theoretical_physics|Theoretical_Physics|  to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.     The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all  |American|People_Of_The_United_States|  physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists,  and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the  |American_Physical_Society|American_Physical_Society| .  The field overlaps with  |chemistry|Chemistry| ,  |materials_science|Materials_Science| , and  |nanotechnology|Nanotechnology| , and relates closely to  |atomic_physics|Atomic_Physics|  and  |biophysics|Biophysics| . The  |theoretical_physics|Theoretical_Physics|  of condensed matter shares important concepts and methods with that of  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  and  |nuclear_physics|Nuclear_Physics| .      A variety of topics in physics such as  |crystallography|Crystallography| ,  |metallurgy|Metallurgy| ,  |elasticity|Elasticity| ,  |magnetism|Magnetism| , etc., were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s, when they were grouped together as  solid state physics . Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of  |liquids|Liquid|  was added to this list, forming the basis for the new, related specialty of condensed matter physics. According to physicist  |Philip_Warren_Anderson|Philip_Warren_Anderson| , the term was coined by him and  |Volker_Heine|Volker_Heine| , when they changed the name of their group at the  |Cavendish_Laboratories|Cavendish_Laboratories| ,  |Cambridge|Cambridge|  from Solid state theory to Theory of Condensed Matter in 1967,  as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids,  |nuclear_matter|Nuclear_Matter| , and so on.  Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name condensed matter , it had been present in Europe for some years, most prominently in the form of a journal published in English, French, and German by  |Springer-Verlag|Springer_Science+Business_Media|  titled Physics of Condensed Matter, which was launched in 1963.  The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name condensed matter physics , which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter, over solid state physics , which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors.  The  |Bell_Telephone_Laboratories|Bell_Labs|  was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics.
