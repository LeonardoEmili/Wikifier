                    A map is a  |symbol|Symbol| ic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as  |objects|Physical_Body| ,  |regions|Region| , or themes.     Many maps are static, fixed to  |paper|Paper|  or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any  |space|Space| , real or fictional, without regard to  |context|Context|  or  |scale|Scale| , such as in  |brain_mapping|Brain_Mapping| ,  |DNA|Dna|  mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.     Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word map comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, map became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.                         |Cartography|Cartography|  or map-making is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface , and one who makes maps is called a  |cartographer|Cartography| .      |Road_maps|Road_Atlas|  are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and  |nautical_charts|Nautical_Chart| , railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by  |municipalities|Municipality| , utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies. Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the  |British|United_Kingdom| |_Ordnance_Survey|Ordnance_Survey| |contour_lines|Contour_Line|  indicating constant values of  |elevation|Elevation| ,  |temperature|Temperature| ,  |rain|Rain| fall, etc.          The orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding  |compass_directions|Compass_Direction|  in reality. The word  |orient|Orient|  is derived from  |Latin|Latin|  , meaning east. In the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  many maps, including the  |T_and_O_maps|T_And_O_Map| , were drawn with east at the top . The most common cartographic convention is that north is at the top of a map.     Maps not oriented with north at the top:   Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of  |Edo|Edo|  show the  |Japanese_imperial_palace|Tokyo_Imperial_Palace|  as the top , but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.  |Medieval|Middle_Ages|  European  |T_and_O_maps|T_And_O_Map|  such as the  |Hereford_Mappa_Mundi|Hereford_Mappa_Mundi|  were centred on  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of  |Ptolemys|Ptolemy|   Geography  to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West.  |Portolan_charts|Portolan_Chart| , for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.   Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.   Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.    |Polar_maps|Azimuthal_Equidistant_Projection|  of the  |Arctic|Arctic|  or  |Antarctic|Antarctica|  regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.    |Reversed_maps|Reversed_Map| , also known as Upside-Down maps or South-Up maps, reverse the North is up convention and have south at the top. Ancient Africans including in  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt|  utilised this orientation, as some maps in Brazil do today.     |Buckminster_Fullers|Buckminster_Fuller| |Dymaxion_maps|Dymaxion_Map|  are based on a projection of the Earths  |sphere|Sphere|  onto an  |icosahedron|Icosahedron| . The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.          Many maps are drawn to a  |scale|Scale|  expressed as a  |ratio|Ratio| , such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of  |measurement|Measurement|  on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the  |curvature|Curvature|  of the Earth to be neglected, such as a  |city_map|City_Map| . Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires  |projections|Map_Projection|  to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the  |sphere|Sphere|  to the  |plane|Plane|  without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as  |point_scale|Scale|  per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.        Some maps, called  |cartograms|Cartogram| , have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map of  |Europe|Europe|  has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.     Another example of distorted scale is the famous  |London_Underground_map|Tube_Map| . The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines  are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.     Further inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.          Geographic maps use a  |projection|Map_Projection|  to translating the three-dimensional real surface of the  |geoid|Geoid|  to a two-dimensional picture. Projection always distorts the surface. There are many ways to apportion the distortion, and so there are many map projections. Which projection to use depends on the purpose of the map.       The various features shown on a map are represented by conventional  |signs|Sign|  or symbols. For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads. Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet. Ordnance Survey,  ; Swisstopo,  ; United States Geological Survey,  .     Some cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room outside the map for information about the map as a whole.   These cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise blank region inside the map |cartouche|Cartouche| ,  |map_legend|Legend| , title,  |compass_rose|Compass_Rose| ,  |bar_scale|Bar_Scale| , etc.   In particular, some maps contain smaller sub-maps in otherwise blank regions—often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing regions of interest at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldnt otherwise fit.   Occasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map—a few maps of the  |contiguous_United_States|Contiguous_United_States|  include a sub-map to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.       To communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be  |labeled|Labeling| . Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed  |automatic_label_placement|Automatic_Label_Placement|  to ease this process. Imhof, E., “Die Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,” Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-Füssli Verlag, Zürich, 93–129, 1962.

Maps of the world or large areas are often either political or physical. The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial  |borders|Border| ; the purpose of the physical is to show features of  |geography|Geography|  such as mountains, soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads, railroads and buildings.  |Topographic_maps|Topographic_Map|  show  |elevations|Elevation|  and  |relief|Terrain|  with  |contour_lines|Contour_Line|  or shading.  |Geological_maps|Geological_Map|  show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock,  |fault|Fault|  lines, and subsurface structures.          From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the  |cartographer|Cartographer|  has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering  |survey|Surveying|  level, has been subsumed by  |Geographic_Information_Systems|Geographic_Information_System|  . The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such  |superimposition|Superimposition|  of data led  |Dr_John_Snow|John_Snow|  to identify the location of an outbreak of  |cholera|Cholera| . Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.          Even when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.     Interactive, computerised maps are commercially available, allowing users to zoom in or zoom out , sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point. In-car  |global_navigation_satellite_systems|Global_Navigation_Satellite_System|  are computerised maps with route-planning and advice facilities which monitor the users position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientists point of view, zooming in entails one or a combination of:     replacing the map by a more detailed one   enlarging the same map without enlarging the  |pixels|Pixel| , hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version   enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged ; no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the quality of ones vision, possibly more detail can be seen; if a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separate, but overlapping instead , then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail. A variation of this method is  |interpolation|Interpolation| .          For example:   Typically applies to a  |Portable_Document_Format|Portable_Document_Format|  file or other format based on  |vector_graphics|Vector_Graphics| . The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles or  |splines|Spline| .   may apply to text and to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.   may apply to the text as needed , while applies to the rest of the image. Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.   The map may also have layers which are partly  |raster_graphics|Raster_Graphics|  and partly  |vector_graphics|Vector_Graphics| . For a single raster graphics image applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter applies.     See also: Webpage , PDF , MapQuest , Google Maps , Google Earth , OpenStreetMap or Yahoo! Maps .       The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features and for combinations of them at the earths surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps show climatic features across a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. When generating the map,  |interpolation|Interpolation|  can be used to synthesize values where there are no measurements, under the assumption that conditions change smoothly.     Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes of the main isobaric surfaces counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.     Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes . Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies . Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon . Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year . Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps ; the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.     Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earths surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.     Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.       Maps exist of the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| , and other cosmological features such as  |star_maps|Star_Map| . In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not  geo graphical maps.          Diagrams such as  |schematic_diagrams|Schematic_Diagram|  and  |Gantt_charts|Gantt_Chart|  and  |treemaps|Treemap|  display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships.  |Topological|Topological|  in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The  |London_Underground_map|London_Underground_Map|  and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.       General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area. The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.        |Atlas|Atlas| |_Cadastral_map|Cadastrecadastral_Map| |_Climatic_map|Climatic_Maps| |_Geologic_map|Geologic_Map| |_Nautical_map|Nautical_Map| |_Physical_map|Map_Types_And_Projections| |_Political_map|Political_Map| |_Relief_map|Terrain_Cartography| |_Resource_map|Resource_Map| |_Star_map|Star_Map| |_Street_map|Street_Map| |_Thematic_map|Thematic_Map| |_Topographic_map|Topographic_Map| |_Weather_map|Weather_Map| |_World_map|World_Map|        Some countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding  |border_disputes|Border_Dispute| . For example:   Within Russia, Google Maps shows  |Crimea|Crimea|  as part of Russia.    Both the Republic of India and the Peoples Republic of China require that all maps show areas subject to the  |Sino_Indian_border_dispute|Sino_Indian_Border_Dispute|  in their own favor.      In 2010, the Peoples Republic of China began requiring that all online maps served from within China be hosted there, making them subject to Chinese laws.
