He soon put his organisational skills to use as business manager for the  Gau  . He moved to Munich in October 1928, where he worked in the SA insurance office. Initially the NSDAP provided coverage through insurance companies for members who were hurt or killed in the frequent violent skirmishes with members of other political parties. As insurance companies were unwilling to pay out claims for such activities, in 1930 Bormann set up the Hilfskasse der NSDAP , a benefits and relief fund directly administered by the party. Each party member was required to pay premiums and might receive compensation for injuries sustained while conducting party business. Payments out of the fund were made solely at Bormanns discretion. He began to gain a reputation as a financial expert, and many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from the fund.

In this capacity, he began to control the flow of information and access to Hitler. During this period, Hitler gave Bormann control of his personal finances.

However, they ran up against resistance from Hitlers cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee.

Bormann, who was strongly anti-Christian, agreed; he stated publicly in 1941 that National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable.  Out of political expediency, Hitler intended to postpone the elimination of the Christian churches until after the war. However, his repeated hostile statements against the church indicated to his subordinates that a continuation of the  Kirchenkampf  would be tolerated and even encouraged.     Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches. In February 1937, he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormanns push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able to reduce the amount of religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms.

Krumnows colleague Wagenpfohl found an SS doctors paybook on the second body identifying him as Ludwig Stumpfegger.
