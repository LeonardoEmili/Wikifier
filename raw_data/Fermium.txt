            Fermium is a  |synthetic_element|Synthetic_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Fm and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  100. It is an  |actinide|Actinide|  and the heaviest element that can be formed by  |neutron|Neutron|  bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257 Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.     It was discovered in the debris of the  |first|Ivy_Mike| |_hydrogen_bomb|Hydrogen_Bomb|  explosion in 1952, and named after  |Enrico_Fermi|Enrico_Fermi| , one of the pioneers of  |nuclear_physics|Nuclear_Physics| . Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.                Fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the  |Ivy_Mike|Ivy_Mike|  nuclear test , the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.   . Retrieved 2 December 2007 Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of  |plutonium|Plutonium| ,  |neutrons|Neutron|  by a  |uranium_238|Uranium_238|  nucleus followed by two  |β_−_decays|Beta_Decay| . At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of  raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.      Element  99  was quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through the cloud from the explosion . It was then identified in December 1952 by  |Albert_Ghiorso|Albert_Ghiorso|  and co-workers at the  |University_of_California_at_Berkeley|University_Of_California_At_Berkeley| . They discovered the isotope 253 Es  that was made by the  |capture|Neutron_Capture|  of 15  |neutrons|Neutron|  by  |uranium_238|Uranium_238|  nuclei – which then underwent seven successive  |beta_decays|Beta_Decay| :      /blockquote sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  ref name Ghiorso /  ref name Ghiorso / ref name PhysRev.99.1048  /ref ref  /ref  ref name PhysRev.93.908  /ref ref  /ref ref name PhysRev.99.1048 / ref name Ghiorso /  sup /sup  ref  /ref  small /small  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup ref name NUBASE2003 / sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  ref name NUBASE2003 /  sup /sup  sup /sup  ref name Silva  /ref ref name G & E  /ref ref namenuclidetable  /ref sup /sup ref nameZagrebaev  /ref  ref groupNote /ref ref  /ref , Tweed  .
