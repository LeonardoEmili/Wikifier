Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system – Morenas Coloradas valley     Though precipitation increases with the height, there are semiarid conditions in the nearly  highest mountains of the Andes. This dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 32–34° S. The valley bottoms have no woods, just dwarf scrub. The largest glaciers, as e.g. the Plomo glacier and the Horcones glaciers, do not even reach  in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness. At glacial times, however, c. 20,000 years ago, the glaciers were over ten times longer. On the east side of this section of the Mendozina Andes, they flowed down to  and on the west side to about  above sea level.
