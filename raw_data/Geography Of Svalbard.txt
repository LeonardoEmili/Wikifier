    Svalbard  is an  |archipelago|Archipelago|  in the  |Arctic_Ocean|Arctic_Ocean|  roughly centered on    |78°_north_latitude|78Th_Parallel_North|  and  |20°_east_longitude|20Th_Meridian_East| . The archipelago is the northernmost part of the  |Kingdom_of_Norway|Norway| . The three main islands in the group consist of  |Spitsbergen|Spitsbergen|  ,  |Nordaustlandet|Nordaustlandet|  and  |Edgeøya|Edgeøya| . There are also a number of smaller islands, such as  |Barents_Island|Barents_Island|  ,  |Kvitøya|Kvitøya|  ,  |Prins_Karls_Forland|Prince_Charles_Foreland|  ,  |Kongsøya|Kongsøya|  , Bear Island ,  |Svenskøya|Svenskøya|  ,  |Wilhelm_Island|Wilhelm_Island|   and other smaller islands or  |skerries|Skerry|  .          There is no arable land in the island group due to heavy glaciation and the northern latitude. There are no trees native to the archipeligo, but there are shrubs such as  |crowberry|Crowberry|  and  |cloudberry|Cloudberry| . The west coast of Spitsbergen remains navigable most of the year, due to favorable winds which keep the area ice-free. Norway claims a  fishery protection zone, but this is not recognized by neighboring  |Russia|Russia| .     The climate of the Svalbard archipeligo is arctic, tempered by warm  |North_Atlantic_Current|North_Atlantic_Current|  along the west and northern coasts. This means cool summers and cold winters along the wild, rugged  |mountain|Mountain| ous islands. The high land of the island interiors is generally ice covered year round, with the west coast clear of ice about one half of the year. There are many  |fjords|Fjord|  along west and north coasts       Svalbard has many mineral resources, and  |coal|Coal|  was mined extensively on the west side of Spitsbergen.   |Ice_floes|Proglacial_Lake|  often block up the entrance to  |Bellsund|Bellsund|  on the west coast and occasionally make parts of the northeastern coast inaccessible to maritime traffic       Although many prior adverse practises are now banned, the issues surrounding past exploitation of animal resources in the Svalbard area remain a problem. With whale, seal and walrus populations are still far below than they were even two centuries ago . The population of  |polar_bears|Polar_Bear|  are locally recovering from the major culls of the 1960s and 1970s that came about due to the availability of snow scooters; however, the polar bear remains threatened at a global level, due to unsustainable levels of killing by humans and marine  |water_pollution|Water_Pollution| .
