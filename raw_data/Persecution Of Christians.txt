              The persecution of Christians can be  |historically|History_Of_Christianity|  traced from the  |first_century|Christianity_In_The_1St_Century|  of the  |Christian_era|Christian_Era|  to the  |present_day|Christianity_In_The_21St_Century| .  |Early_Christians|Early_Christianity|  were  |persecuted|Persecution|  for their  |faith|Faith_In_Christianity|  at the hands of both the  |Jews|Persecution_Of_Christians_By_The_Jews|  from  |whose_religion_Christianity_arose|Split_Of_Early_Christianity_And_Judaism|  and the  |Romans|Persecution_Of_Christians_In_The_Roman_Empire|  who controlled many of the  |lands_across_which_early_Christianity_was_spread|Early_Centers_Of_Christianity| .  |Early_in_the_fourth_century|Christianity_In_The_4Th_Century| , a form of the religion was legalized by the  |Edict_of_Milan|Edict_Of_Milan| , and it eventually became the  |State_church_of_the_Roman_Empire|State_Church_Of_The_Roman_Empire| .      |Christian_missionaries|Christian_Missionaries|  as well as  |converts_to_Christianity|Converts_To_Christianity|  have been the target of persecution ever since the emergence of  |Christianity|Christianity| , sometimes to the point of being  |martyred_for_their_faith|Martyrdom| .     The  |schisms|Schism|  of the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  and especially the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , sometimes provoked severe conflicts between  |Christian_denominations|Christian_Denominations|  to the point of persecuting each other.     In the 20th century, Christians were persecuted by various governments including the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  in the form of the  |Armenian_Genocide|Armenian_Genocide| , the  |Assyrian_Genocide|Assyrian_Genocide|  and the  |Greek_Genocide|Greek_Genocide| , as well as by  |atheistic_states|State_Atheism|  such as the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| ,  |Communist_Albania|Communist_Albania|  and  |North_Korea|North_Korea| .                  |Early_Christianity|Early_Christianity|  began as a sect among  |Second_Temple_Jews|Second_Temple_Judaism| , and according to the New Testament account,  |Pharisees|Pharisees| , including  |Paul_of_Tarsus|Paul_Of_Tarsus|  prior to his conversion to Christianity, persecuted early Christians. The early Christians preached the second coming of a Messiah which  |did_not_conform|Jewish_View_Of_Jesus|  to their  |religious_teachings|Jewish_Messianism| . However, feeling that their beliefs were supported by Jewish scripture, Christians had been hopeful that their countrymen would accept their faith. Despite individual conversions, the vast majority of Judean Jews did not become Christians.     Claudia Setzer asserts that, Jews did not see Christians as clearly separate from their own community until at least the middle of the second century. Thus, acts of Jewish persecution of Christians fall within the boundaries of synagogue discipline and were so perceived by Jews acting and thinking as the established community. The Christians, on the other hand, saw themselves as persecuted rather than disciplined.         Inter-communal dissension began almost immediately with the teachings of  |Stephen|Saint_Stephen|  at Jerusalem, who was considered an apostate. According to the  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles| , a year after the  |Crucifixion_of_Jesus|Crucifixion_Of_Jesus| , Stephen was stoned for his alleged transgression of the faith, Burke, John J., , p.101, Read Country Books 2008 with  |Saul|Paul_Of_Tarsus|   looking on.     In 41  AD, when  |Agrippa_I|Agrippa_I| , who already possessed the territory of Antipas and Phillip, obtained the title of King of the Jews, in a sense re-forming the  |Kingdom_of_Herod|Herodian_Kingdom| , he was reportedly eager to endear himself to his Jewish subjects and continued the persecution in which  |James_the_Greater|James_The_Greater|  lost his life, Peter narrowly escaped and the rest of the apostles took flight.     After Agrippas death, the Roman procuratorship began  and those leaders maintained a neutral peace, until the procurator Festus died and the high priest Annas II took advantage of the power vacuum to attack the Church and executed  |James_the_Just|James_The_Just| , then leader of  |Jerusalems_Christians|First_Christian_Church| . The New Testament states that  |Paul|Paul_Of_Tarsus|  was himself imprisoned on several occasions by the Roman authorities, stoned by the Pharisees and left for dead on one occasion, and was eventually taken to Rome as a prisoner.  |Peter|St_Peter|  and other early Christians were also imprisoned, beaten and harassed. The  |great_Jewish_revolt|First_Jewish_Rebellion| , spurred by the Roman killing of 3,000 Jews, led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70  AD, the end of Second Temple Judaism , and the disempowering of the Jewish persecutors. According to an old church tradition, which is mostly doubted by historians, the early Christian community had fled Jerusalem beforehand, to the already pacified region of  |Pella|Pella_Jordan| .      |Luke_T_Johnson|Luke_Timothy_Johnson|  nuances the harsh portrayal of the Jews in the Gospels by contextualizing the polemics within the rhetoric of contemporaneous philosophical debate, showing how rival schools of thought routinely insulted and slandered their opponents. These attacks were formulaic and stereotyped, crafted to define who was the enemy in the debates, but not used with the expectation that their insults and accusations would be taken literally, as they would be centuries later, resulting in millennia of  |Christian_antisemitism|Antisemitism_In_Christianity| . Johnson, Luke T. The New Testaments Anti-Jewish Slander and the Conventions of Ancient Polemic. Journal of Biblical Literature 108.3 : 419–441     By the 4th century,  |John_Chrysostom|John_Chrysostom|  argued that the Pharisees alone, not the Romans, were  |responsible_for_the_murder_of_Jesus|Jewish_Deicide| . However, according to  |Walter_Laqueur|Walter_Laqueur| , Absolving  |Pilate|Pilate|  from guilt may have been connected with the missionary activities of early Christianity in Rome and the desire not to antagonize those they want to convert. Laqueur, Walter : The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day, Oxford University Press. . p.46-48                      The first documented case of imperially supervised persecution of Christians in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  begins with  |Nero|Nero|  . In 64  AD, a  |great_fire_broke_out_in_Rome|Great_Fire_Of_Rome| , destroying portions of the city and economically devastating the Roman population. Some people suspected that Nero himself was the arsonist, as  |Suetonius|Suetonius|  reported, Suetonius . Lives of the Caesars. 1. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Loeb Classical Library claiming that he played the lyre and sang the Sack of  |Ilium|Troy|  during the fires. In the Annals of  |Tacitus|Tacitus| , we read: This passage in Tacitus constitutes the only independent attestation that Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome, and while it is generally believed to be authentic and reliable, some modern scholars have cast doubt on this view, largely because there is no further reference to Neros blaming of Christians for the fire until the late 4th century.   Suetonius, later to the period, does not mention any persecution after the fire, but in a previous paragraph unrelated to the fire, mentions punishments inflicted on Christians, defined as men following a new and malefic superstition. Suetonius, however, does not specify the reasons for the punishment; he simply lists the fact together with other abuses put down by Nero.        In the first two centuries Christianity was a relatively small sect which was not a significant concern of the Emperor. The Church was not in a struggle for its existence during its first centuries,  before its adoption by the Roman Empire as its national religion. Persecutions of Christians were sporadic and locally inspired.     One traditional account of killing is the  |Persecution_in_Lyon|Persecution_In_Lyon|  in which Christians were purportedly mass-slaughtered by being thrown to wild beasts under the decree of Roman officials for reportedly refusing to renounce their faith according to  |St_Irenaeus|Irenaeus| .  Christopher Reyes . In His Name. California: AuthorHouse. p.33 The sole source for this event is early Christian historian  |Eusebius_of_Caesareas|Eusebius|  Church History, an account written in Egypt in the 4th century.  |Tertullians|Tertullian|   Apologeticus  of 197 was ostensibly written in defense of persecuted Christians and was addressed to Roman governors.      |Trajans|Trajan|  policy towards Christians was no different from the treatment of other sects, that is, they would only be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods, but they were not to be sought out. The edict of  |Septimius_Severus|Septimius_Severus|  touted in the  |Augustan_History|Augustan_History|  is considered unreliable by historians. According to Eusebius, the Imperial household of Maximinus predecessor, Alexander, had contained many  |Christians|Christians| . Eusebius states that, hating his predecessors household, Maximinus ordered that the leaders of the churches should be put to death.   According to Eusebius, this persecution of 235 sent  |Hippolytus_of_Rome|Hippolytus_Of_Rome|  and  |Pope_Pontian|Pope_Pontian|  into exile but other evidence suggests that the persecutions of 235 were local to the provinces where they occurred rather than happening under the direction of the Emperor.      Under the reign of Emperor Decius, a decree was issued requiring public sacrifice, a formality equivalent to a testimonial of allegiance to the Emperor and the established order. Decius authorized  |roving_commissions|Roving_Commission|  visiting the cities and villages to supervise the execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or by burning incense to Roman gods, and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called libelli. Several councils held at  |Carthage|Carthage|  debated the extent to which the community should accept these lapsed Christians.   The Christian church, despite no indication in the surviving texts that the edict targeted any specific group, never forgot the reign of Decius whom they labelled as that fierce tyrant . Scarre 1995, p.170     Some early Christians sought out and welcomed martyrdom. Roman authorities tried hard to avoid Christians because they goaded, chided, belittled and insulted the crowds until they demanded their death.  apud  Boyarin, Daniel. Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999, p. 40     According to Droge and Tabor, in 185 the proconsul of Asia, Arrius Antoninus, was approached by a group of Christians demanding to be executed. The proconsul obliged some of them and then sent the rest away, saying that if they wanted to kill themselves there was plenty of rope available or cliffs they could jump off.  Misquoted as Groge and Tabor by C. Douzinas in  Such seeking after death is found in  |Tertullians|Tertullian|  Scorpiace and in the letters of  |Saint_Ignatius_of_Antioch|Saint_Ignatius_Of_Antioch|  but was not the only view of martyrdom in the early Christian church. The 2nd-century text  Martyrdom of Polycarp  relates the story of Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who did not desire death, but died a  |martyr|Martyr| , bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire miraculously failed to touch him. The Martyrdom of Polycarp advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarps death as its prized example. The example of the Phrygian Quintus, who actively sought out martyrdom, is repudiated.     According to two different Christian traditions,  |Simon_bar_Kokhba|Simon_Bar_Kokhba| , the leader of the  |second_Jewish_revolt_against_Rome|Bar_Kokhba_Revolt|  who was proclaimed Messiah, persecuted the Christians: Justin Martyr claims that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts that Bar Kokhba harassed them because they refused to join his revolt against the Romans. Justin, I Apology 31, 6; Eusebius, Chronicle, seventeenth year of the Emperor Hadrian. See: Bourgel, Jonathan, ″The Jewish-Christians in the storm of the Bar Kokhba Revolt″, in: From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome . Paris: Éditions du Cerf, collection Judaïsme ancien et Christianisme primitif, , pp. 127–175. The latter is likely true, and Christians refusal to take part in the revolt against the Roman Empire was a key event in the schism of Early Christianity and Judaism.            These persecutions culminated with the reign of  |Diocletian|Diocletian|  and  |Galerius|Galerius|  at the end of the third century and the beginning of the 4th century. The  |Great_Persecution|Great_Persecution|  is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the  |Roman_gods|Roman_Gods|  or face immediate execution. According to legend, one of the  |martyrs|Martyrs|  during the Diocletian persecution was  |Saint_George|Saint_George| , a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperors edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to be a Christian by declaring his worship of  |Jesus_Christ|Jesus_Christ| . Though  |Diocletian|Diocletian|  zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in  |Gaul|Gaul| ,  |Spain|Spain| , and  |Britannia|Britannia|  were virtually unmolested.     This persecution lasted until  |Constantine_I|Constantine_I|  came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not until  |Theodosius_I|Theodosius_I|  in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the official religion of the Empire. Between these two events  |Julian_II|Julian_The_Apostate|  temporarily restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities.     Martyrs were considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were not also martyrs.     The New Catholic Encyclopedia states that Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs. Since the title of martyr is the highest title to which a Christian can aspire, this tendency is natural .  Attempts at estimating the numbers involved are inevitably based on inadequate sources, but one historian of the persecutions estimates the overall numbers as between 5,500 and 6,500.,  a number also adopted by later writers including  |Yuval_Noah_Harari|Yuval_Noah_Harari|  In the 300 years from the crucifixion of Christ to the conversion of Emperor Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no more than four general persecutions of Christians. Local administrators and governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.         The Sassanian policy shifted from tolerance of other religions under  |Shapur_I|Shapur_I|  to intolerance under  |Vahrans|Bahram_I|  and apparently a return to the policy of Shapur until the reign of  |Shapur_II|Shapur_Ii| . The persecution at that time was initiated by  |Constantines|Constantine_The_Great|  conversion to Christianity which followed that of Armenian king  |Tiridates|Tiridates_Iii_Of_Armenia|  in about 301 A.D. The Christians were thus viewed with suspicions of secretly being partisans of Roman Empire. This didnt change until the fifth century when the  |Nestorian_Church|Nestorian_Church|  broke off from the  |Church_of_Antioch|Church_Of_Antioch| .    Zoroastrian elites continued viewing the Christians with enmity and distrust throughout the fifth century with threat of persecution remaining significant, especially during war against the Romans.      |Kartir|Kartir|  in his  Kabayi Zartust  inscription dated about 280, refers to persecution  of Christians . Kartir took Christianity as a serious opponent. The use of the double expression may be indicative of the Greek-speaking Christians deported by  |Shapur_I|Shapur_I|  from  |Antioch|Antioch|  and other cities during his war against the Romans.   |Constantines|Constantine_The_Great|  efforts to protect the Persian Christians made them a target of accusations of disloyalty to Sasanians. With the resumption of Roman-Sasanian conflict under  |Constantius_II|Constantius_Ii| , the Christian position became untenable. Zoroastrian priests targeted clergy and ascetics of local Christians to eliminate the leaders of the church. A  |Syriac|Syriac_Language|  manuscript in  |Edessa|Edessa|  in 411 documents dozens executed in various parts of western Sasanian Empire.      In 341,  |Shapur_II|Shapur_Ii|  ordered the persecution of all Christians. Sebastian P. Brock, Fire from Heaven: Studies in Syriac Theology and Liturgy, , 72. D. T. Potts, The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State, , 422. In response to their subversive attitude and support of Romans, Shahpur II doubled the tax on Christians.  |Shemon_Bar_Sabbae|Shemon_Bar_Sabbae|  informed him that he could not pay the taxes demanded from him and his community. He was martyred and a forty-year-long period of persecution of Christians began. The  |Council_of_Seleucia_Ctesiphon|Council_Of_Seleucia_Ctesiphon|  gave up choosing bishops since it would result in death. The local  |mobads|Mobads|  with the help of  |satraps|Satraps|  organized slaughters of Christians in  |Adiabene|Adiabene| ,  |Beth_Garmae|Beth_Garmai| ,  |Khuzistan|Khuzistan|  and many other provinces.       |Yazdegerd_I|Yazdegerd_I|  showed tolerance towards Jews and Christians for much of his rule. He allowed Christians to practice their religion freely, demolished monasteries and churches were rebuilt and missionaries were allowed to operate freely. He reversed his policies during the later part of his reign however, suppressing missionary activities.   |Bahram_V|Bahram_V|  continued and intensified their persecution, resulting in many of them fleeing to the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| . Bahram demanded their return,  |sparking_a_war_between_the_two|Roman–Sasanian_War| . The war ended in 422 with agreement of freedom of religion for Christians in Iran with that of Mazdaism in Byzantium. Meanwhile, Christians suffered destruction of churches,   renounced the faith, had their private property confiscated and many were expelled.      Shah  |Yazdegerd_II|Yazdegerd_Ii|  had ordered all his subjects to embrace  |Mazdeism|Mazdeism|  in an attempt to unite his empire ideologically. The  |Caucasus|Caucasus|  rebelled to defend Christianity which had become integrated in their local culture, with Armenian aristocrats turning to the Romans for help. The rebels were however defeated in a  |battle|Battle_Of_Avarayr|  on the Avaryr Plain.  |Yeghishe|Yeghishe|  in his The History of Vardan and the Armenian War, pays a tribute to the battles waged to defend Christianity.  Another revolt was waged from 481–483 which was suppressed. However, the Armenians succeeded in gaining freedom of religion among other improvements.      Accounts of executions for apostasy of Zoroastrians who converted to Christianity during Sasanian rule proliferated from the fifth to early seventh century, and continued to be produced even after collapse of Sasanians. The punishment of apostates increased under  |Yazdegerd_I|Yazdegerd_I|  and continued under successive kings. It was normative for apostates who were brought to the notice of authorities to be executed, although the prosecution of apostasy depended on political circumstances and Zoroastrian jurisprudence. Per Richard E. Payne, the executions were meant to create a mutually recognised boundary between interactions of the people of the two religions and preventing one religion challenging anothers viability. Although the violence on Christians was selective and especially carried out on elites, it served to keep Christian communities in a subordinate and yet viable position in relation to Zoroastrianism. Christians were allowed to build religious buildings and serve in the government as long as they didnt expand their institutions and population at the expense of Zoroastrianism.       |Khosrow_I|Khosrow_I|  was generally regarded as tolerant of Christians and interested in the philosophical and theological disputes during his reign.  |Sebeos|Sebeos|  claimed he had converted to Christianity on his deathbed.  |John_of_Ephesus|John_Of_Ephesus|  describes an Armenian revolt where he claims that Khusrow had attempted to impose Zoroastrianism in Armenia. The account, however, is very similar to the one of Armenian revolt of 451. In addition, Sebeos doesnt mention any religious persecution in his account of the revolt of 571.  Story about  |Hormizd_IVs|Hormizd_Iv|  tolerance is preserved by the historian  |al_Tabari|Al_Tabari| . Upon being asked why he tolerated Christians, he replied, Just as our royal throne cannot stand upon its front legs without its two back ones, our kingdom cannot stand or endure firmly if we cause the Christians and adherents of other faiths, who differ in belief from ourselves, to become hostile to us.          In AD 516, a tribal unrest broke out in  |Yemen|Yemen|  and several tribal elites fought for power. One of those elites was Joseph  |Dhu_Nuwas|Dhu_Nuwas|  or Yousef Asaar , a Jewish warlord mentioned in ancient south Arabian inscriptions.  |Syriac|Syriac_Christians|  and  |Byzantine|Byzantium|  sources claim that he fought his war because Christians in Yemen refused to renounce  |Christianity|Christianity| . In 2009, a documentary that aired on the  |BBC|Bbc|  defended the claim that the villagers had been offered the choice between conversion to  |Judaism|Judaism|  or death and that 20,000 Christians were then massacred stating that The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary, a former professor of archaeology at the  |King_Saud_University|King_Saud_University|  in Riyadh.  Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride that he expressed after killing more than 22,000 Christians in Zafar and  |Najran|Najran| . Jacques Ryckmans, La persécution des chrétiens himyarites au sixième siècle Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1–24 Historian  |Glen_Bowersock|Glen_Bowersock|  described this as a savage pogrom that the Jewish king of the Arabs launched against the Christians in the city of Najran. The king himself reported in excruciating detail to his Arab and Persian allies about the massacres that he had inflicted on all Christians who refused to convert to Judaism. Bowesock, Glen . The Throne of Adulis: Red Sea Wars on the Eve of Islam. Oxford University Press. p. 4. .              In the 4th century, the  |Terving|Thervings|  king  |Athanaric|Athanaric|  in ca. 375 ordered a  |persecution_of_Christians|Gothic_Persecution_Of_Christians| . Peter Heather & John Matthews, Goths in the Fourth Century, pp. 96ff              The  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  provoked a number of persecutions of Christians by other Christians, including false allegations of  |witchcraft|Witchcraft| .            Several months after the Persian conquest in AD 614, a riot occurred in Jerusalem, and the Jewish governor of Jerusalem Nehemiah was killed by a band of young Christians along with his council of the righteous while he was making plans for the building of the  |Third_Temple|Third_Temple| . At this time the Christians had allied themselves with the  |Eastern_Roman_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| . Shortly afterward, the events escalated into a full-scale Christian rebellion, resulting in a battle against the Jews and Christians who were living in Jerusalem. In the battles aftermath, many Jews were killed and the survivors fled to Caesarea, which was still being held by the Persian Army.     The Judeo-Persian reaction was ruthless—Persian Sasanian general Xorheam assembled Judeo-Persian troops and went and encamped around Jerusalem and besieged it for 19 days.  Eventually, digging beneath the foundations of the Jerusalem, they destroyed the wall and on the 19th day of the siege, the Judeo-Persian forces took Jerusalem.     According to the account of  |Sebeos|Sebeos| , the siege resulted in a total Christian death toll of 17,000, the earliest and thus most commonly accepted figure.   Per Antiochus, 4,518 prisoners alone were massacred near  |Mamilla_reservoir|Mamilla_Pool| .  by Gideon Avni, Director of the Excavations and Surveys Department of the Israel Antiquities Authority. A cave containing hundreds of skeletons near the  |Jaffa_Gate|Jaffa_Gate| , 200 metres east of the large Roman-era pool in Mamilla, correlates with the massacre of Christians at hands of the Persians mentioned by Antiochius Strategius. While reinforcing the evidence of massacre of Christians, the archaeological evidence seem less conclusive on the destruction of Christian churches and monasteries in Jerusalem.       According to the later account of  |Antiochus_Strategos|Antiochus_Strategos| , whose perspective appears to be that of a Byzantine Greek and shows an antipathy towards the Jews,  thousands of Christians were massacred during the conquest of the city. Estimates based on varying copies of Strategoss manuscripts range from 4,518 to 66,509 killed.  Strategos wrote that the Jews offered to help them escape death if they become Jews and deny Christ , and the Christian captives refused. In anger the Jews allegedly purchased Christians to kill them.  In 1989, a mass burial grave at  |Mamilla|Mamilla|  cave was discovered in by Israeli archeologist Ronny Reich, near the site where Antiochus recorded the massacre took place. The human remains were in poor condition containing a minimum of 526 individuals.      From the many excavations carried out in the  |Galilee|Galilee| , it is clear that all churches had been destroyed during the period between the Persian invasion and the  |Arab_conquest_in_637|Siege_Of_Jerusalem| . The church at  |Shave_Ziyyon|Shavei_Tzion|  was destroyed and burnt in 614. Similar fate befell churches at  |Evron|Evron_Israel| ,  |Nahariya|Nahariya| , Arabe and monastery of  |Shelomi|Shlomi_Israel| . The monastery at  |Kursi|Kursi_Golan_Heights|  was damaged in the invasion.        At the time of the  |Arab|Arab| |_Islamic_conquest|Islamic_Conquest|  of the mid 7th century AD the populations of  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  and  |Assyria|Assyria|  ,  |Syria|Syria| ,  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia|  ,  |Egypt|Egypt| ,  |Jordan|Jordan| ,  |North_Africa|North_Africa|  ,  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and  |Armenia|Armenia|  were predominantly Christian and non-Arab.      As  |People_of_the_Book|People_Of_The_Book|  Christians were given  |dhimmi|Dhimmi|  status , which was inferior to the status of Muslims. Christians thus faced  |Religious_discrimination|Religious_Discrimination|  and  |Religious_persecution|Religious_Persecution|  in that they were banned from  |proselytising|Proselytising|  in lands conquered by the Muslims on pain of death, they were banned from bearing arms and undertaking certain professions. Under  |sharia|Sharia| , non-Muslims were obligated to pay  |jizya|Jizya|  and  |al_kharaj|Al_Kharaj|  taxes, together with periodic heavy  |ransom|Ransom|  levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty, and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam. Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender their children to the Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced into Islam Stillman, Norman A., 1998. Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book. Edition. The Jewish Publication Society. According to the  |Hanafi|Hanafi|  school of sharia, the testimony of a non-Muslim was not considered valid against the testimony of a Muslim in legal or civil matters. Islamic law forbid Muslim women from marrying Christian men, but Muslim men were permitted to marry Christian women.   Christians under Islamic rule had the right to convert to Islam or any other religion, while conversely a  |murtad|Murtad| , or an  |apostate|Apostate|  from Islam, faced severe penalties or even  hadd , which could include the death penalty. In general, Christians subject to Islamic rule were allowed to practice their religion with some notable limitations stemming from the  |Pact_of_Umar|Covenant_Of_Umar_I| . This treaty, enacted in 717 AD, forbade Christians from publicly displaying the cross on church buildings, from summoning congregants to prayer with a bell, from re-building or repairing churches and monasteries after they had been destroyed or damaged, and imposed other restrictions relating to occupations, clothing and weapons.  The Umayyad Caliphate persecuted many Berber Christians in the seventh and eighth centuries, who slowly converted to Islam. The Disappearance of Christianity from North Africa in the Wake of the Rise of Islam C. J. Speel, II Church History, Vol. 29, No. 4 , pp. 379–397     Native Christian communities are subject to persecution in several  |Muslim_majority_countries|Muslim_Majority_Countries|  such as  |Egypt|Egypt| .   |Pakistan|Pakistan| ,         |Tamerlane|Tamerlane|  instigated large scale massacres of Christians in  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| ,  |Persia|Persia| ,  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and  |Syria|Syria|  in the 14th century AD. Most of the victims were indigenous  |Assyrians|Assyrian_People|  and  |Armenians|Armenians| , members of the  |Assyrian_Church_of_the_East|Assyrian_Church_Of_The_East|  and  |Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| es, which led to the decimation of the hitherto majority Assyrian population in northern Mesopotamia and the abandonment of the ancient Assyrian city of  |Assur|Assur| .  Other massacres were perpetrated by Helugu Khan against the Assyrians, particularly in and around the ancient Assyrian city of Arbela .               Before the late 16th century, Albania, despite being under Ottoman rule, had remained overwhelmingly Christian, unlike other regions such as Bosnia, Bulgaria and Northern Greece,  and mountainous Albania was a frequent site of revolts against the Ottoman Empire, often incurring enormous human costs such as the decimation of entire villages. Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‘’Albanian Identities’’. Pages 15–16, 19. To handle this problem, the Ottomans their usual policy of toleration of Christians as second class citizens to one aimed at reducing the Christian population through Islamization, beginning in restive Christian regions of Reka and Elbasan in 1570. Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‘’Albanian Identities’’. Sofia, 2000: International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations. Page 15-16 The pressures associated with this campaign included particularly harsh economic conditions opposed on the Christian population; while earlier taxes on the Christian were around 45 akçes a year, by the middle of the 17th century the rate had been multiplied by 27 to 780 akçes a year. Albanian elders often opted to save their clans and villages from hunger and economic ruin by advocating village-wide and region-wide conversions to Islam, with many individuals often continuing to practice Christianity in private. Zhelyazkova Antonina. . ...If the tax levied on the Christians in the Albanian communities in the 16th century amounted to about 45 akçes, in the middle of the 17th century it ran up to 780 akçes a year. In order to save the clans from hunger and ruin, the Albanian elders advised the people in the villages to adopt Islam...Nevertheless, the willingness of the Gegs to support the campaigns of the Catholic West against the Empire, did not abate.... men in Albania, Christians, but also Muslims, were ready to take arms, given the smallest help from the Catholic West.... the complex dual religious identity of the Albanians become clear. Emblematic is the case of the Crypto-Christians inhabiting the inaccessible geographical area...

The transferred villagers were forced to convert over to Islam. and the Venetians in the 1644 Venetian-Ottoman War . Then, in 1644, war broke out between Venice and the Ottoman empire. At the urging of the clergy, many Albanian Catholics sided with Venice. The Ottomans responded with severe repressions, which in turn drove many Catholics to embrace Islam ... Within the span of twenty-two years the number of Catholics in the diocese of Alessio fell by more than 50 percent, while in the diocese of Pulati the number of Catholics declined from more than 20,000 to just 4,045. In general, Albanian insurrections during the Ottoman-Venetian wars of 1644–69 resulted in stiff Ottoman reprisals against Catholics in northern Albania and significantly accelerated Islamization... In general, a pattern emerged. When the, Ottoman empire was attacked by Catholic powers, local Catholics were pressured to convert, and when the attack on the Ottoman empire came from Orthodox Russia, the pressure was on local Orthodox to change faith. In some cases Islamization was only superficial, however, and in the nineteenth century many villages and some entire districts remained crypto-Catholic in spite of the adopting the externals of Islamic culture. as well as the  |Orlov_Revolt|Orlov_Revolt|  . The Ottoman conquest between the end of the fourteenth century and the mid-fifteenth century introduced a third religion – Islam – but the Turks did not at first use force in its expansion, and it was only in the 1600s that large-scale conversion to Islam began – chiefly, at first, among Albanian Catholics. ; p.204. The Orthodox community enjoyed broad toleration at the hands of the Sublime Porte until the late eighteenth century. ; p. 204. In the late eighteenth century Russian agents began stirring up the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman empire against the Sublime Porte. In the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768–74 and 1787–91 Orthodox Albanians rose against the Turks. In the course of the second revolt the New Academy in Voskopoje was destroyed , and at the end of the second Russo-Turkish war more than a thousand Orthodox fled to Russia on Russian warships. As a result of these revolts, the Porte now applied force to Islamicize the Albanian Orthodox population, adding economic incentives to provide positive stimulus. In 1798 Ali Pasha of Janina led Ottoman forces against Christian believers assembled in their churches to celebrate Easter in the villages of Shen Vasil and Nivica e Bubarit. The bloodbath unleashed against these believers frightened Albanian Christians in other districts and inspired a new wave of mass conversions to Islam. . . . . were all factors that led to punitive measures mixing outright force with economic incentives depending on the region, and ended up forcing the conversion of large Christian populations to Islam in Albania. In the case of the Great Turkish War, in the aftermath, massive punitive measures resulted in the flight of most of Kosovos Catholic Albanian population into Hungary around Budapest, where most died of disease and starvation.  After the Orthodox Serbian population subsequently also fled from Kosovo, the pasha of Ipek forced Albanian Catholic mountaineers to repopulate Kosovo by deporting them to Kosovo, and also forced them adopt Islam. In the 17th and 18th centuries, South Albania also saw numerous instances of violence directed by local newly converted Muslims against those who remained Christian, ultimately resulting in many more conversions out of fear as well as flight by the Christian population to faraway lands. . . . . Particularly interesting is the case of Vithkuq, south of Moschopolis... It may well have had Vlach inhabitants before 1769, though the Arvanites were certainly far more numerous, if not the largest population group. This is further supported by the linguistic identity of the refugees who fled Vithkuq and accompanied the waves of departing Vlachs... p. 339. As the same time as, or possibly shortly before or after, these events in Moschopolis, unruly Arnauts also attacked the smaller Vlach and Arvanitic communities round about. The Vlach inhabitants of Llengë, Niçë, Grabovë, Shipckë, and the Vlach villages on Grammos, such as Nikolicë, Linotopi, and Grammousta, and the inhabitants of Vithkuq and even the last Albanian speaking Christian villages on Opar found themselves at the mercy of the predatory Arnauts, whom no-one could withstand. For them too, the only solution was to flee... During this period, Vlach and Arvanite families from the surrounding ruined market towns and villages settled alongside the few Moscopolitans who had returned. Refugee families came from Dushar and other villages in Opar, from Vithkuq, Grabovë, Nikolicë, Niçë, and Llengë and from Kolonjë… .             The Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution is a conventional description of a campaign, conducted by various  |Robespierre|Robespierre| -era governments of France beginning with the start of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  in 1789, to eliminate any symbol that might be associated with the past, especially the  |monarchy|Monarchy_Of_France| .

The climax was reached with the celebration of the Goddess Reason in  |Notre_Dame|Notre_Dame_De_Paris|  Cathedral on 10 November.     Under threat of death, imprisonment, military conscription or loss of income, about 20,000 constitutional priests were forced to abdicate or hand over their letters of ordination and 6,000  – 9,000 were coerced to marry, many ceasing their ministerial duties. Tallet, Frank  p. 10, 1991 Continuum International Publishing Some of those who abdicated covertly ministered to the people. By the end of the decade, approximately 30,000 priests were forced to leave France, and thousands who did not leave were executed.

With these  |massacres|Mass_Murder|  came formal orders for forced evacuation; also, a  |scorched_earth|Scorched_Earth|  policy was initiated: farms were destroyed, crops and forests burned and villages razed. There were many reported atrocities and a campaign of mass killing universally targeted at residents of the  |Vendée|Vendée|  regardless of combatant status, political affiliation, age or gender.  By July 1796, the estimated Vendean dead numbered between 117,000 and 500,000, out of a population of around 800,000.

With the advent of European colonialism in India throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Christians were systematically persecuted in a few Muslim ruled kingdoms in India. Modern-day persecution also exists and is carried out by Hindu nationalists. A report by  |Human_Rights_Watch|Human_Rights_Watch|  stated that there is a rise in anti-Christian violence due to  |Hindu_nationalism|Hindu_Nationalism|  and Smita Narula, Researcher, Asia Division of Human Rights Watch stated Christians are the new scapegoat in Indias political battles. Without immediate and decisive action by the government, communal tensions will continue to be exploited for political and economic ends.      Muslim  |Tipu_Sultan|Tipu_Sultan| , the ruler of the  |Kingdom_of_Mysore|Kingdom_Of_Mysore| , took action against the  |Mangalorean_Catholic|Mangalorean_Catholic|  community from  |Mangalore|Mangalore|  and the  |South_Canara|South_Canara|  district on the southwestern coast of India. Tipu was widely reputed to be anti-Christian. He took Mangalorean Catholics into captivity at  |Seringapatam|Seringapatam|  on 24 February 1784 and released them on 4 May 1799.      Soon after the  |Treaty_of_Mangalore|Treaty_Of_Mangalore|  in 1784, Tipu gained control of Canara.  He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates,  and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, through the  |Jamalabad_fort|Jamalabad|  route.  There were no priests among the captives. Together with Fr. Miranda, all the 21 arrested priests were issued orders of expulsion to Goa, fined Rs 2  lakhs, and threatened death by hanging if they ever returned. Tipu ordered the destruction of 27 Catholic churches.     According to  |Thomas_Munro|Sir_Thomas_Munro_1St_Baronet| , a Scottish soldier and the first collector of Canara, around 60,000 of them,  nearly 92  percent of the entire Mangalorean Catholic community, were captured. 7,000 escaped. Observer  |Francis_Buchanan|Francis_Buchanan_Hamilton|  reports that 70,000 were captured, from a population of 80,000, with 10,000 escaping. They were forced to climb nearly  through the jungles of the  |Western_Ghat|Western_Ghats|  mountain ranges. It was  from Mangalore to Seringapatam, and the journey took six weeks. According to British Government records, 20,000   of them died on the march to Seringapatam. According to James Scurry, a British officer, who was held captive along with Mangalorean Catholics, 30,000  of them were forcibly converted to Islam. The young women and girls were forcibly made wives of the Muslims living there and later distributed and sold in prostitution.  The young men who offered resistance were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears.  According to Mr. Silva of  |Gangolim|Gangolim| , a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment under the orders of Tipu was the cutting off of the ears, nose, the feet and one hand.       The Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800,  It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.       Tipu Sultans invasion of the  |Malabar_Coast|Malabar_Coast|  had an adverse impact on the  |Saint_Thomas_Christian|Saint_Thomas_Christian|  community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in Malabar and  |Cochin|Cochin|  were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipus soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipus army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipus army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode,  |Mavelikkara|Mavelikkara| , etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them. K.L. Bernard, Kerala History , pp. 79     Tipus persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the  |battle_of_Pollilur|Battle_Of_Pollilur| , 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear  ghagra cholis  and entertain the court as nautch girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of  |negro|Negro| es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes. William Dalrymple White Mughals p28     During the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the  |Mestizos|Mestizos|  and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.              |Tokugawa_Ieyasu|Tokugawa_Ieyasu|  assumed control over Japan in 1600. Like  |Toyotomi_Hideyoshi|Toyotomi_Hideyoshi| , he disliked Christian activities in Japan. The  |Tokugawa_shogunate|Tokugawa_Shogunate|  finally decided to ban Catholicism, in 1614 and in the mid-17th century it demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts. This marked the end of open Christianity in Japan.  The  |Shimabara_Rebellion|Shimabara_Rebellion| , led by a young  |Japanese_Christian|Kirishitan|  boy named  |Amakusa_Shirō_Tokisada|Amakusa_Shirō| , took place in 1637. After the  |Hara_Castle|Hara_Castle|  fell, the shogunates forces beheaded an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers. Amakusa Shirōs severed head was taken to  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki_Nagasaki|  for public display, and the entire complex at Hara Castle was burned to the ground and buried together with the bodies of all the dead. Naramoto, p. 401.     Many of the Christians in Japan continued for two centuries to maintain their religion as  |Kakure_Kirishitan|Kakure_Kirishitan| , or hidden Christians, without any priests or pastors. Some of those who were killed for their Faith are venerated as the  |Martyrs_of_Japan|Martyrs_Of_Japan| .     Christianity was later allowed during the  |Meiji_era|Meiji_Era| . The  |Meiji_Constitution|Meiji_Constitution|  of 1890 introduced  |separation_of_church_and_state|Separation_Of_Church_And_State|  and permitted freedom of religion.                       Relations between  |Muslims|Muslim|  and Christians in the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  during the modern era were shaped in no small part by broader dynamics related to European colonial and neo-imperialist activity in the region, dynamics that frequently generated tensions between the two. Too often, growing European influence in the region during the nineteenth century seemed to disproportionately benefit Christians, thus producing resentment on the part of many Muslims, likewise a suspicion that Christians were colluding with the European powers in order to weaken the Islamic world. Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to benefit disproportionately from efforts at reform , likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empires European territories, which often had the support of the European powers. Erik Freas, Muslim-Christian Relations in Late-Ottoman Palestine: Where Nationalism and Religion Intersect ,      Since the time of the  |Austro_Turkish_war_|Great_Turkish_War|  relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire gradually took more extreme forms and resulted in occasional calls by some Muslim religious leaders for the expulsion or extermination of local Christians. As a result of Ottoman  |oppression|Oppression| , the destruction of Churches and Monasteries, and violence against the non-Muslim civilian population,  |Serbian|Serbs|  Christians and their church leaders, headed by Serbian Patriarch  |Arsenije_III|Arsenije_Iii_Čarnojević| , sided with the Austrians in 1689 and again in 1737 under Serbian Patriarch  |Arsenije_IV|Arsenije_Iv_Jovanović_Šakabenta| . In the following punitive campaigns, Ottoman forces conducted systematic atrocities against the Christian population in the Serbian regions, resulted in the  |Great_Migrations_of_the_Serbs|Great_Migrations_Of_The_Serbs| .        Similar persecutions and forced migrations of Christian populations were induced by Ottoman forces during the 18th and 19th centuries in the European and Asian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The  |Massacres_of_Badr_Khan|Massacres_Of_Badr_Khan|  were conducted by  |Kurdish|Kurdish_People|  and  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  forces against the  |Assyrian_Christian|Assyrian_Christian|  population of the Ottoman Empire between 1843 and 1847, resulting in the slaughter of more than 10,000 indigenous Assyrian civilians of the  |Hakkari|Hakkari|  region, with many thousands more being sold into  |slavery|Slavery| .

Adalian, Rouben Paul , Historical Dictionary of Armenia , Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 154. The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert  |Pan_Islamism|Pan_Islamism|  in the Ottoman Empire, resentment of the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. The massacres mainly took place in what is today southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria and northern Iraq.

These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced Ottomanisation of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Ottoman troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by south-east Anatolian tribes. Unarmed Assyrian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered.  According to H.

After the  |Russian_Revolution|Russian_Revolution|  of 1917, the  |Bolsheviks|Bolsheviks|  undertook a massive program to remove the influence of the  |Russian_Orthodox_Church|Russian_Orthodox_Church|  from the government while outlawing  |antisemitism|Antisemitism|  in Russian society, and promoting  |atheism|State_Atheism| . Tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or converted to other uses, and many members of the clergy were murdered, publicly executed and imprisoned for what the government termed anti-government activities. An extensive educational and propaganda campaign was launched in order to convince people, especially children and youths, to abandon their religious beliefs. This persecution resulted in the intentional murder of 500,000 Orthodox followers by the government of the Soviet Union during the 20th century.     Under the doctrine of  |state_atheism|State_Atheism|  in the Soviet Union, a government-sponsored program of forced conversion to  |atheism|Marxist_Leninist_Atheism|  was conducted by the Communists.

Before and after the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 there was a movement within the Soviet Union to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule . This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States.

According to James M. Nelson a psychology professor at  |East_Carolina_University|East_Carolina_University| , the total number of Christian victims under the Soviet regime may have been around 12 million, Estimates of the total number of Christian martyrs in the former Soviet Union are about 12 million. , James M.

The Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions towards particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed. It is estimated that 500,000 Russian  |Orthodox_Christians|Orthodox_Christians|  were  |martyred|Martyred|  in the  |gulags|Gulag|  by the Soviet government, excluding the members of other  |Christian_denominations|Christian_Denominations|  who were also tortured or killed.

The Washington Post Anti-Communist Priest Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa by Patricia Sullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Sunday, 26 November 2006; Page C09 In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.         The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful worshippers. A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested.   The widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of  |Patriarch_of_Moscow|Patriarch_Of_Moscow|  being vacant from 1925 to 1943.     After Nazi Germanys attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957, about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959,  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev|  initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985, fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.     In the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closure and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated by the state and converted to public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. With the exception of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy, it could not instruct the faithful or evangelise the youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all declared illegal and banned. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or  |samizdat|Samizdat| . This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the  |dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|Dissolution_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  in 1991. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Orthodox Church has recognized a number of  |New_Martyrs|New_Martyr|  as saints, some of whom were executed during the  |Mass_operations_of_the_NKVD|Mass_Operations_Of_The_Nkvd|  under directives like  |NKVD_Order_No_00447|Nkvd_Order_No_00447| .          In the 19th century, Mexican President  |Benito_Juárez|Benito_Juárez|  confiscated church lands. The  |Mexican_governments|Mexican_Government|  campaign against the Catholic Church after the  |Mexican_Revolution|Mexican_Revolution|  culminated in the 1917 constitution which contained numerous articles which Catholics perceived as violating their civil rights: outlawing monastic religious orders, forbidding public worship outside of church buildings, restricted religious organizations rights to own property, and taking away basic civil rights of members of the clergy . When the first embassy of the Soviet Union in any country was opened in Mexico, the Soviet ambassador remarked that no other two countries show more similarities than the Soviet Union and Mexico . Krauze, Enrique, , p. 418, Harper Collins 1998     When the Church publicly condemned the anticlerical measures which had not been strongly enforced, the atheist President  |Plutarco_Calles|Plutarco_Calles|  sought to vigorously enforce the provisions and enacted additional anti-Catholic legislation known as the Calles Law. At this time, some in the United States government, considering Calles regime  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik| , started to refer to Mexico as Soviet Mexico . Richards, Michael D.  p. 30      Weary of the persecution, in many parts of the country a popular rebellion called the  |Cristero_War|Cristero_War|  began . The effects of the persecution on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Van Hove, Brian  Faith & Reason 1994 Where there were 4,500 priests serving the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination. Scheina, Robert L.  p. 33  By 1935, 17 states had no priest at all.  |Ruiz_Ramón_Eduardo|Ramón_Eduardo_Ruiz|   p.393  In the second Cristero rebellion , the Cristeros took particular exception to the socialist education, which Calles had also implemented but which President Cardenas had added to the 1917 Mexican Constitution. Sanderson, Steven E., , p. 102, Univ. of California Press 1981 Matthew Butler , p. 201          The  |Latter_Day_Saint_Movement|Latter_Day_Saint_Movement| ,  have been persecuted since their founding in the 1830s. This persecution drove them from  |New_York|New_York|  and  |Ohio|Ohio|  to  |Missouri|Missouri| , where they continued to suffer violent attacks. In 1838, Gov.  |Lilburn_Boggs|Lilburn_Boggs|  declared that Mormons had made war on the state of Missouri, and must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state  At least 10,000 were expelled from the State. In the most violent of the altercations at this time, the  |Hauns_mill_Massacre|Hauns_Mill_Massacre| , 17 were murdered by an anti-Mormon mob and 13 were wounded.  The  |Extermination_Order|Missouri_Executive_Order_44|  signed by Governor Boggs was not formally invalidated until 25 June 1976, 137 years after being signed.     The Mormons subsequently fled to  |Nauvoo|Nauvoo_Illinois| , Illinois, where hostilities again escalated. In Carthage, Ill., where  |Joseph_Smith|Joseph_Smith|  was being held on the charge of  |treason|Treason| , a mob stormed the jail and killed him. Smiths brother, Hyrum, was also killed.

After the  |Mexican–American_War|Mexican–American_War| , the area became the US  |territory_of_Utah|Utah_Territory| . Over the next 63 years, several actions by the  |federal_government|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_States|  were directed against Mormons in the  |Mormon_Corridor|Mormon_Corridor| , including the  |Utah_War|Utah_War| , the  |Morrill_Anti_Bigamy_Act|Morrill_Anti_Bigamy_Act| , the  |Poland_Act|Poland_Act| ,  Reynolds v. United States , the  |Edmunds_Act|Edmunds_Act| , the  |Edmunds–Tucker_Act|Edmunds–Tucker_Act| , and the  |Reed_Smoot_hearings|Reed_Smoot_Hearings| .          Queen  |Ranavalona_I|Ranavalona_I|  issued a royal edict prohibiting the practice of  |Christianity_in_Madagascar|Christianity_In_Madagascar| , expelled British missionaries from the island, and sought to  |stem_the_growth_of_conversion|Persecution_Of_Christians_In_Madagascar|  to Christianity within her realm. Far more, however, were punished in other ways: many were required to undergo the  tangena  ordeal, while others were condemned to hard labor or the confiscation of their land and property, and many of these consequently died. The tangena ordeal was commonly administered to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused person for any crime, including the practice of Christianity, and involved ingestion of the poison contained within the nut of the tangena tree . Survivors were deemed innocent, while those who perished were assumed guilty.     In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20% of the population.  contributing to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalonas rule in historical accounts. Laidler  |Malagasy|Malagasy_People|  Christians would remember this period as ny tany maizina, or the time when the land was dark . Persecution of Christians intensified in 1840, 1849 and 1857; in 1849, deemed the worst of these years by British missionary to Madagascar W.E. Cummins , 1,900 people were fined, jailed or otherwise punished in relation to their Christian faith, including 18 executions.           The Second Republic proclaimed in 1931 attempted to establish a regime with a separation between State and Church as it had happened in France . When established, the Republic passed a number of laws that prompted progress in education, but also challenged the power of the Church, entrenched values and traditional public ceremonies. A process of political polarisation had characterised the Spanish Second Republic, party divisions became increasingly embittered and questions of religious identity came to assume a major political significance. Different Church institutions presented the situation resulting from the proclamation of the 2nd Republic as an anti-Catholic, Masonic, Jewish, and Communist international conspiracy that heralded a clash between God and atheism, chaos and harmony, Good and Evil.  The Churchs high-ranking officials like Isidro Goma, bishop of  |Tudela|Tudela_Navarre| , reminded their Christian subjects of their obligation to vote for the righteous , and their priests to educate the consciences.      A similar approach is attested in 1912, when the bishop of Almería José Ignacio de Urbina announced a decisive battle that must be unleashed between the light and darkness.  Since the early stages of the  |2nd_Spanish_Republic|2Nd_Spanish_Republic| , far-right forces imbued with an ultra-Catholic spirit attempted to overthrow the Republic.  |Carlists|Carlists| , Africanistas, and Catholic theologians fostered an atmosphere of social and racial hatred in their speeches and writings.      Stanley Payne suggested that persecution of right-wingers and people associated with Catholic church before and at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War involved the murder of priests and other clergy, as well as thousands of lay people, by sections of nearly all the leftist groups, while a killing spree unleashed also across the Nationalist zone. Payne, Stanley G.,  The terror During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, and especially in the early months of the conflict, individual clergymen and entire religious communities were executed by leftists, which included communists and anarchists. The  |death_toll_of_the_clergy|Martyrs_Of_The_Spanish_Civil_War|  alone included 13 bishops, 4,172 diocesan priests and seminarians, 2,364 monks and friars and 283 nuns, for a total of 6,832 clerical victims. Julio de la Cueva,  Journal of Contemporary History 33.3 : 355.     In addition to murders of clergy and the faithful, destruction of churches and desecration of sacred sites and objects were widespread. On the night of 19 July 1936 alone, some fifty churches were burned. David Mitchell, The Spanish Civil War , 45. In  |Barcelona|Barcelona| , out of the 58 churches, only the Cathedral was spared, and similar desecrations occurred almost everywhere in Republican Spain. David Mitchell, The Spanish Civil War , 46.     Exceptions were  |Biscay|Biscay|  and  |Gipuzkoa|Gipuzkoa|  where the  |Christian_Democratic|Christian_Democratic| |_Basque_Nationalist_Party|Basque_Nationalist_Party| , after some hesitation, supported the Republic while halting persecution in the areas held by the  |Basque_Government|Basque_Government| . All Catholic churches in the Republican zone were closed. The desecration was not limited to Catholic churches, as synagogues and Protestant churches were also pillaged and closed, but some small Protestant churches were spared. The rising Francos regime would keep Protestant churches and synagogues closed, as he only permitted Catholic church. Payne, Stanley , p. 215, 2008 Yale Univ. Press     Payne called the terror the most extensive and violent persecution of Catholicism in Western History, in some way even more intense than that of the  |French_Revolution|Dechristianisation_Of_France_During_The_French_Revolution| . Payne, Stanley , p. 13, 2008 Yale Univ. Press   The persecution drove Catholics to the Nationalists, even more than would have been expected, as these defended their religious interests and survival.                 |Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  and the  |Nazis|Nazi_Party|  received some support from Christian communities, mainly due to their common cause against the anti-religious Communists, as well as their mutual  |Judeophobia|Antisemitism|  and  |anti_Semitism|Antisemitism| . Once in power, the Nazis moved to consolidate their power over the German churches and bring them in line with Nazi ideals. Some historians say that Hitler had a general covert plan, which some say existed even before the Nazis rise to power, to destroy Christianity within the Reich, which was to be accomplished through control and subversion of the churches and which would be completed after the war. Sharkey, , New York Times, 13 January 2002  , Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion, Winter 2001, publishing evidence compiled by the O.S.S. for the Nuremberg war-crimes trials of 1945 and 1946  |Griffin_Roger|Roger_Griffin|  Fascisms relation to religion in Blamires, Cyprian, , p. 10, ABC-CLIO, 2006: There is no doubt that in the long run Nazi leaders such as Hitler and Himmler intended to eradicate Christianity just as ruthlessly as any other rival ideology, even if in the short term they had to be content to make compromises with it.  |Mosse_George_Lachmann|George_Lachmann_Mosse| , , p. 240, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2003: Had the Nazis won the war their ecclesiastical policies would have gone beyond those of the German Christians, to the utter destruction of both the Protestant and the Catholic Church.

Dill, Marshall, , p. 365, University of Michigan Press, 1970: It seems no exaggeration to insist that the greatest challenge the Nazis had to face was their effort to eradicate Christianity in Germany or at least to subjugate it to their general world outlook. Wheaton, Eliot Barculo , p. 290, 363, Doubleday 1968: The Nazis sought to eradicate Christianity in Germany root and branch. The Third Reich founded its own version of Christianity called  |Positive_Christianity|Positive_Christianity|  which made major changes in the interpretation of the  |Bible|Bible|  by saying that  |Jesus_Christ|Jesus|  was the son of God, but not a Jew and it also argued that Jesus despised Jews, and  |the_Jews_were_the_ones_who_were_solely_responsible_for_Jesuss_death|Jewish_Deicide| . Thus, the Nazi government consolidated religious power, using its allies in order to consolidate the Protestant churches into the  |Protestant_Reich_Church|Protestant_Reich_Church| . The  |syncretist|Syncretism|  project of Positive Christianity was abandoned in 1940.     Like other intelligentsia, Christian leaders were sometimes persecuted for their anti-Nazi political activities. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members, 18% of the Polish clergy, were murdered for their suspected ties to the Polish Resistance or left-wing groups, or for sheltering Jews .     Outside mainstream Christianity, the  |Jehovahs_Witnesses_were_targets_of_Nazi_Persecution|Persecution_Of_Jehovahs_Witnesses_In_Nazi_Germany| , for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, Jehovahs Witnesses refused to renounce their political neutrality and they were placed in concentration camps as a result. The Nazi government gave detained Jehovahs Witnesses the option of release if they signed a document which indicated their renouncement of their faith, their submission to state authority, and their support of the German military.  Historian Hans Hesse said, Some five thousand Jehovahs Witnesses were sent to  |concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps|  where they alone were voluntary prisoners, so termed because the moment they recanted their views, they could be freed. Some lost their lives in the camps, but few renounced their faith .   on the  |United_States_Holocaust_Memorial_Museum|United_States_Holocaust_Memorial_Museum|  website.     The  |Nazi_Dissolution_of_the_Bruderhof|Nazi_Dissolution_Of_The_Bruderhof|  was also carried out by the Nazi government because the Bruderhof refused to pledge allegiance to Hitler. In 1937 their property was confiscated and the group fled to England.             At times, political and religious animosity against  |Jehovahs_Witnesses|Jehovahs_Witnesses|  has led to  |mob_action|Mob_Action|  and government oppression in various countries, including  |Cuba|Human_Rights_In_Cuba| , the  |United_States|Persecution_Of_Jehovahs_Witnesses_In_The_United_States| ,  |Canada|Persecution_Of_Jehovahs_Witnesses_In_Canada|  and  |Singapore|Religion_In_Singaporechristianity| . The religions doctrine of political neutrality has led to the imprisonment of members who refused conscription .          Religion in  |Albania|Albania|  was subordinated to the interests of  |Marxism|Marxism|  during the rule of  |the_countrys_communist_party|Party_Of_Labour_Of_Albania|  when all religions were suppressed. This was used to justify the communist stance of  |state_atheism|State_Atheism|  from 1967 to 1991. , Derek R. Hall, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 165, No. 2, The Changing Meaning of Place in Post-Socialist Eastern Europe: Commodification, Perception and Environment , pp. 161–172, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Royal Geographical Society The  |Agrarian_Reform_Law|Agrarian_Reform_Law|  of August 1945 nationalized most of the property which belonged to religious institutions, including the estates of mosques, monasteries, orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried and some of them were executed. All foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled in 1946.   Churches, cathedrals and mosques were seized by the military and converted into basketball courts, movie theaters, dance halls, and the like; with members of the Clergy being stripped of their titles and imprisoned.   Around 6,000 Albanians were disappeared by agents of the Communist government, with their bodies having never been found or identified. Albanians continued to be imprisoned, tortured and killed for their religious practices well into 1991.      Religious communities or branches that had their headquarters outside the country, such as the  |Jesuit|Society_Of_Jesus|  and  |Franciscan|Franciscans|  orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and they were also prohibited from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals.  |Enver_Hoxhas|Enver_Hoxha|  overarching goal was the eventual destruction of all  |organized_religion|Organized_Religion|  in Albania, despite some variance in approach.            According to Pope Emeritus  |Benedict_XVI|Benedict_Xvi| , Christians are the most persecuted group in the contemporary world.  The  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  has reported that over 100,000 Christians are violently killed annually because of some relation to their faith.  According to the  |World_Evangelical_Alliance|World_Evangelical_Alliance| , over 200  million Christians are denied fundamental human rights solely because of their faith.  Of the 100–200  million Christians alleged to be under assault, the majority are persecuted in Muslim-dominated nations.  Paul Vallely has said that Christians suffer numerically more than any other faith group or any group without faith in the world. Of the worlds three largest religions Christians are allegedly the most persecuted with 80% of all acts of  |religious_discrimination|Religious_Discrimination|  being directed at Christians  who only make up 33% of the worlds population.      Every year, the Christian non-profit organization  |Open_Doors|Open_Doors|  publishes the World Watch List – a list of the top 50 countries which it designates as the most dangerous for Christians. The 2018 World Watch List has the following countries as its top ten:  |North_Korea|North_Korea| ,  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| ,  |Somalia|Somalia| ,  |Sudan|Sudan| ,  |Pakistan|Pakistan| ,  |Eritrea|Eritrea| ,  |Libya|Libya| ,  |Iraq|Iraq| ,  |Yemen|Yemen| ,  |Iran|Iran| .

Furthermore, any Muslim person—including any person born into a Muslim family or any person who became a Muslim at a given point in his or her life—who converts to Christianity or re-converts to it, is considered an  |apostate|Apostasy_In_Islam| . Apostasy, the conscious abandonment of Islam by a Muslim in word or deed, including conversion to Christianity, is punishable as a crime under  |applications_of_the_Sharia|Application_Of_Sharia_Law_By_Country|  . There are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith, secretly without declaring his/her apostasy. As a result, they are practising Christians, but they are still legally Muslims, and they can face the death penalty according to the  |Sharia|Sharia| .  |Meriam_Ibrahim|Meriam_Ibrahim| , a Sudanese woman, was sentenced to death for apostasy in 2014, because the government of Sudan classified her as a Muslim, even though she was raised as a Christian. , BBC, 27 May 2014     A report by the international catholic charity organisation  |Aid_to_the_Church_in_Need|Aid_To_The_Church_In_Need|  said that the religiously motivated ethnic cleansing of Christians is so severe that they are set to disappear completely from parts of the Middle-East within a decade. , The Independent, 10 November 2015 , The Daily Mail, 10 November 2015 , Aid to the Church in Need     A report commissioned by the British foreign secretary  |Jeremy_Hunt|Jeremy_Hunt|  and published in May 2019 stated that the level and nature of persecution of Christians in the Middle East is arguably coming close to meeting the international definition of genocide, according to that adopted by the UN.” The report coted Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia where the situation of Christians and other minorities has reached an alarming stage. The report attributed the sources of persecution to both extremist groups and the failure of state institutions.             In  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| ,  |Abdul_Rahman|Abdul_Rahman| , a 41-year-old citizen, was charged in 2006 with rejecting Islam, a crime punishable by death under  |Sharia|Sharia|  law. He has since been released into exile in the West under intense pressure from Western governments.     In 2008, the  |Taliban|Taliban|  killed a British charity worker,  |Gayle_Williams|Gayle_Williams| , because she was working for an organization which was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan even though she was extremely careful not to try to convert Afghans.

They were held for two months and were found dead on 21 May 1996. The circumstances of their kidnapping and death remain controversial; the  |Armed_Islamic_Group|Armed_Islamic_Group|  allegedly took responsibility for both, but the then French military attaché, retired General  |Francois_Buchwalter|Francois_Buchwalter| , reports that they were accidentally killed by the Algerian army in a rescue attempt, and claims have been made that the GIA itself was a  |cats_paw|Wikt_Cats_Paw|  of Algerias secret services .

Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist  |Islamist|Islamist|  groups such as the  |Gamaat_Islamiya|Gamaat_Islamiya|  during the 1980s was accompanied by increased attacks on Copts and on Coptic Orthodox churches; these have since declined with the decline of those organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with the attackers in some of these cases.      There have been periodic acts of violence against Christians since, including attacks on Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria in April 2006,  and sectarian violence in  |Dahshur|Dahshur|  in July 2012.

Although Christians are minority in Indonesia, Christianity is one of the six official religions of Indonesia and religious freedom is permitted. But there are some religious tensions and persecutions in the country, and most of the tensions and persecutions are civil and not by state.     In January 1999  tens of thousands died when Muslim gunmen terrorized Christians who had voted for independence in  |East_Timor|East_Timor| .  These events came toward the end of the  |East_Timor_genocide|East_Timor_Genocide| , which began around 1975.     In  |Indonesia|Indonesia| , religious conflicts have typically occurred in  |Western_New_Guinea|Western_New_Guinea| ,  |Maluku|Maluku_Islands|  , and  |Sulawesi|Sulawesi| . The presence of Muslims in these traditionally Christian regions is in part a result of the  transmigrasi  program of population re-distribution. Conflicts have often occurred because of the aims of radical  |Islamist|Islamist|  organizations such as  |Jemaah_Islamiah|Jemaah_Islamiah|  or  |Laskar_Jihad|Laskar_Jihad|  to impose  |Sharia|Sharia| ,   with such groups attacking Christians and destroying over 600 churches.  In 2005  |three_Christian_girls_were_beheaded|2005_Indonesian_Beheadings_Of_Christian_Girls|  as retaliation for previous Muslim deaths in Christian-Muslim rioting.  The men were imprisoned for the murders, including Jemaah Islamiyahs district ringleader Hasanuddin.  On going to jail, Hasanuddin said, Its not a problem , because this is a part of our struggle.  Later in November 2011, another fight between Christians against Muslims happen in Ambon. Muslims allegedly set fire to several Christian houses, forcing the occupants to leave the buildings.      In December 2011, a second church in  |Bogor|Bogor| ,  |West_Java|West_Java|  was ordered to halt its activities by the local mayor. Another Catholic church had been built there in 2005.

On 30 April 2012, all the 20 churches have been closed down by order, from the Acting Regent which also ordered members of the congregations to tear down the churches by themselves. Most of the churches slated for demolition were built in the 1930s and 1940s. The regency has 2 churches open, both built after 2000.
