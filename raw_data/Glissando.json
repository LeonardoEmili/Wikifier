The latter could thus be thought of as capable of either glissando or portamento , depending on whether the drum was rolled or not. The clarinet gesture that opens  Rhapsody in Blue  could likewise be thought of either way: it was originally planned as a glissando but is in practice played as a portamento though described as a glissando.           The glissando is indicated by following the initial note with a line, sometimes wavy, in the desired direction, often accompanied by the abbreviation gliss..
