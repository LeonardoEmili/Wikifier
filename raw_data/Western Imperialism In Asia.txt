   Western imperialism in Asia as presented in this article pertains to  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe| an entry into what was first called the  |East_Indies|East_Indies| . This was sparked early in the 15th century by the search for  |trade_routes|Trade_Route|  to  |China|China|  that led directly to the  |Age_of_Discovery|Age_Of_Discovery| , and the introduction of  |early_modern_warfare|Early_Modern_Warfare|  into what was then called the  |Far_East|Far_East| . By the early 16th century the  |Age_of_Sail|Age_Of_Sail|  greatly expanded Western European influence and development of the  |Spice_Trade_under_colonialism|Spice_Tradetrade_Under_Colonialism| . There has been a presence of Western European  |colonial_empires|Colonial_Empire|  and  |imperialism|Imperialism|  in Asia throughout six centuries of  |colonialism|Colonialism| , formally ending with the independence of the  |Portuguese_Empires|Portuguese_Empire|  last colony  |East_Timor|East_Timor|  in 2002. The empires introduced Western concepts of  |nation|Nation|  and the  |multinational_state|Multinational_State| . This article attempts to outline the consequent development of the Western concept of the  |nation_state|Nation_State| .     The thrust of European political power, commerce, and culture in Asia gave rise to growing trade in  |commodities|Commodity| —a key development in the rise of todays modern world  |free_market|Capitalism|  economy. In the 16th century, the Portuguese broke the monopoly of the Arabs and Italians of trade between Asia and  |Europe|Europe|  by the  |discovery_of_the_sea_route_to_India|Discovery_Of_The_Sea_Route_To_India|  around the Cape of Good Hope. M. Weisner-Hanks, Early Modern Europe 1450–1789 With the ensuing rise of the rival  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company| , Portuguese influence in Asia was gradually eclipsed. Dutch forces first established independent bases in the East  and then between 1640 and 1660 wrestled  |Malacca|Malacca| ,  |Ceylon|Ceylon| , some southern Indian ports, and the lucrative  |Japan|Japan|  trade from the Portuguese. Later, the English and the French established settlements in  |India|India|  and established a trade with  |China|China|  and their own acquisitions would gradually surpass those of the Dutch. Following the end of the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War|  in 1763, the British eliminated French influence in India and established the  |British_East_India_Company|British_East_India_Company|  as the most important political force on the  |Indian_Subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent| .     Before the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  in the mid-to-late 19th century, demand for oriental goods such as  remained the driving force behind European imperialism, and the Western European stake in Asia remained confined largely to trading stations and strategic outposts necessary to protect trade. Industrialisation, however, dramatically increased European demand for Asian raw materials; and the severe  |Long_Depression|Long_Depression|  of the 1870s provoked a scramble for new markets for European industrial products and financial services in Africa, the Americas, Eastern Europe, and especially in Asia. This scramble coincided with a new era in global  |colonial|Colonialism|  expansion known as the  |New_Imperialism|New_Imperialism|  , which saw a shift in focus from trade and  |indirect_rule|Indirect_Rule|  to formal colonial control of vast overseas territories ruled as political extensions of their mother countries. Between the 1870s and the beginning of  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  in 1914, the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| ,  |France|France| , and the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| —the established colonial powers in Asia—added to their empires vast expanses of territory in the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| , the Indian Subcontinent, and  |South_East_Asia|South_East_Asia| . In the same period, the  |Empire_of_Japan|Empire_Of_Japan| , following the  |Meiji_Restoration|Meiji_Restoration| ; the  |German_Empire|German_Empire| , following the end of the  |Franco-Prussian_War|Franco-Prussian_War|  in 1871;  |Tsarist_Russia|Imperial_Russia| ; and the  |United_States|United_States| , following the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War|  in 1898, quickly emerged as new imperial powers in  |East_Asia|East_Asia|  and in the Pacific Ocean area.     In Asia, World War I and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  were played out as struggles among several key imperial powers—conflicts involving the European powers along with Russia and the rising American and Japanese powers. None of the colonial powers, however, possessed the resources to withstand the strains of both world wars and maintain their direct rule in Asia. Although nationalist movements throughout the colonial world led to the political independence of nearly all of the Asias remaining colonies,  |decolonisation|Decolonisation|  was intercepted by the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| ; and South East Asia,  |South_Asia|South_Asia| , the Middle East, and East Asia remained embedded in a world economic, financial, and military system in which the great powers compete to extend their influence. However, the rapid post-war economic development and rise of the  |industrialized|Industrialized| |developed_countries|Developed_Country|  of  |Taiwan|Taiwan| ,  |Singapore|Singapore| ,  |South_Korea|South_Korea| ,  |Japan|Japan|  and the developing countries of  |India|India| , the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  and its autonomous territory of  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| , along with the collapse of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , have greatly diminished Western  |Europe|Europe| an influence in Asia. The  |United_States|United_States|  remains influential with trade and military bases in Asia.       European exploration of Asia started in  |ancient_Roman|Ancient_Rome|  times along the  |Silk_Road|Silk_Road| . Knowledge of lands as distant as China were held by the Romans. Trade with India through the Roman Egyptian  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  ports was significant in the first centuries of the  |Common_Era|Common_Era| .          In the 13th and 14th centuries, a number of Europeans, many of them Christian  |missionaries|Missionary| , had sought to penetrate into China. The most famous of these travelers was  |Marco_Polo|Marco_Polo| . But these journeys had little permanent effect on East-West trade because of a series of political developments in Asia in the last decades of the 14th century, which put an end to further European exploration of Asia. The  |Yuan_dynasty|Yuan_Dynasty|  in China, which had been receptive to European missionaries and merchants, was overthrown, and the new  |Ming|Ming_Dynasty|  rulers were found to be unreceptive of religious proselytism. Meanwhile, the  |Turks|Turkish_People|  consolidated control over the eastern  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean_Sea| , closing off key overland trade routes. Thus, until the 15th century, only minor trade and cultural exchanges between Europe and Asia continued at certain terminals controlled by Muslim traders.       Western European rulers determined to find new trade routes of their own. The Portuguese spearheaded the drive to find oceanic routes that would provide cheaper and easier access to South and East Asian goods. This chartering of oceanic routes between East and West began with the unprecedented voyages of Portuguese and Spanish sea captains. Their voyages were influenced by medieval European adventurers, who had journeyed overland to the Far East and contributed to geographical knowledge of parts of Asia upon their return.     In 1488,  |Bartolomeu_Dias|Bartolomeu_Dias|  rounded the southern tip of Africa under the sponsorship of Portugals  |John_II|John_Ii_Of_Portugal| , from which point he noticed that the coast swung northeast . While Dias crew forced him to turn back, by 1497, Portuguese navigator  |Vasco_da_Gama|Vasco_Da_Gama|  made the first open voyage from Europe to India. In 1520,  |Ferdinand_Magellan|Ferdinand_Magellan| , a Portuguese navigator in the service of the  |Crown_of_Castile|Crown_Of_Castile|  , found a sea route into the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| .                   In 1509, the Portuguese under  |Francisco_de_Almeida|Francisco_De_Almeida|  won the decisive  |battle_of_Diu|Battle_Of_Diu|  against a joint  |Mamluk|Burji_Dynasty|  and Arab fleet sent to expel the Portuguese of the Arabian Sea. The victory enabled Portugal to implement its strategy of controlling the Indian Ocean.     Early in the 16th century  |Afonso_de_Albuquerque|Afonso_De_Albuquerque|  emerged as the Portuguese colonial viceroy most instrumental in consolidating Portugals holdings in Africa and in Asia. He understood that Portugal could wrest commercial supremacy from the Arabs only by force, and therefore devised a plan to establish forts at strategic sites which would dominate the trade routes and also protect Portuguese interests on land. In 1510, he  |conquered_Goa|Portuguese_Conquest_Of_Goa|  in India, which enabled him to gradually consolidate control of most of the commercial traffic between Europe and Asia, largely through trade; Europeans started to carry on trade from forts, acting as foreign merchants rather than as settlers. In contrast, early European expansion in the  |West_Indies|West_Indies|  ,  following the 1492 voyage of  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| , involved heavy settlement in colonies that were treated as political extensions of the mother countries.     Lured by the potential of high profits from another expedition, the Portuguese established a permanent base in  |Cochin|History_Of_Kochi| , south of the Indian trade port of  |Calicut|History_Of_Kozhikode|  in the early 16th century. In 1510, the Portuguese, led by  |Afonso_de_Albuquerque|Afonso_De_Albuquerque| , seized Goa on the coast of India, which  |Portugal|Portugal|  held until 1961, along with  |Diu|Diu,_India|  and  |Daman|Daman_District,_India|  . The Portuguese soon acquired a monopoly over trade in the Indian Ocean.     Portuguese viceroy Albuquerque resolved to consolidate Portuguese holdings in Africa and Asia, and secure control of trade with the  |East_Indies|East_Indies|  and China. His first objective was  |Malacca|Malacca| , which controlled the narrow strait through which most Far Eastern trade moved.  |Captured_in_1511|Capture_Of_Malacca| , Malacca became the springboard for further eastward penetration, starting with the voyage of  |António_de_Abreu|António_De_Abreu|  and  |Francisco_Serrão|Francisco_Serrão|  in 1512, ordered by Albuquerque, to the Moluccas. Years later the first trading posts were established in the  |Moluccas|Moluccas| , or Spice Islands , which was the source for some of the worlds most hotly demanded spices, and from there, in  |Makassar|Makassar|  and some others, but smaller, in the  |Lesser_Sunda_Islands|Lesser_Sunda_Islands| . By 1513-1516, the first Portuguese ships had reached  |Canton|Guangdong|  on the southern coasts of China.        In 1513, after the failed attempt to conquer  |Aden|Aden| , Albuquerque entered with an armada, for the first time for Europeans by the ocean via, on the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea| ; and in 1515, Albuquerque consolidated the Portuguese hegemony in the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf|  gates, already begun by him in 1507, with the domain of  |Muscat|Muscat,_Oman|  and  |Ormuz|Ormuz| . Shortly after, other fortified bases and forts were annexed and built along the Gulf, and in 1521, through a military campaign, the Portuguese annexed  |Bahrain|Bahrain| .     The Portuguese conquest of Malacca triggered the  |Malayan–Portuguese_war|Malayan–Portuguese_War| . In 1521,  |Ming_dynasty|Ming_Dynasty|  China defeated the Portuguese at the  |Battle_of_Tunmen|Battle_Of_Tunmen|  and then defeated the Portuguese again at the  |Battle_of_Xicaowan|Battle_Of_Xicaowan| . The Portuguese tried to establish trade with China by illegally smuggling with the pirates on the offshore islands off the coast of  |Zhejiang|Zhejiang|  and  |Fujian|Fujian| , but they were driven away by the  |Ming|Ming|  navy in the 1530s-1540s.     In 1557, China decided to lease  |Macau|Portuguese_Macau|  to the Portuguese as a place where they could dry goods they transported on their ships, which they held until 1999. The Portuguese, based at Goa and Malacca, had now established a lucrative maritime empire in the Indian Ocean meant to monopolise the  |spice_trade|Spice_Trade| . The Portuguese also began a channel of trade with the Japanese, becoming the first recorded Westerners to have visited Japan. This contact introduced Christianity and fire-arms into Japan.     In 1505, , the Portuguese, through  |Lourenço_de_Almeida|Lourenço_De_Almeida| , the son of Francisco de Almeida, reached  |Ceylon|Ceylon| . The Portuguese founded a fort at the city of  |Colombo|Colombo|  in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas and inland. In a series of military conflicts and political manoeuvres, the Portuguese extended their control over the  |Sinhalese_kingdoms|Sinhala_Kingdom| , including  |Jaffna|Jaffna_Kingdom|  ,  |Raigama|Kingdom_Of_Raigama|  ,  |Sitawaka|Kingdom_Of_Sitawaka|  , and  |Kotte|Kingdom_Of_Kotte|  - However, the aim of unifying the entire island under Portuguese control faced the  |Kingdom_of_Kandys|Kingdom_Of_Kandy|  fierce resistance.  The Portuguese, led by  |Pedro_Lopes_de_Sousa|Pedro_Lopes_De_Sousa| , launched a full-scale military invasion of the kingdom of Kandy in the  |Campaign_of_Danture|Campaign_Of_Danture|  of 1594. The invasion was a disaster for the Portuguese, with their entire army wiped out by Kandyan  |guerrilla_warfare|Guerrilla_Warfare| .    |Constantino_de_Sá|Constantino_De_Sá_De_Noronha| , romantically celebrated in the 17th century Sinhalese Epic led the last military operation that also ended in disaster. He died in the  |Battle_of_Randeniwela|Battle_Of_Randeniwela| , refusing to abandon his troops in the face of total annihilation.   - Chandra Tilake Edirisuriya Accessed 2015-12-13     The energies of Castile , the other major colonial power of the 16th century, were largely concentrated on the Americas, not South and East Asia, but the Spanish did establish a footing in the Far East in the Philippines. After fighting with the Portuguese by the Spice Islands since 1522 and the agreement between the two powers in 1529 , the Spanish, led by  |Miguel_López_de_Legazpi|Miguel_López_De_Legazpi| , settled and conquered gradually the Philippines since 1564. After the discovery of the return voyage to the Americas by  |Andres_de_Urdaneta|Andres_De_Urdaneta|  in 1565, cargoes of Chinese goods were transported from the  |Philippines|Philippines|  to  |Mexico|Mexico|  and from there to  |Spain|Spain| . By this long route, Spain reaped some of the profits of Far Eastern commerce. Spanish officials converted the islands to Christianity and established some settlements, permanently establishing the Philippines as the area of East Asia most oriented toward the West in terms of culture and commerce. The Moro Muslims fought against the Spanish for over three centuries in the  |Spanish–Moro_conflict|Spanish–Moro_Conflict| .         The lucrative trade was vastly expanded when the Portuguese began to export  |slaves|Slavery|  from Africa in 1541; however, over time, the rise of the slave trade left Portugal over-extended, and vulnerable to competition from other Western European powers. Envious of Portugals control of trade routes, other Western European nations—mainly the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , France, and England—began to send in rival expeditions to Asia. In 1642, the Dutch drove the Portuguese out of the  |Gold_Coast|Gold_Coast|  in Africa, the source of the bulk of Portuguese slave labourers, leaving this rich slaving area to other Europeans, especially the Dutch and the English.     Rival European powers began to make inroads in Asia as the Portuguese and Spanish trade in the Indian Ocean declined primarily because they had become hugely over-stretched financially due to the limitations on their investment capacity and contemporary naval technology. Both of these factors worked in tandem, making control over Indian Ocean trade extremely expensive.     The existing Portuguese interests in Asia proved sufficient to finance further colonial expansion and entrenchment in areas regarded as of greater strategic importance in  |Africa|Africa|  and  |Brazil|Colonial_Brazil| . Portuguese maritime supremacy was lost to the Dutch in the 17th century, and with this came serious challenges for the Portuguese. However, they still clung to Macau, and settled a new colony on the island of  |Timor|Timor| . It was as recent as the 1960s and 1970s that the Portuguese began to relinquish their colonies in Asia. Goa was invaded by India in 1961 and became an Indian state in 1987;  |Portuguese_Timor|Portuguese_Timor|  was abandoned in 1975 and was then invaded by  |Indonesia|Indonesia| . It became an independent country in 2002; and Macau was handed back to the Chinese as per a treaty in 1999.         The arrival of the Portuguese and Spanish and their holy wars against Muslim states in the  |Malayan–Portuguese_war|Malayan–Portuguese_War| ,  |Spanish–Moro_conflict|Spanish–Moro_Conflict|  and  |Castilian_War|Castilian_War|  inflamed religious tensions and turned Southeast Asia into an arena of conflict between Muslims and Christians. The Brunei Sultanates capital at Kota Batu was assaulted by Governor Sande who led the 1578 Spanish attack.      The word savages in Spanish, cafres, was from the word infidel in Arabic - Kafir, and was used by the Spanish to refer to their own christian savages who were arrested in Brunei.   It was said Castilians are kafir, men who have no souls, who are condemned by fire when they die, and that too because they eat pork by the Brunei Sultan after the term accursed doctrine was used to attack Islam by the Spaniards which fed into hatred between Muslims and Christians sparked by their 1571 war against Brunei.  The Sultans words were in response to insults coming from the Spanish at Manila in 1578, other Muslims from Champa, Java, Borneo, Luzon, Pahang, Demak, Aceh, and the Malays echoed the rhetoric of holy war against the Spanish and Iberian Portuguese, calling them kafir enemies which was a contrast to their earlier nuanced views of the Portuguese in the Hikayat Tanah Hitu and Sejarah Melayu.   The war by Spain against Brunei was defended in an apologia written by Doctor De Sande.  The British eventually partitioned and took over Brunei while Sulu was attacked by the British, Americans, and Spanish which caused its breakdown and downfall after both of them thrived from 1500-1900 for four centuries.  Dar al-Islam was seen as under invasion by kafirs by the Atjehnese led by Zayn al-din and by Muslims in the Philippines as they saw the Spanish invasion, since the Spanish brought the idea of a crusader holy war against Muslim Moros just as the Portuguese did in Indonesia and India against what they called Moors in their political and commercial conquests which they saw through the lens of religion in the 16th century.      In 1578, an attack was launched by the Spanish against Jolo, and in 1875 it was destroyed at their hands, and once again in 1974 it was destroyed by the Philippines.  The Spanish first set foot on Borneo in Brunei.      The Spanish war against Brunei failed to conquer Brunei but it totally cut off the Philippines from Bruneis influence, the Spanish then started colonizing Mindanao and building fortresses. In response, the Bisayas, where Spanish forces were stationed, were subjected to retaliatory attacks by the Magindanao in 1599-1600 due to the Spanish attacks on Mindanao.      The Brunei royal family was related to the Muslim Rajahs who in ruled the principality in 1570 of Manila  and this was what the Spaniards came across on their initial arrival to Manila, Spain uprooted Islam out of areas where it was shallow after they began to force Christianity on the Philippines in their conquests after 1521 while Islam was already widespread in the 16th century Philippines.  In the Philippines in the Cebu islands the natives killed the Spanish fleet leader Magellan. Borneos western coastal areas at Landak, Sukadana, and Sambas saw the growth of Muslim states in the sixteenth century, in the 15th century at Nanking, the capital of China, the death and burial of the Borneo Bruneian king Maharaja Kama took place upon his visit to China with Zheng Hes fleet.      The Spanish were expelled from Brunei in 1579 after they attacked in 1578.   There were fifty thousand inhabitants before the 1597 attack by the Spanish in Brunei.       During first contact with China, numerous aggressions and provocations were undertaken by the Portuguese   They believed they could mistreat the non-Christians because they themselves were Christians and acted in the name of their religion in committing crimes and atrocities.   This resulted in the  |Battle_of_Xicaowan|Battle_Of_Xicaowan|  where the local Chinese navy defeated and captured a fleet of Portuguese caravels.                   The Portuguese decline in Asia was accelerated by attacks on their commercial empire by the Dutch and the English, which began a global struggle over empire in Asia that lasted until the end of the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War|  in 1763. The  |Netherlands_revolt_against_Spanish_rule|Dutch_Revolt|  facilitated Dutch encroachment on the Portuguese monopoly over South and East Asian trade. The Dutch looked on Spains trade and colonies as potential spoils of war. When the two crowns of the Iberian peninsula were joined in 1581, the Dutch felt free to attack Portuguese territories in Asia.     By the 1590s, a number of Dutch companies were formed to finance trading expeditions in Asia. Because competition lowered their profits, and because of the doctrines of  |mercantilism|Mercantilism| , in 1602 the companies united into a  |cartel|Cartel|  and formed the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company| , and received from the government the right to trade and colonise territory in the area stretching from the  |Cape_of_Good_Hope|Cape_Of_Good_Hope|  eastward to the  |Strait_of_Magellan|Strait_Of_Magellan| .     In 1605, armed Dutch merchants captured the Portuguese fort at  |Amboyna|Ambon,_Maluku|  in the Moluccas, which was developed into the companys first secure base. Over time, the Dutch gradually consolidated control over the great trading ports of the East Indies. This control allowed the company to monopolise the world  |spice_trade|Spice_Trade|  for decades. Their monopoly over the spice trade became complete after they drove the Portuguese from  |Malacca|Malacca|  in 1641 and  |Ceylon|Ceylon|  in 1658.        Dutch East India Company colonies or outposts were later established in Atjeh , 1667;  |Macassar|Macassar,_Mozambique| , 1669; and  |Bantam|Bantam| , 1682. The company established its headquarters at  |Batavia|Batavia,_Dutch_East_Indies|   on the island of  |Java|Java| . Outside the East Indies, the Dutch East India Company colonies or outposts were also established in  |Persia|Persia|  ,  |Bengal|Bengal|  ,  |Mauritius|Mauritius|  ,  |Siam|Ayutthaya_Kingdom|  ,  |Guangzhou|Guangzhou|  ,  |Taiwan|Taiwan|  , and southern India .     Ming dynasty China defeated the Dutch East India Company in the  |Sino-Dutch_conflicts|Sino-Dutch_Conflicts| . The Chinese first  |defeated_and_drove_the_Dutch_out_of_the_Pescadores_in_1624|Penghuming-Dutch_War| . The Ming navy under  |Zheng_Zhilong|Zheng_Zhilong|  defeated the Dutch East India Companys fleet at the 1633  |Battle_of_Liaoluo_Bay|Battle_Of_Liaoluo_Bay| . In 1662, Zheng Zhilongs son  |Zheng_Chenggong|Koxinga|  expelled the Dutch from Taiwan after defeating them in the  |Siege_of_Fort_Zeelandia|Siege_Of_Fort_Zeelandia| .  Further, the Dutch East India Company trade post on  |Dejima|Dejima|  , an artificial island off the coast of  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki,_Nagasaki| , was for a long time the only place where Europeans could trade with Japan.     The Vietnamese  |Nguyễn_lords|Nguyễn_Lords|  defeated the Dutch  |in_a_naval_battle_in_1643|Trịnh–Nguyễn_Warlater_Campaigns| .     The Cambodians defeated the Dutch in the  |Cambodian–Dutch_War|Cambodian–Dutch_War|  in 1644.     In 1652,  |Jan_van_Riebeeck|Jan_Van_Riebeeck|  established an outpost at the  |Cape_of_Good_Hope|Cape_Of_Good_Hope|   to restock company ships on their journey to East Asia. This post later became a fully-fledged colony, the  |Cape_Colony|Dutch_Cape_Colony|  . As Cape Colony attracted increasing Dutch and European settlement, the Dutch founded the city of Kaapstad .     By 1669, the Dutch East India Company was the richest private company in history, with a huge fleet of merchant ships and warships, tens of thousands of employees, a private army consisting of thousands of soldiers, and a reputation on the part of its stockholders for high dividend payments.             The company was in almost constant conflict with the English; relations were particularly tense following the  |Amboyna_Massacre|Amboyna_Massacre|  in 1623. During the 18th century,  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company|  possessions were increasingly focused on the East Indies. After  |the_fourth_war|Fourth_Anglo-Dutch_War|  between the  |United_Provinces|Dutch_Republic|  and England , the company suffered increasing financial difficulties. In 1799, the company was dissolved, commencing official colonisation of the  |East_Indies|East_Indies| . During the era of New Imperialism the territorial claims of the Dutch East India Company expanded into a fully fledged colony named the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies| . Partly driven by re-newed colonial aspirations of fellow European nation states the Dutch strived to establish unchallenged control of the  |archipelago|Archipelago|  now known as  |Indonesia|Indonesia| .     Six years into formal colonisation of the East Indies, in Europe the  |Dutch_Republic|Dutch_Republic|  was occupied by the French forces of  |Napoleon|Napoleon| . The Dutch government went into exile in England and formally ceded its colonial possessions to Great Britain. The pro-French Governor General of Java  |Jan_Willem_Janssens|Jan_Willem_Janssens| , resisted  |a_British_invasion_force_in_1811|Invasion_Of_Java|  until forced to surrender. British Governor  |Raffles|Stamford_Raffles| , who the later founded the city of  |Singapore|Singapore| , ruled the colony the following 10 years of the British  |interregnum|Interregnum|  .     After the defeat of  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  and the  |Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1814|Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_Of_1814|  colonial government of the East Indies was ceded back to the Dutch in 1817. The loss of South Africa and the continued scramble for Africa stimulated the Dutch to secure unchallenged dominion over its colony in the East Indies. The Dutch started to consolidate its power base through extensive military campaigns and elaborate diplomatic alliances with indigenous rulers ensuring the Dutch  |tricolor|Triband|  was firmly planted in all corners of the  |Archipelago|Archipelago| . These military campaigns included: the  |Padri_War|Padri_War|  , the  |Java_War|Java_War|  and the  |Aceh_War|Aceh_War|  . This raised the need for a considerable military buildup of the colonial army . From all over Europe soldiers were recruited to join the KNIL. Note: In 1819 the standing army consisted of over 7,000 European and 5,000 indigenous troops. See: Willems, Wim Sporen van een Indisch verleden . . Chapter I, P.24      The Dutch concentrated their colonial enterprise in the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies|  throughout the 19th century. The Dutch lost control over the East Indies to the Japanese during much of World War II.  Following the war, the Dutch fought Indonesian independence forces after Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945. In 1949, most of what was known as the Dutch East Indies was ceded to the independent Republic of Indonesia. In 1962, also  |Dutch_New_Guinea|Dutch_New_Guinea|  was annexed by Indonesia de facto ending Dutch imperialism in Asia.              The English sought to stake out claims in India at the expense of the Portuguese dating back to the  |Elizabethan_era|Elizabethan_Era| . In 1600,  |Queen_Elizabeth_I|Elizabeth_I_Of_England|  incorporated the  |English_East_India_Company|British_East_India_Company|  , granting it a monopoly of trade from the Cape of Good Hope eastward to the Strait of Magellan. In 1639, it acquired  |Madras|Madras|  on the east coast of India, where it quickly surpassed Portuguese Goa as the principal European trading centre on the Indian Subcontinent.     Through bribes, diplomacy, and manipulation of weak native rulers, the company prospered in India, where it became the most powerful political force, and outrivaled its Portuguese and French competitors. For more than one hundred years, English and French trading companies had fought one another for supremacy, and, by the middle of the 18th century, competition between the British and the French had heated up. French defeat by the British under the command of  |Robert_Clive|Robert_Clive|  during the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War|  marked the end of the French stake in India.          The British East India Company, although still in direct competition with French and Dutch interests until 1763, was able to extend its control over almost the whole of India in the century following the subjugation of Bengal at the 1757  |Battle_of_Plassey|Battle_Of_Plassey| . The British East India Company made great advances at the expense of a  |Mughal|Mughal_Empire|  dynasty.     The reign of Aurangzeb had marked the height of Mughal power, By 1690. Mughal territorial expansion reached its greatest extent, Aurangzebs Empire encompassed the entire Indian Subcontinent. But this period of power was followed by one of decline. Fifty years after the death of Aurangzeb, the great Mughal empire had crumbled. Meanwhile, marauding warlords, nobles, and others bent on gaining power left the  |Subcontinent|Subcontinent|  increasingly anarchic. Although the Mughals kept the imperial title until 1858, the central government had collapsed, creating a power vacuum.               Aside from defeating the French during the Seven Years War,  |Robert_Clive|Robert_Clive| , the leader of the Company in India, defeated a key Indian ruler of Bengal at the decisive  |Battle_of_Plassey|Battle_Of_Plassey|  , a victory that ushered in the beginning of a new period in Indian history, that of informal British rule. While still nominally the sovereign, the Mughal Indian emperor became more and more of a puppet ruler, and anarchy spread until the company stepped into the role of policeman of India. The transition to formal imperialism, characterised by  |Queen_Victoria|Victoria_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  being crowned Empress of India in the 1870s was a gradual process. The first step toward cementing formal British control extended back to the late 18th century. The British Parliament, disturbed by the idea that a great business concern, interested primarily in profit, was controlling the destinies of millions of people, passed acts in 1773 and 1784 that gave itself the power to control company policies and to appoint the highest company official in India, the  |Governor-General|Governor-General| . By 1818, the East India Company was master of all of India. Some local rulers were forced to accept its overlordship; others were deprived of their territories. Some portions of India were administered by the British directly; in others native dynasties were retained under British supervision.        Until 1858, however, much of India was still officially the dominion of the Mughal emperor. Anger among some social groups, however, was seething under the governor-generalship of  |James_Dalhousie|James_Andrew_Broun-Ramsay,_10Th_Earl_Of_Dalhousie|  , who annexed the  |Punjab|Punjab_Region|  after victory in the  |Second_Sikh_War|Second_Anglo-Sikh_War| , annexed seven princely states using the  |doctrine_of_lapse|Doctrine_Of_Lapse| , annexed the key state of  |Oudh|Oudh|  on the basis of misgovernment, and upset cultural sensibilities by banning Hindu practices such as  |sati|Sati| .     The 1857  |Sepoy_Rebellion|Indian_Mutiny| , or Indian Mutiny, an uprising initiated by Indian troops, called sepoys, who formed the bulk of the Companys armed forces, was the key turning point. Rumour had spread among them that their bullet cartridges were lubricated with pig and cow fat. The cartridges had to be bit open, so this upset the  |Hindu|Hindu|  and  |Muslim|Muslim|  soldiers. The  |Hindu|Hindu|  religion held cows sacred, and for Muslims pork was considered  |haraam|Haraam| . In one camp, 85 out of 90 sepoys would not accept the cartridges from their garrison officer. The British harshly punished those who would not by jailing them. The Indian people were outraged, and on May 10, 1857, sepoys marched to  |Delhi|Delhi| , and, with the help of soldiers stationed there, captured it. Fortunately for the British, many areas remained loyal and quiescent, allowing the revolt to be crushed after fierce fighting. One important consequence of the revolt was the final collapse of the Mughal dynasty. The mutiny also ended the system of dual control under which the British government and the British East India Company shared authority. The government relieved the company of its political responsibilities, and in 1858, after 258 years of existence, the company relinquished its role. Trained civil servants were recruited from graduates of British universities, and these men set out to rule India. Lord Canning , appointed Governor-General of India in 1856, became known as Clemency Canning as a term of derision for his efforts to restrain revenge against the Indians during the Indian Mutiny. When the Government of India was transferred from the Company to the Crown, Canning became the first  |viceroy|Viceroy|  of India.     The Company initiated the first of the  |Anglo-Burmese_wars|Anglo-Burmese_Wars|  in 1824, which led to total annexation of Burma by the Crown in 1885. The  |British_ruled_Burma|British_Rule_In_Burma|  as a  |province_of_British_India|Presidencies_And_Provinces_Of_British_India|  until 1937, then administered her separately under the  |Burma_Office|Burma_Office|  except during the  |Japanese_occupation_of_Burma|Japanese_Occupation_Of_Burma| , 1942–1945, until granted independence on 4 January 1948.           The denial of equal status to Indians was the immediate stimulus for the formation in 1885 of the  |Indian_National_Congress|Indian_National_Congress| , initially loyal to the Empire but committed from 1905 to increased self-government and by 1930 to outright independence. The Home charges , payments transferred from India for administrative costs, were a lasting source of nationalist grievance, though the flow declined in relative importance over the decades to independence in 1947.     Although majority  |Hindu|Hindu|  and minority  |Muslim|Muslim|  political leaders were able to collaborate closely in their criticism of British policy into the 1920s, British support for a distinct Muslim political organisation, the  |Muslim_League|All-India_Muslim_League|  from 1906 and insistence from the 1920s on separate electorates for religious minorities, is seen by many in India as having contributed to Hindu-Muslim discord and the countrys eventual  |Partition|Partition_Of_India| .                France, which had lost its empire to the  |British|Great_Britain|  by the end of the 18th century, had little geographical or commercial basis for expansion in Southeast Asia. After the 1850s, French imperialism was initially impelled by a  |nationalistic|Nationalistic|  need to rival the United Kingdom and was supported intellectually by the notion that French culture was superior to that of the people of  |Annam|Name_Of_Vietnam|  , and its  mission civilisatrice —or its civilizing mission of the Annamese through their assimilation to French culture and the Catholic religion. The pretext for French expansionism in  |Indochina|Indochina|  was the protection of French religious missions in the area, coupled with a desire to find a southern route to China through  |Tonkin|Tonkin| , the European name for a region of northern  |Vietnam|Vietnam| .     French religious and commercial interests were established in Indochina as early as the 17th century, but no concerted effort at stabilizing the French position was possible in the face of British strength in the Indian Ocean and  |French_defeat|Napoleonic_Wars|  in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. A mid-19th century religious revival under the  |Second_Empire|Second_French_Empire|  provided the atmosphere within which interest in Indochina grew. Anti-Christian persecutions in the Far East provided the pretext for the bombardment of Tourane in 1847, and invasion and occupation of Danang in 1857 and Saigon in 1858. Under  |Napoleon_III|Napoleon_Iii| , France decided that French trade with China would be surpassed by the British, and accordingly the French joined the British against China in the  |Second_Opium_War|Second_Opium_War|  from 1857 to 1860, and occupied parts of Vietnam as its gateway to China.     By the  |Treaty_of_Saigon|Treaty_Of_Saigon|  in 1862, on June 5, the Vietnamese emperor ceded France three provinces of southern Vietnam to form the French colony of  |Cochinchina|French_Cochinchina| ; France also secured trade and religious privileges in the rest of Vietnam and a protectorate over Vietnams foreign relations. Gradually French power spread through exploration, the establishment of protectorates, and outright annexations. Their seizure of  |Hanoi|Hanoi|  in 1882 led directly to war with China , and the French victory confirmed French supremacy in the region. France governed  |Cochinchina|French_Cochinchina|  as a direct colony, and central and northern Vietnam under the protectorates of  |Annam|Annam|  and  |Tonkin|Tonkin| , and  |Cambodia|French_Protectorate_Of_Cambodia|  as protectorates in one degree or another.  |Laos|Laos|  too was soon brought under  |French_protection|French_Colonial_Administration_Of_Laos| .     By the beginning of the 20th century, France had created an empire in  |Indochina|Indochina|  nearly 50 percent larger than the mother country. A Governor-General in  |Hanoi|Hanoi|  ruled  |Cochinchina|French_Cochinchina|  directly and the other regions through a system of residents. Theoretically, the French maintained the precolonial rulers and administrative structures in  |Annam|Annam| ,  |Tonkin|Tonkin| ,  |Cochinchina|French_Cochinchina| ,  |Cambodia|French_Protectorate_Of_Cambodia| , and  |Laos|French_Protectorate_Of_Laos| , but in fact the governor-generalship was a centralised fiscal and administrative regime ruling the entire region. Although the surviving native institutions were preserved in order to make French rule more acceptable, they were almost completely deprived of any independence of action. The ethnocentric French colonial administrators sought to assimilate the upper classes into Frances superior culture. While the French improved public services and provided commercial stability, the native standard of living declined and precolonial social structures eroded. Indochina, which had a population of over eighteen million in 1914, was important to France for its  |tin|Tin| ,  |pepper|Black_Pepper| ,  |coal|Coal| ,  |cotton|Cotton| , and  |rice|Rice| . It is still a matter of debate, however, whether the colony was commercially profitable.                 |Tsarist_Russia|Imperial_Russia|  is not often regarded as a colonial power such as the United Kingdom or France because of the manner of Russian expansions: unlike the United Kingdom, which expanded overseas, the Russian empire grew from the centre outward by a process of accretion, like the United States. In the 19th century, Russian expansion took the form of a struggle of an effectively  |landlocked|Landlocked|  country for access to a  |warm_water_port|Warm_Water_Port| .     Qing China defeated Russia in the  |Sino-Russian_border_conflicts|Sino-Russian_Border_Conflicts| .     While the British were consolidating their hold on India, Russian expansion had moved steadily eastward to the Pacific, then toward the Middle East. In the early 19th century it succeeded in conquering the  |South_Caucasus|South_Caucasus|  and  |Dagestan|Dagestan|  from  |Qajar_Iran|Qajar_Iran|  following the  |Russo-Persian_War|Russo-Persian_War| , the  |Russo-Persian_War|Russo-Persian_War|  and the out coming treaties of  |Gulistan|Treaty_Of_Gulistan|  and  |Turkmenchay|Treaty_Of_Turkmenchay| , Allen F. Chew. An Atlas of Russian History: Eleven Centuries of Changing Borders. Yale University Press, 1967. pp 74. giving Russia direct borders with both Persias as well as  |Ottoman_Turkeys|Ottoman_Empire|  heartlands. Later, they eventually reached the frontiers of  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  as well . In response to Russian expansion, the defense of Indias land frontiers and the control of all sea approaches to the  |Subcontinent|Subcontinent|  via the  |Suez_Canal|Suez_Canal| , the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea| , and the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf|  became preoccupations of British foreign policy in the 19th century.     Anglo-Russian rivalry in the Middle East and Central Asia led to a brief confrontation over  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  in the 1870s. In  |Persia|Persia|  , both nations set up banks to extend their economic influence. The United Kingdom went so far as to invade  |Tibet|Tibet| , a land subordinate to the Chinese empire, in 1904, but withdrew when it became clear that Russian influence was insignificant and when Chinese resistance proved tougher than expected.     In 1907, the United Kingdom and  |Russia|Russia|  signed an agreement which — on the surface —ended their rivalry in Central Asia.  As part of the entente, Russia agreed to deal with the sovereign of  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  only through British intermediaries. In turn, the United Kingdom would not annex or occupy  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| . Chinese suzerainty over  |Tibet|Tibet|  also was recognised by both Russia and the United Kingdom, since nominal control by a weak China was preferable to control by either power. Persia was divided into Russian and British spheres of influence and an intervening neutral zone. The United Kingdom and Russia chose to reach these uneasy compromises because of growing concern on the part of both powers over German expansion in strategic areas of China and Africa.     Following the entente, Russia increasingly intervened in Persian domestic politics and suppressed nationalist movements that threatened both  |St._Petersburg|St._Petersburg|  and  |London|London| . After the  |Russian_Revolution|Russian_Revolution_Of_1917| , Russia gave up its claim to a sphere of influence, though  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  involvement persisted alongside the United Kingdoms until the 1940s.     In the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| , in  |Persia|Qajar_Dynasty|  and the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , a German company built a railroad from  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  to  |Baghdad|Baghdad|  and the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf|  in the latter, while it built  |a_railroad|Trans-Iranian_Railway|  from the north of the country to the south, connecting the  |Caucasus|Caucasus|  with the Persian Gulf in the former. Mohammad Gholi Majd. August 1941: The Anglo-Russian Occupation of Iran and Change of Shahs. pp 239–240 University Press of America, 2012   |Germany|Germany|  wanted to gain economic influence in the region and then, perhaps, move on to India. This was met with bitter resistance by the United Kingdom, Russia, and France who divided the region among themselves.               The 16th century brought many  |Jesuit|Jesuit|  missionaries to China, such as  |Matteo_Ricci|Matteo_Ricci| , who established missions where Western science was introduced, and where Europeans gathered knowledge of Chinese society, history, culture, and science. During the 18th century, merchants from Western Europe came to China in increasing numbers. However, merchants were confined to Guangzhou and the Portuguese colony of Macau, as they had been since the 16th century. European traders were increasingly irritated by what they saw as the relatively high customs duties they had to pay and by the attempts to curb the growing import trade in  |opium|Opium| . By 1800, its importation was forbidden by the imperial government. However, the opium trade continued to boom.     Early in the 19th century, serious internal weaknesses developed in the  |Qing_dynasty|Qing_Dynasty|  that left China vulnerable to Western,  |Meiji_period|Meiji_Period|  Japanese, and  |Russian|History_Of_Russia|  imperialism. In 1839, China found itself fighting the  |First_Opium_War|First_Opium_War|  with Britain. China was defeated, and in 1842, signed the provisions of the  |Treaty_of_Nanking|Treaty_Of_Nanking|  which were first of the  |unequal_treaties|Unequal_Treaty|  signed during the Qing Dynasty.  |Hong_Kong_Island|Hong_Kong_Island|  was ceded to Britain, and certain ports, including  |Shanghai|Shanghai|  and  |Guangzhou|Guangzhou| , were opened to British trade and residence. In 1856, the  |Second_Opium_War|Second_Opium_War|  broke out. The Chinese were again defeated, and now forced to the terms of the 1858  |Treaty_of_Tientsin|Treaty_Of_Tientsin| . The treaty opened new ports to trade and allowed foreigners to travel in the interior. In addition, Christians gained the right to propagate their religion. The United States  |Treaty_of_Wanghia|Treaty_Of_Wanghia|  and Russia later obtained the same prerogatives in separate treaties.     Toward the end of the 19th century, China appeared on the way to territorial dismemberment and economic vassalage—the fate of Indias rulers that played out much earlier. Several provisions of these treaties caused long-standing bitterness and humiliation among the Chinese: extraterritoriality , customs regulation, and the right to station foreign warships in Chinese waters, including its navigable rivers.     Jane E. Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic, noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats, buying weapons from Western countries and manufacturing their own at arsenals, such as the  |Hanyang_Arsenal|Hanyang_Arsenal|  during the  |Boxer_Rebellion|Boxer_Rebellion| . In addition, Elliott questioned the claim that Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories, as many Chinese peasants living outside the concessions continued about their daily lives, uninterrupted and without any feeling of humiliation .      Historians have judged the Qing dynastys vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go......In the Arrow War , the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions,  |bluffed_Russia_into_a_peaceful_settlement_of_disputed_frontiers_in_Central_Asia|Treaty_Of_Saint_Petersburg| , and  |defeated_the_French_forces_on_land_in_the_Sino-French_War|Battle_Of_Bang_Bo| . But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.      During the  |Sino-French_War|Sino-French_War| , Chinese forces defeated the French at the  |Battle_of_Cầu_Giấy|Battle_Of_Cầu_Giấy| ,  |Bắc_Lệ_ambush|Bắc_Lệ_Ambush| ,  |Battle_of_Phu_Lam_Tao|Battle_Of_Phu_Lam_Tao| ,  |Battle_of_Zhenhai|Battle_Of_Zhenhai| , the  |Battle_of_Tamsui|Battle_Of_Tamsui|  in the  |Keelung_Campaign|Keelung_Campaign|  and in the last battle which ended the war, the  |Battle_of_Bang_Bo|Battle_Of_Bang_Bo| , which triggered the French  |Retreat_from_Lạng_Sơn|Retreat_From_Lạng_Sơn|  and resulted in the collapse of the French  |Jules_Ferry|Jules_Ferry|  government in the  |Tonkin_Affair|Tonkin_Affair| .     The Qing dynasty forced Russia to hand over disputed territory in Ili in the  |Treaty_of_Saint_Petersburg|Treaty_Of_Saint_Petersburg| , in what was widely seen by the west as a diplomatic victory for the Qing.  Russia acknowledged that Qing China potentially posed a serious military threat.  Mass media in the west during this era portrayed China as a rising military power due to its modernization programs and as a major threat to the western world, invoking fears that China would successfully conquer western colonies like Australia.      The British observer Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger suggested a British-Chinese alliance to check Russian expansion in Central Asia.     During the Ili crisis when Qing China threatened to go to war against Russia over the Russian occupation of Ili, the British officer  |Charles_George_Gordon|Charles_George_Gordon|  was sent to China by Britain to advise China on military options against Russia should a potential war break out between China and Russia.      The Russians observed the Chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the Ili crisis, the Chinese bought thousands of rifles from Germany.  In 1880, massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe.      The Russian military observer D. V. Putiatia visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China along the Chinese-Russian border, the Chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at European tactics under certain circumstances, and the Chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles.      Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.      Russian sinologists, the Russian media, threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in St Petersburg, and return most of Ili to China.         The rise of Japan since the  |Meiji_Restoration|Meiji_Restoration|  as an imperial power led to further subjugation of China. In a dispute over Chinas longstanding claim of suzerainty in  |Korea|Korea| , war broke out between China and Japan, resulting in humiliating defeat for the Chinese. By the  |Treaty_of_Shimonoseki|Treaty_Of_Shimonoseki|  , China was forced to recognize effective Japanese rule of Korea and Taiwan was ceded to Japan until its recovery in 1945 at the end of the WWII by the Republic of China.     Chinas defeat at the hands of  |Japan|Japan|  was another trigger for future aggressive actions by Western powers. In 1897,  |Germany|Germany|  demanded and was given a set of exclusive mining and railroad rights in  |Shandong|Shandong|  province. Russia obtained access to  |Dairen|Dairen|  and  |Port_Arthur|Lüshunkou|  and the right to build a railroad across Manchuria, thereby achieving complete domination over a large portion of northwestern China. The United Kingdom and France also received a number of  |concessions|Concession| . At this time, much of China was divided up into spheres of influence : Germany dominated  |Jiaozhou_Bay|Jiaozhou_Bay| ,  |Shandong|Shandong| , and the  |Yellow_River|Yellow_River|  valley; Russia dominated the  |Liaodong_Peninsula|Liaodong_Peninsula|  and Manchuria; the United Kingdom dominated  |Weihaiwei|Weihaiwei_Under_British_Rule|  and the  |Yangtze|Yangtze_River|  Valley; and France dominated the  |Guangzhou_Bay|Guangzhou_Bay|  and several other southern provinces.        China continued to be divided up into these spheres until the United States, which had no sphere of influence, grew alarmed at the possibility of its businessmen being excluded from Chinese markets. In 1899,  |Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| |John_Hay|John_Hay|  asked the major powers to agree to a policy of equal trading privileges. In 1900, several powers agreed to the U.S.-backed scheme, giving rise to the  |Open_Door|Open_Door_Policy|  policy, denoting freedom of commercial access and non-annexation of Chinese territory. In any event, it was in the European powers interest to have a weak but independent Chinese government. The privileges of the Europeans in China were guaranteed in the form of treaties with the Qing government. In the event that the Qing government totally collapsed, each power risked losing the privileges that it already had negotiated.     The erosion of Chinese sovereignty and seizures of land from Chinese by foreigners contributed to a spectacular anti-foreign outbreak in June 1900, when the  |Boxers|Fists_Of_Righteous_Harmony|  attacked foreigners around  |Beijing|Beijing| . The Imperial Court was divided into anti-foreign and pro-foreign factions, with the pro-foreign faction led by  |Ronglu|Ronglu|  and  |Prince_Qing|Prince_Qing|  hampering any military effort by the anti-foreign faction led by  |Prince_Duan|Prince_Duan|  and  |Dong_Fuxiang|Dong_Fuxiang| . The Qing Empress Dowager ordered all diplomatic ties to be cut off and all foreigners to leave the legations in Beijing to go to  |Tianjin|Tianjin| . The foreigners refused to leave.  |Fueled_by_entirely_false_reports_that_the_foreigners_in_the_legations_were_massacred|Siege_Of_The_International_Legationsfalse_Propaganda| , the  |Eight-Nation_Alliance|Eight-Nation_Alliance|  decided to launch an expedition on Beijing to reach the legations but they underestimated the Qing military. The Qing and Boxers defeated the foreigners at the  |Seymour_Expedition|Seymour_Expedition| , forcing them to turn back at the  |Battle_of_Langfang|Battle_Of_Langfang| . In response to the foreign attack  |on_Dagu_Forts|Battle_Of_Dagu_Forts|  the Qing responded by declaring war against the foreigners. the Qing forces and foreigners fought a fierce battle at the  |Battle_of_Tientsin|Battle_Of_Tientsin|  before the foreigners could launch a second expedition. On their second try  |Gaselee_Expedition|Gaselee_Expedition| , with a much larger force, the foreigners managed to reach Beijing and fight the  |Battle_of_Peking|Battle_Of_Peking| . British and French forces looted, plundered and burned the  |Old_Summer_Palace|Old_Summer_Palace|  to the ground for the second time . German forces were particularly severe in exacting revenge for the killing of their ambassador due to the orders of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who held anti-Asian sentiments, while Russia tightened its hold on Manchuria in the northeast until its crushing defeat by Japan in the war of 1904–1905. The Qing court evacuated to  |Xian|Xian|  and threatened to continue the war against foreigners, until the foreigners tempered their demands in the  |Boxer_Protocol|Boxer_Protocol| , promising that China would not have to give up any land and gave up the demands for the execution of Dong Fuxiang and Prince Duan.     The correspondent Douglas Story observed Chinese troops in 1907 and praised their abilities and military skill.      Extraterritorial jurisdiction was abandoned by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1943.  |Chiang_Kai-shek_forced_the_French_to_hand_over|Chiang_Kai-Shekrefusal_Of_French_Indochina|  all their concessions back to China control after World War II. Foreign political control over leased parts of China ended with the incorporation of Hong Kong and the small Portuguese territory of Macau into the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|China|  in 1997 and 1999 respectively.               Some Americans in the Nineteenth Century advocated for the annexation of Taiwan from China.    |Aboriginals_on_Taiwan|Taiwanese_Aborigines|  often attacked and massacred shipwrecked western sailors.     In 1867, during the  |Rover_incident|Rover_Incident| ,  |Taiwanese_aborigines|Taiwanese_Aborigines|  attacked shipwrecked American sailors, killing the entire crew.  They subsequently defeated a retaliatory  |expedition_by_the_American_military|Formosa_Expedition|  and killed another American during the battle.      As the United States emerged as a new imperial power in the Pacific and Asia, one of the two oldest Western imperialist powers in the regions,  |Spain|Spain| , was finding it increasingly difficult to maintain control of territories it had held in the regions since the 16th century. In 1896, a widespread revolt against Spanish rule broke out in the Philippines. Meanwhile, the recent string of U.S. territorial gains in the Pacific posed an even greater threat to Spains remaining colonial holdings.     As the U.S. continued to expand its economic and military power in the Pacific, it declared war against Spain in 1898. During the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| , U.S. Admiral Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet at  |Manila|Manila|  and U.S. troops landed in the Philippines. Spain later agreed by treaty to cede the Philippines in Asia and  |Guam|Guam|  in the Pacific. In the Caribbean, Spain ceded  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico|  to the U.S. The war also marked the end of Spanish rule in Cuba, which was to be granted nominal independence but remained heavily influenced by the U.S. government and U.S. business interests. One year following its treaty with Spain, the U.S. occupied the small Pacific outpost of  |Wake_Island|Wake_Island| .     The Filipinos, who assisted U.S. troops in fighting the Spanish, wished to establish an independent state and, on June 12, 1898,  |declared_independence|Philippine_Declaration_Of_Independence|  from Spain. In 1899, fighting between the Filipino nationalists and the U.S. broke out; it took the U.S. almost fifteen years to fully subdue the  |insurgency|Philippine–American_War| . The U.S. sent 70,000 troops and suffered thousands of casualties. The Filipinos insurgents, however, suffered considerably higher casualties than the Americans. Most casualties in the war were civilians dying primarily from disease.      U.S. attacks into the countryside often included scorched earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed, and concentrated civilians into camps known as protected zones . Most of these civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine. Reports of the execution of U.S. soldiers taken prisoner by the Filipinos led to disproportionate reprisals by American forces.     The Moro Muslims fought against the Americans in the  |Moro_Rebellion|Moro_Rebellion| .     In 1914,  |Dean_C._Worcester|Dean_C._Worcester| , U.S. Secretary of the Interior for the Philippines described the regime of civilisation and improvement which started with American occupation and resulted in developing naked savages into cultivated and educated men . Nevertheless, some Americans, such as  |Mark_Twain|Mark_Twain| , deeply opposed American involvement/imperialism in the Philippines, leading to the abandonment of attempts to construct a permanent U.S. naval base and using it as an entry point to the Chinese market. In 1916, Congress guaranteed the independence of the Philippines by 1945.       World War I brought about the fall of several empires in Europe. This had repercussions around the world. The defeated  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  included  |Germany|Germany|  and the  |Turkish|Turkish_People| |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| .  |Germany|Germany|  lost all of its colonies in Asia. German New Guinea, a part of  |Papua_New_Guinea|Papua_New_Guinea| , became administered by  |Australia|Australia| . German possessions and concessions in China, including  |Qingdao|Qingdao| , became the subject of a controversy during the  |Paris_Peace_Conference|Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919|  when the  |Beiyang_government|Beiyang_Government|  in China agreed to cede these interests to  |Japan|Japan| , to the anger of many Chinese people. Although the Chinese diplomats refused to sign the agreement, these interests were ceded to  |Japan|Japan|  with the support of the United States and the United Kingdom.      |Turkey|Turkey|  gave up her provinces;  |Syria|Syria| ,  |Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine| , and  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|   came under French and British control as  |League_of_Nations_Mandates|League_Of_Nations_Mandates| . The discovery of  |petroleum|Petroleum|  first in  |Iran|Iran|  and then in the Arab lands in the interbellum provided a new focus for activity on the part of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.               In 1641, all Westerners were thrown out of Japan. For the next two centuries, Japan was free from Western contact, except for at the port of  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki,_Nagasaki| , which Japan allowed Dutch merchant vessels to enter on a limited basis.     Japans freedom from Western contact ended on 8 July 1853, when  |Commodore_Matthew_Perry|Matthew_Perry|  of the  |U.S._Navy|U.S._Navy|  sailed a squadron of black-hulled warships into  |Edo|Edo|   harbor. The Japanese told Perry to sail to  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki,_Nagasaki|  but he refused. Perry sought to present a letter from U.S. President  |Millard_Fillmore|Millard_Fillmore|  to the emperor which demanded concessions from Japan. Japanese authorities responded by stating that they could not present the letter directly to the emperor, but scheduled a meeting on July 14 with a representative of the emperor. On 14 July, the squadron sailed towards the shore, giving a demonstration of their cannons firepower thirteen times. Perry landed with a large detachment of Marines and presented the emperors representative with Fillmores letter. Perry said he would return, and did so, this time with even more war ships. The U.S. show of force led to Japans concession to the  |Convention_of_Kanagawa|Convention_Of_Kanagawa|  on 31 March 1854. This treaty conferred extraterritoriality on American nationals, as well as, opening up further treaty ports beyond Nagasaki. This treaty was followed up by similar treaties with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia and France. These events made Japanese authorities aware that the country was lacking technologically and needed the strength of industrialism in order to keep their power. This realisation eventually led to a civil war and political reform known the  |Meiji_Restoration|Meiji_Restoration| .     The  |Meiji_Restoration|Meiji_Restoration|  of 1868 led to administrative overhaul, deflation and subsequent rapid economic development. Japan had limited natural resources of her own and sought both overseas markets and sources of raw materials, fuelling a drive for imperial conquest which began with the defeat of China in 1895.        Taiwan, ceded by  |Qing_dynasty|Qing_Dynasty|  China, became the first Japanese colony. In 1899, Japan won agreements from the  |great_powers|Great_Powers|  to abandon extraterritoriality for their citizens, and an alliance with the United Kingdom established it in 1902 as an international power. Its spectacular defeat of Russias navy in 1905 gave it the southern half of the island of  |Sakhalin|Sakhalin| ; exclusive Japanese influence over Korea ; the former Russian lease of the  |Liaodong_Peninsula|Liaodong_Peninsula|  with Port Arthur ; and extensive rights in Manchuria .     The Empire of Japan and the  |Joseon_Dynasty|Joseon_Dynasty|  in Korea formed bilateral diplomatic relations in 1876. China lost its suzerainty of Korea after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Russia also lost influence on the Korean peninsula with the  |Treaty_of_Portsmouth|Treaty_Of_Portsmouth|  as a result of the  |Russo-Japanese_war|Russo-Japanese_War|  in 1904. The Joseon Dynasty became increasingly dependent on Japan. Korea became a protectorate of Japan with the  |Japan–Korea_Treaty_of_1905|Japan–Korea_Treaty_Of_1905| . Korea was then de jure annexed to Japan with the  |Japan–Korea_Treaty_of_1910|Japan–Korea_Treaty_Of_1910| .     Japan was now one of the most powerful forces in the  |Far_East|Far_East| , and in 1914, it entered World War I on the side of the Allies, seizing German-occupied  |Kiaochow|Jiaozhou_Bay|  and subsequently demanding Chinese acceptance of Japanese political influence and territorial acquisitions .  |Mass_protests_in_Peking|May_Fourth_Movement|  in 1919 coupled with Allied opinion led to Japans abandonment of most of the demands and Joseons 1922 return to China. Japan received the German territory from the Treaty of Versailles, 1919, sparking widespread Chinese nationalism.     Tensions with China increased over the 1920s, and in 1931 Japanese army units based in Manchuria seized control of the region without direction from Tokyo. Intermittent conflict with China led to full-scale war in mid-1937, drawing Japan toward an overambitious bid for Asian hegemony , which ultimately led to defeat and the loss of all its overseas territories after World War II .           In the aftermath of World War II, European colonies, controlling more than one billion people throughout the world, still ruled most of the Middle East, South East Asia, and the Indian Subcontinent. However, the image of European pre-eminence was shattered by the wartime Japanese occupations of large portions of British, French, and Dutch territories in the Pacific. The destabilisation of European rule led to the rapid growth of nationalist movements in Asia—especially in Indonesia,  |Malaya|British_Malaya| ,  |Burma|Myanmar| , and  |French_Indochina|French_Indochina|  .        The war, however, only accelerated forces already in existence undermining Western imperialism in Asia. Throughout the colonial world, the processes of urbanisation and capitalist investment created professional merchant classes that emerged as new Westernised elites. While imbued with Western political and economic ideas, these classes increasingly grew to resent their unequal status under European rule.       In India, the westward movement of Japanese forces towards Bengal during World War II had led to major concessions on the part of British authorities to Indian nationalist leaders. In 1947, the United Kingdom, devastated by war and embroiled in economic crisis at home, granted  |British_India|British_India|  its independence as two nations:  |India|India|  and  |Pakistan|Pakistan| . Myanmar  and  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka|  , which is also part of British India, also gained their independence from the United Kingdom the following year, in 1948. In the Middle East, the United Kingdom granted independence to  |Jordan|Jordan|  in 1946 and two years later, in 1948, ended its mandate of  |Palestine|Palestine|  becoming the independent nation of  |Israel|Israel| .   Following the end of the war, nationalists in Indonesia demanded complete independence from the Netherlands. A brutal conflict ensued, and finally, in 1949, through  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  mediation, the Dutch East Indies achieved independence, becoming the new nation of Indonesia. Dutch imperialism moulded this new multi-ethnic state comprising roughly 3,000 islands of the Indonesian archipelago with a population at the time of over 100 million.     The end of Dutch rule opened up latent tensions between the roughly 300 distinct ethnic groups of the islands, with the major ethnic fault line being between the  |Javanese|Javanese_People|  and the non-Javanese.      |Netherlands_New_Guinea|Netherlands_New_Guinea|  was under the Dutch administration until 1962 .       In the Philippines, the U.S. remained committed to its previous pledges to grant the islands their independence, and the Philippines became the first of the Western-controlled Asian colonies to be granted independence post-World War II. However, the Philippines remained under pressure to adopt a political and economic system similar to their old imperial master.     This aim was greatly complicated by the rise of new political forces. During the war, the  Hukbalahap  , which had strong ties to the  |Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines|Communist_Party_Of_The_Philippines|  , fought against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines and won strong popularity among many sectors of the Filipino working class and peasantry. In 1946, the PKP participated in elections as part of the Democratic Alliance. However, with the onset of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , its growing political strength drew a reaction from the ruling government and the United States, resulting in the repression of the PKP and its associated organisations. In 1948, the PKP began organizing an armed struggle against the government and continued U.S. military presence. In 1950, the PKP created the Peoples Liberation Army , which mobilised thousands of troops throughout the islands. The insurgency lasted until 1956, when the PKP gave up armed struggle.     In 1968, the PKP underwent a split, and in 1969 the  |Maoist|Maoist|  faction of the PKP created the  |New_Peoples_Army|New_Peoples_Army| . Maoist rebels re-launched an armed struggle against the government and the U.S. military presence in the Philippines, which continues to this day.            France remained determined to retain its control of  |Indochina|Indochina| . However, in  |Hanoi|Hanoi| , in 1945, a broad front of nationalists and communists led by  |Ho_Chi_Minh|Ho_Chi_Minh|  declared an independent Republic of Vietnam, commonly referred to as the  |Viet_Minh|Viet_Minh|  regime by Western outsiders. France, seeking to regain control of Vietnam, countered with a vague offer of self-government under French rule. Frances offers were unacceptable to Vietnamese nationalists; and in December 1946 the Việt Minh launched a rebellion against the French authority governing the colonies of French Indochina. The first few years of the war involved a low-level rural insurgency against French authority. However, after the Chinese communists reached the Northern border of Vietnam in 1949, the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies equipped with modern weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union. Fall, Street Without Joy, p. 17. Meanwhile, the France granted the  |State_of_Vietnam|State_Of_Vietnam|  based in  |Saigon|Saigon|  independence in 1949 while  |Laos|Laos|  and  |Cambodia|Cambodia|  received independence in 1953. The US recognized the regime in Saigon, and provided the French military effort with military aid.     Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the French war against the Viet Minh continued for nearly eight years. The French were gradually worn down by guerrilla and jungle fighting. The turning point for France occurred at  |Dien_Bien_Phu|Dien_Bien_Phu|  in 1954, which resulted in the surrender of ten thousand French troops.  |Paris|Paris|  was forced to accept a political settlement that year at the  |Geneva_Conference|Geneva_Conference| , which led to a precarious set of agreements regarding the future political status of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
