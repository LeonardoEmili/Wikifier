        In  |probability_theory|Probability_Theory| , the expected value of a  |random_variable|Random_Variable|  is a key aspect of its  |probability_distribution|Probability_Distribution| . Intuitively, a random variables expected value represents the average of a large number of independent realizations of the random variable. For example, the expected value of rolling a six-sided  |d_i_e|Dice|  is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers that come up converges to 3.5 as the number of rolls  |approaches|Law_Of_Large_Numbers|  infinity . The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, mean, or first moment.     A bit more formally, the expected value of a  |discrete_random_variable|Discrete_Random_Variable|  is the  |probability-weighted_average|Weighted_Average|  of all its possible values. In other words, each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value. The same principle applies to an  |absolutely_continuous|Absolute_Continuityabsolute_Continuity_Of_Measures|  random variable, except that an  |integral|Lebesgue_Integral|  of the variable with respect to its  |probability_density|Probability_Density_Function|  replaces the sum. The formal definition subsumes both of these and also works for distributions which are neither discrete nor absolutely continuous; the expected value of a random variable is the integral of the random variable with respect to its  |probability_measure|Probability_Measure| .       The expectation of a random variable plays an important role in a variety of contexts. For example, in  |decision_theory|Decision_Theory| , an agent making an optimal choice in the context of incomplete information is often assumed to  |maximize|Expected_Utility_Maximization|  the expected value of their  |utility_function|Von_Neumann–Morgenstern_Utility_Function| .   For a different example, in  |statistics|Statistics| , where one seeks estimates for unknown parameters based on available data, the estimate itself is a random variable. In such settings, a desirable criterion for a good estimator is that it is  |unbiased|Unbiased_Estimator|  – that is, the expected value of the estimate is equal to the true value of the underlying parameter.               The idea of the expected value originated in the middle of the 17th century from the study of the so-called  |problem_of_points|Problem_Of_Points| , which seeks to divide the stakes in a fair way between two players who have to end their game before its properly finished. This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to  |Blaise_Pascal|Blaise_Pascal|  by French writer and amateur mathematician  |Chevalier_de_Méré|Antoine_Gombaud| . Méré claimed that this problem couldnt be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to  |Pierre_de_Fermat|Pierre_De_Fermat| . Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively. However, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.      Three years later, in 1657, a Dutch mathematician  |Christiaan_Huygens|Christiaan_Huygens| , who had just visited Paris, published a treatise  De ratiociniis in ludo aleæ on probability theory. In this book he considered the problem of points and presented a solution based on the same principle as the solutions of Pascal and Fermat. Huygens also extended the concept of expectation by adding rules for how to calculate expectations in more complicated situations than the original problem . In this sense this book can be seen as the first successful attempt at laying down the foundations of the  |theory_of_probability|Theory_Of_Probability| .     In the foreword to his book, Huygens wrote: It should be said, also, that for some time some of the best mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for me for this reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally I have found that my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs. . Thus, Huygens learned about  |de_Mérés_Problem|De_Mérés_Problem|  in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascals; so that before his book went to press in 1657 he knew about Pascals priority in this subject.       Neither Pascal nor Huygens used the term expectation in its modern sense. In particular, Huygens writes: That my Chance or Expectation to win any thing is worth just such a Sum, as woud procure me in the same Chance and Expectation at a fair Lay. ... If I expect a or b, and have an equal Chance of gaining them, my Expectation is worth . More than a hundred years later, in 1814,  |Pierre-Simon_Laplace|Pierre-Simon_Laplace|  published his tract Théorie analytique des probabilités , where the concept of expected value was defined explicitly:          The use of the letter E to denote expected value goes back to  |W._A._Whitworth|William_Allen_Whitworth|  in 1901, Whitworth, W.A. Choice and Chance with One Thousand Exercises. Fifth edition. Deighton Bell, Cambridge. who used a script E. The symbol has become popular since for English writers it meant Expectation , for Germans Erwartungswert , for Spanish Esperanza matemática and for French Espérance mathématique .            Let X be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes x1, x2,   xk occurring with probabilities p1, p2,   pk, respectively. The expectation of X is defined as     :     xi  + x2p2 +   + xkpk.     Since all probabilities pi add up to 1 , the expected value is the  |weighted_average|Weighted_Average| , with pi ’s being the weights.     If all outcomes xi are  |equiprobable|Equiprobable|  , then the weighted average turns into the simple  |average|Arithmetic_Mean| . If the outcomes xi are not equiprobable, then the simple average must be replaced with the weighted average, which takes into account the fact that some outcomes are more likely than the others.            Let X represent the outcome of a roll of a fair six-sided . More specifically, X will be the number of  |pips|Pip|  showing on the top face of the  after the toss. The possible values for X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all of which are equally likely with a probability of . The expectation of X is   ::   1  + 2  + 3  + 4  + 5  + 6  3.5.     :If one rolls the  n times and computes the average  of the results, then as n grows, the average will  |almost_surely|Almost_Surely| |converge|Convergent_Sequence|  to the expected value, a fact known as the  |strong_law_of_large_numbers|Strong_Law_Of_Large_Numbers| .     The  |roulette|Roulette|  game consists of a small ball and a wheel with 38 numbered pockets around the edge. As the wheel is spun, the ball bounces around randomly until it settles down in one of the pockets. Suppose random variable X represents the outcome of a $1 bet on a single number . If the bet wins , the payoff is $35; otherwise the player loses the bet. The expected profit from such a bet will be   ::   -      +       -      :That is, the bet of $1 stands to lose -  , so its expected value is -        Intuitively, the expectation of a random variable taking values in a countable set of outcomes is defined analogously as the weighted sum of the outcome values, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of realizing that value. However, convergence issues associated with the infinite sum necessitate a more careful definition. A rigorous definition first defines expectation of a non-negative random variable, and then adapts it to general random variables.     Let X be a non-negative random variable with a countable set of outcomes x1, x2,   occurring with probabilities p1, p2,   respectively. Analogous to the discrete case, the expected value of X is then defined as the series   :     xi  pi.   Note that since xi pi   0 , the infinite sum is well-defined and does not depend on the  |order|Absolute_Convergence|  in which it is computed. Unlike the discrete case, the expectation here can be equal to infinity, if the infinite sum above increases without bound.     For a general random variable X that need not be non-negative, first define X+   and X-   . Observe that X X+ - X- , and both X+ and X- are non-negative random variables. Hence,   and   are well-defined . Then, we define   as follows:   :         -   &      .
