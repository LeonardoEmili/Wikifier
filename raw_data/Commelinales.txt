     Commelinales is the  |botanical_name|Botanical_Name|  of an order of  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plant| . It comprises five families:  |Commelinaceae|Commelinaceae| ,  |Haemodoraceae|Haemodoraceae| ,  |Hanguanaceae|Hanguanaceae| ,  |Philydraceae|Philydraceae| , and  |Pontederiaceae|Pontederiaceae| . All the families combined contain over 885 species in about 70  |genera|Genus| ; the majority of species are in the  |Commelinaceae|Commelinaceae| . Plants in the order share a number of  |synapomorphies|Synapomorphy|  that tie them together, such as a lack of  |mycorrhizal_associations|Mycorrhiza|  and  |tapetal|Tapetum| |_raphides|Raphides| . Estimates differ as to when the Comminales evolved, but most suggest an origin and diversification sometime during the mid- to late  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous| . Depending on the methods used, studies suggest a range of origin between 123 and 73 million years, with diversification occurring within the group 110 to 66 million years ago. The orders closest relatives are in the  |Zingiberales|Zingiberales| , which includes  |ginger|Ginger| ,  |bananas|Banana| ,  |cardamom|Cardamom| , and others. Stevens, P. F. . Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, November 2011.       According to the most recent classification scheme, the  |APG_IV|Apg_Iv_System|  of 2016, the order includes five families:    |Commelinaceae|Commelinaceae| |_Haemodoraceae|Haemodoraceae| |_Hanguanaceae|Hanguanaceae| |_Philydraceae|Philydraceae| |_Pontederiaceae|Pontederiaceae|      This is unchanged from the  |APG_III|Apg_Iii_System|  of 2009 and the  |APG_II|Apg_Ii_System|  of 2003, but different from the older  |APG_system|Apg_System|  of 1998, which did not include  |Hanguanaceae|Hanguanaceae| .       The older  |Cronquist_system|Cronquist_System|  of 1981, which was based purely on morphological data, placed the order in subclass  |Commelinidae|Commelinidae|  of class  |Liliopsida|Liliopsida|  and included the families  |Commelinaceae|Commelinaceae| ,  |Mayacaceae|Mayacaceae| ,  |Rapateaceae|Rapateaceae|  and  |Xyridaceae|Xyridaceae| . These families are now known to be only distantly related.   In the classification system of  |Dahlgren|Rolf_Dahlgren|  the Commelinales were one of four orders in the  |superorder|Superorder|  Commeliniflorae , and contained five families, of which only Commelinaceae has been retained by the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group| .
