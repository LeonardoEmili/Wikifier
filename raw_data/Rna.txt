           Ribonucleic acid  is a  |polymer|Polymer| ic molecule essential in various biological roles in  |coding|Genetic_Code| ,  |decoding|Translation| ,  |regulation|Regulatory_Rna|  and  |expression|Rna_Splicing|  of  |genes|Gene| . RNA and  |DNA|Dna|  are  |nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid| , and, along with  |lipids|Lipid| ,  |proteins|Protein|  and  |carbohydrates|Carbohydrate| , constitute the four major  |macromolecules|Macromolecule|  essential for all known forms of  |life|Life| . Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of  |nucleotides|Nucleotide| , but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use  |messenger_RNA|Messenger_Rna|   to convey genetic information  that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many  |virus|Virus| es encode their genetic information using an RNA  |genome|Genome| .     Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling  |gene_expression|Gene_Expression| , or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is  |protein_synthesis|Protein_Biosynthesis| , a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on  |ribosomes|Ribosome| . This process uses  |transfer_RNA|Transfer_Rna|   molecules to deliver  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  to the ribosome, where  |ribosomal_RNA|Ribosomal_Rna|   then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.            The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of  |DNA|Dna| , but differs in three primary ways:   Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is a single-stranded molecule  in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides.  However, a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in tRNA.   While the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA contains  deoxyribose , RNA contains  ribose  instead.  Ribose has a  |hydroxyl|Hydroxy_Group|  group attached to the pentose ring in the  |2|Nucleic_Acid_Nomenclature|  position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically  |labile|Lability|  than DNA by lowering the  |activation_energy|Activation_Energy|  of  |hydrolysis|Hydrolysis| .   The complementary base to  |adenine|Adenine|  in DNA is  |thymine|Thymine| , whereas in RNA, it is  |uracil|Uracil| , which is an  |unmethylated|Methylation|  form of thymine.       Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including  |mRNA|Mrna| ,  |tRNA|Trna| ,  |rRNA|Rrna| ,  |snRNAs|Snrna| , and other  |non_coding_RNAs|Non_Coding_Rna| , contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold  and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.   In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical  |catalysis|Catalysis|  .  For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome—an RNA-protein complex that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.              Each  |nucleotide|Nucleotide|  in RNA contains a  |ribose|Ribose|  sugar, with carbons numbered 1 through 5. A base is attached to the 1 position, in general,  |adenine|Adenine|  ,  |cytosine|Cytosine|  ,  |guanine|Guanine|  , or  |uracil|Uracil|  . Adenine and guanine are  |purines|Purine| , cytosine and uracil are  |pyrimidines|Pyrimidine| . A  |phosphate|Phosphate|  group is attached to the 3 position of one ribose and the 5 position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each, making RNA a charged molecule . The bases form  |hydrogen_bonds|Hydrogen_Bond|  between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil. However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge,    or the GNRA  |tetraloop|Tetraloop|  that has a guanine–adenine base-pair.         An important structural component of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a  |hydroxyl|Hydroxyl|  group at the 2 position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to mostly take the  |A_form_geometry|A_Dna| ,  although in single strand dinucleotide contexts, RNA can rarely also adopt the B-form most commonly observed in DNA.  The A-form geometry results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove.  A second consequence of the presence of the 2-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule , it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.         RNA is transcribed with only four bases ,  but these bases and attached sugars can be modified in numerous ways as the RNAs mature.  |Pseudouridine|Pseudouridine|  , in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and  |ribothymidine|5_Methyluridine|  are found in various places .  Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose  |nucleoside|Nucleoside|  is called  |inosine|Inosine|  . Inosine plays a key role in the  |wobble_hypothesis|Wobble_Hypothesis|  of the  |genetic_code|Genetic_Code| .      There are more than 100 other naturally occurring modified nucleosides.  The greatest structural diversity of modifications can be found in  |tRNA|Trna| ,  while pseudouridine and nucleosides with  |2_O_methylribose|2_O_Methylation|  often present in rRNA are the most common.  The specific roles of many of these modifications in RNA are not fully understood. However, it is notable that, in ribosomal RNA, many of the post-transcriptional modifications occur in highly functional regions, such as the peptidyl transferase center and the subunit interface, implying that they are important for normal function.      The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific  |tertiary_structure|Rna_Tertiary_Structure| . The scaffold for this structure is provided by  |secondary_structural|Secondary_Structure|  elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable domains of secondary structure like  |hairpin_loops|Hairpin_Loop| , bulges, and  |internal_loops|Internal_Loop| .  Since RNA is charged, metal ions such as  |Mg_2_|Magnesium|  are needed to stabilise many secondary and  |tertiary_structures|Rna_Tertiary_Structure| .      The naturally occurring  |enantiomer|Enantiomer|  of RNA is D -RNA composed of D -ribonucleotides. All chirality centers are located in the D -ribose. By the use of L -ribose or rather L -ribonucleotides, L -RNA can be synthesized. L -RNA is much more stable against degradation by  |RNase|Ribonuclease| .      Like other structured biopolymers such as proteins, one can define topology of a folded RNA molecule. This is often done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within a folded RNA, termed as  |circuit_topology|Circuit_Topology| .       Synthesis of RNA is usually catalyzed by an enzyme— |RNA_polymerase|Rna_Polymerase| —using DNA as a template, a process known as  |transcription|Transcription| . Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a  |promoter|Promoter|  sequence in the DNA . The DNA double helix is unwound by the  |helicase|Helicase|  activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.       |Primary_transcript|Primary_Transcript|  RNAs are often  |modified|Post_Transcriptional_Modification|  by enzymes after transcription. For example, a  |poly_tail|Poly_Tail|  and a  |5_cap|5_Cap|  are added to eukaryotic  |pre_mRNA|Pre_Mrna|  and  |introns|Intron|  are removed by the  |spliceosome|Spliceosome| .     There are also a number of  |RNA_dependent_RNA_polymerases|Rna_Dependent_Rna_Polymerase|  that use RNA as their template for synthesis of a new strand of RNA. For instance, a number of RNA viruses use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material.  Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is part of the  |RNA_interference|Rna_Interference|  pathway in many organisms.                  Messenger RNA is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the  |ribosome|Ribosome| , the sites of protein synthesis  in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  sequence in the  |protein|Protein|  that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein .     These so-called  |non_coding_RNAs|Non_Coding_Rna|  can be encoded by their own genes , but can also derive from mRNA  |introns|Intron| . The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are  |transfer_RNA|Transfer_Rna|  and  |ribosomal_RNA|Ribosomal_Rna|  , both of which are involved in the process of translation.  There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation,  |RNA_processing|Rna_Processing|  and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to  |catalyse|Catalysis|  chemical reactions such as cutting and  |ligating|Ligase|  other RNA molecules,  and the catalysis of  |peptide_bond|Peptide_Bond|  formation in the  |ribosome|Ribosome| ; these are known as  |ribozymes|Ribozyme| .       According to the length of RNA chain, RNA includes  |small_RNA|Small_Rna|  and long RNA.  Usually,  |small_RNAs|Small_Rna|  are shorter than 200   |nt|Nucleotide|  in length, and long RNAs are greater than 200   |nt|Nucleotide|  long.  Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include  |long_non_coding_RNA|Long_Non_Coding_Rna|  and  |mRNA|Mrna| . Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S  |ribosomal_RNA|Ribosomal_Rna|  , 5S rRNA,  |transfer_RNA|Transfer_Rna|  ,  |microRNA|Microrna|  ,  |small_interfering_RNA|Small_Interfering_Rna|  ,  |small_nucleolar_RNA|Small_Nucleolar_Rna|  ,  |Piwi_interacting_RNA|Piwi_Interacting_Rna|  , tRNA-derived small RNA  and small rDNA-derived RNA .         |Messenger_RNA|Messenger_Rna|  carries information about a protein sequence to the  |ribosomes|Ribosome| , the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is  |coded|Genetic_Code|  so that every three nucleotides  corresponds to one amino acid. In  |eukaryotic|Eukaryotic|  cells, once precursor mRNA has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its  |introns|Intron| —non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and  |translated|Translation|  into its corresponding protein form with the help of  |tRNA|Trna| . In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a certain amount of time, the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of  |ribonucleases|Ribonuclease| .      |Transfer_RNA|Transfer_Rna|  is a small RNA chain of about 80  |nucleotides|Nucleotide|  that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing  |polypeptide|Polypeptide|  chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an  |anticodon|Anticodon|  region for  |codon|Codon|  recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.      |Ribosomal_RNA|Ribosomal_Rna|  is the catalytic component of the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the  |nucleolus|Nucleolus| , and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.  Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.      |Transfer_messenger_RNA|Tmrna|  is found in many  |bacteria|Bacteria|  and  |plastids|Plastid| . It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.          The earliest known regulators of  |gene_expression|Gene_Expression|  were proteins known as  |repressors|Repressor|  and  |activators|Activator| , regulators with specific short binding sites within  |enhancer|Enhancer|  regions near the genes to be regulated.

Kevin Morris and John Mattick. “The rise of regulatory RNA” Nature Reviews Genetics15 |Bacterial_small_RNA|Bacterial_Small_Rna|  and the  |CRISPR|Crispr|  system are examples of such prokaryotic regulatory RNA systems.

Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  for discovering  |microRNAs|Microrna|  , specific short RNA molecules that can base-pair with mRNAs. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006 . Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 6 Aug 2018.             Post-transcriptional expression levels of many genes can be controlled by  |RNA_interference|Rna_Interference| , in which  |miRNAs|Mirna| , specific short RNA molecules, pair with meRNA regions and target them for degradation. Fire et al. 1998 “Potent and Specific Genetic Interference by double stranded RNA in Ceanorhabditis elegans” Nature 391 |antisense|Antisense_Rna| -based process involves steps that first process the RNA so that it can  |base_pair|Base_Pair|  with a region of its target mRNAs. Once the base pairing occurs, other proteins direct the mRNA to be destroyed by  |nucleases|Nuclease| . Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  for this discovery.            Next to be linked to regulation were  |Xist|Xist|  and other  |long_noncoding_RNAs|Long_Noncoding_Rna|  associated with  |X_chromosome_inactivation|X_Chromosome_Inactivation| .   Their roles, at first mysterious, were shown by  |Jeannie_T_Lee|Jeannie_T_Lee|  and others to be the  |silencing|Silencing|  of blocks of chromatin via recruitment of  |Polycomb|Polycomb_Group_Proteins|  complex so that messenger RNA could not be transcribed from them. J Zhao, BK Sun, JA Erwin, JJ Song, and JT Lee. “Polycomb proteins targeted by a short repeat RNA to the mouse X chromosome.” Science 322Annu. Rev. Biochem 81 have been found associated with regulation of  |stem_cell|Stem_Cell| |_pluripotency|Pluripotency|  and  |cell_division|Cell_Division| .            The third major group of regulatory RNAs is called  |enhancer_RNAs|Enhancer_Rna| .  It is not clear at present whether they are a unique category of RNAs of various lengths or  constitute a distinct subset of lncRNAs.   In any case, they are transcribed from  |enhancers|Enhancers| , which are known regulatory sites in the DNA near genes they regulate. RJ Taft, CD Kaplan., C Simons,  and JS  Mattick, . Evolution, biogenesis and function of promoter- associated RNAs. Cell Cycle 8, 2332–38.  They up-regulate the transcription of the gene under control of the enhancer from which they are transcribed. UA Orom, T Derrien, M Beringer, K Gumireddy, A. Gardini, et al. ‘Long noncoding RNAs with enhancer-like function in human cells.” Cell 143Advances in genetics . Currently, the ubiquitous nature of systems of RNA regulation of genes has been discussed as support for the  |RNA_World|Rna_World|  theory. J.W. Nelson, R.R. Breaker The lost language of the RNA World. Sci. Signal.10,eaam8812 1–11.  |Bacterial_small_RNAs|Bacterial_Small_Rna|  generally act via  |antisense|Antisense_Rna|  pairing with mRNA to down-regulate its translation, either by affecting stability or affecting cis-binding ability.  |Riboswitch|Riboswitch| es have also been discovered. They are cis-acting regulatory RNA sequences acting  |allosterically|Allosteric_Regulation| . They change shape when they bind  |metabolites|Metabolite|  so that they gain or lose the ability to bind chromatin to regulate expression of genes.

The CRISPR system, recently being used to edit DNA in situ, acts via regulatory RNAs in archaea and bacteria to provide protection against virus invaders.

Koonin, J Van Der Oost.   “Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes” Science 321, 960–64. .          Many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs.    |Introns|Intron|  are  |spliced|Splicing|  out of  |pre_mRNA|Pre_Mrna|  by  |spliceosomes|Spliceosome| , which contain several  |small_nuclear_RNAs|Small_Nuclear_Rna|  , or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.    RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to nucleotides other than  |A|Adenosine| ,  |C|Cytidine| ,  |G|Guanosine|  and  |U|Uridine| .   In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by  |small_nucleolar_RNAs|Small_Nucleolar_Rna|  ,  found in the  |nucleolus|Nucleolus|  and  |cajal_bodies|Cajal_Body| . snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification.   RNA can also be methylated.         Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information.  |RNA_virus|Rna_Virus| es have  |genomes|Genome|  composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell.  |Viroids|Viroid|  are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cells polymerase.        Reverse transcribing viruses replicate their genomes by  |reverse_transcribing|Reverse_Transcription|  DNA copies from their RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA.  |Retrotransposons|Retrotransposon|  also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another,  and  |telomerase|Telomerase|  contains an RNA that is used as template for building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.           Double-stranded RNA is RNA with two complementary strands, similar to the DNA found in all cells, but with the replacement of thymine by uracil. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some  |virus|Virus| es . Double-stranded RNA, such as viral RNA or  |siRNA|Sirna| , can trigger  |RNA_interference|Rna_Interference|  in  |eukaryotes|Eukaryote| , as well as  |interferon|Interferon|  response in  |vertebrates|Vertebrate| .               In the late 1970s, it was shown that there is a single stranded covalently closed, i.e. circular form of RNA expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdom .  circRNAs are thought to arise via a back-splice reaction where the  |spliceosome|Spliceosome|  joins a downstream donor to an upstream acceptor splice site. So far the function of circRNAs is largely unknown, although for few examples a microRNA sponging activity has been demonstrated.             Research on RNA has led to many important biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes.  |Nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid|  were discovered in 1868 by  |Friedrich_Miescher|Friedrich_Miescher| , who called the material nuclein since it was found in the  |nucleus|Cell_Nucleus| .  It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939.   |Severo_Ochoa|Severo_Ochoa|  won the 1959  |Nobel_Prize_in_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Medicine|   after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory.  However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa  was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.      The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by  |Robert_W_Holley|Robert_W_Holley|  in 1965,  winning Holley the  |1968_Nobel_Prize_in_Medicine|List_Of_Nobel_Laureates_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  .     During the early 1970s,  |retrovirus|Retrovirus| es and  |reverse_transcriptase|Reverse_Transcriptase|  were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA . For this work,  |David_Baltimore|David_Baltimore| ,  |Renato_Dulbecco|Renato_Dulbecco|  and  |Howard_Temin|Howard_Temin|  were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.   In 1976,  |Walter_Fiers|Walter_Fiers|  and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of  |bacteriophage_MS2|Bacteriophage_Ms2| .      In 1977,  |introns|Intron|  and  |RNA_splicing|Rna_Splicing|  were discovered in both mammalian viruses and in cellular genes, resulting in a 1993 Nobel to  |Philip_Sharp|Philip_A_Sharp|  and  |Richard_Roberts|Richard_J_Roberts| .   Catalytic RNA molecules  were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to  |Thomas_Cech|Thomas_Cech|  and  |Sidney_Altman|Sidney_Altman| . In 1990, it was found in  Petunia  that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plants own, now known to be a result of  |RNA_interference|Rna_Interference| .       At about the same time, 22 nt long RNAs, now called  |microRNAs|Microrna| , were found to have a role in the  |development|Developmental_Biology|  of  C. elegans .    Studies on RNA interference gleaned a Nobel Prize for  |Andrew_Fire|Andrew_Z_Fire|  and  |Craig_Mello|Craig_Mello|  in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on the transcription of RNA to  |Roger_Kornberg|Roger_Kornberg|  in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as  |siRNA|Sirna| , to silence genes.  Adding to the Nobel prizes awarded for research on RNA in 2009 it was awarded for the elucidation of the atomic structure of the ribosome to Venki Ramakrishnan, Tom Steitz, and Ada Yonath.       In 1967,  |Carl_Woese|Carl_Woese|  hypothesized that RNA might be catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms of life could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an  |RNA_world|Rna_World_Hypothesis| .       In March 2015, complex  |DNA|Dna|  and RNA  |nucleotides|Nucleotide| , including  |uracil|Uracil| ,  |cytosine|Cytosine|  and  |thymine|Thymine| , were reportedly formed in the laboratory under  |outer_space|Outer_Space|  conditions, using starter chemicals, such as  |pyrimidine|Pyrimidine| , an  |organic_compound|Organic_Compound|  commonly found in  |meteorites|Meteorite| . Pyrimidine, like  |polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons|Polycyclic_Aromatic_Hydrocarbons|  , is one of the most carbon-rich compounds found in the  |Universe|Universe|  and may have been formed in  |red_giants|Red_Giant|  or in  |interstellar_dust|Cosmic_Dust|  and gas clouds.
