                 A star is an  |astronomical_object|Astronomical_Object|  consisting of a luminous  |spheroid|Spheroid|  of  |plasma|Plasma|  held together by its own  |gravity|Gravity| . The nearest star to  |Earth|Earth|  is the  |Sun|Sun| . Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of  |fixed|Fixed_Stars|  luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into  |constellations|Constellation|  and  |asterisms|Asterism| , the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled  |star_catalogues|Star_Catalogue|  that identify the known stars and provide standardized  |stellar_designations|Stellar_Designation| . The  |observable_Universe|Observable_Universe|  contains an estimated  stars,   but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our  |galaxy|Galaxy| , the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| .     For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to  |thermonuclear_fusion|Thermonuclear_Fusion|  of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  into  |helium|Helium|  in its core, releasing energy that traverses the stars interior and then  |radiates|Radiation|  into  |outer_space|Outer_Space| . Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by  |stellar_nucleosynthesis|Stellar_Nucleosynthesis|  during the stars lifetime, and for some stars by  |supernova_nucleosynthesis|Supernova_Nucleosynthesis|  when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain  |degenerate_matter|Degenerate_Matter| .  |Astronomers|Astronomer|  can determine the  |mass|Stellar_Mass| , age,  |metallicity|Metallicity|  , and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its  |luminosity|Luminosity| , and  |spectrum|Astronomical_Spectroscopy|  respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its  |evolution|Stellar_Evolution|  and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the stars environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a  |Hertzsprung–Russell_diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell_Diagram|  . Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.     A stars life  |begins|Star_Formation|  with the  |gravitational_collapse|Gravitational_Collapse|  of a gaseous  |nebula|Nebula|  of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.  The remainder of the stars interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of  |radiative|Radiation|  and  |convective|Convection| |heat_transfer|Heat_Transfer|  processes. The stars internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Suns will expand to become a  |red_giant|Red_Giant|  when the hydrogen  |fuel|Fuel|  in its core is exhausted.  In some cases, it will fuse heavier  |elements|Chemical_Element|  at the core or in shells around the core. As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars.  Meanwhile, the core becomes a  |stellar_remnant|Stellar_Remnant| |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf| , a  |neutron_star|Neutron_Star| , or, if it is sufficiently massive, a  |black_hole|Black_Hole| .      |Binary|Binary_Star|  and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable  |orbits|Orbit| . When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution.  Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a  |star_cluster|Star_Cluster|  or a galaxy.               Historically, stars have been important to  |civilizations|Civilization|  throughout the world. They have been part of religious practices and used for  |celestial_navigation|Celestial_Navigation|  and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a  |heavenly_sphere|Heavenly_Sphere|  and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into  |constellations|Constellation|  and used them to track the motions of the  |planets|Planets|  and the inferred position of the Sun.  The motion of the Sun against the background stars was used to create  |calendars|Solar_Calendar| , which could be used to regulate agricultural practices.  The  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a  |solar_calendar|Solar_Calendar|  based on the angle of the Earths rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.     The oldest accurately dated  |star_chart|Star_Chart|  was the result of ancient  |Egyptian_astronomy|Egyptian_Astronomy|  in 1534 BC.  The  |earliest_known_star_catalogues|Babylonian_Star_Catalogues|  were compiled by the ancient  |Babylonian_astronomers|Babylonian_Astronomy|  of  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the  |Kassite_Period|Kassites|  .      The first  |star_catalogue|Star_Catalogue|  in  |Greek_astronomy|Ancient_Greek_Astronomy|  was created by  |Aristillus|Aristillus|  in approximately 300 BC, with the help of  |Timocharis|Timocharis| .  The star catalog of  |Hipparchus|Hipparchus|  included 1020 stars, and was used to assemble  |Ptolemys|Ptolemy|  star catalogue.  Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded  nova  .  Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.     In spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens,  |Chinese_astronomers|Chinese_Astronomy|  were aware that new stars could appear.  In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a  |supernova|Supernova| , now known as the  |SN_185|Sn_185| .  The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the  |SN_1006|Sn_1006|  supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer  |Ali_ibn_Ridwan|Ali_Ibn_Ridwan|  and several Chinese astronomers.  The  |SN_1054|Sn_1054|  supernova, which gave birth to the  |Crab_Nebula|Crab_Nebula| , was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.            |Medieval_Islamic_astronomers|Astronomy_In_Medieval_Islam|  gave  |Arabic_names_to_many_stars|List_Of_Arabic_Star_Names|  that are still used today and they invented numerous  |astronomical_instruments|Astronomy_In_Medieval_Islaminstruments|  that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large  |observatory|Observatory|  research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing  Zij  star catalogues.  Among these, the  Book of Fixed Stars  was written by the  |Persian|Persian_People|  astronomer  |Abd_al-Rahman_al-Sufi|Abd_Al-Rahman_Al-Sufi| , who observed a number of stars,  |star_clusters|Star_Cluster|   and  |galaxies|Galaxy|  .  According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian  |polymath|Polymath|  scholar  |Abu_Rayhan_Biruni|Abu_Rayhan_Biruni|  described the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of  |nebulous|Nebula|  stars, and also gave the  |latitudes|Latitude|  of various stars during a  |lunar_eclipse|Lunar_Eclipse|  in 1019.      According to Josep Puig, the  |Andalusian|Al-Andalus|  astronomer  |Ibn_Bajjah|Ibn_Bajjah|  proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars that almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of  |refraction|Refraction|  from sublunary material, citing his observation of the  |conjunction|Conjunction|  of Jupiter and Mars on 500  |AH|Islamic_Calendar|  as evidence.     Early European astronomers such as  |Tycho_Brahe|Tycho_Brahe|  identified new stars in the  |night_sky|Night_Sky|  , suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584,  |Giordano_Bruno|Giordano_Bruno|  suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have  |other_planets|Extrasolar_Planet| , possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them,  an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient  |Greek_philosophers|Greek_Philosophy| ,  |Democritus|Democritus|  and  |Epicurus|Epicurus| ,  and by medieval  |Islamic_cosmologists|Cosmology_In_Medieval_Islam|   such as  |Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi|Fakhr_Al-Din_Al-Razi| .  By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System,  |Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian  |Richard_Bentley|Richard_Bentley| .      The Italian astronomer  |Geminiano_Montanari|Geminiano_Montanari|  recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star  |Algol|Algol|  in 1667.  |Edmond_Halley|Edmond_Halley|  published the first measurements of the  |proper_motion|Proper_Motion|  of a pair of nearby fixed stars, demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient  |Greek|Ancient_Greece|  astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus.      |William_Herschel|William_Herschel|  was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s, he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way  |core|Galactic_Center| . His son  |John_Herschel|John_Herschel|  repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction.  In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.     The science of  |stellar_spectroscopy|Astronomical_Spectroscopy|  was pioneered by  |Joseph_von_Fraunhofer|Joseph_Von_Fraunhofer|  and  |Angelo_Secchi|Angelo_Secchi| . By comparing the spectra of stars such as  |Sirius|Sirius|  to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their  |absorption_lines|Spectral_Line| —the dark lines in stellar spectra caused by the atmospheres absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865, Secchi began classifying stars into  |spectral_types|Stellar_Classification| .  However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by  |Annie_J._Cannon|Annie_Jump_Cannon|  during the 1900s.        The first direct measurement of the distance to a star  was made in 1838 by  |Friedrich_Bessel|Friedrich_Bessel|  using the  |parallax|Parallax|  technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion.  |Edward_Pickering|Edward_Charles_Pickering|  discovered the first  |spectroscopic_binary|Spectroscopic_Binary|  in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star  |Mizar|Mizar|  in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as  |Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_von_Struve|Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_Von_Struve|  and  |S._W._Burnham|Sherburne_Wesley_Burnham| , allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of  |orbital_elements|Orbital_Elements| . The first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.    The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars. The  |photograph|Photograph|  became a valuable astronomical tool.  |Karl_Schwarzschild|Karl_Schwarzschild|  discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the  |visual_magnitude|Visual_Magnitude|  against the  |photographic_magnitude|Photographic_Magnitude| . The development of the  |photoelectric|Photoelectric_Effect| |photometer|Photometer|  allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921  |Albert_A._Michelson|Albert_A._Michelson|  made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an  |interferometer|Interferometer|  on the  |Hooker_telescope|Mount_Wilson_Observatoryhooker_Telescope|  at  |Mount_Wilson_Observatory|Mount_Wilson_Observatory| .      Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1913, the  |Hertzsprung-Russell_diagram|Hertzsprung-Russell_Diagram|  was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful  |models|Stellar_Model|  were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution.  |Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin|Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin|  first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis.  The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in  |quantum_physics|Quantum_Mechanics| . This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.         With the exception of supernovae, individual stars have primarily been observed in the  |Local_Group|Local_Group| , e.g.  and especially in the visible part of the Milky Way .  But some stars have been observed in the M100 galaxy of the  |Virgo_Cluster|Virgo_Cluster| , about 100 million light years from the Earth.    In the  |Local_Supercluster|Local_Supercluster|  it is possible to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group  . However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years  —ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.     In February 2018, astronomers reported, for the first time, a signal of the  |reionization|Reionization|  epoch, an indirect detection of light from the earliest stars formed—about 180 million years after the  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang| .      In April, 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant ordinary  star, named  |Icarus|Icarus|  , at 9 billion light-years away from  |Earth|Earth| .       In May 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant oxygen ever detected in the Universe—and the most distant galaxy ever observed by  |Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array|Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array|  or the  |Very_Large_Telescope|Very_Large_Telescope| —with the team inferring that the signal was emitted 13.3 billion years ago . They found that the observed brightness of the galaxy is well-explained by a model where the onset of star formation corresponds to only 250 million years after the Universe began, corresponding to a  |redshift|Redshift|  of about 15.           The concept of a constellation was known to exist during the  |Babylon|Babylon| ian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic|  and these became the basis of  |astrology|Astrology| . Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with  |Arabic|Arab_Language|  or  |Latin|Latin_Language|  designations.     As well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have their own  |myths|Mythology| .  To the  |Ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greek_Religion| , some stars , known as  |planets|Planet|  , represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets  |Mercury|Mercury| ,  |Venus|Venus| ,  |Mars|Mars| ,  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  and  |Saturn|Saturn|  were taken.      Circa 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer  |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer|  created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as  |designations|Bayer_Designation|  to the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the stars  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  was invented and added to  |John_Flamsteeds|John_Flamsteed|  star catalogue in his book  Historia coelestis Britannica  , whereby this numbering system came to be called  Flamsteed designation  or Flamsteed numbering.       The only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  . The International Astronomical Union maintains the  |Working_Group_on_Star_Names|Iau_Working_Group_On_Star_Names|   which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the  |British_Library|British_Library|  calls an  |unregulated|Regulation| |commercial_enterprise|Commercial_Enterprise| . The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither recognized by the IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the  |International_Star_Registry|International_Star_Registry| , which, during the 1980s, was accused of  |deceptive_practice|Deceptive_Practice|  for making it appear that the assigned name was  |official|Officialadjective| . This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the  |New_York_City_Department_of_Consumer_and_Worker_Protection|New_York_City_Department_Of_Consumer_And_Worker_Protection|  issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.         Although stellar parameters can be expressed in  |SI_units|International_System_Of_Units|  or  |CGS_units|Cgs_Unit| , it is often most convenient to express  |mass|Mass| ,  |luminosity|Luminosity| , and  |radii|Radius|  in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun. In 2015, the IAU defined a set of nominal solar values which can be used for quoting stellar parameters:     :     The  |solar_mass|Solar_Mass|  M ⊙ was not explicitly defined by the IAU due to the large relative uncertainty of the  |Newtonian_gravitational_constant|Gravitational_Constant|  G. However, since the product of the Newtonian gravitational constant and solar mass   together has been determined to much greater precision, the IAU defined the nominal solar mass parameter to be:     :     However, one can combine the nominal solar mass parameter with the most recent CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 10 30 kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.     Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the  |semi-major_axis|Semi-Major_And_Semi-Minor_Axes|  of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the  |astronomical_unit|Astronomical_Unit| —approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun . In 2012, the IAU defined the  |astronomical_constant|Astronomical_Constant|  to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.               Stars condense from regions of  |space|Interstellar_Medium|  of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a  |vacuum_chamber|Vacuum_Chamber| . These regions—known as  molecular cloud s—consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the  |Orion_Nebula|Orion_Nebula| .      Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.         |Massive_stars|O-Type_Star|  in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds,  |ion|Ion| izing the hydrogen, and creating  |H_II_regions|H_Ii_Region| . Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.     All stars spend the majority of their existence as  main sequence stars, fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment. Accordingly, astronomers often group stars by their mass:        Very low mass stars, with masses below 0.5 , are fully convective and distribute  |helium|Helium|  evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence. Therefore, they never undergo shell burning, never become  |red_giants|Red_Giant| , which cease fusing and become  |helium_white_dwarfs|White_Dwarfstars_With_Very_Low_Mass|  and slowly cool after exhausting their hydrogen. However, as the lifetime of  stars is longer than the  |age_of_the_universe|Age_Of_The_Universe| , no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage.   Low mass stars , with a mass between  and  depending on composition, do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a  |helium_flash|Helium_Flash| ; they develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core later on the  |asymptotic_giant_branch|Asymptotic_Giant_Branch| ; they finally blow off their outer shell as a  |planetary_nebula|Planetary_Nebula|  and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf.   Intermediate-mass stars, between  and , pass through evolutionary stages similar to low mass stars, but after a relatively short period on the  |red_giant_branch|Red_Giant_Branch|  they ignite helium without a flash and spend an extended period in the  |red_clump|Red_Clump|  before forming a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.   Massive stars generally have a minimum mass of  . After exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become  |supergiants|Supergiant|  and go on to  |fuse|Nuclear_Fusion|  elements heavier than helium. They end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae.            The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density—often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the  |collision_of_galaxies|Interacting_Galaxy|  .           When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for  |Jeans_instability|Jeans_Instability| , it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.           As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form  |Bok_globules|Bok_Globule|  . As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of  |hydrostatic_equilibrium|Hydrostatic_Equilibrium| , a  |protostar|Protostar|  forms at the core.      These  |pre-main-sequence_stars|Pre-Main-Sequence_Star|  are often surrounded by a  |protoplanetary_disk|Protoplanetary_Disk|  and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.        Early stars of less than 2  are called  |T_Tauri_stars|T_Tauri_Star| , while those with greater mass are  |Herbig_Ae/Be_stars|Herbig_Ae/Be_Star| . These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum|  of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as  |Herbig–Haro_objects|Herbig–Haro_Object| .             These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.          Early in their development, T Tauri stars follow the  |Hayashi_track|Hayashi_Track| —they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the  |Henyey_track|Henyey_Track| .     Most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed.      A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.            Stars spend about 90% of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence| , and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a stars core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the stars temperature and luminosity.      The Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion years ago.     Every star generates a  |stellar_wind|Stellar_Wind|  of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses 10 −14  every year,      or about 0.01% of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose 10 −7 to 10 −5  each year, significantly affecting their evolution.      Stars that begin with more than 50  can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.               The time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. The Sun is expected to live 10 billion years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 , called  |red_dwarfs|Red_Dwarf| , are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1  can only fuse about 10% of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion years; the most extreme of 0.08  |d-dwarf_sta|D-Dwarf_Sta| 13.8 billion yearsAGBsee  |Carbon-burning_process|Carbon-Burning_Process| see  |neon-burning_process|Neon-Burning_Process| see  |oxygen-burning_process|Oxygen-Burning_Process| see  |silicon-burning_process|Silicon-Burning_Process| more than 1.4  |tists_impressi|Tists_Impressi| 10 12 more stars than all the  |grains_of_sand|Sand|  on planet  |Earth|Earth| 8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour3 × 10 4 km/h × 24 × 365.25 |la|La| Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the Universe, determined by the  |Planck_satellite|Planck|  as 13.799 ± 0.021red dwarfs or the rise in brightness when it reappears |nstellati|Nstellati| mas |trono|Trono| |T_Tauri_type|Young_Star_Of_[[T_Tauri_Star| |nt|Nt| i.e., they are observed to have a high redshiftsee classification belowMass can be calculated for stars in  |binary_systems|Binary_Star|  by measuring their orbital velocities and distances.  |Gravitational_microlensing|Gravitational_Microlensing|  has been used to measure the mass of a single star.   |ysi|Ysi| power per unit area |trono|Trono| 32.6 light-years the  |5th_root|Nth_Root|  of 100 or approximately 2.512+1.00+2.00+6.00ΔLm b m f mfb Mm  |hypergiants|Hypergiant| |giants|Giant_Star| main sequence dwarfswhite dwarfs |ti|Ti| making radiatative heat transfer inefficient |lar_physi|Lar_Physi| 2 x 0.4 M |eV|Electronvolt| 2 x 1.0 MeV2 x 5.5 MeV12.9 MeV26.7 MeV  .
