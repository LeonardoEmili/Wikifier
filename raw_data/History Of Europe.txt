The history of Europe covers the people inhabiting  |Europe|Europe|  from  |prehistory|Prehistoric|  to the present. During the  |Neolithic_era|Neolithic_Europe|  and the time of the  |Indo-European_migrations|Indo-European_Migrations|  Europe saw human inflows from east and southeast and subsequent important cultural and material exchange. The period known as  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity|  began with the emergence of the city-states of  |ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| . Later, the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  came to dominate the entire  |Mediterranean_basin|Mediterranean_Basin| . The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . Beginning in the 14th century a  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England. After 1800, the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. The main powers set up colonies in most of the Americas and Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 20th century,  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  resulted in massive numbers of deaths. The  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  dominated European geo-politics from 1947 to 1989.          During the  |Neolithic_era|Neolithic_Europe|  and the time of the  |Indo-European_migrations|Indo-European_Migrations|  Europe saw massive migrations from east and southeast which also brought agriculture, new technologies, and the Indo-European languages, primarily through the areas of the  |Balkan_peninsula|Balkan_Peninsula|  and the  |Black_sea|Black_Sea|  region.     Some of the best-known civilizations of the late prehistoric Europe were the  |Minoan|Minoan_Civilization|  and the  |Mycenaean|Mycenaean_Greece| , which flourished during the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  until they  |collapsed|Bronze_Age_Collapse|  in a short period of time around 1200 BC.     The period known as  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity|  began with the emergence of the city-states of  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| . After ultimately checking the  |Persian|Achaemenid_Empire|  advance in Europe through the  |Greco-Persian_Wars|Greco-Persian_Wars|  in the 5th century BC, Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| , spreading throughout  |Asia|Asia| ,  |Africa|Africa| , and other parts of Europe. The  |Thracians|Thracians|  and their  |kingdoms|Odrysian_Kingdom|  and  |culture|Thracian_Treasure|  were long present in  |Southeast_Europe|Southeast_Europe| . The  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  came to dominate the entire  |Mediterranean_basin|Mediterranean_Basin| . By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the  |Western|Western_Roman_Empire|  and  |Eastern|Eastern_Roman_Empire|  empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the  |Germanic_peoples|Germanic_Peoples|  of  |Northern_Europe|Northern_Europe| , pressed by the  |Huns|Huns| , grew in strength and led repeated attacks that resulted in the  |Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire|Fall_Of_The_Western_Roman_Empire| . The Western empires collapse in AD 476 traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| .     In  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe| , Germanic peoples became more powerful in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the  |Franks|Franks|  would rise to a position of  |hegemony|Hegemony|  over Western Europe, the  |Frankish_Empire|Frankish_Empire|  reaching its peak under  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne|  around 800. This empire was later divided into several parts;  |West_Francia|West_Francia|  would evolve into the  |Kingdom_of_France|Kingdom_Of_France| , while  |East_Francia|East_Francia|  would evolve into the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , a precursor to modern Germany and Italy. The  |British_Isles|British_Isles|  were the site of several large-scale migrations.     The  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  – the eastern part of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , with its capital  |Constantinople|Constantinople| , survived for the next 1000 years as the most dominant  |empire|List_Of_Empires|  in  |Southeast_Europe|Southeast_Europe| . The powerful and long lived  |Bulgarian_Empire|Bulgarian_Empire|  was its main competitor in the region. Both empires were major powers in that part of Europe for centuries, both creating  |important|Byzantine_Art| |cultural|Golden_Age_Of_Medieval_Bulgarian_Culture| ,  |political|Third_Rome| ,  |linguistic|Cyrillic_Script|  and  |religious|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  legacy through the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  to this day.     The  |Viking_Age|Viking_Age| , a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, occurred from the late 8th century to the middle 11th century. The  |Normans|Normans| , descendants of the  |Vikings|Vikings|  who settled in Northern France, had a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the  |Norman_conquest_of_England|Norman_Conquest_Of_England|  to  |Sicily|Norman_Conquest_Of_Sicily| . The  |Rus_people|Rus_People|  founded  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus| , which evolved into Russia. After 1000 the  |Crusades|Crusades|  were a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the  |Levant|Levant|  back under Christian rule. The Crusaders opened trade routes which enabled the merchant republics of  |Genoa|Republic_Of_Genoa|  and  |Venice|Republic_Of_Venice|  to become major economic powers. The  |Reconquista|Reconquista| , a related movement, worked to reconquer  |Iberia|Iberia|  for  |Christendom|Christendom| .           |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe|  in the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages|  was dominated by the rise and fall of the  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire| . Led by  |Genghis_Khan|Genghis_Khan| , the Mongols were a group of  |steppe_nomads|Steppe_Nomad|  who established a decentralized empire which, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic Seas in Europe. As Mongol power waned towards the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| , the  |Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow|Grand_Duchy_Of_Moscow|  rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would grow into the  |Tsardom_of_Russia|Tsardom_Of_Russia|  in 1547. The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the  |Black_Death|Black_Death|  and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the  |Kalmar_Union|Kalmar_Union|  dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the  |Wars_of_Scottish_Independence|Wars_Of_Scottish_Independence|  and with France in the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War| . In  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe| , the  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|  became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an  |elective_monarchy|Elective_Monarchy| , came to be dominated for centuries by the  |House_of_Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg| . Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands. In the  |Balkans|Balkans| , the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  overran Byzantine lands, culminating in the  |Fall_of_Constantinople|Fall_Of_Constantinople|  in 1453, which historians mark as the end of the Middle Ages.     Beginning in the 14th century in  |Florence|Florence|  and later spreading through Europe, a  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge had an enormous liberating effect on intellectuals. Simultaneously, the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  under German  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  questioned Papal authority.  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  seized control of the English Church and its lands. The  |European_religious_wars|European_Religious_Wars|  were fought between German and Spanish rulers. The  |Reconquista|Reconquista|  ended Muslim rule in  |Iberia|Iberia| . By the 1490s a series of oceanic explorations marked the  |Age_of_Discovery|Age_Of_Discovery| , establishing direct links with Africa,  |the_Americas|The_Americas| , and Asia. Religious wars continued to be fought in Europe, until the 1648  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia| . The  |Spanish_crown|Spanish_Empire|  maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the  |Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees|Treaty_Of_The_Pyrenees| , which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| . An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and the world in the period between 1610 and 1700. Geoffrey Parker, States Make War But Wars Also Break States, Journal of Military History 741 pp. 11–34          The  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  began in  |Britain|Great_Britain| , based on coal, steam, and textile mills. Political change in  |continental_Europe|Continental_Europe|  was spurred by the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  under the motto  liberté, égalité, fraternité .  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte|  took control, made many reforms inside France, and transformed Western Europe. But his rise stimulated both nationalism and reaction and he was defeated in 1814–15 as the old royal conservatives returned to power.     The period between 1815 and 1871 saw revolutionary attempts in much of Europe . They all failed however. As industrial work forces grew in Western Europe,  |socialism|Socialism|  and  |trade_union|Trade_Union|  activity developed. The last vestiges of  |serfdom|Serfdom|  were abolished  |in_Russia|Serfdom_In_Russia|  in 1861. Greece and the other  |Balkan_nations|Balkans|  began a long slow road to  |independence|History_Of_The_Balkans|  from the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , starting in the 1820s. Italy was unified in its  |Risorgimento|Risorgimento|  in 1860. After the  |Franco-Prussian_War|Franco-Prussian_War|  of 1870–71,  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  unified the German states into an empire that was politically and militarily dominant until 1914. Most of Europe scrambled for imperial colonies  |in_Africa|Scramble_For_Africa|  and Asia in  |the_Age_of_Empire|The_Age_Of_Empire| . Britain and France built the largest empires, while diplomats ensured there were no major wars in Europe, apart from the  |Crimean_War|Crimean_War|  of the 1850s.     The outbreak of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in  |Southeastern_Europe|Southeastern_Europe|  as the  |Great_Powers|Great_Powers|  took sides. The 1917  |October_Revolution|October_Revolution|  led the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  to become the worlds first  |communist_state|Communist_State| , the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . The  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_I| , led by Britain, France, and the United States, defeated the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers| , led by the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  and  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary| , in 1918. During the  |Paris_Peace_Conference|Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919|  the  |Big_Four|The_Big_Four|  imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles| . The wars human and material devastation was unprecedented.     Germany lost its overseas empire and several provinces, had to pay large reparations, and was humiliated by the victors. They in turn had large debts to the United States. The 1920s were prosperous until 1929 when the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  broke out, which led to the collapse of democracy in many European states. The  |Nazi|Nazi|  regime under  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  came to power in 1933, rearmed Germany, and along with  |Mussolinis_Italy|Italian_Fascism|  sought to assert themselves on the continent by demands and appeasement, leading eventually to the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| . Most of the fighting took place on the  |Eastern_Front|Eastern_Front| , and the war ended with the defeat of the  |Axis_powers|Axis_Powers| , leaving the USSR and the United States dominating Eastern and Western Europe respectively.   The  |Iron_Curtain|Iron_Curtain|  now separated the east under Moscows control from the  |capitalist|Capitalist|  West. The United States launched the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan|  from 1948–51 and  |NATO|Nato|  from 1949, and rebuilt industrial economies that all were thriving by the 1950s. France and  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  took the lead in forming the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community| , which eventually became the  |European_Union|European_Union|  . Secularization saw the weakening of Protestant and Catholic churches across most of Europe, except where they were symbols of anti-government resistance, as in Poland. The  |Revolutions_of_1989|Revolutions_Of_1989|  brought an end to both Soviet hegemony and  |communism|Communism|  in Eastern Europe. Germany was reunited,  |Europes_integration_deepened|Maastricht_Treaty| , and both NATO and the EU expanded to the east. The EU came under increasing pressure because of the  |worldwide_recession_after_2008|Great_Recession| .                  Homo erectus  migrated from Africa to Europe before the emergence of modern humans.  Homo erectus georgicus , which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in  |Georgia|Georgia| , is the earliest  |hominid|Hominid|  to have been discovered in Europe.   |Lézignan-la-Cèbe|Lézignan-La-Cèbe|  in France,  |Orce|Orce|   in Spain,  |Monte_Poggiolo|Monte_Poggiolo|   in Italy and  |Kozarnika|Kozarnika|  in Bulgaria are amongst the oldest Palaeolithic sites in Europe.     The earliest appearance of  |anatomically_modern_people|Anatomically_Modern_Humans|  in Europe has been dated to 35,000 BC, usually referred to as the Cro-Magnon. The earliest sites in Europe are    |Riparo_Mochi|Riparo_Mochi|  ,  |Geissenklösterle|Geissenklösterle|  , and  |Isturitz|Isturitz|  . 42.7–41.5 ka .   Katerina Douka et al., A new chronostratigraphic framework for the Upper Palaeolithic of Riparo Mochi , Journal of Human Evolution 62, 19 December 2011, 286–299, .   Some locally developed transitional cultures  use clearly  |Upper_Palaeolithic|Upper_Palaeolithic|  technologies at very early dates.     Nevertheless, the definitive advance of these technologies is made by the  |Aurignacian|Aurignacian|  culture. The origins of this culture can be located in the  |Levant|Levant|  and Hungary . By 35,000 BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last  |Neanderthals|Neanderthals|  seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula| .     Around 29,000 BC a new technology/culture appeared in the western region of Europe: the  |Gravettian|Gravettian| . This technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the  |Balkans|Balkans|  .     Around 16,000 BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of a new culture, known as  |Magdalenian|Magdalenian| , possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the  |Solutrean|Solutrean|  area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The  |Hamburg_culture|Hamburg_Culture|  prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the  |Creswellian|Creswellian|  did shortly after in the British Islands.   Around 12,500 BC, the  |Würm_glaciation|Würm_Glaciation|  ended. Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000 BC, when it quickly evolved into two  microlith ist cultures:  |Azilian|Azilian|  , in Spain and southern France, and then  |Sauveterrian|Sauveterrian| , in southern France and  |Tardenoisian|Tardenoisian|  in Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the  |Lyngby_complex|Lyngby_Culture|  succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the  |Federmesser|Federmesser|  group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans.     The  |Indo-European_migrations|Indo-European_Migrations|  started at around c. 4200 BC. through the areas of the  |Black_sea|Black_Sea|  and the  |Balkan_peninsula|Balkan_Peninsula|  in  |East|Eastern_Europe|  and  |Southeast_Europe|Southeast_Europe| . In the next 3000 years the  |Indo-European_languages|Indo-European_Languages|  expanded through Europe.     In  |Varna_Necropolis|Varna_Necropolis|  – a burial site from 4569–4340 BC and one of the most important archaeological sites in world prehistory, was found the oldest gold treasure in the world.  Recently discovered golden artifacts treasure in  |Durankulak|Durankulak| ,  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| , appears to be 7000 old.      The  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millenniums BC.                 The first well-known literate civilization in Europe was that of the Minoans. The  |Minoan_civilization|Minoan_Civilization|  was a  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  civilization that arose on the island of  |Crete|Crete|  and flourished from approximately the 27th century BC to the 15th century BC.  It was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century through the work of the British archaeologist  |Arthur_Evans|Arthur_Evans| .  |Will_Durant|Will_Durant|  referred to it as the first link in the European chain . Durant, The Life of Greece; The Story of Civilization Part II, 1939:11.     The Minoans were replaced by the  |Mycenaean_civilization|Mycenaean_Civilization|  which flourished during the period roughly between 1600 BC, when  |Helladic|Helladic|  culture in mainland Greece was transformed under influences from Minoan Crete, and 1100 BC. The major Mycenaean cities were  |Mycenae|Mycenae|  and  |Tiryns|Tiryns|  in Argolis,  |Pylos|Pylos|  in Messenia,  |Athens|Athens|  in Attica,  |Thebes|Ancient_Thebes|  and  |Orchomenus|Orchomenus|  in Boeotia, and  |Iolkos|Iolkos|  in Thessaly. In  |Crete|Crete| , the Mycenaeans occupied  |Knossos|Knossos| . Mycenaean settlement sites also appeared in  |Epirus|Epirus| ,  Tandy, p. xii. Figure 1: Map of Epirus showing the locations of known sites with Mycenaean remains ; Tandy, p. 2. The strongest evidence for Mycenaean presence in Epirus is found in the coastal zone of the lower Acheron River, which in antiquity emptied into a bay on the Ionian coast known from ancient sources as Glykys Limin .  |Macedonia|Macedonia| ,   on islands in the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea| , on the coast of  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor| , the  |Levant|Levant| , The Synchronisation of Civilisations in the eastern Mediterranean in the Second Millennium BC III, Proceedings of the SCIEM 2000 – 2nd EuroConference, Vienna, 28 May – 1 June 2003  |Cyprus|Cyprus|  , Gert Jan van Wijngaarden, Amsterdam Archaeological Studies and Italy. , University of Glasgow, Department of Archaeology Emilio Peruzzi, Mycenaeans in early Latium, , Edizioni dellAteneo & Bizzarri, Roma, 1980 Mycenaean artefacts have been found well outside the limits of the Mycenean world.     Quite unlike the Minoans, whose society benefited from trade, the Mycenaeans advanced through conquest. Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior  |aristocracy|Aristocracy| . Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script  to write their early form of  |Greek|Greek_Language|  in  |Linear_B|Linear_B| .     The Mycenaean civilization perished with the  |collapse_of_Bronze-Age_civilization|Bronze_Age_Collapse|  on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the  |Dorian_invasion|Dorian_Invasion| , although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after  |LH_III_C|Lh_Iiic| , when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the  Greek Dark Ages  of traditional historiography.                 The Greeks and the Romans left a legacy in Europe which is evident in European languages,  |thought|Western_Philosophy| , visual arts and law. Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, out of which the original form of democracy developed.  |Athens|Classical_Athens|  was the most powerful and developed city, and a cradle of learning from the time of  |Pericles|Pericles| . Citizens forums debated and legislated policy of the state, and from here arose some of the most notable classical philosophers, such as  |Socrates|Socrates| ,  |Plato|Plato| , and  |Aristotle|Aristotle| , the last of whom taught  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| .     Through his military campaigns, the king of the kingdom of  |Macedon|Macedon| , Alexander, spread Hellenistic culture and learning to the banks of the  |River_Indus|River_Indus| . Meanwhile, the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic|  strengthened through victory over  |Carthage|Carthage|  in the  |Punic_Wars|Punic_Wars| . Greek wisdom passed into Roman institutions, as Athens itself was absorbed under the banner of the Senate and People of Rome –  |SPQR|Senatus_Populusque_Romanus| .          The Romans expanded their domains from Anatolia in the east to Britannia in the west. In 44 BC as it approached its height, its dictator  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  was  |murdered|Assassination_Of_Julius_Caesar|  by senators in an attempt to restore the Republic. In the ensuing turmoil,  |Octavian|Octavian|   usurped the reins of power and fought the Roman Senate. While proclaiming the rebirth of the Republic, he had ushered in the transfer of the Roman state from a republic to an empire, the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , which lasted for more than four centuries until the fall of the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire| .               The  |Hellenic_civilisation|Hellenic_Civilisation|  was a collection of city-states or  |poleis|Poleis|  with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.     The most powerful city-states were  |Athens|Ancient_Athens| ,  |Sparta|History_Of_Sparta| ,  |Thebes|Thebes,_Greece| ,  |Corinth|Ancient_Corinth| , and  |Syracuse|Syracuse,_Sicily| . Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of  |direct_democracy|Direct_Democracy|  invented by  |Cleisthenes|Cleisthenes| ; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of  |Socrates|Socrates| ,   |Plato|Plato| , and the  |Platonic_Academy|Platonic_Academy| .     The Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  and the Mediterranean . By the late 6th century BC, all the Greek  |city_states|City_States|  in Asia Minor had been incorporated into the  |Persian_Empire|Achaemenid_Empire| , while the latter had made territorial gains in the  |Balkans|Balkans|   and  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe|  proper as well. In the course of the 5th century BC, some of the Greek city states attempted to overthrow Persian rule in the  |Ionian_Revolt|Ionian_Revolt| , which failed. This sparked the  |first_Persian_invasion_of_mainland_Greece|First_Persian_Invasion_Of_Greece| . At some point during the ensuing  |Greco-Persian_Wars|Greco-Persian_Wars| , namely during the  |Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece|Second_Persian_Invasion_Of_Greece| , and precisely after the  |Battle_of_Thermopylae|Battle_Of_Thermopylae|  and the  |Battle_of_Artemisium|Battle_Of_Artemisium| , almost all of Greece to the north of the  |Isthmus_of_Corinth|Isthmus_Of_Corinth|  had been overrun by the Persians, Brian Todd Carey, Joshua Allfree, John Cairns .  Pen and Sword,  but the Greek city states reached a decisive victory at the  |Battle_of_Plataea|Battle_Of_Plataea| . With the end of the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians were eventually decisively forced to withdraw from their territories in Europe. The Greco-Persian Wars and the victory of the Greek  |city_states|City_States|  directly influenced the entire further course of European history and would set its further tone. Some Greek city-states formed the  |Delian_League|Delian_League|  to continue fighting Persia, but Athens position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival  |Peloponnesian_League|Peloponnesian_League| . The  |Peloponnesian_Wars|Peloponnesian_War|  ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with  |Spartan_hegemony|Spartan_Hegemony|  led to the  |Corinthian_War|Corinthian_War|  and the defeat of Sparta at the  |Battle_of_Leuctra|Battle_Of_Leuctra| . At the same time at the north ruled the Thracian  |Odrysian_Kingdom|Odrysian_Kingdom|  between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD.     Hellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and  |Philip_II_of_Macedon|Philip_Ii_Of_Macedon|  united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philip II, known as  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| , invaded neighboring  |Persia|Achaemenid_Empire| , toppled and incorporated its domains, as well as invading Egypt and going as far off as  |India|India| , increasing contact with people and cultures in these regions that marked the beginning of the  |Hellenistic_period|Hellenistic_Period| .     After the death of Alexander, his empire split into multiple kingdoms ruled by his generals, the  |Diadochi|Diadochi| . The Diadochi fought against each other in a series of conflicts called the  |Wars_of_the_Diadochi|Wars_Of_The_Diadochi| . In the beginning of the 2nd century BC, only three major kingdoms remained: the  |Ptolemaic_Egypt|Ptolemaic_Kingdom| , the  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire|  and  |Macedonia|Macedonia| . These kingdoms spread Greek culture to regions as far away as  |Bactria|Bactria| .                       Much of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia| n colony of  |Carthage|Carthage| , and its defeats in the three  |Punic_Wars|Punic_Wars|  marked the start of Roman  |hegemony|Hegemony| . First governed by  |kings|Roman_Kings| , then as a senatorial republic , Rome finally became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under  |Augustus|Augustus|  and his  |authoritarian|Authoritarian|  successors.          The  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the  |Rhine|Rhine|  and  |Danube|Danube|  rivers. Under emperor  |Trajan|Trajan|  the empire reached its maximum expansion, controlling approximately  of land surface, including  |Italia|Italian_Peninsula| ,  |Gallia|Gaul| ,  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia| ,  |Aquitania|Aquitania| ,  |Britannia|Roman_Britain| ,  |Baetica|Baetica| ,  |Hispania|Hispania_Romana| ,  |Thrace|Odrysian_Kingdom| ,  |Macedonia|Macedonia| ,  |Greece|Greece| ,  |Moesia|Moesia| ,  |Dacia|Dacia| ,  |Pannonia|Pannonia| ,  |Egypt|Egypt| ,  |Minor_Asia|Minor_Asia| ,  |Cappadocia|Cappadocia| ,  |Armenia|Kingdom_Of_Armenia| ,  |Caucasus|Caucasus| ,  |North_Africa|North_Africa| ,  |Levant|Levant|  and parts of  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| .  |Pax_Romana|Pax_Romana| , a period of peace,  |civilisation|Roman_Civilisation|  and an efficient  |centralised_government|Centralised_Government|  in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a  |series_of_civil_wars|Crisis_Of_The_Third_Century|  undermined Romes economic and social strength.     In the 4th century, the emperors  |Diocletian|Diocletian|  and  |Constantine|Constantine_I_Of_The_Roman_Empire|  were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  . Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored  |persecution_of_Christians|Persecution_Of_Christians_In_The_Roman_Empire|  in 313 with the  |Edict_of_Milan|Edict_Of_Milan| , thus setting the stage for the  |Church|Christian_Church|  to become the  |state_church_of_the_Roman_Empire|State_Church_Of_The_Roman_Empire|  in about 380.               The Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell.  |Romulus_Augustus|Romulus_Augustus| , the last  |Emperor|Roman_Emperor|  of the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire| , surrendered to the Germanic King  |Odoacer|Odoacer| . The British historian  |Edward_Gibbon|Edward_Gibbon|  argued in  The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire  that the Romans had become decadent, they had lost civic virtue.     Gibbon said that the adoption of Christianity, meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. From the eighteenth century onward , Glen W. Bowersock has remarked, Bowersock, The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 49.8 p. 31. we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears. It remains one of the greatest historical questions, and has a tradition rich in scholarly interest.     Some other notable dates are the  |Battle_of_Adrianople|Battle_Of_Adrianople|  in 378, the death of  |Theodosius_I|Theodosius_I|  in 395 , the crossing of the  |Rhine|Rhine|  in 406 by  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples|  after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against  |Alaric_I|Alaric_I| , the death of  |Stilicho|Stilicho|  in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of  |Justinian_I|Justinian_I| , the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a fall , the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.  Over time many theories have been proposed on why the Empire fell, or whether indeed it fell at all.               When Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the  |cross|Christian_Cross|  in 312, he soon afterwards issued the  |Edict_of_Milan|Edict_Of_Milan|  in 313 , declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma – it was later named Constantinople .     In 395  |Theodosius_I|Theodosius_I| , who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire. The empire was split into two halves: the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire|  centred in  |Ravenna|Ravenna| , and the Eastern Roman Empire  centred in Constantinople. The Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by  |Hunnic|Huns| ,  |Germanic|Germanic_Peoples| ,  |Slavic|Slavic_People|  and other “barbarian” tribes , and in 476 finally the  |Western_part|Western_Roman_Empire|  fell to the  |Heruli|Heruli|  chieftain  |Odoacer|Odoacer| .          Roman authority in the Western part of the empire had collapsed, and a power vacuum left in the wake of this collapse; the central organization, institutions, laws and power of Rome had broken down, resulting in many areas being open to invasion by migrating tribes. Over time,  |feudalism|Feudalism|  and  |manorialism|Manorialism|  arose, two interlocking institutions that provided for division of land and labor, as well as a broad if uneven hierarchy of law and protection. These localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked, and to a lord, who would provide and administer both local law to settle disputes among the peasants, as well as protection from outside invaders. Unlike under Roman rule, with its standard laws and military across the empire and its great bureaucracy to administer them and collect taxes, each lord was largely sovereign in his domain. A peasants lot could vary greatly depending on the leadership skills and attitudes to justice of the lord toward his people.  |Tithes|Tithe|  or rents were paid to the lord, who in turn owed resources, and armed men in times of war, to his lord, perhaps a regional prince. However, the levels of hierarchy were varied over time and place.     The western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers: first, the  |Franks|Franks|   in  |Francia|Francia|  481–843 AD, which covered much of present France and Germany; second, the  |Visigothic_kingdom|Visigothic_Kingdom|  418–711 AD in the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  ; and third, the  |Ostrogothic_kingdom|Ostrogothic_Kingdom|  493–553 AD in  |Italy|Italy|  and parts of the western  |Balkans|Balkans|  The Ostrogoths were later replaced by the  |Kingdom_of_the_Lombards|Kingdom_Of_The_Lombards|  568–774 AD. These new powers of the west built upon the Roman traditions until they evolved into a synthesis of Roman and Germanic cultures. Although these powers covered large territories, they did not have the great resources and bureaucracy of the Roman empire to control regions and localities. The ongoing invasions and boundary disputes usually meant a more risky and varying life than that under the empire. This meant that in general more power and responsibilities were left to local lords. On the other hand, it also meant more freedom, particularly in more remote areas.     In Italy,  |Theodoric_the_Great|Theodoric_The_Great|  began the cultural romanization of the new world he had constructed. He made  |Ravenna|Ravenna|  a center of Romano-Greek culture of art and his court fostered a flowering of literature and philosophy in  |Latin|Latin| . In Iberia,  |King_Chindasuinth|Chindasuinth|  created the  |Visigothic_Code|Visigothic_Code| .        In the Eastern part the dominant state was the remaining  |Eastern_Roman_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| .     In the feudal system, new princes and kings arose, the most powerful of which was arguably the Frankish ruler  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| . In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans by  |Pope_Leo_III|Pope_Leo_Iii| , effectively solidifying his power in western Europe. Charlemagnes reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus|  were marking out their territory, a  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia|  was growing, while the  |Angles|Angles|  and the  |Saxons|Saxons|  were securing their borders.     For the duration of the 6th century, the  |Eastern_Roman_Empire|Eastern_Roman_Empire|  was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian  |Sassanid_Empire|Sassanid_Empire|  , followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic  |Caliphate|Caliphate|  . By 650, the provinces of  |Egypt|Muslim_Conquest_Of_Egypt| ,  |Palestine_and_Syria|Muslim_Conquest_Of_Syria|  were lost to the  |Muslim_forces|Rashidun_Army| , followed by  |Hispania|Umayyad_Conquest_Of_Hispania|  and  |southern_Italy|History_Of_Islam_In_Southern_Italy|  in the 7th and 8th centuries . The Arab invasion from the east was stopped after the intervention of the  |Bulgarian_Empire|Bulgarian_Empire|  .          The Middle Ages are commonly dated from the  |fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire|Fall_Of_The_Western_Roman_Empire|  in the 5th century to the beginning of the  |early_modern_period|Early_Modern_Period|  in the 16th century, marked by the rise of  |nation_states|Nation_State| , the division of Western Christianity in the  |Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , the rise of  |humanism|Humanism|  in the  |Italian_Renaissance|Italian_Renaissance| , and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the  |Columbian_Exchange|Columbian_Exchange| . Susan Wise Bauer, The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade                Many consider Emperor  |Constantine_I|Constantine_I|  to be the first  |Byzantine_Emperor|Byzantine_Emperor|  . It was he who moved the imperial capital in 324 from  |Nicomedia|Nicomedia|  to  |Byzantium|Byzantium| , which re-founded as Constantinople, or Nova Roma . Fletcher, Banister, Sir Banister Fletchers A History of Architecture , Architectural Press; 20 edition , , p. 172 The city of  |Rome|Ancient_Rome|  itself had not served as the capital since the reign of  |Diocletian|Diocletian| . Some date the beginnings of the Empire to the reign of  |Theodosius_I|Theodosius_I|  and Christianitys official supplanting of the pagan  |Roman_religion|Religion_In_Ancient_Rome| , or following his death in 395, when the empire was split into two parts, with capitals in Rome and Constantinople. Others place it yet later in 476, when  |Romulus_Augustulus|Romulus_Augustulus| , traditionally considered the last western Emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the  |Greek_East|Greek_East| . Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of  |Heraclius|Heraclius|  when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing  |Christianisation|Christianisation|  was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the  |fall_of_Constantinople|Fall_Of_Constantinople|  to the  |Ottoman_Turks|Ottoman_Empire|  in 1453. The  |Plague_of_Justinian|Plague_Of_Justinian|  was a  |pandemic|Pandemic|  that afflicted the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| , including its capital  |Constantinople|Constantinople| , in the years 541–542. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world.   It caused  |Europes_population|Medieval_Demography|  to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700.  It also may have contributed to the success of the  |Muslim_conquests|Muslim_Conquests| .            The Early Middle Ages span roughly five centuries from 500 to 1000. Events used to mark the periods beginning include the sack of Rome by the  |Goths|Goths|  , the deposition of the last western  |Roman_Emperor|Roman_Emperor|  , the  |Battle_of_Tolbiac|Battle_Of_Tolbiac|  and the  |Gothic_War|Gothic_War|  . Particular events taken to mark its end include the founding of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  by  |Otto_I_the_Great|Otto_I_The_Great|  , the  |Great_Schism|East–West_Schism|  and the  |Norman_conquest_of_England|Norman_Conquest_Of_England|  .      In the Eastern part of Europe new dominant states formatted – the  |Avar_Khaganate|Avar_Khaganate|  ,  |Old_Great_Bulgaria|Old_Great_Bulgaria|  , the  |Khazar_Khaganate|Khazars|  and  |Danube_Bulgaria|First_Bulgarian_Empire|   were constantly rivaling the hegemony of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| .     From the 7th century Byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of Islam and the  |Caliphates|Caliphates| . Muslim  |Arabs|Arabs|  first invaded historically Roman territory under  |Abū_Bakr|Abū_Bakr| , first Caliph of the  |Rashidun_Caliphate|Rashidun_Caliphate| , who entered  |Roman_Syria|Roman_Syria|  and  |Roman_Mesopotamia|Roman_Mesopotamia| . As the Byzantines and neighboring  |Sasanids|Sasanids|  were severely weakened by the time, amongst the most important reason being the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent  |Byzantine–Sasanian_wars|Byzantine–Sasanian_Wars| , which included the climactic  |Byzantine–Sasanian_War_of_602–628|Byzantine–Sasanian_War_Of_602–628| , under  |Umar|Umar| , the second Caliph, the Muslims entirely toppled the  |Sasanid_Persian_Empire|Sasanian_Empire| , and decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as  |Roman_Palestine|Roman_Palestine| ,  |Roman_Egypt|Roman_Egypt| , and parts of  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and  |Roman_North_Africa|Africa_Province| . In the mid 7th century AD, following the  |Muslim_conquest_of_Persia|Muslim_Conquest_Of_Persia| , Islam penetrated into the  |Caucasus|Caucasus|  region, of which parts  |would_later|Russo-Persian_Wars|  permanently become part of  |Russia|Russia| .  This trend, which included the conquests by the invading Muslim forces and by that the spread of Islam as well continued under Umars successors and under the  |Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad_Caliphate| , which conquered the rest of Mediterranean North Africa and most of the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Visigothic_Kingdom| . Over the next centuries Muslim forces were able to take further European territory, including  |Cyprus|Cyprus_In_The_Middle_Ages| , Malta,  |Crete|Emirate_Of_Crete| , and  |Sicily_and_parts_of_southern_Italy|History_Of_Islam_In_Southern_Italy| . Kennedy, Hugh . The Muslims in Europe . In McKitterick, Rosamund, The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 500 – c. 700, pp. 249–72. Cambridge University Press. .     The Muslim conquest of Hispania began when the  |Moors|Moors|   invaded the Christian  |Visigothic|Visigoths|  kingdom of  |Hispania|Iberian_Peninsula|  in the year 711, under the Berber general  |Tariq_ibn_Ziyad|Tariq_Ibn_Ziyad| . They landed at  |Gibraltar|Gibraltar|  on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariqs forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior,  |Musa_ibn_Nusair|Musa_Ibn_Nusair| . During the eight-year campaign most of the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  was brought under Muslim rule – save for small areas in the northwest  and largely  |Basque|Basque_People|  regions in the  |Pyrenees|Pyrenees| . In 711,  |Visigothic|Visigothic| |Hispania|Hispania|  was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne involving two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis that crossed the  |Hispano|Hispania| - |Visigothic|Visigothic|  society to carry out their conquests. This territory, under the Arab name  |Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus| , became part of the expanding  |Umayyad|Umayyad|  empire.     The  |second_siege_of_Constantinople|Siege_Of_Constantinople|  ended unsuccessful after the intervention of  |Tervel_of_Bulgaria|Tervel_Of_Bulgaria|  and weakened the  |Umayyad_dynasty|Umayyad|  and reduced their prestige. In 722  |Don_Pelayo|Don_Pelayo| , a  |nobleman|Nobleman|  of Visigothic origin, formed an army of 300  |Astur|Astures|  soldiers, to confront Munuzas Muslim troops. In the  |battle_of_Covadonga|Battle_Of_Covadonga| , the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the  |Reconquista|Reconquista|  and the establishment of the  |Kingdom_of_Asturias|Kingdom_Of_Asturias| , whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the  |Frankish|Frankish_Empire|  leader  |Charles_Martel|Charles_Martel|  at the  |Battle_of_Poitiers|Battle_Of_Tours|  in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the  |Abbāsids|Abbāsids| , Joseph F. O´Callaghan, Reconquest and crusade in Medieval Spain and, in 756, the Umayyads established an  |independent_emirate|Emirate_Of_Córdoba|  in the Iberian Peninsula.                   The  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  emerged around 800, as  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| , king of the  |Franks|Franks| , was crowned by the pope as emperor. His empire based in modern France, the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  and Germany expanded into modern Hungary, Italy,  |Bohemia|Bohemia| , Lower Saxony and Spain. He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the  |Lombards|Lombards| . Michael Frassetto, Early Medieval World, The: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne     To the east,  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria|  was established in 681 and became the first  |Slavic|Slavic_Peoples|  country. The powerful  |Bulgarian_Empire|Bulgarian_Empire|  was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the  |Balkans|Balkans|  for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The  |Empire|First_Bulgarian_Empire|  created the  |Cyrillic_script|Cyrillic_Script|  during the 9th century AD, at the  |Preslav_Literary_School|Preslav_Literary_School| , and experienced the  |Golden_Age|Golden_Age_Of_Medieval_Bulgarian_Culture|  of Bulgarian cultural prosperity during the reign of emperor  |Simeon_I_the_Great|Simeon_I_Of_Bulgaria|  . Two states,  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia|  and  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus| , emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the  |Vikings|Viking|  who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the  |longships|Longship| . The  |Hungarians|Invasionmagyar_Invasions_Of_Europe|  pillaged mainland Europe, the  |Pechenegs|Pechenegs|  raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the  |Arab|Arab|  states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe including Poland and the newly settled  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| . The kingdoms of  |Croatia|Kingdom_Of_Croatia|  and  |Serbia|Kingdom_Of_Serbia|  also appeared in the  |Balkans|Balkans| . The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of  |feudalism|Feudalism| , which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.     In eastern Europe,  |Volga_Bulgaria|Volga_Bulgaria|  became an Islamic state in 921, after  |Almış_I|Almış_I|  converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of  |Ahmad_ibn_Fadlan|Ahmad_Ibn_Fadlan| . Gerald Mako, The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered , Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.     Slavery in the early medieval period had mostly died out in western Europe by about the year 1000 AD, replaced by  |serfdom|Serfdom| . It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Muslim world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians. Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000. Seymour Drescher and Stanley L. Engerman, eds. A Historical Guide to World Slavery pp. 197–200                  The slumber of the  |Dark_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages|  was shaken by a renewed crisis in the Church. In 1054, the  |East–West_Schism|East–West_Schism| , an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in  |Rome|Catholic_Church|  and  |Constantinople|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  .     The High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a  |rapidly_increasing_population|Medieval_Demography|  of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century. John H. Mundy, Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150–1309      From about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The  |Vikings|Viking|  had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The  |Magyars|Hungarian_People|  had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic  |Apostolic_Kingdom|Apostolic_Kingdom|  of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the  |Mongol_invasions|Mongol_Invasion_Of_Europe| , major barbarian incursions ceased.      |Bulgarian|Bulgarian_Empire|  sovereignty was reestablished with the  |anti-Byzantine_uprising_of_the_Bulgarians_and_Vlachs|Uprising_Of_Asen_And_Peter|  in 1185. The crusaders invaded the  |Byzantine_empire|Byzantine_Empire| , captured Constantinople in 1204 and established their  |Latin_Empire|Latin_Empire| .  |Kaloyan_of_Bulgaria|Kaloyan_Of_Bulgaria|  defeated  |Baldwin_I|Baldwin_I,_Latin_Emperor| ,  |Latin_emperor_of_Constantinople|Latin_Emperor_Of_Constantinople| , in the  |Battle_of_Adrianople|Battle_Of_Adrianople|  on 14 April 1205. The reign of  |Ivan_Asen_II_of_Bulgaria|Ivan_Asen_Ii_Of_Bulgaria|  led to maximum territorial expansion and that of  |Ivan_Alexander_of_Bulgaria|Ivan_Alexander_Of_Bulgaria|  to a  |Second_Golden_Age_of_Bulgarian_culture|Architecture_Of_The_Tarnovo_Artistic_School| . The Byzantine Empire was fully reestablished in 1261.     In the 11th century, populations north of the  |Alps|Alps|  began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| . In what is known as the great clearances , vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the  |Frankish_Empire|Frankish_Empire|  to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the  |Elbe|Elbe|  river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded  |European_colonies|Crusader_States|  in the  |Levant|Levant| , the majority of the  |Iberian_Peninsula_was_conquered|Reconquista|  from the Muslims, and the  |Normans|Normans|  colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.     The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and  |artistic_works|Medieval_Art| . The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of  |Gothic_architecture|Gothic_Architecture| , which evolved from  |Romanesque_architecture|Romanesque_Architecture| . This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian  |city-states|City-State| , such as  |Florence|Florence|  and  |Venice|Venice| . The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of  |Crusades|Crusades|  against the  |Seljuq_Turks|Seljuq_Dynasty| , who occupied the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land| . The rediscovery of the works of  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  led  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of  |Scholasticism|Scholasticism| .            The Great Schism between the Western and Eastern Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by  |Pope_Leo_IX|Pope_Leo_Ix|  asserting authority over three of the seats in the  |Pentarchy|Pentarchy| , in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empires borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion.  |Antioch|Antioch|  had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the  |filioque|Filioque|  clause in the  |Nicene_Creed|Nicene_Creed|  which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the  |Council_of_Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon|  explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over  |liturgy|Liturgy| . The Schism of Roman Catholic and  |Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  followed centuries of estrangement between the Latin and Greek worlds.               After the  |East–West_Schism|East–West_Schism| ,  |Western_Christianity|Western_Christianity|  was adopted by the newly created kingdoms of Central Europe:  |Poland|Poland| , Hungary and  |Bohemia|Bohemia| . The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to the conversions of pagan kings , the Christian  |Reconquista|Reconquista|  of  |Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus| , and the  |crusades|Crusades| . Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.     Early signs of the rebirth of civilization in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent  |city-states|City-State|  such as  |Venice|Venicehistory|  and  |Florence|History_Of_Florence| ; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional  |Latin|Latin| . Notable figures of this movement would include  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri|  and  |Christine_de_Pizan|Christine_De_Pizan|  , the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian , relocated to France, writing in French.  Elsewhere, the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.     The 14th century, when the  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire|  came to power, is often called the Age of the Mongols. Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of  |Batu_Khan|Batu_Khan| . Their western conquests included almost all of Russia ,  the  |Kipchak-Cuman_Confederation|Kipchak-Cuman_Confederation| .  |Bulgaria|Second_Bulgarian_Empire| , Hungary, and Poland managed to remain sovereign states. Mongolian records indicate that Batu Khan was planning a complete conquest of the remaining European powers, beginning with a winter attack on Austria, Italy and Germany, when he was recalled to  |Mongolia|Mongolia|  upon the death of Great Khan  |Ögedei|Ögedei_Khan| . Most historians believe only his death prevented the complete conquest of Europe. The areas of Eastern Europe and most of Central Asia that were under direct Mongol rule became known as the  |Golden_Horde|Golden_Horde| .

In the Northern Europe,  |Konrad_of_Masovia|Konrad_Of_Masovia|  gave  |Chelmno|Chelmno|  to the  |Teutonic_Knights|Teutonic_Knights|  in 1226 as a base for a Crusade against the  |Old_Prussians|Old_Prussians|  and  |Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania|Grand_Duchy_Of_Lithuania| . The  |Livonian_Brothers|Livonian_Brothers_Of_The_Sword|  of the Sword were defeated by the Lithuanians, so in 1237 Gregory IX merged the remainder of the order into the Teutonic Order as the  |Livonian_Order|Livonian_Order| . By the middle of the century, the Teutonic Knights completed their conquest of the Prussians before conquering and converting the Lithuanians in the subsequent decades. The order also came into conflict with the Eastern Orthodox Church of the  |Pskov|Pskov_Republic|  and  |Novgorod_Republics|Novgorod_Republic| . In 1240 the Orthodox Novgorod army defeated the Catholic Swedes in the  |Battle_of_the_Neva|Battle_Of_The_Neva| , and, two years later, they defeated the Livonian Order in the  |Battle_on_the_Ice|Battle_On_The_Ice| . The  |Union_of_Krewo|Union_Of_Krewo|  in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania:  |conversion_to_Catholicism|Christianization_Of_Lithuania|  and establishment of a  |dynastic_union|Dynastic_Union|  between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the  |Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland|Crown_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_Poland|  marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the  |Battle_of_Grunwald|Battle_Of_Grunwald|  in 1410.               The Late Middle Ages spanned the 14th and early 15th centuries. Wallace K. Ferguson, Europe in transition, 1300–1520 . Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, such as the  |Great_Famine_of_1315–1317|Great_Famine_Of_1315–1317|  and the  |Black_Death|Black_Death| , killed people in a matter of days, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:   :The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway.... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended. Traditional bonds of kinship, village, and even religion were broken and the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. People cared no more for dead men than we care for dead goats, wrote one survivor. Mark Kishlansky et al. Civilization in the West: Volume 1 to 1715 p. 316     Depopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the  |Jacquerie|Jacquerie|  and the  |Peasants_Revolt|Peasants_Revolt| . At the same time, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the  |Great_Schism|Western_Schism| . Collectively these events have been called the  |Crisis_of_the_Late_Middle_Ages|Crisis_Of_The_Late_Middle_Ages| . Cantor, p. 480.     Beginning in the 14th century, the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  became one of the most important  |trade_routes|Trade_Route| . The  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League| , an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland,  |Lithuania|Lithuania| , and  |Livonia|Terra_Mariana|  into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland-Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  is usually associated with the fall of the city of  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  and of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  to the  |Ottoman_Turks|Ottoman_Turks|  in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , which lasted until 1922 and included  |Egypt|Egypt| , Syria, and most of the  |Balkans|Balkans| . The  |Ottoman_wars_in_Europe|Ottoman_Wars_In_Europe| , also sometimes referred to as the Turkish wars, marked an essential part of the history of the continent as a whole.       At the local level, levels of violence were extremely high by modern standards in medieval and early modern Europe. Typically, small groups would battle their neighbors, using the farm tools at hand such as knives, sickles, hammers and axes. Mayhem and death were deliberate. The vast majority of people lived in rural areas. Cities were few, and small in size, but their concentration of population was conducive to violence. Long-term studies of places such as Amsterdam, Stockholm, Venice and Zurich show the same trends as rural areas. Across Europe,  |homicide|Homicide|  trends show a steady long-term decline. Manuel Eisner, Long-term historical trends in violent crime. Crime and Justice 30 : 83–142.  Lawrence Stone, Interpersonal Violence in English Society, 1300–   1980 Past and Present . 101:22–33.  Regional differences were small, except that Italys decline was later and slower. From approximately 1200 AD through 1800 AD, homicide rates from violent local episodes declined by a factor of ten, from approximately 32 deaths per 1000 people to 3.2 per 1000. In the 20th century the homicide rate fell to 1.4 per 1000. Police forces seldom existed outside the cities; prisons only became common after 1800. Before then harsh penalties were imposed for homicide but they proved ineffective at controlling or reducing the insults to honor that precipitated most of the violence. The decline does not correlate with economics. Most historians attribute the trend in homicides to a steady increase in self-control of the sort promoted by Protestantism, and necessitated by schools and factories. Eisner, pp 127–32.

Lockwood, Death, Justice and the State: The Coroner and the Monopoly of Violence in England, 1500–1800 and his The Conquest of Death: Violence and the Birth of the Modern English State .     Historian  |Manuel_Eisner|Manuel_Eisner|  has summarized the patterns from over 300 historical studies.                    The Early Modern period spans the centuries between the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  and the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , roughly from 1500 to 1800, or from the discovery of the  |New_World|New_World|  in 1492 to the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  in 1789. The period is characterised by the rise to importance of science and increasingly rapid  |technological_progress|History_Of_Technology| , secularised civic politics and the  |nation_state|Nation_State| .  |Capitalist_economies|Capitalist_Economy|  began their rise. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of  |mercantilism|Mercantilism| . As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of  |feudalism|Feudalism| , serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church. The period includes the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , thr  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , the disastrous  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , the  |European_colonisation_of_the_Americas|European_Colonisation_Of_The_Americas|  and the  |European_witch-hunts|European_Witch-Hunts| .               Despite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient  |Greek|Ancient_Greece|  and  |Roman|Ancient_Rome| led to what has later been termed the  |Italian_Renaissance|Italian_Renaissance| .     The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the  |early_modern_period|Early_Modern_Period| . Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and  |middle_Europe|Middle_Europe|  during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual enquiry.     The Italian  |Petrarch|Petrarch|  , deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time. He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild.  |Matteo_Palmieri|Matteo_Palmieri|  wrote in the 1430s: Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age. The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.     The Renaissance was inspired by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci| . The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance – a rebirth of civilization itself.           Important political precedents were also set in this period.  |Niccolò_Machiavellis|Niccolò_Machiavelli|  political writing in  The Prince  influenced later absolutism and real-politik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.     In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought – the immediate past being too Gothic in language, thought and sensibility.               Toward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus travel to the Americas in 1492, and  |Vasco_da_Gamas|Vasco_Da_Gama|  circumnavigation of  |India|Indian_Subcontinent|  and Africa in 1498.     The numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search of a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century, dividing their exploration of the world according to the  |Treaty_of_Tordesillas|Treaty_Of_Tordesillas|  in 1494.  They were the first states to set up colonies in America and European  |trading_posts|Factory|  along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar  |Ivan_the_Terrible|Ivan_The_Terrible|  conquered two major  |Tatar|Tatar|  khanates, the  |Khanate_of_Kazan|Khanate_Of_Kazan|  and the  |Astrakhan_Khanate|Astrakhan_Khanate| . The  |Yermaks|Yermak_Timofeyevich|  voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar  |Siberian_Khanate|Siberian_Khanate|  into Russia, and the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of  |Siberia|Siberia| , steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries. Oceanic explorations soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606 MacKnight, CC . The Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia.  |Melbourne_University_Press|Melbourne_University_Publishing| . and New Zealand in 1642.                  With the development of the  |printing_press|Printing_Press| , new ideas spread throughout Europe and challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  under German  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  questioned Papal authority. The most common dating of the Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published  The Ninety-Five Theses , and concludes in 1648 with the  |Treaty_of_Westphalia|Treaty_Of_Westphalia|  that ended years of  |European_religious_wars|European_Wars_Of_Religion| . Euan Cameron, The European Reformation     During this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| . It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  began to emerge as well like  |John_Calvin|John_Calvin|  whose  |Calvinism|Calvinism|  had influence in many countries and King  |Henry_VIII_of_England|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the  |Anglican_Church|Anglican_Church| ; his daughter  |Queen_Elizabeth|Elizabeth_I_Of_England|  finished the organization of the church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralised and powerful.     The Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the  |Counter-Reformation|Counter-Reformation| , which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the  |Jesuits|Jesuits| , who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of  |Saint_Philip_Neri|Saint_Philip_Neri| , who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the church institutions within their kingdoms.     Unlike many European countries, the  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|  and Hungary were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism, they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided among Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.     Another important development in this period was the growth of pan-European sentiments. Eméric Crucé came up with the idea of the  |European_Council|European_Council| , intended to end wars in Europe; attempts to create lasting peace were no success, although all European countries agreed to make peace in 1518 at the  |Treaty_of_London|Treaty_Of_London| . Many wars broke out again in a few years. The Reformation also made European peace impossible for many centuries.          Another development was the idea of European superiority. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: Discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as  |Montaigne|Michel_De_Montaigne|  that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a  |humanistic|Renaissance_Humanism|  interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised.  |Francis_Bacon|Francis_Bacon|  and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.  |1|Notes|  In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the  |New_Monarchs|New_Monarchs|  who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|  grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.                    The  |Iberian|Iberian_Peninsula|  states were able to dominate  |New_World|New_World|  colonial activity in the 16th century. The Spanish constituted the first global empire and during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, Spain was the most powerful nation in the world, but was increasingly challenged by  |British|British_Colonisation_Of_The_Americas| ,  |French|French_Colonisation_Of_The_Americas| , and the short-lived  |Dutch|New_Netherland|  and  |Swedish|New_Sweden|  colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries. New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of  |government|Federalism| ,  |law|Constitutionalism|  and economics necessary.     Colonial expansion continued in the following centuries . Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the  |Philippines|Philippines| ; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India ,  |Indochina|French_Indochina| , large parts of Africa and the Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the  |East_Indies|Indies|   and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.     This expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them.  |Trade|Mercantilism|  flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spains total budget.  The European countries fought wars that were largely paid for by the money coming in from the colonies. Nevertheless, the profits of the  |slave_trade|Slave_Tradethe_Americas|  and of plantations of the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| , then the most profitable of all the British colonies, amounted to less than 5% of the  |British_Empires|British_Empire|  economy at the time of the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  in the late 18th century.               The 17th century was an era of crisis.  Trevor Aston, ed. Crisis in Europe 1560–1660: Essays from Past and Present Many historians have rejected the idea, while others promote it as an invaluable insight into the warfare, politics, economics, Jan de Vries, The Economic Crisis of the Seventeenth Century after Fifty Years, Journal of Interdisciplinary History 402 pp. 151–94  and even art. Peter Burke, The Crisis in the Arts of the Seventeenth Century: A Crisis of Representation? Journal of Interdisciplinary History 402 pp. 239–61  The  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War|  focused attention on the massive horrors that wars could bring to entire populations. Peter H. Wilson, The Thirty Years War: Europes Tragedy The 1640s in particular saw more state breakdowns around the world than any previous or subsequent period. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the worlds first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe – for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker, a British historian, suggests that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially global cooling.

Max Beloff, The age of absolutism, 1660–1815 .     Throughout the early part of this period, capitalism  was replacing feudalism as the principal form of economic organisation, at least in the western half of Europe. The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a  |Commercial_Revolution|Commercial_Revolution| . The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  after 1750.     The Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the  |French_Wars_of_Religion|French_Wars_Of_Religion| , which ended in the triumph of the  |Bourbon_Dynasty|House_Of_Bourbon| . England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under  |Elizabeth|Elizabeth_I_Of_England|  to a moderate  |Anglicanism|Anglicanism| . Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|  is notable in this time for its  |religious_indifference|Religious_Tolerance|  and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.       The  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War|  was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighbouring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia. Peter H. Wilson, Europes Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War Beginning as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in  |Bohemia|Bohemia| , it quickly developed into a general war involving Catholics versus Protestants for the most part. The major impact of the war, in which  |mercenary|Mercenary|  armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and disease, and the breakup of family life, devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries| , the  |Crown_of_Bohemia|Crown_Of_Bohemia|  and northern parts of Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from disease and starvation, as well as postponed births. Henry Kamen, The Economic and Social Consequences of the Thirty Years War, Past and Present 391 pp. 44–61         After the  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia| , which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance,  |absolutism|Political_Absolutism|  became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War|  and particularly the  |Glorious_Revolution|Glorious_Revolution| . European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest,  |the_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|  gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the  |printing_press|Printing_Press| , created new secular forces in thought.        From the Union of Krewo central and eastern Europe was dominated by  |Kingdom_of_Poland|Kingdom_Of_Poland|  and  |Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania|Grand_Duchy_Of_Lithuania| . In the 16th and 17th centuries Central and Eastern Europe was an arena of conflict for domination of the continent between  |Sweden|Swedish_Empire| , the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth  and the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies: Russia, Prussia and Austria . By the turn of the 19th century they had become new powers, having  |divided_Poland|Partitions_Of_Poland|  between themselves, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation.       The  |War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War_Of_The_Spanish_Succession|  was a major war with France opposed by a coalition of England, the Netherlands, the Habsburg Monarchy, and Prussia.  |Duke_of_Marlborough|John_Churchill,_1St_Duke_Of_Marlborough|  commanded the English and Dutch victory at the  |Battle_of_Blenheim|Battle_Of_Blenheim|  in 1704. The main issue was whether France under King Louis XIV would take control of Spains very extensive possessions and thereby become by far the dominant power, or be forced to share power with other major nations. After initial allied successes, the long war produced a military stalemate and ended with the  |Treaty_of_Utrecht|Treaty_Of_Utrecht| , which was based on a balance of power in Europe. Historian  |Russell_Weigley|Russell_Weigley|  argues that the many wars almost never accomplished more than they cost. Russell Weigley, The Age of Battles: The Quest for Decisive Warfare from Breitenfeld to Waterloo . British historian  |G._M._Trevelyan|G._M._Trevelyan|  argues:   :That Treaty which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large – the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain. G.M. Trevelyan, A shortened history of England p. 363.        |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_The_Great| , king of Prussia 1740–86, modernized the  |Prussian_army|Prussian_Army| , introduced new tactical and strategic concepts, fought mostly successful wars  and doubled the size of Prussia. Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he fought total wars for limited objectives. The goal was to convince rival kings that it was better to negotiate and make peace than to fight him.  Dennis E. Showalter, The Wars of Frederick the Great       Russia with its numerous wars and rapid expansion  was in a continuous state of financial crisis, which it covered by borrowing from Amsterdam and issuing paper money that caused inflation. Russia boasted a  |large_and_powerful_army|Imperial_Russian_Army| , a very large and complex internal bureaucracy, and a splendid court that rivaled Paris and London. However the government was living far beyond its means and seized  |Church|Russian_Orthodox_Church|  lands, leaving organized religion in a weak condition. Throughout the 18th century Russia remained a poor, backward, overwhelmingly agricultural, and illiterate country. Nicholas Riasanovsky, A History of Russia , p. 284             The Enlightenment was a powerful, widespread cultural movement of intellectuals beginning in late 17th-century Europe emphasizing the power of  |reason|Reason|  rather than tradition; it was especially favourable to science and hostile to religious orthodoxy . Margaret C.C. Jacob, The Enlightenment: A Brief History with Documents It sought to analyze and reform society using reason, to challenge ideas grounded in tradition and faith, and to advance knowledge through the  |scientific_method|Scientific_Method| . It promoted scientific thought, skepticism, and intellectual interchange. Alan Charles Kors, Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment The Enlightenment was a revolution in human thought. This new way of thinking was that rational thought begins with clearly stated principles, uses correct logic to arrive at conclusions, tests the conclusions against evidence, and then revises the principles in light of the evidence.      Enlightenment thinkers opposed superstition. Some Enlightenment thinkers collaborated with  |Enlightened_despots|Enlightened_Absolutism| , absolutist rulers who attempted to forcibly impose some of the new ideas about government into practice. The ideas of the Enlightenment exerted significant influence on the culture, politics, and governments of Europe. Geoffrey Bruun, The enlightened despots .     Originating in the 17th century, it was sparked by philosophers  |Francis_Bacon|Francis_Bacon|  ,  |Baruch_Spinoza|Baruch_Spinoza|  ,  |John_Locke|John_Locke|  ,  |Pierre_Bayle|Pierre_Bayle|  ,  |Voltaire|Voltaire|  ,  |Francis_Hutcheson|Francis_Hutcheson| , ,  |David_Hume|David_Hume|  and physicist  |Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  . Sootin, Harry. Isaac Newton. New York, Messner . Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered these figures and even attempted to apply their ideas of government in what was known as  |enlightened_absolutism|Enlightened_Absolutism| . The  |Scientific_Revolution|Scientific_Revolution|  is closely tied to the Enlightenment, as its discoveries overturned many traditional concepts and introduced new perspectives on nature and mans place within it. The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790–1800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to  |Romanticism|Romanticism| , which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a  |Counter-Enlightenment|Counter-Enlightenment|  began to increase in prominence. The Romantics argued that the Enlightenment was  |reductionistic|Reductionistic|  insofar as it had largely ignored the forces of imagination, mystery, and sentiment.      In France, Enlightenment was based in the  |salons|Salon|  and culminated in the great  Encyclopédie  edited by  |Denis_Diderot|Denis_Diderot|  and  |Jean_le_Rond_dAlembert|Jean_Le_Rond_Dalembert|  with contributions by hundreds of leading intellectuals who were called  philosophes  , notably  |Voltaire|Voltaire|  ,  |Rousseau|Jean-Jacques_Rousseau|  and  |Montesquieu|Charles_De_Secondat,_Baron_De_Montesquieu|  . Some 25,000 copies of the 35 volume encyclopedia were sold, half of them outside France. These new intellectual strains would spread to urban centres across Europe, notably England, Scotland, the German states, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Italy, Austria, and Spain, as well as  |Britains_American_colonies.|Thirteen_Colonies|      The political ideals of the Enlightenment influenced the  |American_Declaration_of_Independence|American_Declaration_Of_Independence| , the  |United_States_Bill_of_Rights|United_States_Bill_Of_Rights| , the French  |Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen|Declaration_Of_The_Rights_Of_Man_And_Of_The_Citizen| , and the Polish–Lithuanian  |Constitution_of_3_May_1791|Constitution_Of_3_May_1791| .

Eighteenth-Century Life 201 : 80–92.      The great enemy of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Austria, Spain and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between supporters of the Church versus active Masons.

The  |long_19th_century|The_Long_19Th_Century|  , from 1789 to 1914 saw the drastic social, political and economic changes initiated by the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  and the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| . Following the reorganisation of the political map of Europe at the  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  in 1815, Europe experienced the rise of Nationalism, the rise of the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  and the peak of the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , which was paralleled by the  |decline_of_the_Ottoman_Empire|Decline_Of_The_Ottoman_Empire| . Finally, the rise of the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  and the  |Austro-Hungarian_Empire|Austro-Hungarian_Empire|  initiated the course of events that culminated in the outbreak of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  in 1914.                The Industrial Revolution was a period in the late 18th century and early 19th century when major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transport affected  |socioeconomic|Socioeconomics|  and cultural conditions in Britain and subsequently spread throughout Europe and North America and eventually the world, a process that continues as industrialisation. Technological advancements, most notably the invention of the steam engine by Scottish engineer James Watt, were major catalysts in the industrialisation of Britain and, later, the wider world. It started in England and Scotland in the mid-18th century with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of  |canals|Canal| , improved roads and railways. The introduction of  |steam_power|Steam_Engine|  and powered machinery  underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. Business and Economics. Leading Issues in Economic Development, Oxford University Press US.   The development of all-metal  |machine_tools|Machine_Tool|  in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world. The impact of this change on society was enormous. Russell Brown, Lester. , James & James / Earthscan.           Historians  |R.R._Palmer|R.R._Palmer|  and  |Joel_Colton|Joel_Colton|  argue:   :In 1789 France fell into revolution, and the world has never since been the same. The French Revolution was by far the most momentous upheaval of the whole revolutionary age. It replaced the old regime with modern society, and at its extreme phase became very radical, so much so that all later revolutionary movements have looked back to it as a predecessor to themselves.... From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive. R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, A History of the Modern World , p. 341     The era of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars was a difficult time for monarchs. Tsar  |Paul_I_of_Russia|Paul_I_Of_Russia|  was assassinated; King  |Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis_Xvi_Of_France|  was executed, as was his queen  |Marie_Antoinette|Marie_Antoinette| .

Steven Englund, Napoleon: A Political Life p. 388     The  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution|  was the first successful revolt of a colony against a European power. It proclaimed, in the words of  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| , that all men are created equal, a position based on the principles of the Enlightenment. It rejected aristocracy and established a  |republican_form_of_government|Republicanism|  under  |George_Washington|George_Washington|  that attracted worldwide attention. Gordon S. Wood, The radicalism of the American Revolution .     The French Revolution was a product of the same democratic forces in the  |Atlantic_World|Atlantic_World|  and had an even greater impact. R.R. Palmer, The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800: The Challenge pp. 4–5  |French_historian_François_Aulard|François_Victor_Alphonse_Aulard|  says:   :From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.           French intervention in the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War|  had nearly bankrupted the state. After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, King  |Louis_XVI|Louis_Xvi_Of_France|  had to convene the  |Estates-General|Estates-General_Of_1789| , a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a  |National_Assembly|National_Assembly|  and swore an  |oath|Tennis_Court_Oath|  not to dissolve until France had a constitution and created, in July, the  |National_Constituent_Assembly|National_Constituent_Assembly| . At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the  |Bastille|Bastille|  prison on 14 July 1789.     At the time the assembly wanted to create a  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , and over the following two years passed various laws including the  |Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen|Declaration_Of_The_Rights_Of_Man_And_Of_The_Citizen| , the  |abolition_of_feudalism|Abolition_Of_Feudalism_In_France| , and a  |fundamental_change|Civil_Constitution_Of_The_Clergy|  in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people. As anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king tried to flee and join Frances enemies. He was captured and on 21 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was guillotined.     On 20 September 1792 the  |National_Convention|National_Convention|  abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of  |war|French_Revolutionary_Wars| , the National Convention created the  |Committee_of_Public_Safety|Committee_Of_Public_Safety| , controlled by  |Maximilien_de_Robespierre|Maximilien_De_Robespierre|  of the  |Jacobin_Club|Jacobin_Club| , to act as the countrys executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the  |Reign_of_Terror|Reign_Of_Terror| , during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the  |Revolutionary_Tribunal|Revolutionary_Tribunal| , often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example  |Madame_Roland|Madame_Roland|  and  |Georges_Danton|Georges_Danton| . Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary  |insurrections|War_In_The_Vendée|  were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the  |coup_of_9_Thermidor|Thermidorian_Reaction|  and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierres more extreme policies.             |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon|  was one of the worlds most famous soldiers and statesmen, leading France to great victories over numerous European enemies. Despite modest origins he became Emperor and restructured much of European diplomacy, politics and law, until he was forced to abdicate in 1814. His 100-day comeback in 1815 failed at the  |Battle_of_Waterloo|Battle_Of_Waterloo| , and he died in exile on a remote island, remembered as a great hero by many Frenchmen and as a great villain by British and other enemies.     Napoleon, despite his youth, was Frances most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of  |Italy|Italy|  and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on  |18_Brumaire|18_Brumaire|  he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the  |Consulate|French_Consulate| , which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself  |Emperor|First_French_Empire| . In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria , forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the  |Battle_of_Trafalgar|Battle_Of_Trafalgar| , ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at  |Austerlitz|Battle_Of_Austerlitz| , forcing Austrias withdrawal from the coalition  and dissolving the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . In 1806, a  |Fourth_Coalition|Fourth_Coalition|  was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the  |Battle_of_Jena-Auerstedt|Battle_Of_Jena-Auerstedt| , marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at  |Friedland|Battle_Of_Friedland| . The  |Treaties_of_Tilsit|Treaties_Of_Tilsit|  divided Europe between France and Russia and created the  |Duchy_of_Warsaw|Duchy_Of_Warsaw| .          On 12 June 1812 Napoleon  |invaded_Russia|French_Invasion_Of_Russia|  with a  |Grande_Armée|Grande_Armée|  of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at  |Smolensk|Battle_Of_Smolensk|  and  |Borodino|Battle_Of_Borodino|  Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by  |Cossacks|Cossacks| , and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a  |seven_nation_army|Sixth_Coalition|  at the  |Battle_of_Leipzig|Battle_Of_Leipzig|  in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the  |Six_Days_Campaign|Six_Days_Campaign|  and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of  |Elba|Elba| . He returned to France on 1 March 1815 , raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the  |Battle_of_Waterloo|Battle_Of_Waterloo|  on 18 June 1815 and exiled to a small British island in the South Atlantic.          Roberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4 million deaths ; 1.4 million were French deaths. Andrew Roberts, Why Napoleon merits the title the Great, BBC History Magazine     Outside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power. Roberts, Why Napoleon merits the title the Great, BBC History Magazine     Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised  |property_laws|Property_Law| , ended  |seigneurial_dues|Manorialism| , abolished the  |guild|Guild|  of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised of divorce, closed the  |Jewish_ghettos|Ghetto|  and made Jews equal to everyone else. The  |Inquisition|Spanish_Inquisition|  ended as did the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and  |equality_under_the_law|Equality_Before_The_Law|  was proclaimed for all men. Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton, A History of the Modern World , pp. 428–29.     In foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven. Andrew Roberts, Why Napoleon merits the title the Great, BBC History Magazine France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 . It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler. William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution pp. 341–68 Steven T. Ross, European Diplomatic History, 1789–1815: France Against Europe     Napoleon conquered most of  |Italy|Italy|  in the name of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He consolidated old units and split up Austrias holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleons  |Cisalpine_Republic|Cisalpine_Republic|  was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small  |Ligurian_Republic|Ligurian_Republic|  around Genoa. The  |Neapolitan_Republic|Parthenopean_Republic|  was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the  |Kingdom_of_Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy| , with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the  |Batavian_Republic|Batavian_Republic| , and Switzerland into the  |Helvetic_Republic|Helvetic_Republic| . All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleons wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France. Alexander Grab, Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe pp. 62–65, 78–79, 88–96, 115–17, 154–59     Most of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:   :For nearly two decades the  |Italians|Italians|  had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality. Frederick B. Artz, Reaction and Revolution: 1814–1832  pp. 142–43     Likewise in  |Switzerland|History_Of_Switzerland|  the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:   :It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages , suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works. William Martin, Histoire de la Suisse , pp. 187–88, quoted in Crane Brinson, A Decade of Revolution: 1789–1799 p. 235     The greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized – new names were given, left and right for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.     British historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler . Max Hastings, Everything Is Owed to Glory,           By the 19th century, governments increasingly took over traditional religious roles, paying much more attention to efficiency and uniformity than to religiosity. Secular bodies took control of education away from the churches, abolished taxes and tithes for the support of established religions, and excluded bishops from the upper houses. Secular laws increasingly regulated marriage and divorce, and maintaining birth and death registers became the duty of local officials. Although the numerous religious denominations in the United States founded many colleges and universities, that was almost exclusively a state function across Europe. Imperial powers protected Christian missionaries in African and Asian colonies.  |James_Harvey_Robinson|James_Harvey_Robinson|  and  |Charles_A._Beard|Charles_A._Beard| , ‘’The Development of Modern Europe Volume II The Merging of European into World History’’ v. 2 pp 88-89.  In France and other largely Catholic nations, anti-clerical political movements tried to reduce the role of the Catholic Church. Likewise briefly in Germany in the 1870s there was a fierce  |Kulturkampf|Kulturkampf|  against Catholics, but the Catholics successfully fought back. The Catholic Church concentrated more power in the papacy and fought against secularism and socialism. It sponsored devotional reforms that gained wide support among the churchgoers. Kenneth Scott Latourette, Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, Volume I: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: Background and the Roman Catholic Phase pp. 321-23, 370, 458-59, 464-66.     Historian  |Kenneth_Scott_Latourette|Kenneth_Scott_Latourette|  argues that the outlook for Protestantism at the start of the 19th century was discouraging. It was a regional religion based in northwestern Europe, with an outpost in the sparsely settled United States. It was closely allied with government, as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Prussia, and especially Great Britain. The alliance came at the expense of independence, as the government made the basic policy decisions, down to such details as the salaries of ministers and location of new churches. The dominant intellectual currents of the Enlightenment promoted rationalism, and most Protestant leaders preached a sort of deism. Intellectually, the new methods of historical and anthropological study undermine automatic acceptance of biblical stories, as did the sciences of geology and biology. Industrialization was a strongly negative factor, as workers who moved to the city seldom joined churches. The gap between the church and the unchurched grew rapidly, and secular forces, based both in socialism and liberalism undermine the prestige of religion. Despite the negative forces, Protestantism demonstrated a striking vitality by 1900. Shrugging off Enlightenment rationalism, Protestants embraced  |romanticism|Romanticism| , with the stress on the personal and the invisible. Entirely fresh ideas as expressed by  |Friedrich_Schleiermacher|Friedrich_Schleiermacher| ,  |Soren_Kierkegaard|Soren_Kierkegaard| ,  |Albrecht_Ritschl|Albrecht_Ritschl|  and  |Adolf_von_Harnack|Adolf_Von_Harnack|  restored the intellectual power of theology. There was more attention to historic creeds such as the Augsburg, the Heidelberg, and the Westminster confessions. In England, Anglicans emphasize the historically Catholic components of their heritage, as the High Church element reintroduced vestments and incense into their rituals. The stirrings of  |pietism|Pietism|  on the Continent, and  |evangelicalism|Evangelicalism|  in Britain expanded enormously, leading the devout away from an emphasis on formality and ritual and toward an inner sensibility toward personal relationship to Christ. Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service. Above all, worldwide missionary activity became a highly prized goal, proving quite successful in close cooperation with the imperialism of the British, German, and Dutch empires. Kenneth Scott Latourette, Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches pp. 428–31                      The political development of nationalism and the push for  |popular_sovereignty|Popular_Sovereignty|  culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe.

It was renamed  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia| , which was never able to tame the multiple nationalities and religions and it flew apart in civil war in the 1990s.          The Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain.

Most European states had become  |constitutional|Constitutional_Monarchy|  monarchies by 1871, and Germany and Italy merged many small city-states to become united nation-states. Germany in particular increasingly dominated the continent in terms of economics and political power. Meanwhile, on a global scale, Great Britain, with its far-flung  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , unmatched Royal Navy, and powerful bankers, became the worlds first global power. The sun never set on its territories, while an informal empire operated through British financiers, entrepreneurs, traders and engineers who established operations in many countries, and largely dominated Latin America.
