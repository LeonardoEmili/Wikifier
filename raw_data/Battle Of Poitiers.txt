                    The Battle of Poitiers was a major English victory in the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War| . It was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaillé, near the city of  |Poitiers|Poitiers|  in  |Aquitaine|Aquitaine| , western France.  |Edward,_the_Black_Prince|Edward,_The_Black_Prince| , led an army of  |English|Kingdom_Of_England| ,  |Welsh|Principality_Of_Wales| ,  |Breton|Duchy_Of_Brittany|  and  |Gascon|Duchy_Of_Gascony|  troops, many of them veterans of the  |Battle_of_Crécy|Battle_Of_Crécy| . They were attacked by a larger French force led by King  |John_II_of_France|John_Ii_Of_France| , which included allied  |Scottish|Kingdom_Of_Scotland|  forces. The French were heavily defeated; an English counter-attack captured King John II along with  |his_youngest_son|Philip_The_Bold|  and much of the French nobility.     The effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving  |Dauphin_Charles|Charles_V_Of_France|  to rule the country. Charles faced  |populist_revolts_across_the_kingdom|Jacquerie|  in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war ended four years later in 1360,  |on_favourable_terms_for_England|Treaty_Of_Brétigny| .     Poitiers was the second major English victory of the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War| . Poitiers was fought ten years after the  |Battle_of_Crécy|Battle_Of_Crécy|  , and about half a century before the third, the  |Battle_of_Agincourt|Battle_Of_Agincourt|  . The town and battle were often referred to as Poictiers in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated in  |several_warships_of_the_Royal_Navy|Hms_Poictiers| .        Following the death of  |Charles_IV_of_France|Charles_Iv_Of_France|  in 1328,  |Philip|Philip_Vi_Of_France| , Count of Valois, had been crowned as his successor, over his closest male relative and legal successor,  |Edward_III_of_England|Edward_Iii_Of_England| . Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to Philip in his role as  |Duke_of_Aquitaine|Duke_Of_Aquitaine| , resulting in Philips confiscating those lands in 1337 and precipitating war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself  |King_of_France|King_Of_France| . The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the war at the  |Battle_of_Sluys|Battle_Of_Sluys|  in 1340, Henri de Wailly. Introduction by Emmanuel Bourassin, Crecy 1346: Anatomy of a Battle p. 10 devastated the French in south west France with the  |Gascon_campaigns_of_1345|Gascon_Campaign_Of_1345|  and  |1346|Lancasters_Chevauchée_Of_1346| , inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at  |Crécy|Battle_Of_Crécy|  in 1346, and  |captured_Calais_in_1347|Siege_Of_Calais| .     In the late 1340s and early 1350s, the  |Black_Death|Black_Death|  devastated the population of Western Europe, bringing all significant efforts in campaigning to a halt, while  |Philip_VI_of_France|Philip_Vi_Of_France|  himself died as well. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son,  |Edward,_the_Black_Prince|Edward,_The_Black_Prince| , now an experienced soldier following the Crécy campaign, landed at  |Bordeaux|Bordeaux|  in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to  |Carcassonne|Carcassonne| . Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the  |Duke_of_Lancaster|Henry_Of_Grosmont,_1St_Duke_Of_Lancaster|  led an army through  |Normandy|Normandy| , while Edward led his army on a great  |chevauchée|Chevauchée|  from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356. William W. Lace, The Hundred Years War , 1/1994     Edwards forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the  |Loire|Loire|  river at  |Tours|Tours| . They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed  |King_John_II|John_Ii_Of_France|  to attempt to pin down and destroy Edwards army. John, who had been besieging  |Breteuil|Breteuil,_Eure|  in  |Normandy|Normandy| , organised the bulk of his army at  |Chartres|Chartres|  to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his armys march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux. Jonathan Sumption, The Hundred Years War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire , pp. 223, 227–228 The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south. Historians disagree over whether the outnumbered English commander was seeking battle or trying to avoid it.  In any case, after preliminary manoeuvres and failed negotiations for a truce, the two armies faced-off, both ready for battle, near  |Poitiers|Poitiers|  on Monday, 19 September 1356.              Edward arrayed his army in a defensive posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, in front of the forest of Nouaillé. He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, his army leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English. The English gained vantage points on the natural high ground in order for their longbowmen to have an advantage over the heavily armoured French troops.       The English army was led by  |Edward,_the_Black_Prince|Edward,_The_Black_Prince| , and composed primarily of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of  |Gascon|Duchy_Of_Gascony|  and  |Breton|Duchy_Of_Brittany|  soldiers with the army. Edwards army consisted of approximately 2,000  |longbow|Longbow| men, 3,000  |men-at-arms|Men-At-Arms| , and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.     Like the earlier engagement at  |Crécy|Battle_Of_Crécy| , the power of the English army lay in the  |longbow|Longbow| , a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as  |Falkirk|Battle_Of_Falkirk|  in 1298,  |Halidon_Hill|Battle_Of_Halidon_Hill|  in 1333, and  |Crécy|Battle_Of_Crécy|  in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War|  attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.         |Geoffrey_the_Baker|Geoffrey_The_Baker|  wrote that the English archers under the Earl of Salisbury made their arrows prevail over the knights armour , Edward Maunde Thompson, Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker, p. 147                     .
