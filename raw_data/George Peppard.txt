During 1948 and 1949, he studied  |civil_engineering|Civil_Engineering|  at  |Purdue_University|Purdue_University|  where he was a member of the Purdue Playmakers theatre troupe and  |Beta_Theta_Pi|Beta_Theta_Pi|  fraternity. He then transferred to Carnegie Institute of Technology  in  |Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh| , Pennsylvania, where he earned his  |bachelors_degree|Bachelors_Degree|  in 1955.  He also trained at the  |Pittsburgh_Playhouse|Pittsburgh_Playhouse| .      In addition to acting, Peppard was a pilot. He spent a portion of his 1966 honeymoon training to fly his  |Learjet|Learjet|  in  |Wichita_Kansas|Wichita_Kansas| .         Peppard made his stage debut in 1949 at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. After moving to  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , Peppard enrolled in the  |Actors_Studio|Actors_Studio| , where he studied  |the_Method|Method_Acting|  with  |Lee_Strasberg|Lee_Strasberg| . He did a variety of jobs to pay his way during this time, such as working as a disc jockey, being a radio station engineer, teaching fencing, driving a taxi and being a mechanic in a motorcycle repair shop.      He worked in summer stock in New England and appeared at the open air  |Oregon_Shakespeare_Festival|Oregon_Shakespeare_Festival|  in  |Ashland_Oregon|Ashland_Oregon| .     His first work on  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  led to his first television appearance, with  |Paul_Newman|Paul_Newman| , in  The United States Steel Hour  , as the singing, guitar-playing baseball player Piney Woods in  Bang the Drum Slowly .     He made his film debut in  The Strange One  .       Peppard had signed to play a role on Broadway in  The Pleasure of His Company  when he auditioned successfully for MGMs  Home from the Hill  . He ended up appearing in Pleasure of His Company for six months before making Home from the Hill. Part of the arrangement of the latter involved signing with MGM for a long term contract.      Home from the Hill was a prestigious film directed by  |Vincente_Minnelli|Vincente_Minnelli|  and starring  |Robert_Mitchum|Robert_Mitchum| , who played Peppards father. It was a success at the box office, although the films high cost meant that it was not profitable.     Peppards next film for MGM was  The Subterraneans , an adaptation of  |the_1958_novel|The_Subterraneans|  by  |Jack_Kerouac|Jack_Kerouac| . It flopped and Peppard said I couldnt get arrested afterwards.           His good looks, elegant manner and superior acting skills landed Peppard his most famous film role as Paul Varjak in  Breakfast at Tiffanys  with  |Audrey_Hepburn|Audrey_Hepburn| , based on a story by  |Truman_Capote|Truman_Capote| . This 1961 role boosted him briefly to a major film star.     That year a newspaper article dubbed him the next big thing . Peppard said he had turned down two TV series and was focused on being a film star. His contract with MGM was for two pictures a year, allowing for one outside film and six TV appearances a year, plus the right to star in a play every second year.      He was meant to appear in Unarmed in Paradise which was not made.  Instead MGM cast him in the lead of their epic western  How the West Was Won  in 1962 . It was a massive hit.     He followed this with a war story for  |Carl_Foreman|Carl_Foreman| ,  The Victors  in 1963, then, most notably,  The Carpetbaggers , a 150-minute saga of a ruthless, Hughes-like aviation and film mogul based on a best-selling novel by  |Harold_Robbins|Harold_Robbins| . It turned out to be one of the biggest box-office hits of 1964.     My performances bore me , said Peppard in a 1964 interview, adding that his ambition was to deliver one great performance. And I must say I feel a little presumptuous to shoot for that. But thats the goal, like a hockey goal. I figure Ive got a choice ... not of the outcome but of the objective. And my objective is that one performance.      For MGM he appeared in  Operation Crossbow . He was meant to follow this with an adaptation of the play  Merrily We Roll Along  but it was never made.      Peppard started choosing tough-guy roles in big, ambitious pictures where he was somewhat overshadowed by ensemble casts; for example, his role as German pilot Bruno Stachel, an obsessively competitive officer from humble beginnings who challenges the  |Prussian_aristocracy|Junker|  during  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  in  The Blue Max  . For this role, Peppard earned a private pilots license and did much of his own stunt flying, although stunt pilot  |Derek_Piggott|Derek_Piggott|  was at the controls for the famous under-the-bridge scene.     Im an actor not a star, he said around this time, adding that he looked for three things in a film, a good director, a good part and a good script. If I get two out of three of those Im satisfied. By, K. H. . Im an actor, not a star. The Christian Science Monitor Retrieved from  He was cast as the lead in  Sands of the Kalahari  but walked off the set after only a few days of filming.      Film critic  |David_Shipman|David_Shipman|  writes of this stage in his career:          A string of Peppard films that followed made little or no impact, including  Tobruk ,  P.J. ,  The Executioner ,  House of Cards  and  One More Train to Rob , as well as a romantic comedy called  Whats So Bad About Feeling Good? , co-starring  |Mary_Tyler_Moore|Mary_Tyler_Moore| .     In 1968 he announced he had co-written a script Watch Them Die, which he planned to direct, but not play a starring role.  It was never made.     Among other disappointments during this period were a pair of westerns, 1970s  Cannon for Cordoba , in which Peppard played the steely Captain Rod Douglas, who has been put in charge of gathering a group of soldiers on a dangerous mission into Mexico, and 1967s  Rough Night in Jericho  in which he was billed over  |Dean_Martin|Dean_Martin|  and  |Jean_Simmons|Jean_Simmons| , a reflection of his status at that time in his career.       Peppard then decided to turn to television. After developing projects for two years, including making a number of pilots, he had a notable success with  Banacek  , part of  The NBC Mystery Movie  series, starring in 90-minute whodunits as a wealthy Boston playboy who solves thefts for insurance companies for a finders fee.  Sixteen regular episodes were produced over two seasons. Both have been released on DVD along with the pilot episode. He also delivered one of his most critically acclaimed, though rarely seen, performances in the TV movie Guilty or Innocent: The Sam Sheppard Murder Case , as  |Sam_Sheppard|Sam_Sheppard| .     Peppard appeared in the short-lived  Doctors Hospital  and several other television films. He starred in the 1977 science-fiction film  Damnation Alley , which has gone on to attain a substantial cult following. Peppards role in the film was reportedly turned down by  |Steve_McQueen|Steve_Mcqueen|  because of salary issues. With fewer interesting roles coming his way, he acted in, directed and produced the drama  Five Days from Home  in 1979.       Peppard later said the low point of his career came over a three-year period around the time of Five Days from Home. It was a bad time , he said. I was heavily in debt. My career seemed to be going nowhere. Not much work over a three-year period. Every morning Id wake up and realize I was getting deeper and deeper into debt .      He had to sell his car and take out a second mortgage on his home to finance Five Days from Home. Eventually, he got his money back and was able to concentrate on his career.     In a rare game show appearance, Peppard did a week of shows on  Password Plus  in 1979, in which he could often be seen smoking cigarettes while filming. Out of five shows, the first was never broadcast on  |NBC|Nbc| , but aired much later on  |GSN|Game_Show_Network|  and  |Buzzr|Buzzr| , because of on-camera comments made by Peppard regarding personal dissatisfaction he felt related to his treatment by the NBC officials who supervised the production of Password Plus.      Dynasty |Blake_Carrington|Blake_Carrington|  in the television series  Dynasty . During the filming of the pilot episode, which also featured  |Linda_Evans|Linda_Evans|  and  |Bo_Hopkins|Bo_Hopkins| , Peppard repeatedly clashed with the shows producers,  |Richard_and_Esther_Shapiro|Richard_And_Esther_Shapiro| ; among other things, he felt that his role was too similar to that of  |J_R_Ewing|J_R_Ewing|  in the series  Dallas . Three weeks later, before filming was to begin on additional episodes, Peppard was fired and the part was offered to  |John_Forsythe|John_Forsythe| ; the scenes with Peppard were re-shot and Forsythe became the permanent star of the show.      It was a big blow, Peppard noted subsequently, adding he felt Forsythe ultimately did a better job than I could have done. Ironically, this led to him being available to be cast in NBCs The A-Team, the number one rated television show in its first season in 1982.     The A-Team The A-Team , acting alongside  |Mr_T|Mr_T| ,  |Dirk_Benedict|Dirk_Benedict|  and  |Dwight_Schultz|Dwight_Schultz| . In the series, the A-Team was a team of renegade commandos on the run from the military for a crime they did not commit while serving in the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| . The A-Team members made their collective living as  |soldiers_of_fortune|Mercenary| , but they helped only people who came to them with justified grievances.     As Hannibal Smith, Peppard played the leader of the A-Team, distinguished by his cigar smoking, confident smirk, black  |leather_gloves|Glove| , disguises, and distinctive catch phrase, I love it when a plan comes together. The show ran five seasons on  |NBC|Nbc|  from 1983 to 1987, made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. It has been reported that the role was originally written with  |James_Coburn|James_Coburn|  in mind, but Coburn declined, and thus it went to Peppard. Peppard was reportedly annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship, refused to speak directly to Mr. T. Instead he sent messages through intermediaries , and for this, Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player.        In his later years Peppard appeared in several stage productions. In 1988 he portrayed  |Ernest_Hemingway|Ernest_Hemingway|  in the play PAPA, which played a number of cities including  |Boise_Idaho|Boise_Idaho| ;  |Atlanta_Georgia|Atlanta_Georgia| ; and  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco| .

In 1992 he toured in  The Lion in Winter , in which he played  |Henry_II|Henry_Ii_Of_England|  to  |Susan_Clarks|Susan_Clark| |_Eleanor_of_Aquitaine|Eleanor_Of_Aquitaine| .

The second film Man Against the Mob: The Chinatown Murders was broadcast in December 1989. A third film in this series was planned, but Peppard died before it was filmed.

The cemetery was subsequently restored.        Peppard overcame a serious alcohol problem in 1978; subsequently then became deeply involved in helping other alcoholics.
