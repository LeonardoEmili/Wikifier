                  Ich bin ein Berliner   is a speech by  |United_States_President|President_Of_The_United_States| |_John_F_Kennedy|John_F_Kennedy|  given on June 26, 1963, in  |West_Berlin|West_Berlin| . It is widely regarded as the best-known speech of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  and the most famous  |anti_communist|Anti_Communist|  speech. Kennedy aimed to underline the support of the United States for  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  22 months after  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| -occupied  |East_Germany|East_Germany|  erected the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall|  to prevent  |mass_emigration|Republikflucht|  to the West. The message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. Another phrase in the speech was also spoken in German,  Lasst sie nach Berlin kommen  , addressed at those who claimed we can work with the Communists , a remark at which  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev|  scoffed only days later.     The speech is considered one of Kennedys best, both a notable moment of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  and a high point of the  |New_Frontier|New_Frontier| . It was a great morale boost for West Berliners, who lived in an  |enclave|Enclave|  deep inside  |East_Germany|East_Germany|  and feared a possible East German occupation. Speaking from a platform erected on the steps of  |Rathaus_Schöneberg|Rathaus_Schöneberg|  for an audience of 450,000, Kennedy said,          Kennedy used the phrase twice in his speech, including at the end, pronouncing the sentence with his  |Boston_accent|Boston_Accent|  and reading from his note ish bin ein Bearleener , which he had written out using English orthography to approximate the German pronunciation. He also used  |classical_Latin_pronunciation|Latin_Pronunciation|  of civis romanus sum, with the c pronounced  and the v as .     There is  |a_widespread_misconception|Ich_Bin_Ein_Berliner_Im_A_Doughnut_Urban_Legend|  that the phrase was not used correctly and actually means Im a doughnut , referring to the  |Berliner_doughnut|Berliner| . It has even been embellished into an urban legend, including equally incorrect claims about the audience laughing at this phrase.                Germanys capital, Berlin, was deep within the area controlled after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  by the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . Initially governed in four sectors controlled by the four  |Allied|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  powers , tensions of the Cold War escalated until the Soviet forces implemented the  |Berlin_Blockade|Berlin_Blockade| , which the Western allies relieved with the dramatic  |airlift|Berlin_Airlift| . Afterward, the sectors controlled by the  |NATO|Nato|  Allies became an effective  |exclave|Exclave|  of  |West_Germany|West_Germany| , completely surrounded by East Germany. From 1952, the border between East and West was closed everywhere but in Berlin. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans  |defected|Defection|  to the West via West Berlin, a labour drain that threatened East Germany with economic collapse.     In 1961, the East German government under  |Walter_Ulbricht|Walter_Ulbricht|  erected a barbed-wire barrier around West Berlin, officially called the antifaschistischer Schutzwall . The East German authorities argued that it was meant to prevent spies and agents of West Germany from crossing into the East. However, it was universally known as the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall|  and its real purpose was to keep East German citizens from escaping to the West. Over a period of months the wall was rebuilt using concrete, and buildings were demolished to create a death zone in view of East German guards armed with  |machine_guns|Machine_Gun| . The Wall closed the biggest loophole in the Iron Curtain, and Berlin went from being one of the easiest places to cross from East Europe to West Europe to being one of the most difficult. Keeling, Drew ,      The West, including the U.S., was accused of failing to respond forcefully to the erection of the Wall. Officially, Berlin was under joint occupation by the four allied powers, each with primary responsibility for a certain zone. Kennedys speech marked the first instance where the U.S. acknowledged that  |East_Berlin|East_Berlin|  was part of the  |Soviet_bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  along with the rest of East Germany. On July 25, 1961, Kennedy insisted in a presidential address that the U.S. would defend West Berlin, asserting its  |Four_Power_rights|Potsdam_Agreement| , while making it clear that challenging the Soviet presence in Germany was not possible.              The Ich bin ein Berliner speech is in part derived from a speech Kennedy gave at a Civic Reception on May 4, 1962, in  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans| ; there also he used the phrase civis Romanus sum by saying Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was to say, I am a citizen of Rome. Today, I believe, in 1962 the proudest boast is to say, I am a citizen of the United States. And it is not enough to merely say it; we must live it. Anyone can say it. But Americans who serve today in West Berlin—your sons and brothers -- are the Americans who are bearing the great burden.  The phrases I am a Berliner and I am proud to be in Berlin were typed already a week before the speech on a list of expressions to be used, including a phonetic transcription of the German translation. Such transcriptions are also found in the third draft of the speech , from June 25. The final typed version of the speech does not contain the transcriptions, which are added by hand by Kennedy himself.     In practice sessions before the trip, Kennedy had run through a number of sentences, even paragraphs, to recite in German; in these sessions, he was helped by Margaret Plischke, a translator working for the US State Department; by  |Ted_Sorensen|Ted_Sorensen| , Kennedys counsel and habitual speechwriter; and by an interpreter,  |Robert_Lochner|Robert_Lochner| , who had grown up in Berlin. It became clear quickly that the president did not have a gift for languages and was more likely to embarrass himself if he was to cite in German for any length.     But there are differing accounts on the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner. Plischke wrote a 1997 account Her letter to  American Heritage  is printed anonymously; however, in the first-person story the writer refers to herself as Mrs. Plischke from the Foreign Service Institute. Additionally, she is named as Margarethe Plischke in  by W. R. Smyser, p. 217. Retrieved 2011-05-23. of visiting Kennedy at the White House weeks before the trip to help compose the speech and teach him the proper pronunciation; she also claims that the phrase had been translated stateside already by the translator scheduled to accompany him on the trip .  Additionally, Ted Sorensen claimed in his memoir Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History to have had a hand in the speech, and said he had incorrectly inserted the word ein, incorrectly taking responsibility for the  |jelly_doughnut_misconception_below|Ich_Bin_Ein_Berliner_Im_A_Doughnut_Urban_Legend| , a claim apparently supported by Berlin mayor  |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt|  but dismissed by later scholars since the final typed version, which does not contain the words, is the last one Sorensen could have worked on. Robert Lochner claimed in his memoirs that Kennedy had asked him for a translation of I am a Berliner , and that they practiced the phrase in Brandts office. Daum credited the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner to Kennedy and his 1962 speech in New Orleans quoted above. According to Daum, Kennedy was affected by seeing the Berlin Wall, so that he falls back on the most memorable passage of his New Orleans speech given the year before, changing pride in being an American in being a Berliner.          Behind the long table set up on the steps of the  |Rathaus_Schöneberg|Rathaus_Schöneberg|  were U.S. and German dignitaries, including  |Dean_Rusk|Dean_Rusk|  ,  |Lucius_D_Clay|Lucius_D_Clay|  ,  |Konrad_Adenauer|Konrad_Adenauer|  ,  |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt| , and  |Otto_Bach|Otto_Bach|  . The crowd was estimated at 450,000 people. This is the estimate given in Daum, Kennedy in Berlin 137. A  |BBC|Bbc|  article has a much lower number, 120,000.  Bach spoke first, of the recent developments in Berlin, especially the wall. He was followed by Konrad Adenauer, who spoke briefly and introduced the president.     Kennedy was accompanied not by Robert Lochner, but by Heinz Weber of the Berlin mission; Weber translated the presidents speech to the audience. Besides the typescript, Kennedy had a  |cue_card|Cue_Card|  on which he himself had written the phonetic spelling, and he surprised everyone by completely disregarding the speech, which had taken weeks to prepare. Instead, he improvised: He says more than he should, something different from what his advisers had recommended, and is more provocative than he had intended to be.      The speech culminated with the second use in the speech of the Ich bin ein Berliner phrase: Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner! The crowd was quiet while Weber translated and repeated the presidents German line; Kennedy was obviously relieved at the crowds positive response and thanked Weber for his translation. Weber translated this compliment also. According to Daum, after this first successful delivery, Kennedy, who fiddles a bit with his suit jacket, is grinning like a boy who has just pulled off a coup.     Kennedys  |National_Security_Advisor|United_States_National_Security_Advisor| |_McGeorge_Bundy|Mcgeorge_Bundy|  thought the speech had gone a little too far , and the two revised the text of a second major speech scheduled at the  |Freie_Universität_Berlin|Free_University_Of_Berlin|  later that day for a softer stance which amounted to being a bit more conciliatory toward the Soviets.              While the immediate response from the West German population was positive, the Soviet authorities were less pleased with the combative Lass sie nach Berlin kommen.  |Only_two_weeks_before_Kennedy_had_spoken_in_a_more_conciliatory_tone|American_University_Speech| , speaking of improving relations with the Soviet Union : in response to Kennedys Berlin speech, Nikita Khrushchev, days later, remarked that one would think that the speeches were made by two different Presidents.       |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  would evoke both the sentiment and the legacy of Kennedys speech 24 years later in his  |Tear_down_this_wall_|Tear_Down_This_Wall_|  speech.     There are commemorative sites to Kennedy in Berlin, such as the German-American  |John_F_Kennedy_School|John_F_Kennedy_School_Berlin|  and the  |John_F_Kennedy_Institute_for_North_American_Studies|John_F_Kennedy_Institute_For_North_American_Studies|  of the  |FU_Berlin|Free_University_Of_Berlin| . The public square in front of the Rathaus Schöneberg was renamed  John-F.-Kennedy-Platz . A large plaque dedicated to Kennedy is mounted on a column at the entrance of the building and the room above the entrance and overlooking the square is dedicated to Kennedy and his visit.     The original manuscript of the speech is stored with the  |National_Archives_and_Records_Administration|National_Archives_And_Records_Administration| .            There is a widespread belief that Kennedy made an embarrassing mistake by saying Ich bin ein Berliner. By not leaving out the  |indefinite_article|Indefinite_Article|  ein, he supposedly changed the meaning of the sentence from the intended I am a citizen of Berlin to I am a  |Berliner|Berliner|  , amusing Germans throughout the city.     While the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner can be understood as having a double meaning, it is neither wrong to use it the way Kennedy did nor was it embarrassing.  According to some grammar texts, Despite widespread claims to the contrary in most German grammars and textbooks, it is not incorrect to use an indefinite article before an indication of a persons origin, profession. As explained in the Duden-Grammatik: Der indefinite Artikel wird beim prädikativen Nominativ oft weggelassen, wenn damit die Zugehörigkeit zu einer sozial etablierten und anerkannten Gruppe angegeben wird . Zum Teil bestehen regionale Unterschiede im Gebrauch; ein strikter Standard hat sich nicht herausgebildet : Sie wird Hochbauzeichnerin. Er bleibt Junggeselle. Er ist Engländer. Sie ist Heidelbergerin.
