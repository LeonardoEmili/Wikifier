Kemp had his first encounter with supply-side economics in 1976, when  The Wall Street Journal s Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his Congressional office. Kemp questioned Wanniski all day and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer s supply-side discipline. Thereafter, Kemp espoused supply-side economics freely, and in 1978 he and Sen. Bill Roth of Delaware proposed tax-cutting legislation. Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply-side economics inclusion in President Reagans economic plan, although at the time of Robert Mundell s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell, Laffer, Robert Bartley , and Wanniski. In 1979, Kemp wrote An American Renaissance , to deliver his message that A rising tide lifts all boats. Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan, they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp–Roth Tax Cut legislation. Reagans budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of United States House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski .     During the Reagan years, Kemp and his followers ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990,  which by 1996 had become one of the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker s success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming , prisons, medical treatment , and credit card use.     An early Kemp tax reform attempt was an unsuccessful 1979 proposal to index tax brackets for cost of living fluctuations, which was incorporated in Reagans 1980 package. Kemp co-sponsored a legislative attempt at enterprise zones in 1980. One of Kemps more trying times as a congressman came in 1982 when Reagan decided to reverse the tax cuts and promote tax increases. The reversal was controversial and stimulated opposition by Kemp. Nonetheless, the revised taxes passed. In 1983, Kemp opposed the policies of chairman Volcker on multiple occasions. The debates included domestic monetary involvement and roles in funding the International Monetary Fund .     Kemp delivered speeches at several Republican National Convention s. He addressed the convention on July 15 at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan and on August 21 at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas . Kemp, Jack, An American Idea: Ending Limits to Growth, Goodrich, 1985 During the 1984 Convention, with Trent Lott as Republican Party Platform Committee chairman, Congressmen Kemp and Newt Gingrich claimed control of the party platform to the consternation of G.O.P. senators Bob Dole and Howard Baker . Kemps official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy. However, the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes, the gold standard and the role of the Federal Reserve . Despite Kemps official role, his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes. By 1985, Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 Presidential nomination. He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston , Texas. Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain, Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress.     Kemp was a critic of association football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup , Kemp proclaimed: I think it is important for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football , where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport. Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin s 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his tongue was firmly planted in cheek when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccers main problem is it doesnt have a quarterback . Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have changed his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger , although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a boring game .         thu , on October 3, 1987. William Daroff is standing directly behind Kemps left shoulder.   In 1988, if Kemp had won his campaign for the United States Presidency, it would have made him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield . When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins , Reagans 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemps leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in his campaign. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemps free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize governments role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.

        " requested things such as psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates. Candidates from each party expressed opinions on both sides of the personal privacy issue, and Kemp rejected the Times inquiry as beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate . His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire, but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York. Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters, Kemps campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red, which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques. To offset his socially moderate stances, Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion, his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State George Shultz . To position himself as Reagans successor, Kemp called for Shultzs resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighter s in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on SDI. In an attempt to highlight his stands on key Reagan Era foreign policy initiatives, Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan—a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists. He was accompanied on the trip by 50-plus US conservative leaders.     Despite a platform covering the full range of political subjects, Kemps primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts. As part of his fiscal policy, he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending. Some viewed Kemps supply-side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit . In late 1987, political pundits saw that Kemp needed to gain support from the far right on non-social issues. Kemp was among the majority of Republican candidates in opposition to Reagans INF Treaty agreement with the Soviet Union s Mikhail Gorbachev despite general Republican voter approval of the treaty. With aspirations of support from right-wing voters, all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same sabre-rattling stand. By early 1988, the moderates were clearly the front-runners and Kemp was battling with Pat Robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates.     He used a somewhat negative advertising campaign that seemed to have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemps campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday , in which his 39  delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg , New York to Bethesda, Maryland , their residence at the time of his death. In 1994, Kemps 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire , and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.       thu Dean.   As a so-called bleeding-heart conservative , Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , whose job would be to foster public sector and private sector methods to meet the demands of public housing. However, the scandals of Reagans Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership. The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives. Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUDs director, he cleaned up HUDs reputation, and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration . He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive, which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett . He supported Operation Clean Sweep and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.     Although Kemp coaxed Bush to support a $4  billion housing program that encouraged public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361  million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman , who opposed Kemps pet project HOPE . The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemps proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as did most of the Cabinet , but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh , encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemps Economic Empowerment Task Force. However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemps new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton , and Vin Weber . The budget left him with $256  million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemps Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.     President Bush avoided federal antipoverty issues, and instead used Kemp as a mouthpiece to speak on the administrations low priority conservative activist agenda. Bushs contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his Points of Light theme, and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from presidential candidate Bill Clinton . By the time of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones, tenant ownership and welfare reform: Mort Zuckerman compared Bushs vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car. Nonetheless, the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration, even though at first, Kemp had been overlooked. However, Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemps success in advance best when he said in 1989, Good ideas with money can do a whole lot. Good ideas without money arent probably going to do a whole lot, and the issue here was the decision not to fund Kemps ideas. Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions, he was among the administrations leading users of first class corporate jet s. He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary.     Generally, his time as housing secretary was considered unsuccessful. However, although he could not get federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5  billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a vice presidential candidate.     Kemp was partly at fault for not achieving either of his primary goals because he did not get along with the rest of the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker , White House Chief of Staff , that Bushs best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention , Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemps reference to parts of the Presidents economic policy as gimmicks after the 1992 State of the Union Address . Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bushs administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a domestic policy czar. The letter, highlighting Kemps energy, enthusiasm and national clout , insulted Bush. Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the Bush Cabinet for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands. Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992, and some pundits agreed with him.       Kemp gave public speeches for $35,000 apiece between his time as Housing Secretary and his Vice Presidential nomination. By 1994, Kemp had embarked on 241  fund-raising dinners to raise $35  million for a 1996 Presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts. After stepping down from his $189,000 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development job, Kemp personally earned $6.9  million in the next three years, primarily for speaking on behalf of local Republican candidates. During the Super Bowl XXVIII festivities, Kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series.     Kemp was considered the star of the 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp was considered the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections , Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement by the end of the year. In January 1995, Kemps stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limit s, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America . Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell , Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.     Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich appointed Kemp to head a tax reform commission, , in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deduction s, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.     During the campaign, Kemps endorsement was highly coveted. Forbes had tried to get Kemp to run in the 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar . Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Doles campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.     Kemp was also outspoken on immigration on around this time: according to Kemps interpretation of a scientific index that he and Bennett support, immigrants are a blessing, not a curse. In 1994, Kemp and Bennett opposed California ballot Proposition 187 , a measure to bar illegal immigrants from obtaining public services, in direct opposition to first-term Republican California Governor Pete Wilson , one of its endorsers who was running for re-election. Republican Senate candidate Michael Huffington had also endorsed the proposition. Kemp supported rights for illegal immigrants, and opposed Lamar Smith and Alan Simpson s proposed restrictions on legal immigration.         thu and Kemp were featured on the cover of Time , but were nearly displaced by a story about Mars   Kemp had a reputation as the highest-profile progressive Republican. When Dole declined an invitation to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , he suggested Kemp as a substitute even before Kemp had become the vice presidential nominee. On August 5, 1996, Dole announced a 15% across-the-board tax cut in response to both the Forbes campaign and Kemps tax reform commission. Several of Doles other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennetts Empower America , which had Jeane Kirkpatrick , Weber, Forbes and Alexander as principals. For example, Dole borrowed Kirkpatricks tough foreign policy , Bennetts right conduct and even Alexanders school choice interest.     Bennett declined the offer to be Doles running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Doles antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential nominee , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp was seen as a means to attract conservative and libertarian -minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan . Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack , John McCain , and Carroll Campbell , and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Doles senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemps tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Doles running mate in 1996, they appeared on the cover of the August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine , but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars , which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.     The two politicians had a storied history stemming from alternative perspectives and objectives. Dole was a longstanding conservative deficit hawk who had even voted against John F. Kennedy s tax cuts, while Kemp was an outspoken supply-sider. In the early 1980s, according to David Stockman , Kemp persuaded Reagan to make a 30% across-the-board tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature. Once Reagan was elected, Dole was the Senate Finance Committee chairman who Kemp claims resisted the plan every step of the way. Dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan. The big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms. Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op-ed piece in The New York Times, which enraged Dole. Reagan supported the reforms at Doles request, causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act, which eventually passed in 1982. At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Kemp, along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott, added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases. Gingrich called this action Dole proofing the platform, and the plank passed over Doles opposition. Then, in 1985, Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote. In meetings with the president that excluded Dole, Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks. This is said to have been Doles most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the Republican loss of control of the Senate. During the 1988 presidential election, the two antagonized each other. After Bush won and Kemp left Congress for the Cabinet, the two did not really cross paths again until 1996, when Kemp endorsed Doles opponent Forbes on the eve of the New York Primary in March.     Dole despised Kemps economic theories, but he felt Kemp-like tax cuts offered his best chance at electoral success. For his part, Kemp had to make concessions as well: he had to back expelling the children of illegal immigrants from public schools despite his longstanding opposition to Proposition 187 and mute his opposition to abolishing affirmative-action programs in California. Some derided Kemp for his compromise and referred to him as a con artist . From the outset of their campaign, Dole-Kemp trailed, and they faced skeptics even from within the party. However, Kemp was able to use the nomination to promote his opposition to Clintons partial birth abortion ban veto. During the campaign, Kemp and Forbes advocated for a stronger stand on tax cutting than Dole used. However, in general, the opinion was that Kemp was helpful to the tickets chances of catching Bill Clinton , and Kemps advocacy gave a clear picture of the tax reforms that would likely occur on the condition of a successful campaign. Kemp was seen as likely to influence several types of swing voter s, especially those of his native state of California, and even the Democrats feared Kemp might lure voters.     After receiving the nomination, Kemp became the tickets spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to agreement on the self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March , Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic , and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described as if he was the presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemps style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as ": null

During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemps voice on minority issues, Colin Powells support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer , school voucher s and criminal justice , the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.     Both Al Gore and Kemp had Presidential aspirations, which induced pursuit of debate on a higher plane. In addition, Gore and Kemp were long-time friends, unlike Gore and his previous vice presidential opponent Dan Quayle . Thus, as debaters they avoided personal attacks. However, some felt Kemp failed to counter substantive attacks. In the final October 9, 1996 Vice Presidential Debate against Al Gore , Kemp was soundly beaten, and Al Gores performance is considered one of the best modern debate performances. The debate topics ranged broadly from the usual such as abortion and foreign policy to the unusual such as an incident preceding the then-current baseball playoffs, in which Roberto Alomar , the Baltimore Orioles second baseman , cursed and spat on an umpire . The Mexico policy debate was one of the more interesting topics for critical review. The Gore victory was not a surprise since Kemp had been outmatched by Gore in previous encounters, and Gore had a reputation as an experienced and vaunted debater.       thu , Phil English and Mike Turner   In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and financial backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded the free market advocacy group Empower America , which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works .

He resigned as Co-Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein .

In early 1998, he was a serious contender for the 2000 United States presidential election , but his campaign possibilities faltered, and he instead endorsed eventual winner George W. Bush. Kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation, Social Security and education. When a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked for debt repayment, Kemp opposed the plan in favor of tax cuts. Along with John Ashcroft and Alan Krueger , he endorsed reform of payroll taxes to eliminate double taxation .

In 1997, when Gingrich was embroiled in a House ethics controversy, Kemp served as an intermediary between Dole and Gingrich to save the Republican Party leader.

On January 6, 2008, Kemp endorsed McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries shortly before the New Hampshire primary , which surprised conservative Republican tax cutters. However, as McCain neared the official nomination, the press associated McCain with Kemp more and more. Kemp prepared an open letter to Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Laura Ingraham and other conservative talk show hosts on McCains behalf to quell their dissatisfactions. In addition, Kemp and Phil Gramm advised McCain on economic policy.     In February 2008, Kemp was associated with a group called Defense of Democracies that was advocating an electronic surveillance bill that failed in the House of Representatives.

Kemps legacy includes the Kemp–Roth Tax Cut of the 1980s, also known as the first of two Reagan tax cuts. These served as the foundation of supply-side economics, known as Reaganomics . Many Republicans have endorsed this Laffer Curve view that tax cuts spur economic growth and reduce deficits . Although George H. W. Bush called this philosophy voodoo economics , George W. Bush and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snow , were believers. Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats.     In the early 21st century, Kemp continued to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible for the implementation of supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He has been described as a beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.

Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress, including Steve Largent , J. C. Watts , and Heath Shuler .     Congressman Paul Ryan cites Kemp as a mentor, and mentioned him in his acceptance speech as the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee in 2012.     Senator Arlen Specter in a severe rebuke of federal governmental policy, stated just one day after Kemp died of cancer, that Kemp would still be alive if the federal government had done a better job funding cancer research.
