           Limburg an der Lahn  is the district seat of  |Limburg-Weilburg|Limburg-Weilburg|  in  |Hesse|Hesse| , Germany.           Limburg lies in western Hessen between the  |Taunus|Taunus|  and the  |Westerwald|Westerwald|  on the river  |Lahn|Lahn| .     The town lies roughly centrally in a basin within the  |Rhenish_Slate_Mountains|Rheinisches_Schiefergebirge|  which is surrounded by the low ranges of the Taunus and Westerwald and called the  |Limburg_Basin|Limburg_Basin|  . Owing to the favourable soil and climate, the Limburg Basin stands as one of Hesses richest agricultural regions and moreover, with its convenient Lahn crossing, it has been of great importance to transport since the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . Within the basin, the Lahns otherwise rather narrow lower valley broadens out noticeably, making Limburgs mean elevation only 117  m above sea level.       Limburg forms, together with the town of Diez, a middle centre  but partially functions as an upper centre to western  |Middle_Hesse|Middle_Hesse| .     Limburgs residential neighbourhoods reach beyond the town limits; the neighbouring centres of  |Elz|Elz,_Hesse|  and  |Diez|Diez,_Germany|  run seamlessly together.     Surrounding towns and communities are the community of Elz and the town of  |Hadamar|Hadamar|  in the north, the community of  |Beselich|Beselich|  in the northeast, the town of  |Runkel|Runkel|  in the east, the communities of  |Villmar|Villmar|  and  |Brechen|Brechen|  in the southeast, the community of  |Hünfelden|Hünfelden|  in the south , the community of  |Holzheim|Holzheim,_Rhineland-Palatinate|  in the southwest, and the town of Diez and the communities of  |Aull|Aull,_Germany|  and  |Gückingen|Gückingen|  in the west .     The nearest major cities are  |Wetzlar|Wetzlar|  and  |Gießen|Gießen|  to the north east,  |Wiesbaden|Wiesbaden|  and  |Frankfurt|Frankfurt_Am_Main|  to the south and  |Koblenz|Koblenz|  to the west.       The town consists of eight formerly autonomous  Ortsteil e or villages, listed here by population.     Limburg: 18,393    |Lindenholzhausen|Lindenholzhausen| |Dietkirchen|Dietkirchen| Domäne Blumenrod, a former manor house that has been restored and remodelled by the Limburg Free Evangelical community.     Limburg’s biggest outlying centre is Lindenholzhausen ; the second biggest is Linter.       The derivation of the name “Limburg” is not quite clear and may well hearken back to a  |castle|Castle|  built here . In 910 the town was first mentioned as Lintpurc. Two of the popular theories are:   The name was chosen because of the close proximity to the Linterer Bach, a former stream in Linter that has now run dry and that emptied into the Lahn at the Domfelsen . Linda is the  |Gaulish|Gaulish|  word for water.   Rather unlikely but very popular is the connection to a dragon saga  and the connection with the  |monastery|Monastery|  of  |Saint_George|Saint_George|  the Dragon Slayer founded in Limburg. However, the monastery was built after the castle and founded around the time of the first written mention of the name.          About 800 A.D., the first castle buildings arose on the Limburg crags. This was probably designed for the protection of a  |ford|Ford|  over the river Lahn. In the decades that followed, the town developed under the castles protection. Limburg is first mentioned in documents in 910 under the name of Lintpurc when  |Louis_the_Child|Louis_The_Child|  granted Konrad Kurzbold an estate in the community on which he was to build a church. Konrad Kurzbold laid the foundation stone for Saint Georges Monastery Church, where he was also buried. The community soon increased in importance with the monasterys founding and profited from the lively goods trade on the Via Publica.     In 1150, a wooden bridge was built across the Lahn. The long-distance road from  |Cologne|Cologne|  to  |Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt_Am_Main|  subsequently ran through Limburg. In the early 13th century, Limburg Castle was built in its current form. Shortly afterwards, the town passed into the ownership of the  |Lords_of_Ysenburg|County_Of_Isenburg| . In 1214, the community was granted town rights. Remains of the fortification wall from the years 1130, 1230 and 1340 with a maximum length of roughly one thousand metres indicate to this day the blossoming towns quick development in the Middle Ages. There is proof of a  |mint|Mint|  in Limburg in 1180.      One line of the Lords of Ysenburg resided from 1258 to 1406 at Limburg Castle and took their name from their seat, Limburg. From this line came the  |House_of_Limburg-Stirum|House_Of_Limburg-Stirum|  and also  |Imagina_of_Isenburg-Limburg|Imagina_Of_Isenburg-Limburg| , German King  |Adolfs|Adolf_Of_Germany|  wife.     The ruling class among the mediaeval townsfolk were rich merchant families whose houses stood right near the castle tower and were surrounded by the first town wall once it was built. The area of todays Rossmarkt , in which many simple craftsmen lived, was only brought within the fortifications once the second town wall was built. The inhabitants there, however, unlike the merchant élite, were accorded no entitlement to a voice in town affairs and were not allowed to send representatives to the town council. Nevertheless, they had to bear the main financial burden of running the town. Only in 1458 were they allowed to send two representatives to town council.      Saint Georges Cathedral  built on the old monastery churchs site, and also called Georgsdom, was consecrated in 1235. On 14 May 1289, a devastating fire wiped out great parts of the inner town, although these were subsequently rebuilt. One of the houses built at that time was the  |Römer_2-4-6|Römer_2-4-6| , which is today one of Germanys oldest  |half-timbered|Half-Timbered|  houses. In 1337, Limburgs  |Jews|Jew|  were expelled from the town. Only in 1341 were they once again able to settle in the town, by royal decree. In 1344 a half share of the town was pledged to the  |Electorate_of_Trier|Electorate_Of_Trier| , and in 1420, the town passed wholly into the ownership of Trier. This event, along with another town fire in 1342, the  |Black_Death|Black_Death|  in 1349, 1356 and 1365, but above all the rise of the Territorial Princes, led to a gradual decline. In 1315 and 1346, the old stone Lahn Bridge was built .            Against the background of the  |German_Peasants_War|German_Peasants_War| , unrest also arose among the townsfolk in 1525. After the Elector of Trier had demanded that the townsmen turn a  |Lutheran|Lutheranism|  preacher out of the town, a board made up of townsmen who were ineligible for council functions handed the council a 30-point comprehensive list of demands on 24 May. It dealt mainly with financial participation and equality in taxation, trade and building issues with the merchant class. In the days that followed, these demands were reduced in negotiations between the council and the board to 16 points, which were likely also taken up with the Elector afterwards. On 5 August, however, Archbishop Richard ordered the council to overturn all concessions to the townsmen. Furthermore, a ban on assembly was decreed, and the ineligible townsmen were stripped of their right to send two representatives to council.     In 1806, Limburg came into the possession of the newly founded  |Duchy_of_Nassau|Duchy_Of_Nassau| . In 1818 the town wall was torn down. In 1827 the town was raised to a  |Catholic|Roman_Catholicism|  episcopal seat. In 1866 the Duchy and with it Limburg passed to  |Prussia|Prussia|  in the wake of the  |Austro-Prussian_War|Austro-Prussian_War| . As of 1862, Limburg became a railway hub and from 1886 a district seat. In 1892, the  |Pallottines|Pallottines|  settled in town, but only the men; the women came in 1895.     During  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  there was a major  |prisoner_of_war|Prisoner_Of_War|  camp at Limburg an der Lahn. Many Irish members of the  |British_Army|British_Army|  were interned there until the end of the war and at one stage they were visited by the Irish republican leader  |Roger_Casement|Roger_Casement|  in an attempt to win recruits for the forthcoming  |Irish_rebellion|Easter_Rising| .     From 1919 to 1923, Limburg was the capital of a short-lived state called  |Free_State_Bottleneck|Free_State_Bottleneck|   because it was the nearest unoccupied town to the  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| .           The municipal election held on 6 March 2016 yielded the following results:          The towns mayor is currently Marius Hahn .         |Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon|Sainte-Foy-Lès-Lyon| ,  |Rhône|Rhône| , France     |Oudenburg|Oudenburg| ,  |West_Flanders|West_Flanders| , Belgium     |Lichfield|Lichfield| , Staffordshire, England, United Kingdom     PatenschaftPatenschaft – roughly, a sponsorship – was undertaken for  |Sudeten_Germans|Germans_In_Czechoslovakia|  driven out of the town of  |Mährisch_Neustadt|Uničov|  in the Sternberg district.                    Limburg is a traditional transport hub. Already in the Middle Ages, the Via Publica crossed the navigable Lahn here. Today the  |A_3|Bundesautobahn_3|   and  Bundesstraße  8, which both follow the Via Publicas alignment as closely as possible, run through the town. Bundesstraße 49 links Limburg to Koblenz towards the west and Wetzlar and Gießen towards the east. The section between Limburg and Wetzlar is currently being widened to four lanes. This section as far as  |Obertiefenbach|Beselich|  is also known as Die lange Meil . Bundesstraße 54 links Limburg on the one hand with  |Siegen|Siegen|  to the north and on the other by way of Diez with Wiesbaden, which may likewise be reached over Bundesstraße 417 .     As early as 1248, a wooden bridge spanned the Lahn, but was replaced after the  |flood|Flood| ing in 1306 by a stone bridge, the Alte Lahnbrücke. Other road bridges are the Lahntalbrücke Limburg on the A  3, the Lahnbrücke near Staffel and the Neue Lahnbrücke from 1968, over which run the Bundesstraßen before they cross under the inner town through the Schiedetunnel, a bypass tunnel.     Once the  Lahntalbahn  had been built, Limburg was joined to the railway network in 1862.  |Limburg_railway_station|Limburg_Station|  developed into a transport hub.  |Eschhofen_station|Eschhofen_Station|  is also in Limburg. Other railway lines are the  Unterwesterwaldbahn , the  Oberwesterwaldbahn  and the  |Main-Lahn_Railway|Main-Lahn_Railway| . At  |Niedernhausen_station|Niedernhausen_Station|  on the Main-Lahn Railway, transfer to the  Ländchesbahn  to Wiesbaden is possible. With the exception of the upper section of the Lahntalbahn and express lines to Koblenz and Frankfurt, which are still served by  |Deutsche_Bahn|Deutsche_Bahn| , all railway lines are run by Vectus Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH, based in Limburg.     Once the  |InterCityExpress|Intercityexpress| |Cologne-Frankfurt_high-speed_rail_line|Cologne-Frankfurt_High-Speed_Rail_Line|  had been built, Limburg acquired an  |ICE_station|Limburg_Süd_Railway_Station| . It is the only railway station in Germany at which exclusively ICE trains stop. The high-speed rail line crosses the Lahn over the Lahntalbrücke and then dives into the Limburger Tunnel.     The nearest airport is  |Frankfurt_Airport|Frankfurt_Airport| , 63  km away on the A  3. Travel time there on the ICE is roughly 20 minutes.  |Cologne_Bonn_Airport|Cologne_Bonn_Airport|  is 110  km away and can be reached on the ICE in 44 minutes.     The Lahn between  |Lahnstein|Lahnstein|  and Wetzlar is a Bundeswasserstraße . Since the Lahntalbahns expansion, however, the waterways importance has been declining. It is used mainly by tourists with small  |motorboats|Motorboat| ,  |canoes|Canoe|  and  |rowboats|Rowboat| . Limburg is the landing site of the tourboat Wappen von Limburg.           |Tetra_Pak|Tetra_Pak|        Limburg has four schools which lead to, among other qualifications, the  |Abitur|Abitur| |Gymnasium|Gymnasium|  , which has existed since 1895 and which belongs to the Bishopric of Limburg.   Peter-Paul-Cahensly-Schule with vocational Gymnasium in the fields of economics and administration,  |data_processing|Data_Processing| ,  |electrical_engineering|Electrical_Engineering|  and machine building    |Adolf-Reichwein|Adolf_Reichwein| -Schule with vocational Gymnasium in the fields of  |dietetics|Dietetics|  and  |health_sciences|Health_Science|      Professional training schools:   Peter-Paul-Cahensly-Schule   Friedrich-Dessauer-Schule   Adolf-Reichwein-Schule   Marienschule      |Hauptschule|Hauptschule| n and  |Realschule|Realschule| n:   Johann-Wolfgang-von-Goethe-Schule   Leo-Sternberg-Schule   Theodor-Heuss-Schule      |Libraries|Library|    The hospital perched on the Schafsberg overlooking the town has at its disposal 433 beds and 15 specialist departments.       In Limburg there are various  |sport_clubs|Sport_Club| ; some are even represented in Bundesligen, and even at the world level.   Limburger Club für Wassersport 1895/1907 e.V.    Limburger Hockey Club   Schwimmverein Poseidon Limburg e. V.   various clubs in the outlying centres such as the Turnverein Eschhofen , the  |fistball|Fistball|  stronghold in Limburg-Weilburg       The  |Evangelical_Church|Evangelical_Church_In_Germany|  offers with its Jugendfreizeitstätte Limburg a meeting place for youth with many events. With  |table_football|Table_Football| , Internet café and many events, this institution is not only church-based, with two staff and a  Zivildienst leistender supporting the visitors not only with their problems.       The Mütterzentrum Limburg is a family meeting place for those with or without children on Hospitalstraße. The club is supported by the town of Limburg and the  |Bundesland|States_Of_Germany|  of Hesse and offers among other things a parents service that looks after children, a broad array of course offerings for children and adults, a miniature  |kindergarten|Kindergarten|  and a café.       Limburg an der Lahn Volunteer  |Fire_brigade|Fire_Brigade| , founded 1867   Ahlbach Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1908   Dietkirchen Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1934   Eschhofen Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1901   Lindenholzhausen Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1933   Linter Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1935   Offheim Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1898   Staffel Volunteer Fire Brigade, founded 1880           The  |cabaret|Cabaret|  troupe Thing , founded more than 25 years ago, moved after a short time from its initial home in the outlying centre of Staffel to the Josef-Kohlmaier-Halle, a civic event hall, where its stage can now be found in the halls club rooms. The troupe is run by an independent acting club. On the programme are  |chanson|Chanson| , cabaret, literature and  |jazz|Jazz|  as well as  |folk|Folk_Music| , Rock and performances by singer-songwriters. It makes a point of furthering young artists. Each month, three or four events are staged.     The dedication of Thing was recognized on 6 December 2003 when the Kulturpreis Mittelhessen was awarded to it.     Limburg Cathedral has a famous boys choir, the  |Limburger_Domsingknaben|Limburger_Domsingknaben| , which trains at Musical Boarding School in  |Hadamar|Hadamar| , and an excellent girls choir, the  |Mädchenkantorei_Limburg|Mädchenkantorei_Limburg| , both singing at the Limburg Cathedral and internationally.                  In Limburg there are several museums. The most important are:   Town of Limburg art collections that offer changing exhibits   Staurothek,  |cathedral_treasury|Cathedral_Treasury|  and diocesan museum with the Limburger Staurothek   Museum Limburg Navy Museum   Pallottine Mission museum       Only a few towns, like Limburg, have been able to keep a full set of nearly unscathed mediaeval buildings. The formerly walled town core between St. George’s Cathedral, Grabenstraße  and the 600-year-old Lahn Bridge thus stands today as a whole under monumental protection.     The Altstadt boasts a fine cathedral and is full of narrow streets with  |timber-frame|Timber_Framing|  houses, dating mainly from the 17th and 18th centuries. Thats why it is located on the  |German_Timber-Frame_Road|German_Timber-Frame_Road| .    Limburger Dom , one of the most complete creations of Late  |Romanesque_architecture|Romanesque_Architecture| . It was printed on the reverse of the 1,000   |Deutsche_Mark|Deutsche_Mark|  note from the second series,  which was in circulation from 1960 to 1989. The cathedral was recently renovated and painted to reflect its original appearance.   Limburger Schloss, built in early 13th century by Gerlach von Ysenburg    Burgmann enhaus, built about 1544; serves as a museum today   St. Anna-Kirche ,  |stained_glass|Stained_Glass|  from third fourth of 14th century with eighteen scenes from the  |New_Testament|New_Testament|  Via Publica crossed the Lahn   In the Old Town stand many timber-frame houses from the 13th to 19th centuries. One peculiarity seen among the  |timber-framed|Timber_Framing|  houses of Limburg is the  |hall_house|Hall_House|  from the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages| , which has a  |great_hall|Great_Hall|  on the ground floor. When restoration work began in the Old Town in 1972, the houses were carefully restored. Among the best known timber-frame houses are:   Haus Kleine Rütsche 4, narrowest spot on the historic trade road between Frankfurt and Cologne, whose breadth is written at the Haymarket  in Cologne   Haus der sieben Laster at Brückengasse 9, built in 1567,  timber-frame house with carvings showing Christianitys  |seven_deadly_sins|Seven_Deadly_Sins| , namely  |pride|Pride| ,  |greed|Greed| ,  |envy|Envy| ,  |lust|Lust| ,  |gluttony|Gluttony| ,  |wrath|Wrath|  and  |sloth|Sloth|  Werner-Senger-Haus, a beautiful stone  |hall_house|Hall_House|  with timber-framed façade dating from the 13th century   Houses at the fishmarket.
