Transport in Croatia relies on several main modes, including  |transport|Transportation|  by road, rail, water and air. Road transport incorporates a comprehensive network of state, county and local routes augmented by a network of highways for long-distance travelling. Water transport can be divided into sea, based on the ports of  |Rijeka|Rijeka| ,  |Ploče|Ploče| ,  |Split|Split|  and  |Zadar|Zadar| , and river transport, based on  |Sava|Sava| ,  |Danube|Danube|  and, to a lesser extent,  |Drava|Drava| .  |Croatia|Croatia|  has 68 airports, nine of which are international. The country also has several airlines, of which the most notable are  |Croatia_Airlines|Croatia_Airlines|  and  |Trade_Air|Trade_Air| . Rail transport is fairly developed, with dual track and electrification not very common, although high-speed tilting trains are used on some routes. However, bus still tends to be more common than rail as a mode of inter-city transport.          There are international  |airports|Airport|  in  |Zagreb|Zagreb_International_Airport| ,  |Split|Split_Airport| ,  |Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik_Airport| ,  |Zadar|Zadar_Airport| ,  |Pula|Pula_Airport| ,  |Rijeka|Rijeka_Airport|  ,  |Osijek|Osijek_Airport| ,  |Bol|Brač_Airport|  and  |Mali_Lošinj|Lošinj_Airport| .     Currently, the following low cost airlines are flying to Croatia: Jet2,  |EasyJet|Easyjet| ,  |Eurowings|Eurowings| ,  |TUIfly|Tuifly| ,  |Ryanair|Ryanair| ,  |Thomson|Thomson_Airways| ,  |flydubai|Flydubai|  and  |Wizz_Air|Wizz_Air| . Major established companies that fly to Croatia include the domestic  |Croatia_Airlines|Croatia_Airlines|  ,  |Air_France|Air_France| ,  |Aeroflot|Aeroflot| ,  |Lufthansa|Lufthansa| ,  |Emirates|Emirates| ,  |Finnair|Finnair| ,  |Austrian_Airlines|Austrian_Airlines| ,  |KLM|Klm| ,  |Qatar_Airways|Qatar_Airways| ,  |Swiss_International_Air_Lines|Swiss_International_Air_Lines| ,  |British_Airways|British_Airways|  and  |Turkish_Airlines|Turkish_Airlines| . Seasonal intercontinental flights also operate from and to Croatia.     In January 2011 the U.S.  |Federal_Aviation_Administration|Federal_Aviation_Administration|  assessed the Government of Croatias Civil Aviation Authority announcing that Croatia complied with  |International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|  aviation safety standards for oversight of Croatias air carrier opinions.  IASA Category 1 rating and that Croatian air carriers are authorized Croatia to the US.     Statistics:     Overall: 68 airports     Airports with paved  |runways|Runway|  :   total: 23    or more: 2    |Heliports|Heliport| : 3     Airports:     |Franjo_Tuđman_Airport|Zagreb_Airport| |_Split_Airport|Split_Airport| |_Rijeka_Airport|Rijeka_Airport| |_Osijek_Airport|Osijek_Airport| |_Zadar_Airport|Zadar_Airport| |_Dubrovnik_Airport|Dubrovnik_Airport| |_Pula_Airport|Pula_Airport| |_Brač_Airport|Brač_Airport| |_Lošinj_Airport|Lošinj_Airport|                     The Croatian railway network is classified into three groups: railways of international, regional and local significance.   The most important railway lines follow  |Pan_European_corridors|Pan_European_Corridors|  V and X, they connect at Zagreb with each other. There are connections to the railway networks of  |Slovenia|Slovenia| ,  |Hungary|Hungary| ,  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina|  and  |Serbia|Serbia| .     The railways need to be modernized because the lions share of the railway infrastructure in Croatia dates back from the pre-WW2 period and more than half of the core routes were, in fact, built during the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  i.e. before the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . As a result, most of the routes are not electrified, are only single track traffic around bends and lag significantly behind the West-European standards. Some limited improvements, however, have been made in recent times. A result of this has been an increase in the maximum speed on the railway line on the  |Pan_European_Corridor_X|Pan_European_Corridor_X| , from the Slovenian border via Zagreb, Novska, Vinkovci to the Serbian border . In places the lines speed limit has been raised from  to , and plans have been made to raise this further to  on certain sections. The railway line of the  |Pan_European_Corridor_Vb|Pan_European_Corridor_Vb| , from the Hungarian border via Koprivnica, Zagreb, Karlovac to the  |Port_of_Rijeka|Port_Of_Rijeka|   has a slow section through  |Gorski_Kotar|Gorski_Kotar| , which is planned to undergo a major overhaul. The railway line of the  |Pan_European_Corridor_Vc|Pan_European_Corridor_Vc| , from the Hungarian border via Beli Manastir, Osijek, Đakovo or Vinkovci, Slavonski Šamac, to the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina , is also being modernised, the aim is to allow speeds of up to 160  km/h along the entire length.     The official rail speed record in Croatia is . Maximum speed reached in regular service is  on parts of the  |Novska–Tovarnik_line|M105_Railway| .        Recently  |Croatian_Railways|Croatian_Railways|  introduced a series of modern  |tilting_trains|Tilting_Train|  produced by the German branch of  |Bombardier_Transportation|Bombardier_Transportation| . They usually deployed on the mountainous route between the two largest Croatian cities,  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  and  |Split|Split_Croatia| . Although they can sometimes be found on other routes in the country. Contrary to regular overnight fast trains between Zagreb and Split with scheduled travelling time of circa 8 hours in total, tilting trains on the Zagreb–Split route  offer passengers a faster journey with a journey time of about 6 hours.     Croatian Railways aims to revitalize rail traffic through further improvements. Thus, establishing rail as serious competitor to the car, particularly during the busy the summer months.     Croatian Railways plan to build their first  |high_speed_railway|High_Speed_Railway|  service is progressing. Construction of an entirely new line from  |Karlovac|Karlovac|  to  |Rijeka|Rijeka| , and reconstruction of the line from the  |Hungarian|Hungary|  border to Karlovac should have originally begun in the fall of 2007. The line is going to be entirely electrified and in order to speed up the journey even more shall be  long from end to end,  shorter than the existing line. The journey from  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  to  |Rijeka|Rijeka|  will be cut to one hour compared to 4 hours with the existing track. The line is intended to carry the increasing amount of goods that enter Europe, at the Croatian  |Port_of_Rijeka|Port_Of_Rijeka|  and are then transported to destinations across central and  |eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| . The plans have originally foreseen 2008-2010 as the date for completion. Due to the  |world_economic_crisis|Global_Financial_Crisis_Of_2008–2009| , building start date is prolonged to a yet undefined date. The project plans have been drawn, however.      |Pan_European_Corridor_X|Pan_European_Corridor_X|  is going to be upgraded to higher speed sometime in the future. Possibly by building a new high capacity connection line from  |Sisak|Sisak|  via  |Kutina|Kutina|  to  |Lipovljani|Lipovljani| . The line should allow for speeds of up to 250  km/h.

Croatian  |highways|Highway|  are widely regarded as being one of the most modern and safe in Europe.   This is because the largest part of the Croatian motorway and expressway system  has been recently constructed , and further construction is continuing. The  |motorways_in_Croatia|Motorways_In_Croatia|  connect most major Croatian cities and all major seaports. The two longest routes, the  |A1|A1|  and the  |A3|A3| , span the better part of the country and the motorway network connects most major border crossings.      |Tourism|Tourism|  is of major importance for the Croatian economy, and as most tourists come to vacation in Croatia in their own cars, the highways serve to alleviate summer jams. They have also been used as a means of stimulating urgently needed economic growth, and for the sustainable development of this country. Croatia now has a considerable highway density for a country of its size, helping it cope with the consequences of being a  |transition_economy|Transition_Economy|  and having suffered in the  |Croatian_War_of_Independence|Croatian_War_Of_Independence| .     , Croatia has a total of  of roads.         The  |traffic_signs|Traffic_Sign|  adhere to the  |Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Signs_and_Signals|Vienna_Convention_On_Road_Signs_And_Signals| .     The general  |speed_limits|Speed_Limit|  are:   in inhabited areas 50  km/h   outside of inhabited areas 90  km/h   on marked expressways 110  km/h   on marked motorways 130  km/h     In 2004, a controversial new traffic law was introduced, which provides for drastic safety measures for drunken or dangerous driving: it reduced the blood alcohol limit to 0‰ of alcohol in blood. In 2008 this law was reversed to 0.5‰ of alcohol in blood.     Some of the more technical safety measures include that all new Croatian  |tunnels|Tunnel|  have modern safety equipment and there are several control centers, which monitor highway traffic.          Motorways  in Croatia applies to dual carriageway roads with at least two  |traffic_lanes|Traffic_Lanes|  in each driving direction and an  |emergency_lane|Emergency_Lane| . Direction  |road_signs|Road_Sign|  at Croatian motorways have green background with white lettering similar to the Swiss  |Autobahn|Autobahn| . The designations of motorways are A and the motorway number. , the Croatian motorway network is  long.      The list of completed motorways is as follows :      A1 ,  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  -  |Bosiljevo|Bosiljevo_2_Interchange|  -  |Split|Split_Croatia|  -  |Ploče|Ploče|      A2 ,  |Zagreb|Zagreb_Bypass|  -  |Krapina|Krapina|  -  |Macelj|Macelj|      A3 ,  |Bregana|Bregana|  -  |Zagreb|Zagreb_Bypass|  -  |Lipovac|Lipovac_Vukovar_Syrmia_County|      A4 ,  |Goričan|Goričan|  -  |Varaždin|Varaždin| / |Čakovec|Čakovec|  -  |Zagreb|Zagreb_Bypass|      A5 ,  |Osijek|Osijek|  -  |Đakovo|Đakovo|  -  |Sredanci|Sredanci_Interchange|      A6 ,  |Bosiljevo|Bosiljevo_2_Interchange|  -  |Rijeka|Rijeka|      A7 ,  |Rupa|Rupa_Croatia|  -  |Rijeka_bypass|Rijeka_Bypass|      A9 ,  |Umag|Umag|  -  |Pula|Pula|      A10 , A1 Ploče interchange - Metković border crossing    A11 ,  |Velika_Gorica|Velika_Gorica|  - Buševec     Toll is charged on most  |Croatian_motorways|Croatian_Motorways| , and exceptions are the A11 motorway,  |Zagreb_bypass|Zagreb_Bypass|  and  |Rijeka_bypass|Rijeka_Bypass| , as well as sections adjacent to border crossings . Payment in  |kuna|Croatian_Kuna| , all major credit cards and  |euros|Euro|  are accepted at all toll gates. Most motorways are covered by the  |closed_toll_collection|Closed_Toll_Collection|  system, where a driver receives a ticket at the entrance gates and pays at the exit gates according to the number of sections travelled.  |Open_toll_collection|Open_Toll_Collection|  is used on some bridges and tunnels and short stretches of tolled highway, where drivers immediately pay the toll upon arriving. Various forms of prepaid  |electronic_toll_collection|Electronic_Toll_Collection|  systems are in place which allow quicker collection of toll, usually at a discounted rate, as well as use of dedicated toll plaza lanes .     All heavily traveled routes towards  |Slovenia|Slovenia| ,  |Hungary|Hungary|  and  |Serbia|Serbia|  are motorway connections, and almost all parts of Croatia are now easy to reach using motorways.     The 479  km long motorway A1  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  -  |Split|Split|  -  |Ploče|Ploče|  connects the continental part of Croatia with Mediterranean  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia| . It is complete with two lanes in both directions in its full length. The highway winds itself as a panoramic road through the Croatian hills. The highway currently ends near the  |Ploče|Ploče|  sea port, but is planned to continue further on to  |Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik| .     The most important edifice on the A1 is the  |Sveti_Rok_Tunnel|Sveti_Rok_Tunnel|  , which goes through the famous  |Velebit|Velebit|  mountain range barrier. The most modern, and at the same time the longest Croatian tunnel, is also along the A1: the  |Mala_Kapela_Tunnel|Mala_Kapela_Tunnel|  , which passes through the  |Mala_Kapela|Mala_Kapela|  mountain range. The  |Sveti_Ilija_Tunnel|Sveti_Ilija_Tunnel|  through  |Biokovo|Biokovo|  connects the  |Makarska|Makarska|  riviera with the A1.     Since June 2005 the  |Istrian_Y|Istrian_Y|  extends from the Slovenian border in  |Istria|Istria|  and the A7 connects Slovenia to  |Rijeka|Rijeka| . The A2 connection between  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  via  |Hrvatsko_Zagorje|Hrvatsko_Zagorje|  to  |Maribor|Maribor|  was completed in May 2007.     Motorway A3 extends from Slovenia via the  |Zagreb_bypass|Zagreb_Bypass|  through the length of  |Slavonia|Slavonia|  to the  |Serbia|Serbia| n border. In Slavonia there is now another motorway, A5, along the  |European_route_E73|European_Route_E73|  between the  |Hungarian_border|Hungary|  at  |Beli_Manastir|Beli_Manastir| ,  |Osijek|Osijek|  and the  |Bosnian_border|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina| . This route will eventually continue as a modern motorway towards  |Sarajevo|Sarajevo|  and further on to the Croatian sea port of  |Ploče|Ploče| .     The A4 connection from Zagreb to  |Varaždin|Varaždin|  and  |Čakovec|Čakovec|  exists since 2003, which was extended to the Hungarian border in 2008 to complete the upgrade of the  |European_route_E71|European_Route_E71| . The A6 route between  |Rijeka|Rijeka|  and  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  was constructed as an expressway in spring 2004, and upgraded to a full motorway in 2008, thus upgrading the Croatian section of the  |European_route_E65|European_Route_E65| . Together these two upgrades completed the European north-south corridor Vb.     A motorway connection of  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  to the important industrial city of  |Sisak|Sisak|  is planned to be constructed as  |A11|A11| .     Significant tunnel and bridge construction projects in the south of Dalmatia are planned, such as a  long  |Pelješac_bridge|Pelješac_Bridge| , connecting the  |Pelješac|Pelješac|  peninsula to the Croatian mainland.     By 2008, numerous service areas and petrol stations had been constructed along all Croatian motorways. All Croatian motorways are equipped with enclosed service areas with gas stations and parking. Many areas have restaurants and childrens playgrounds.          The term brza cesta or expressway refers to  |limited_access_roads|Limited_Access_Road|  specifically designated as such by legislation and marked with appropriate  |limited_access_road|Limited_Access_Road|  traffic signs. The expressways may comprise two or more traffic lanes, while they normally do not have emergency lanes.     Polu-autocesta or  semi-highway  refers to a two-lane, undivided road running on one roadway of a motorway while the other is in construction. By legal definition, all semi-highways are expressways.     The expressway routes in Croatia usually correspond to a state road and are marked a D followed by a number. The E numbers are designations of  |European_routes|European_Route| .          Major roads that arent part of the motorway system are državne ceste . They are marked with the letter D and the roads number.     The most traveled state routes in Croatia are:    D1 , connects  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  and Split via  |Lika|Lika|  - passes through  |Karlovac|Karlovac| ,  |Slunj|Slunj| ,  |Plitvice|Plitvička_Jezera| ,  |Korenica|Korenica| ,  |Knin|Knin| ,  |Sinj|Sinj| .    D2 , connects  |Varaždin|Varaždin|  and  |Osijek|Osijek|  via  |Podravina|Podravina|  - passes through  |Koprivnica|Koprivnica| ,  |Virovitica|Virovitica| ,  |Slatina|Slatina_Croatia| ,  |Našice|Našice| .    D8 , connects  |Rijeka|Rijeka|  and  |Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik| , widely known as  Jadranska magistrala  and part of  |E65|European_Route_E65|  - runs along the coastline and connects many cities on the coast, including  |Crikvenica|Crikvenica| ,  |Senj|Senj| ,  |Zadar|Zadar| ,  |Šibenik|Šibenik| ,  |Trogir|Trogir| ,  |Split|Split| ,  |Omiš|Omiš| ,  |Makarska|Makarska|  and  |Ploče|Ploče| .     Since the construction of  |A1|A1|  motorway beyond  |Gorski_kotar|Gorski_Kotar|  started, D1 and D8 are much less used.     These routes are monitored by Croatian roadside assistance because they connect important locations. Like all state routes outside major cities, they are only two-lane arterials and do not support heavy traffic. All state routes are routinely maintained by Croatian road authorities. The road sign for a state route has a blue background and the routes designation in white. State routes have one, two or three-digit numbers.       Secondary routes are known as county roads. They are marked with signs with yellow background and road number. These roads designations are rarely used, but usually marked on regional maps if these roads are shown. Formally, their designation is the letter Ž and the number. County roads have four-digit numbers.     The least known are the so-called local roads. Their designations are never marked on maps or by roadside signs and as such are virtually unknown to public. Their designations consist of the letter L and a five-digit number.       In contrast to the fairly underdeveloped rail traffic,  |bus|Bus| es represent the most-accepted, cheapest and widely used means of public transport. National bus traffic is very well developed and it is very easy to reach even the remotest parts of Croatia by bus. Almost all buses on national routes are air-conditioned and offer pleasant traveling comfort. The Croatian parliament has passed a law that no bus should be older than 12 years - however, this decision is currently frozen because of the high cost for bus operators.     In practice, bus fares are collected on the bus while traveling, which is sometimes even cheaper than when paying at the ticket office and sometimes a ticket office fee .     From Croatia, there are many international bus routes to the neighboring countries , as well as to Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland and to other European countries. International buses correspond to European standards.      |Zagreb|Zagreb|  has the largest and most modern bus terminal in Croatia. It is located near the downtown in  |Trnje|Trnje_Zagreb|  district on the  |Marin_Držić_Avenue|Marin_Držić_Avenue| . It sports specially designed waiting areas above the bus stopping and parking area. The Zagreb bus terminal is close to the central train station, Glavni kolodvor and it is easy to reach by  |tram|Tram|  lines and by car.              Croatia has several large  |seaports|Seaport| . The largest seaport with the deepest channel to a port in the Adriatic is  |Port_of_Rijeka|Port_Of_Rijeka|  on the northern Croatian coast, followed by  |Ploče|Ploče|  in southern Dalmatia. The port of Ploče is of strategic importance for the industries of  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina| . The largest Croatian passenger port is  |Split|Port_Of_Split|  in  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia| , also called gateway to the islands, followed by  |Zadar|Zadar| . There are 66 inhabited islands along the Croatian coast which means there is a large number of local ferry connections.     Ports and harbors:  |Omišalj|Omišalj| ,  |Ploče|Port_Of_Ploče| ,  |Rijeka|Port_Of_Rijeka| ,  |Šibenik|Šibenik| |_Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik| ,  |Dugi_Rat|Dugi_Rat| ,  |Pula|Pula_Croatia| ,  |Split|Port_Of_Split| ,  |Zadar|Zadar| |_Vukovar|Vukovar|  ,  |Sisak|Sisak|  ,  |Slavonski_Brod|Slavonski_Brod|  ,  |Zupanja|Zupanja|  ,  |Osijek|Osijek| |_Merchant_marine|Merchant_Marine|  total: 77 ships   ships by type:  |bulk_carrier|Bulk_Carrier|  24   cargo 7    |chemical_tanker|Chemical_Tanker|  8   passenger/cargo 27    |petroleum_tanker|Oil_Tanker|  10   refrigerated cargo 1   foreign-owned ships registered here as a  |flag_of_convenience|Flag_Of_Convenience| |Jadrolinija|Jadrolinija| , serves Croatias many islands and links coastal cities. Ferry services to Italian cities of  |Venice|Venice| ,  |Ancona|Ancona| ,  |Pescara|Pescara|  and  |Bari|Bari|  from around a dozen of Croatian sea ports, most notably  |Rovinj|Rovinj| ,  |Rijeka|Rijeka| ,  |Zadar|Zadar| ,  |Split|Split| ,  |Korčula|Korčula|  and  |Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik| , is available on a daily or weekly basis. From April to September the schedule is denser and can include several round trips within a day.       Croatia is also on the important  |Danube|Danube|  waterway, which connects Eastern and Central Europe. The major Danube port is  |Vukovar|Vukovar| .     Perennially navigable rivers:    |Danube|Danube| |_Sava|Sava|  - from  |Rugvica|Rugvica|  until it exits Croatia near Gunja. The most upstream port is in  |Sisak|Sisak| .     Total  |waterway|Waterway|  length  of crude oil pipelines in Croatia, connecting the Port of Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, as well as several transhipment terminals. The system has a capacity of 20  million tonnes per year.  The natural gas transportation system comprises  of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines, and more than 300 associated structures, connecting production rigs, the  |Okoli|Okoli_Croatia|  natural gas storage facility, 27 end-users and 37 distribution systems.
