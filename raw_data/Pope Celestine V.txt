           Pope Celestine V , born Pietro Angelerio , also known as Pietro da Morrone, Peter of Morrone, and Peter Celestine, was pope for five months from 5 July to 13 December 1294, when he resigned. He was also a  |monk|Monk|  and  |hermit|Hermit|  who founded the order of the  |Celestines|Celestines|  as a branch of the  |Benedictine_order|Order_Of_Saint_Benedict| .     He was elected  |pope|Pope|  in the Catholic Churchs  |last_non-conclave_papal_election|Papal_Election,_1292–94| , ending a two-year impasse. Among the few edicts of his to remain in force was the confirmation of the right of the pope to abdicate; nearly all of his other official acts were annulled by his successor,  |Boniface_VIII|Pope_Boniface_Viii| .  On 13 December 1294, a week after issuing the decree, Celestine resigned, stating his desire to return to his humble, pre-papal life. He was subsequently imprisoned by Boniface in the castle of  |Fumone|Fumone|  in the  |Lazio|Lazio|  region, in order to prevent his potential installation as  |antipope|Antipope| . He died in prison on 19 May 1296 at the age of 81.     Celestine was  |canonized|Canonization|  on 5 May 1313 by  |Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V| . No subsequent pope has taken the name Celestine.         According to tradition, Pietro Angelerio was born to parents Angelo Angelerio and Maria Leone in a town called SantAngelo Limosano, in the Kingdom of Sicilia . SantAngelo Limosano is now part of  |Provincia_di_Campobasso|Provincia_Di_Campobasso| , in  |Molise|Molise| ,  |Italy|Italy| .     After his fathers death he began working in the fields. His mother Maria was a key figure in Pietros spiritual development: she imagined a different future for her deeply beloved son than becoming just a  |farmer|Farmer|  or a  |shepherd|Shepherd| . From the time he was a child, he showed great intelligence and love for others. He became a  |Benedictine|Benedictine| |monk|Monk|  at Faifoli in the  |Diocese_of_Benevento|Diocese_Of_Benevento|  when he was 17. He showed an extraordinary disposition toward  |asceticism|Asceticism|  and solitude, and in 1239 retired to a solitary cavern on the mountain Morrone, hence his name . Five years later he left this retreat, and went with two companions to a similar cave on the even more remote Mountain of Maiella in the  |Abruzzi|Abruzzi|  region of central  |Italy|Italy| , where he lived as strictly as possible according to the example of St.  |John_the_Baptist|John_The_Baptist| . Accounts exist of the severity of his  |penitential|Penance|  practices.             While living like this he founded, in 1244, the order subsequently named after him, the  |Celestines|Celestines| . A new religious community was formed, and Pietro gave them a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices. In 1264 the new institution was approved by  |Urban_IV|Urban_Iv| . Having heard that it was probable that  |Pope_Gregory_X|Pope_Gregory_X| , then holding  |a_council_at_Lyon|Second_Council_Of_Lyon| , would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the  |Lateran_Council|Lateran_Council|  had commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, Pietro went to Lyon. There he succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the  |Benedictines|Benedictines|  and following the rule of  |Saint_Benedict|Saint_Benedict| , but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under the Papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Pietro lived to see himself Superior-General to thirty-six monasteries and more than six hundred monks. Pietro, however, cannot be accused of ambition or the lust of power when a monastic superior, any more than when he insisted on divesting himself of the Papacy, to which he was subsequently raised.     As soon as he had seen his new order thus consolidated he gave up the government of it to a certain Robert, and retired once again to a still more remote solitude to give himself up more entirely to solitary penance and prayer. Shortly afterwards, in a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery of  |Majella|Majella|  being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that  |Abbazia_Morronese|Abbazia_Morronese|  in the plains of  |Sulmona|Sulmona|  should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the General-Superior, as it has continued to be to the present day.               The cardinals assembled at  |Perugia|Perugia|  after the death of  |Pope_Nicholas_IV|Pope_Nicholas_Iv|  in April 1292. After more than two years, a consensus had still not been reached. Pietro, well known to the cardinals as a Benedictine hermit, sent the cardinals a letter warning them that divine vengeance would fall upon them if they did not quickly elect a pope. Latino Malabranca, the aged and ill dean of the  |College_of_Cardinals|College_Of_Cardinals|  cried out, In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, I elect brother Pietro di Morrone. The cardinals promptly ratified Malabrancas desperate decision. When sent for, Pietro obstinately refused to accept the papacy, and even, as  |Petrarch|Petrarch|  says, tried to flee, until he was finally persuaded by a deputation of cardinals accompanied by the king of  |Naples|Charles_Ii_Of_Naples|  and the  |pretender_to_the_throne_of_Hungary|Charles_Martel_Of_Anjou| . Elected on 5 July 1294, Jeffrey H.

James Loughlin . Pope St. Celestine V , The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company               Shortly after assuming office, Celestine issued a papal bull granting a rare  |plenary_indulgence|Plenary_Indulgence|  to all pilgrims visiting  |Santa_Maria_di_Collemaggio|Santa_Maria_Di_Collemaggio|  through its holy door on the anniversary of his papal coronation.  The Perdonanza Celestiniana festival is celebrated in LAquila every 28–29 August in commemoration of this event.      With no political experience, Celestine proved to be an especially weak and ineffectual pope. Clement Vs bull of canonization noted his marvelous simplicity and inexperience in everything belonging to the rule of the Church He held his office in the  |Kingdom_of_Naples|Kingdom_Of_Naples| , out of contact with the  |Roman_Curia|Roman_Curia|  and under the complete power of King  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_Naples| . He appointed the kings favorites to church offices, sometimes several to the same office. One of these was  |Louis_of_Toulouse|Louis_Of_Toulouse| , whom Celestine ordered given  |clerical_tonsure|Clerical_Tonsure|  and  |minor_orders|Minor_Orders| , although this was not carried out. He renewed a decree of  |Pope_Gregory_X|Pope_Gregory_X|  that had established stringent rules for  |papal_conclaves|Papal_Conclave|  after a similarly prolonged election. In one decree, he appointed three cardinals to govern the church during  |Advent|Advent|  while he fasted, which was again refused. McBrien, Richard P. . Lives of the Popes     Realizing his lack of authority and personal incompatibility with papal duties, he consulted with Cardinal Benedetto Caetani about the possibility of resignation. This resulted in one final decree declaring the right of resignation, which he promptly exercised after five months and eight days in office, thus on 13 December 1294, Celestine V resigned. Papal Resignations ,  |Olivier_Guyotjeannin|Olivier_Guyotjeannin| , The Papacy: An Encyclopedia, Vol. 3, ed. Philippe Levillain, , 1305. In the formal instrument of renunciation, he recited as the causes moving him to the step: The desire for humility, for a purer life, for a stainless conscience, the deficiencies of his own physical strength, his ignorance, the perverseness of the people, his longing for the tranquility of his former life .  |Walker,_Jesse|Jesse_Walker|  ,  Reason  Having divested himself of every outward symbol of papal dignity, he slipped away from Naples and attempted to retire to his old life of solitude.     The next pope to resign of his own accord was  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  in 2013, 719 years later.              The former Celestine, now reverted to Pietro Angelerio, was not allowed to become a hermit once again. Various parties had opposed his resignation and the new  |Pope_Boniface_VIII|Pope_Boniface_Viii|  had reason to worry that one of them might install him as an  |antipope|Antipope| . To prevent this he ordered Pietro to accompany him to Rome. Pietro escaped and hid in the woods before attempting to return to Sulmona to resume monastic life. This proved impossible, and Pietro was captured after an attempt to flee to  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia|  was thwarted when a tempest forced his ship to return to port. Boniface imprisoned him in the castle of Fumone near  |Ferentino|Ferentino|  in  |Lazio|Lazio| , attended by two monks of his order, where Pietro died after 10 months at about the age of 81. His supporters spread the allegation that Boniface had treated him harshly and ultimately executed Pietro, but there is no clear historical evidence of this. Gregorovius, Ferdinand . History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages vol. 5 part 2 Pietro was buried at Ferentino, but his body was subsequently moved to the Basilica Santa Maria di Collemaggio in  |Aquila|Laquila| .      |Philip_IV_of_France|Philip_Iv_Of_France| , who had supported Celestine and bitterly opposed Boniface, nominated Celestine for sainthood following the election of  |Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V| . The latter signed a decree of dispensation on 13 May 1306 to investigate the nomination.  He was canonized on 5 May 1313 after a  |consistory|Papal_Consistory|  in which Bonifaces  |Caetani|Caetani|  family was outvoted by members of the rival  |Colonna|Colonna|  family. Ronald C. Finucane . Contested Canonizations: The Last Medieval Saints, 1482–1523. Catholic University of America Press, p. 19.         Most modern interest in Celestine V has focused on his resignation.  He was the first pope to formalize the resignation process and is often said to have been the first to resign. In fact he was preceded in this by  |Pontian|Pope_Pontian|  ,  |John_XVIII|John_Xviii|  ,  |Benedict_IX|Benedict_Ix|  , and  |Gregory_VI|Pope_Gregory_Vi|  .  As noted above, Celestines own decision was brought about by mild pressure from the Church establishment. His reinstitution of Gregory Xs conclave system established by the papal bull  Ubi periculum  has been respected ever since.     A 1966 visit by  |Pope_Paul_VI|Pope_Paul_Vi|  to Celestines place of death in Ferentino along with his speech in homage of Celestine prompted speculation that the Pontiff was considering retirement. Cf.       Celestines remains survived the  |2009_LAquila_earthquake|2009_Laquila_Earthquake|  with one Italian spokesman saying it was another great miracle by the pope .  They were then recovered from the basilica shortly after the earthquake.  While inspecting the earthquake damage during a 28 April 2009 visit to the Aquila,  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  visited Celestines remains in the badly damaged Santa Maria di Collemaggio and left the woolen  |pallium|Pallium|  he wore during his papal inauguration in April 2005 on his glass casket as a gift.       To mark the 800th anniversary of Celestines birth, Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed the Celestine year from 28 August 2009 through 29 August 2010.  Benedict XVI visited the  |Sulmona_Cathedral|Sulmona_Cathedral| , near Aquila, on 4 July 2010  as part of his observance of the Celestine year and prayed before the altar consecrated by Celestine containing his relics, on 10 October 1294.      His entry in the  Martyrologium Romanum  for 19 May reads as follows:     :Ad Castrum Fumorense prop Alatrium in Latio, natalis sancti Petri Caelestini, qui, cum vitam eremeticam in Aprutio ageret, fama sanctitatis et miraculorum clarus, octogenarius Romanus Pontifex electus est, assumpto nomine Caelestini Quinti, sed eodem anno munere se abdicavit et solitudinem recedere maluit.     :At Castrum Fumorense near  |Alatri|Alatri|  in  |Lazio|Lazio| , the birth of Saint Peter Celestine, who, when leading the life of a hermit in Abruzzo, being famous for his sanctity and miracles, was elected Roman Pontiff as an octogenarian, assumed the name Celestine V, but abandoned his office that same year and preferred to return to solitude.            A persistent tradition identifies Celestine V as the nameless figure  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri|  sees among those in the antechamber of Hell, in the enigmatic verses:          The first commentators to make this identification included Dantes son  |Jacopo_Alighieri|Jacopo_Alighieri| ,  followed by Graziolo Bambaglioli in 1324. The identification is also considered probable by recent scholars .  |Petrarch|Petrarch|  was moved to defend Celestine vigorously against the accusation of cowardice and some modern scholars have suggested Dante may have meant someone else .     In 1346, Petrarch declared in his De vita solitaria that Celestines refusal was a virtuous example of solitary life.      Pope Celestine V is referenced in Chapter 88 of  |Dan_Browns|Dan_Brown|   Angels & Demons , where he is erroneously referenced as an example of a  |murdered_pope|List_Of_Murdered_Popes| . Celestine V is also mentioned in the  |film_version|Angels_&_Demons| .     The life of Pope Celestine V is dramatised in the plays  Lavventura di un povero cristiano   by  |Ignazio_Silone|Ignazio_Silone|  in 1968 and Sunsets and Glories by  |Peter_Barnes|Peter_Barnes|  in 1990.     Pope Celestine Vs life is the subject of the short story Brother of the Holy Ghost in Brendan Connells short story collection The Life of Polycrates and Other Stories for Antiquated Children.      Pope Celestine V is the subject of  |Stefania_Del_Montes|Stefania_Del_Monte|  book Celestino V. Papa Templare o Povero Cristiano?, published in 2009 and translated into English under the title The Story and Legacy of Celestine V in 2010.      Pope Celestine V is the subject of a popular history by author  |Jon_M._Sweeney|Jon_M._Sweeney| , The Pope Who Quit: A True Medieval Tale of Mystery, Death, and Salvation, published by Image Books/Random House in 2012.
