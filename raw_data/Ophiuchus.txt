              Ophiuchus  is a large  |constellation|Constellation|  straddling the  |celestial_equator|Celestial_Equator| . Its name is from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|   Ophioukhos;  |serpent|Snake| -bearer , and it is commonly represented as a man grasping a snake . The serpent is represented by the constellation  |Serpens|Serpens| . Ophiuchus was one of the 48  constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| , and it remains one of the 88  modern constellations. It was formerly referred to as Serpentarius  and Anguitenens.             Ophiuchus lies between  |Aquila|Aquila| ,  |Serpens|Serpens| ,  |Scorpius|Scorpius| ,  |Sagittarius|Sagittarius| , and  |Hercules|Hercules| , northwest of the center of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| . The southern part lies between  |Scorpius|Scorpius|  to the west and  |Sagittarius|Sagittarius|  to the east.    In the  |northern_hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| , it is best visible in summer.  It is opposite  |Orion|Orion| . Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a  |serpent|Serpens| ; the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts,  |Serpens_Caput|Serpens_Caput|  and  |Serpens_Cauda|Serpens_Cauda| . Ophiuchus straddles the equator with the majority of its  |area|Solid_Angle|  lying in the southern hemisphere.  |Rasalhague|Rasalhague| , its brightest star, lies near the northern edge of Ophiuchus at about 12½°N declination.  The constellation extends southward to −30°  declination. Segments of the ecliptic within Ophiuchus are south of −20°  declination.     In contrast to Orion, from November to January , Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However, for much of the  |Arctic_Circle|Arctic_Circle|  in the Northern Hemispheres winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the south. In the Northern Hemispheres spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, at those times and places in the Arctic when  |midnight_sun|Midnight_Sun|  obscures the stars. In countries close to the equator, Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October evening sky.              The brightest stars in Ophiuchus include  |α_Ophiuchi|Alpha_Ophiuchi| , called Rasalhague , at magnitude  2.07, and  |η_Ophiuchi|Eta_Ophiuchi| , known as Sabik , at magnitude  2.43. Chartrand III, Mark R.; Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 170 . Other bright stars in the constellation include  |β_Ophiuchi|Beta_Ophiuchi| , Cebalrai  and  |λ_Ophiuchi|Lambda_Ophiuchi| , or Marfik . Chartrand, at p. 170.      |RS_Ophiuchi|Rs_Ophiuchi|  is part of a class called recurrent  |novae|Nova| , whose brightness increase at irregular intervals by hundreds of times in a period of just a few days. It is thought to be at the brink of becoming a type-1a  |supernova|Supernova| .   |Barnards_Star|Barnards_Star| , one of the  |nearest_stars|List_Of_Nearest_Stars|  to the  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  , lies in Ophiuchus. It is located to the left of β and just north of the V-shaped group of stars in an area that was once occupied by the now-obsolete constellation of  |Taurus_Poniatovii|Taurus_Poniatovii|  . In 2005, astronomers using data from the  |Green_Bank_Telescope|Green_Bank_Telescope|  discovered a  |superbubble|Superbubble|  so large that it extends beyond the plane of the galaxy.  It is called the  |Ophiuchus_Superbubble|Ophiuchus_Superbubble| .     In April 2007,  |astronomers|Astronomy|  announced that the  |Swedish|Sweden| -built  |Odin_satellite|Odin|  had made the first detection of clouds of  |molecular|Molecule| |_oxygen|Oxygen|  in space, following observations in the constellation Ophiuchus.  The  |supernova_of_1604|Sn_1604|  was first observed on 9  October 1604, near θ  Ophiuchi.  |Johannes_Kepler|Johannes_Kepler|  saw it first on 16  October and studied it so extensively that the  |supernova|Supernova|  was subsequently called Keplers Supernova. He published his findings in a book titled De stella nova in pede Serpentarii .  |Galileo|Galileo_Galilei|  used its brief appearance to counter the  |Aristotelian|Aristotle| |_dogma|Dogma|  that the heavens are changeless. In 2009 it was announced that  |GJ_1214|Gj_1214| , a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeated, cyclical dimming with a period of about 1.5  days consistent with the transit of a small orbiting planet.  The planets low density suggests that the planet may have a substantial component of low-density gas—possibly  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  or  |steam|Steam| .  The proximity of this star to Earth makes it a tempting target for further observations. In April 2010, the naked-eye star  |ζ_Ophiuchi|Zeta_Ophiuchi|  was occulted by the asteroid  |824_Anastasia|824_Anastasia| .

Ophiuchus contains several  |star_clusters|Star_Cluster| , such as  |IC_4665|Open_Cluster_Ic_4665| ,  |NGC_6633|Ngc_6633| ,  |M9|Globular_Cluster_M9| ,  |M10|Globular_Cluster_M10| ,  |M12|Globular_Cluster_M12| ,  |M14|Globular_Cluster_M14| ,  |M19|Globular_Cluster_M19| ,  |M62|Globular_Cluster_M62| , and  |M107|Globular_Cluster_M107| , as well as the  |nebula|Nebula|  IC  4603-4604.    |M10|Messier_10|  is a fairly close  |globular_cluster|Globular_Cluster| , only 20,000  light-years from Earth. It has a magnitude of 6.6 and is a Shapley class  VII cluster. This means that it has intermediate concentration; it is only somewhat concentrated towards its center.     The unusual  |galaxy|Galaxy|  merger remnant and  |starburst_galaxy|Starburst_Galaxy| |_NGC_6240|Ngc_6240|  is also in Ophiuchus. At a distance of 400  million light-years, this butterfly-shaped galaxy has two  |supermassive_black_holes|Supermassive_Black_Hole|  3,000  light-years apart. Confirmation of the fact that both  |nuclei|Active_Galactic_Nucleus|  contain black holes was obtained by  |spectra|Electromagnetic_Spectrum|  from the  |Chandra_X_ray_Observatory|Chandra_X_Ray_Observatory| . Astronomers estimate that the black holes will  |merge|Binary_Black_Hole|  in another billion years. NGC  6240 also has an unusually high rate of  |star_formation|Star_Formation| , classifying it as a  |starburst_galaxy|Starburst_Galaxy| . This is likely due to the heat generated by the orbiting black holes and the aftermath of the  |collision|Galactic_Merger| .      In 2006, a new nearby  |star_cluster|Star_Cluster|  was discovered associated with the 4th magnitude star  |Mu_Ophiuchi|Mu_Ophiuchi| .  The  |Mamajek_2|Mamajek_2|  cluster appears to be a poor cluster remnant analogous to the  |Ursa_Major_Moving_Group|Ursa_Major_Moving_Group| , but 7  times more distant . Mamajek  2 appears to have formed in the same star-forming complex as the  |NGC_2516|Ngc_2516|  cluster roughly 135  million years ago.       |Barnard_68|Barnard_68|  is a large  |dark_nebula|Dark_Nebula| , located 410  light-years from Earth. Despite its diameter of 0.4  light-years, Barnard  68 only has twice the mass of the Sun, making it both very diffuse and very cold, with a temperature of about 16   |kelvins|Kelvin| . Though it is currently stable, Barnard  68 will eventually collapse, inciting the process of  |star_formation|Star_Formation| . One unusual feature of Barnard  68 is its vibrations, which have a period of 250,000  years. Astronomers speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the  |shock_wave|Shock_Wave|  from a  |supernova|Supernova| .      |Voyager_1|Voyager_1|  is in the same direction of space as the constellation.       There is no evidence of the constellation preceding the  |classical_era|Classical_Greece| , and in  |Babylonian_astronomy|Babylonian_Astronomy| , a Sitting Gods constellation seems to have been located in the general area of Ophiuchus. However, Gavin White proposes that Ophiuchus may in fact be remotely descended from this Babylonian constellation, representing  |Nirah|Nirah| , a serpent-god who was sometimes depicted with his upper half human but with serpents for legs. White, Gavin; Babylonian Star-lore, Solaria Pubs, 2008, p. 187f     The earliest mention of the constellation is in  |Aratus|Aratus| , informed by the lost catalogue of  |Eudoxus_of_Cnidus|Eudoxus_Of_Cnidus|  :       To the  |ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greece| , the constellation represented the god  |Apollo|Apollo|  struggling with a huge snake that guarded the  |Oracle_of_Delphi|Oracle_Of_Delphi| .      Later myths identified Ophiuchus with  |Laocoön|Laocoön| , the  |Trojan|Troy|  priest of  |Poseidon|Poseidon| , who warned his fellow Trojans about the  |Trojan_Horse|Trojan_Horse|  and was later slain by a pair of sea serpents sent by the gods to punish him. According to  |Roman_era|Roman_Era|  mythography, Hyginus, Astronomica 2, 14, Latin Mythography, 2nd  century  AD the figure represents the healer  |Asclepius|Asclepius| , who learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming  |immortal|Immortality|  under Asclepius care,  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  killed him with a bolt of  |lightning|Lightning| , but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works. In medieval  |Islamic_astronomy|Islamic_Astronomy|  , the constellation was known as Al-Ḥawwaʾ, the snake-charmer .      |Aratus|Aratus|  describes Ophiuchus as trampling on  |Scorpius|Scorpius|  with his feet. This is depicted in Renaissance to Early Modern  |star_charts|Star_Chart| , beginning with  |Albrecht_Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer|  in 1515; in some depictions , Scorpius also seems to threaten to sting Serpentarius in the foot. This is consistent with  |Azophi|Azophi| , who already included  |ψ_Oph|Psi_Ophiuchi|  and  |ω_Oph|Omega_Ophiuchi|  as the snake-charmers left foot , and  |θ_Oph|Theta_Ophiuchi|  and  |ο_Oph|Omicron_Ophiuchi|  as his right foot , making Ophiuchus a  |zodiacal_constellation|Zodiacal_Constellation|  at least as regards his feet.  This arrangement has been taken as symbolic in later literature, and placed in relation to the words spoken by God to the serpent in the  |Garden_of_Eden|Garden_Of_Eden|  .  |Maunder_Edward_Walter|Edward_Walter_Maunder| ; Astronomy of the Bible  |Azophis|Azophi| |_Uranometry|Book_Of_Fixed_Stars| , 18th  century copy of a manuscript prepared for  |Ulugh_Beg|Ulugh_Beg|  in 1417   Uranias Mirror , a set of constellation cards published in London c.  1825. Above the tail of the serpent is the now-obsolete constellation  |Taurus_Poniatovii|Taurus_Poniatovii|  while below it is  |Scutum|Scutum| .               Ophiuchus is one of thirteen constellations that cross the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic| . Shapiro, Lee T. , in The Space Place It has therefore been called the 13th sign of the zodiac . However, this confuses  |sign|Astrological_Sign|  with  |constellation|Constellation| .  The signs of the zodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of celestial longitude, approximately the distance the Sun travels in a month, and are aligned with the seasons so that the  |March_equinox|March_Equinox|  always falls on the boundary between Pisces and Aries.     Constellations, on the other hand, are unequal in size and are based on the positions of the stars. The  |constellations_of_the_zodiac|Zodiacal_Constellationzodiacal_Constellations|  have only a loose association with the signs of the zodiac, and do not in general coincide with them.  In Western astrology the constellation of Aquarius, for example, largely corresponds to the sign of Pisces. Similarly, the constellation of Ophiuchus occupies most  of the sign of Sagittarius . The differences are due to the fact that the time of year that the sun passes through a particular zodiac constellations position has slowly changed  over the centuries from when the Greeks,  |Babylonians|Babylonians| , and  |Dacians|Dacians|  through  |Zamolxis|Zamolxis|   originally developed the Zodiac.
