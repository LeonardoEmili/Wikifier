In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.

Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church , article Christmas The Jewish calendar date of 14 Nisan was believed to be that of creation , See discussion in the Talmud , and Aryeh Kaplan s The Shofar of Mercy , on the apparent contradiction between that tradition and the Jewish celebration of creation on 1 Tishrei. as well as of the Exodus and so of Passover , and Christians held that the new creation, both the death of Jesus and the beginning of his human life , occurred on the same date, which some put at 25 March in the Julian calendar. Alexander V. G. Allen, Christian Institutions , p. 474 , p.72 Frank C. Senn, Introduction to Christian Liturgy , p. 114     It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men lived a whole number of years, without fractions, so that Jesus was considered to have been conceived on 25 March, as he died on 25 March, which was calculated to have coincided with 14 Nisan. William J. Colinge, Historical Dictionary of Catholicism , p. 99 Sextus Julius Africanus gave 25 March as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus. Joseph F. Kelly, The Origins of Christmas , p. 60 The tractate De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae falsely attributed to John Chrysostom also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March. A passage of the Commentary on the prophet Daniel by Hippolytus of Rome , written in about 204, has also been appealed to.     Among those who have put forward this view are Louis Duchesne, Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution , pp 261–265New York: Pueblo, 1986Oxford University Press 2011 Washington, D.C.: Pastoral Press, 1993St Vladimirs Seminary Press 1997 editorsOxford University Press 2000 Kempen 1995 emphasis addedOxford University Press 2000 2009C.E. 274ProQuest 2008 20092009Sheed & Ward 1961Taylor & Francisthe Great": null
