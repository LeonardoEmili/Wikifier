A killer micro is a  |microprocessor|Microprocessor| -based machine that infringes on  |mini|Minicomputer| ,  |mainframe|Mainframe_Computer| , or  |supercomputer|Supercomputer|  performance turf. It originally referred to the replacement of  |vector_supercomputers|Vector_Processor|  built with bipolar technology by  |Massively_Parallel_Processors|Massively_Parallel|  assembled from a larger number of lower performing microprocessors. These systems faced initial skepticism, based on the assumption that applications do not have significant parallelism, because of  |Amdahls_law|Amdahls_Law| , but the success of early systems such as  |nCUBE|Ncube|  and the fast progress in microprocessor performance following  |Moores_law|Moores_Law|  led to a fast replacement.     Taken from the title of Eugene Brooks  talk Attack of the Killer Micros at Supercomputing 1990. This title was probably chosen after the  Attack of the Killer Tomatoes   |cult_film|Cult_Film| .
