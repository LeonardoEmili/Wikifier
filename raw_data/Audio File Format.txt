An audio file format is a  |file_format|File_Format|  for storing  |digital_audio|Digital_Audio|  data on a  |computer|Computer|  system. The bit layout of the audio data is called the  |audio_coding_format|Audio_Coding_Format|  and can be uncompressed, or  |compressed|Audio_Compression|  to reduce the file size, often using  |lossy_compression|Lossy_Compression| . The data can be a raw  |bitstream|Bitstream|  in an audio coding format, but it is usually embedded in a  |container_format|Container_Format|  or an audio data format with defined storage layer.       It is important to distinguish between the  |audio_coding_format|Audio_Coding_Format| , the  |container|Container_Format|  containing the raw audio data, and an  |audio_codec|Audio_Codec| . A codec performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data while this encoded data is stored in a container file. Although most audio file formats support only one type of audio coding data , a multimedia container format  may support multiple types of audio and video data.     There are three major groups of audio file formats:     Uncompressed audio formats, such as  |WAV|Wav| ,  |AIFF|Aiff| ,  |AU|Au_File_Format|  or  |raw|Raw_Audio_Format|  header-less  |PCM|Pulse_Code_Modulation| ;   Formats with  |lossless_compression|Lossless_Compression| , such as  |FLAC|Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec| ,  |Monkeys_Audio|Monkeys_Audio|  ,  |WavPack|Wavpack|  ,  |TTA|Tta| ,  |ATRAC|Atrac|  Advanced Lossless,  |ALAC|Apple_Lossless|  ,  |MPEG_4_SLS|Mpeg_4_Sls| ,  |MPEG_4_ALS|Mpeg_4_Als| ,  |MPEG_4_DST|Mpeg_4_Dst| ,  |Windows_Media_Audio_Lossless_|Windows_Media_Audiowindows_Media_Audio_Lossless| , and  |Shorten|Shorten|  .   Formats with  |lossy|Lossy_Data_Compression|  compression, such as  |Opus|Opus| ,  |MP3|Mp3| ,  |Vorbis|Vorbis| ,  |Musepack|Musepack| ,  |AAC|Advanced_Audio_Coding| ,  |ATRAC|Atrac|  and  |Windows_Media_Audio_Lossy_|Windows_Media_Audiowindows_Media_Audio_Lossy| .          One major uncompressed audio format,  |LPCM|Pulse_Code_Modulation| , is the same variety of PCM as used in  |Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio|Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio|  and is the format most commonly accepted by low level audio  |APIs|Api|  and  |D_A_converter|Digital_To_Analog_Converter|  hardware. Although LPCM can be stored on a computer as a  |raw_audio_format|Raw_Audio_Format| , it is usually stored in a .wav file on  |Windows|Microsoft_Windows|  or in a .aiff file on  |macOS|Macos| . The AIFF format is based on the  |Interchange_File_Format|Interchange_File_Format|  , and the WAV format is based on the similar  |Resource_Interchange_File_Format|Riff|  . WAV and AIFF are designed to store a wide variety of audio formats, lossless and lossy; they just add a small,  |metadata|Metadata| -containing header before the audio data to declare the format of the audio data, such as LPCM with a particular  |sample_rate|Sampling| ,  |bit_depth|Audio_Bit_Depth| ,  |endianness|Endianness|  and number of  |channels|Audio_Channel| . Since WAV and AIFF are widely supported and can store LPCM, they are suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording.      |BWF|Broadcast_Wave_Format|  is a standard audio format created by the  |European_Broadcasting_Union|European_Broadcasting_Union|  as a successor to WAV. Among other enhancements, BWF allows more robust  |metadata|Metadata|  to be stored in the file. See  European Broadcasting Union: Specification of the Broadcast Wave Format  . This is the primary recording format used in many professional audio workstations in the television and film industry. BWF files include a standardized  |timestamp|Timestamp|  reference which allows for easy synchronization with a separate picture element. Stand-alone, file based, multi-track recorders from AETA,  Sound Devices,  Zaxcom,  HHB Communications Ltd,   |Fostex|Fostex| , Nagra, Aaton,  and  |TASCAM|Tascam|  all use BWF as their preferred format.       A lossless compressed format stores data in less space without losing any information. The original, uncompressed data can be recreated from the compressed version.     Uncompressed audio formats encode both sound and silence with the same number of bits per unit of time. Encoding an uncompressed minute of absolute silence produces a file of the same size as encoding an uncompressed minute of music. In a lossless compressed format, however, the music would occupy a smaller file than an uncompressed format and the silence would take up almost no space at all.     Lossless compression formats include the common   |FLAC|Flac| ,  |WavPack|Wavpack| ,  |Monkeys_Audio|Monkeys_Audio| ,  |ALAC|Apple_Lossless|  . They provide a compression ratio of about 2:1 . Development in lossless compression formats aims to reduce processing time while maintaining a good compression ratio.       Lossy compression enables even greater reductions in file size by removing some of the audio information and simplifying the data. This, of course, results in a reduction in audio quality, but a variety of techniques are used, mainly by exploiting  |psychoacoustics|Psychoacoustics| , to remove the parts of the sound that have the least effect on perceived quality, and to minimize the amount of audible noise added during the process. The popular  |MP3_format|Mp3|  is probably the best-known example, but the  |AAC_format|Advanced_Audio_Coding|  found on the iTunes Music Store is also common. Most formats offer a range of degrees of compression, generally measured in  |bit_rate|Bit_Rate| . The lower the rate, the smaller the file and the more significant the quality loss.
