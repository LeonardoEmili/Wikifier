         Lincoln is a  |cathedral_city|Cathedral_City|  and  |county_town|County_Town|  of  |Lincolnshire|Lincolnshire|  in the  |East_Midlands|East_Midlands|  of England. The  |non_metropolitan_district|Non_Metropolitan_District|  of Lincoln had a 2012 population of 94,600.   Retrieved 29 August 2014 The 2011 census gave the urban area of Lincoln, which includes  |North_Hykeham|North_Hykeham|  and  |Waddington|Waddington_Lincolnshire| , a population of 130,200.   |Roman|Roman_Britain|   Lindum Colonia  developed from an  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  settlement on the  |River_Witham|River_Witham| . The citys landmarks include  |Lincoln_Cathedral|Lincoln_Cathedral| , an example of  |English_Gothic_architecture|English_Gothic_Architecture|  and the tallest building in the world for over 200 years, and the 11th-century,  |Norman|Norman_Architecture| |_Lincoln_Castle|Lincoln_Castle| . The city is home to the  |University_of_Lincoln|University_Of_Lincoln|  and  |Bishop_Grosseteste_University|Bishop_Grosseteste_University| , and to  |Lincoln_City_FC|Lincoln_City_F_C_|  and  |Lincoln_United_FC|Lincoln_United_F_C_| .            Lincoln   The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  settlement of round wooden dwellings that have been dated to the 1st century BC.  This settlement was built by a deep pool  in the  |River_Witham|River_Witham|  at the foot of a large hill .      The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the  |Brythonic_language|Brythonic_Languages|  of Iron Age Britains  |Celt|Celt| ic inhabitants as Lindon The Pool ,  presumably referring to Brayford Pool . The extent of this original settlement is unknown as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins and modern Lincoln.     Lindum Colonia      The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the  |River_Witham|River_Witham|   and at the northern end of the  |Fosse_Way|Fosse_Way|  Roman road . The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently  |Latinised|Latin_Language|  to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.      The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to  |York|York|   in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after the Emperor  |Domitian|Domitian|  who ruled at the time, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below.     It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the  |River_Trent|River_Trent|  and through the  |River_Witham|River_Witham| . On the basis of the patently corrupt list of British bishops who attended the  |314_Council_of_Arles|Council_Of_Arles| , the city is now often considered to have been the capital of the  |province|Roman_Province|  of  |Flavia_Caesariensis|Flavia_Caesariensis|  which was formed during the late-3rd century  |Diocletian_Reforms|Diocletian_Reforms| . Subsequently, however, the town and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for  |Saint_Paulinus|Paulinus_Of_York|  visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629.             During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in  |Old_English|Old_English|  to become first Lindocolina, then Lincylene.      After the first destructive  |Viking|Viking|  raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at  |York|York| . Finds suggest a 100-to-1 preponderance over nominal mints Caistor, Horncastle and Louth; a hoard recovered at Corringham, near Gainsborough, is composed mainly of coins minted at Lincoln and York . After the establishment of the  |Danelaw|Danelaw|  in 886, Lincoln became one of the  |Five_Boroughs|Five_Burghs|  in the  |East_Midlands|East_Midlands| . Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900. Richard Hall, Viking Age Archaeology 2010:23. Lincoln experienced an unprecedented explosion in its economy with the settlement of the  |Danes|Danes| . Like York, the Upper City seems to have been given over to purely administrative functions up to 850 or so, while the Lower City, running down the hill towards the River Witham, may have been largely deserted. By 950, however, the banks of the Witham were newly developed with the Lower City being resettled and the suburb of Wigford quickly emerging as a major trading centre. In 1068, two years after the  |Norman_conquest|Norman_Conquest_Of_England| ,  |William_I|William_I_Of_England|  ordered  |Lincoln_Castle|Lincoln_Castle|  to be built on the site of the former Roman settlement, for the same strategic reasons and controlling the same road.                Construction of the first Lincoln Cathedral, within its close or walled precinct facing the castle, began when the see was removed from the quiet backwater of  |Dorchester_on_Thames|Dorchester_On_Thames_Oxfordshire| ,  |Oxfordshire|Oxfordshire| , and was completed in 1092;  it was rebuilt after a fire but was destroyed by an unusual earthquake in 1185. The rebuilt Lincoln Minster, enlarged to the east at each rebuilding, was on a magnificent scale, its  |crossing_tower|Crossing_Tower|  crowned by a spire reputed to have been  high, the highest in Europe. When completed the central of the three spires is widely accepted to have succeeded the  |Great_Pyramids_of_Egypt|Egyptian_Pyramids|  as the tallest man-made structure in the world.  Mary Jane Taber , The Cathedrals of England: An account of some of their distinguishing characteristics, p. 100.      The Bishops of Lincoln were among the magnates of medieval England: the  |Diocese_of_Lincoln|Diocese_Of_Lincoln| , the largest in England, had more monasteries than the rest of England put together, and the diocese was supported by large estates.     When  |Magna_Carta|Magna_Carta|  was drawn up in 1215, one of the witnesses was  |Hugh_of_Wells|Hugh_Of_Wells| ,  |Bishop_of_Lincoln|Bishop_Of_Lincoln| . One of only four surviving originals of the document is preserved in  |Lincoln_Castle|Lincoln_Castle| .        Among the most famous bishops of Lincoln were  |Robert_Bloet|Robert_Bloet| , the magnificent  |justiciar|Justiciar|  to  |Henry_I|Henry_I_Of_England| ,  |Hugh_of_Avalon|Hugh_Of_Avalon| , the cathedral builder canonised as  |St_Hugh_of_Lincoln|St_Hugh_Of_Lincoln| ,  |Robert_Grosseteste|Robert_Grosseteste| , the 13th century intellectual,  |Henry_Beaufort|Henry_Beaufort| , chancellor of  |Henry_V|Henry_V_Of_England|  and  |Henry_VI|Henry_Vi_Of_England| ,  |Thomas_Rotherham|Thomas_Rotherham| , a politician deeply involved in the  |Wars_of_the_Roses|Wars_Of_The_Roses| ,  |Philip_Repyngdon|Philip_Repyngdon| , chaplain to  |Henry_IV|Henry_Iv_Of_England|  and defender of  |Wycliffe|John_Wycliffe| , and  |Thomas_Wolsey|Thomas_Wolsey| , the lord chancellor of  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii_Of_England| . Theologian  |William_de_Montibus|William_De_Montibus|  was the head of the cathedral school and chancellor until his death in 1213.     The administrative centre was the  |Bishops_Palace|Lincoln_Medieval_Bishops_Palace| , the third element in the central complex. When it was built in the late 12th century, the Bishops Palace was one of the most important buildings in England. Built by Hugh of Lincoln, its East Hall range over a vaulted under-croft is the earliest surviving example of a roofed domestic hall. The chapel range and entrance tower were built by Bishop William of Alnwick, who modernised the palace in the 1430s. Both Henry VIII and  |James_I|James_Vi_And_I|  were guests of bishops here; the palace was sacked by royalist troops during the  |civil_war|English_Civil_War|  in 1648.            During  |the_Anarchy|The_Anarchy| , in 1141 Lincoln was the site of a  |battle|Battle_Of_Lincoln|  between  |King_Stephen|Stephen_Of_England|  and the forces of  |Empress_Matilda|Empress_Matilda| , led by her illegitimate half-brother  |Robert_1st_Earl_of_Gloucester|Robert_1St_Earl_Of_Gloucester| . After fierce fighting in the citys streets, Stephens forces were defeated. Stephen himself was captured and taken to  |Bristol|Bristol| .     By 1150, Lincoln was among the wealthiest towns in England. The basis of the economy was cloth and  |wool|Wool| , exported to  |Flanders|Flanders| ; Lincoln  |weavers|Weaving|  had set up a  |guild|Guild|  in 1130 to produce Lincoln Cloth, especially the fine dyed scarlet and green, the reputation of which was later enhanced by  |Robin_Hood|Robin_Hood|  wearing woollens of  |Lincoln_green|Lincoln_Green| . In the Guildhall that surmounts the city gate called the  |Stonebow|Guildhall_And_Stonebow_Lincoln| , the ancient Council Chamber contains Lincolns civic insignia, a particularly fine collection of civic regalia.     Outside the precincts of cathedral and castle, the old quarter clustered around the Bailgate, and down Steep Hill to the  |High_Bridge|High_Bridge_Lincoln| , which bears  |half_timbered|Half_Timbered|  housing, with the upper storeys jutting out over the river. There are three ancient churches:  |St_Mary_le_Wigford|St_Mary_Le_Wigford|  and  |St_Peter_at_Gowts|St_Peter_At_Gowts|  are both 11th century in origin and  |St_Mary_Magdalene|St_Mary_Magdalene_Bailgate_Lincoln| , built in the late 13th century, is an unusual English dedication to the saint, whose cult was coming greatly into vogue on the European continent at that time.        Lincoln was home to one of the five most important Jewish communities in England, well established before it was officially noted in 1154. In 1190,  |anti_Semitic|Antisemitism|  riots that started in  |Kings_Lynn|Kings_Lynn| , Norfolk, spread to Lincoln; the Jewish community took refuge with royal officials, but their habitations were plundered. The so-called House of Aaron has a two-storey street frontage that is essentially 12th century and a nearby  |Jews_House|Jews_House|  likewise bears witness to the Jewish population.    In 1255, the affair called The  |Libel_of_Lincoln|Blood_Libel|  in which prominent Jews of Lincoln, accused of the ritual murder of a Christian boy  were sent to the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London|  and 18 were executed. The Jews were expelled en masse in 1290.        During the 13th century, Lincoln was the third largest city in England and was a favourite of more than one king. During the  |First_Barons_War|First_Barons_War| , it became caught up in the strife between the king and the rebel barons, who had allied with the French. It was  |here|Battle_Of_Lincoln|  and at  |Dover|Dover|  that the French and Rebel army was defeated. In the aftermath of the battle, the town was pillaged for having sided with  |Prince_Louis|Louis_Viii_Of_France| .  In 1266, during the  |Second_Barons_War|Second_Barons_War| , the disinherited rebels attacked the Jews of Lincoln, ransacked the  |synagogue|Synagogue| , and burned the records which registered debts.      According to some historians, the citys fortunes began to decline during the 14th century, although this assertion has been disputed, it being argued that the city remained buoyant in both trade and communications well into the 15th century. Thus in 1409, the city was made a county in its own right known as the County of the City of Lincoln. Thereafter, various additional rights being conferred on the town by successive monarchs, including those of an assay town . A. Kissane, Civic Community in Late Medieval Lincoln: Urban Society and Economy in the Age of the Black Death, 1289–1409 . Updated 4 January 2017 The oldest surviving  |secular|Secularity| |_drama|Drama|  in English,  The Interlude of the Student and the Girl  , may have originated from Lincoln.     Lincolns  |coat_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms| , not officially endorsed by the  |College_of_Arms|College_Of_Arms| , is believed to date from the 14th century. It is  Argent on a cross gules a fleur-de-lis or . The cross is believed to be derived from the Diocese of Lincoln, and the fleur-de-lis is the symbol of the Virgin Mary, to whom the cathedral is dedicated. The  |motto|Motto|  is CIVITAS LINCOLNIA .           The  |Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries|Dissolution_Of_The_Monasteries|  exacerbated Lincolns problems, cutting off its main source of diocesan income and drying up the network of patronage controlled by the bishop, with no fewer than seven monasteries closed within the city alone. A number of nearby abbeys were also closed, which led to further diminution of the regions political power. When the cathedrals great spire rotted and collapsed in 1549 and was not replaced, it was a significant symbol of Lincolns economic and political decline. However, the comparative poverty of post-medieval Lincoln preserved pre-medieval structures that would probably have been lost under more prosperous conditions.       Between 1642 and 1651, during the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War| , Lincoln was on the frontier between the  |Royalist|Cavalier|  and  |Parliamentary|Roundhead|  forces and changed hands several times. . Many buildings were badly damaged. Lincoln now had no major industry and no easy access to the sea and was poorly situated. Thus while the rest of the country was beginning to prosper at the beginning of the 18th century, Lincoln suffered immensely, travellers often commenting on the state of what had essentially become a one-street town.       By the  |Georgian_era|Georgian_Era| , Lincolns fortunes began to pick up, thanks in part to the  |Agricultural_Revolution|British_Agricultural_Revolution| . The re-opening of the  |Foss_Dyke|Foss_Dyke|  canal allowed coal and other raw materials vital to industry to be more easily brought into the city.     As well as the economic growth of Lincoln during this era, the city boundaries expanded to include the West Common. To this day, an annual Beat the Boundaries walk takes place along the perimeter of the common.       Coupled with the arrival of the railway links, Lincoln boomed again during the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , and several world-famous companies arose, such as  |Rustons|Ruston| ,  |Claytons|Clayton_Shuttleworth| ,  |Proctors|Proctor|  and  |William_Fosters|William_Foster_Co_Ltd| . Lincoln began to excel in heavy engineering, building locomotives, steam shovels and all manner of heavy machinery.     A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the  |_Old_Barracks_|The_Old_Barracks_Lincoln|   in 1857; these were replaced by the New Barracks  in 1890.   |Lincoln_Drill_Hall|Lincoln_Drill_Hall|  in Broadgate also opened in 1890.           Lincoln was hit by a major  |typhoid|Typhoid|  epidemic between November 1904 and August 1905 caused by polluted drinking water from Hartsholme Lake and the  |River_Witham|River_Witham| . Over 1,000 people contracted the disease and fatalities totalled 113,  including the man responsible for the citys water supply, Liam Kirk of Baker Crescent. Near the beginning of the epidemic, Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston installed a chlorine  |disinfection|Disinfection|  system just ahead of the poorly operating slow sand filter to kill the bacteria causing the epidemic.

Westgate Water Tower was constructed to provide new water supplies to the city.      In the two  |world_wars|World_War| , Lincoln switched to war production. The first ever  |tanks|Tank|  were invented, designed and built in Lincoln by  |William_Foster_Co_|William_Foster_Co_|  during the First World War and population growth provided more workers for even greater expansion. The tanks were tested on land now covered by Tritton Road . During the Second World War, Lincoln produced a vast array of war goods, from tanks, aircraft,  |munitions|Munitions|  and military vehicles.      Ruston & Hornsby produced  |diesel_engines|Diesel_Engine|  for ships and  |locomotives|Locomotive| , then by teaming up with former colleagues of  |Frank_Whittle|Frank_Whittle|  and  |Power_Jets|Power_Jets|  Ltd, in the early 1950s, R & H opened the first-ever production line to build  |gas_turbine|Gas_Turbine|  engines for land-based and sea-based energy production. Hugely successful, it was the largest single employer in the city, providing over 5,000 jobs in its factory and research facilities, making it a rich takeover target for industrial conglomerates. It was subsumed by  |English_Electric|English_Electric|  in November 1966, which was then bought by  |GEC|General_Electric_Company_Plc|  in 1968, with diesel engine production being transferred to the Ruston Diesels Division in  |Newton_le_Willows|Newton_Le_Willows| , Lancashire, at the former  |Vulcan_Foundry|Vulcan_Foundry| , which was eventually bought by the German  |MAN_Diesel|Man_Diesel|   in June 2000.           It merged with  |Alstom|Alstom|  of France in the late 1980s, then in 2003 was bought out by  |Siemens|Siemens|  of Germany, now being called  |Siemens_Industrial_Turbomachinery|Siemens_Power_Generation| . This also includes what is left of  |Napier_Turbochargers|Napier_Turbochargers| . Plans were announced early in 2008 for the construction of a new plant just outside the city boundary at  |Teal_Park|Teal_Park_Lincolnshire| ,  |North_Hykeham|North_Hykeham| .  Unfortunately Siemens made large-scale redundancies and moved jobs to both  |Sweden|Sweden|  and the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| . The factory now employs 1300 people. R & Hs former  |Beevor_Foundry|Beevor_Foundry|  is now owned by  |Hoval_Group|Hoval_Group|  who make industrial boilers . The Aerospace Manufacturing Facility at the Firth Road site was divested to  |ITP_Engines|Industria_De_Turbo_Propulsores|  UK, in January 2009 from Alstom Aerospace Ltd.       Lincolns second largest private employer is James Dawson and Son, a belting and hose manufacturer founded in Lincoln in the late 19th century. It is located at two sites, both on the citys Tritton Road. The main site, next to the University of Lincoln, operated using Lincolns last coal-fired boiler, until it was replaced by a gas-powered boiler in July 2018. Dawsons became part of the  |Fenner|Fenner_Plc|  group, based in Hull, in the late 1970s.     New suburbs were built in the years after 1945, but heavy industry declined towards the end of the 20th century, as it did generally in the UK economy. Nevertheless, more people in Lincoln are still employed today in building gas turbines than in any other field.     Much development, particularly around the Brayford area, has followed the construction of the University of Lincolns Brayford Campus, which opened in 1996.  In 2012, Bishop Grosseteste teaching college was also awarded university status.       Lincolns economy is based mainly on  |public_administration|Forms_Of_Government| , commerce, arable farming and tourism, with industrial relics like  |Ruston|Ruston|   still in existence. However, many of Lincolns industrial giants have long ceased production in the city, leaving large empty industrial warehouse-like buildings. More recently, these buildings have become multi-occupant units, with the likes of  |Lincs_FM|Lincs_Fm|  radio station  and  |LA_Fitness|La_Fitness|  gym taking up space. The main employment sectors in Lincoln are; public administration, education and health, which accounts for 34 per cent of the workforce. Distribution, restaurants and hotels account for 25 per cent of the workforce.      Like many other cities in Britain, Lincoln has developed a growing  |IT|Information_Technology|  economy, with many e-commerce mail order companies setting up in or around the city. A plethora of other, more conventional small industrial businesses are located in and around Lincoln. One of the reasons for building the University of Lincoln was to increase inward investment and act as a springboard for small companies. The Universitys presence has also drawn many more licensed premises to the town centre around the Brayford Pool. A new small business unit next door to a university accommodation building, the Think Tank, opened in June 2009.         The  |Extra|Extra|  motorway services company is based on Castle Hill, with most new UK service areas being built by Swayfields who are the parent company. There are two main electronics companies in the town:  |Chelmsford|Chelmsford| -based  |e2V|English_Electric_Valve_Company|   is situated between Carholme Road  and the  |Foss_Dyke|Foss_Dyke|  next-door to Carholme Golf Club;  and  |Dynex_Semiconductor|Dynex_Semiconductor|  is on Doddington Road near the A46 bypass just inside the borough boundary, and near  |North_Hykeham|North_Hykeham| .  |Bifrangi|Bifrangi| , an Italian company, makes  |crankshafts|Crankshaft|  for  |off_road_vehicles|Off_Road_Vehicle|  , using a  |screw_press|Screw_Press| ; it is based at the former Tower Works formerly owned by  |Smith_Clayton_Forge|Smith_Clayton_Forge| .     Lincoln is the functional hub of a wider area that encompasses several satellite settlements, such as Welton, Saxilby, Skellingthorpe and Washingborough. These villages look to Lincoln for most service and employment needs. Including them boosts the citys population to about 165,000.  Lincoln is the main centre for jobs and facilities in Central Lincolnshire, and performs a wider regional role that extends to cover much of Lincolnshire and parts of Nottinghamshire. According to a document entitled Central Lincolnshire Local Plan Core Strategy , Lincoln is within a travel-to-work area with a population of about 300,000.     Since 1994 Lincoln has gained two universities, and this has been associated with a lot of growth in the services sector. New blocks of flats, restaurants and entertainment venues have appeared. Entertainment venues linked to the universities include  |The_Engine_Shed|The_Engine_Shed|  and The Venue Cinema.       Around the  |Tritton_Road_|B1003_Road|  trading estate, many new businesses have begun trading from large units with car parking. Lincoln has a choice of seven large national supermarkets . The St Marks Square complex has  |Debenhams|Debenhams|  as its flagship store and an accompanying trading estate with well-known chain stores.          The city is a tourist centre and those who come do so to visit the numerous historic buildings including the cathedral the castle, and the medieval Bishops Palace.         |The_Collection|The_Collection| , of which the Usher Gallery is now a part, is an important attraction. Housed partly in a purpose-built venue, it currently contains over 2,000,000 objects, and was one of the four finalists for the 2006  |Gulbenkian_Prize|Gulbenkian_Prize| . Any material from official archaeological excavations in Lincolnshire is eventually deposited in The Collection so it is growing all the time.     Other attractions include the  |Museum_of_Lincolnshire_Life|Museum_Of_Lincolnshire_Life|  and the  |International_Bomber_Command_Centre|International_Bomber_Command_Centre| . Tranquil destinations close by include  |Whisby_Nature_Reserve|Whisby_Nature_Park|  and Hartsholme Country Park , while noisier entertainment can be found at  |Waddington_airfield|Raf_Waddington| ,  |Scampton_airfield|Raf_Scampton|  , the County Showground or the  |Cadwell_Park|Cadwell_Park| |_motor_racing|Auto_Racing|  circuit near  |Louth|Louth_Lincolnshire| .     Because of its climate, Lincoln attracts many of its tourists in summer, but also on the first Thursday of December until the following Sunday when the Bailgate area of the city holds its annual  |Christmas_Market|Lincoln_Christmas_Market|  in and around the Castle grounds. The market is based upon the traditional German-style Christmas market as found in several German cities, including Lincolns twin town  |Neustadt_an_der_Weinstrasse|Neustadt_An_Der_Weinstrasse| . In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Christmas Market, the event was cancelled due to atrocious conditions of heavy snowfall across Lincolnshire and most of the United Kingdom.         Lincoln lies  north of London by road,  at a height of   |above_sea_level|Above_Mean_Sea_Level|  by the  |River_Witham|River_Witham| , stretching to  above sea level around the cathedral. It occupies a gap in the  |Lincoln_Cliff|Lincoln_Cliff|  .      The city is also 76 miles north-east of  |Birmingham|Birmingham| , 32 miles north-east of  |Nottingham|Nottingham| , 47 miles north of  |Peterborough|Peterborough|  and 40 miles east south-east of  |Sheffield|Sheffield| .       The city lies on the  |River_Witham|River_Witham| , which flows through this gap. Lincoln is thus divided informally into two zones, known unofficially as uphill and downhill.        The uphill area comprises the northern part of the city, on top of the Lincoln Cliff . This area includes the historical quarter, including  |Lincoln_Cathedral|Lincoln_Cathedral| ,  |Lincoln_Castle|Lincoln_Castle|  and the Medieval Bishops Palace, known locally as The Bail .  It includes residential suburbs to the north and north-east. The downhill area comprises the city centre and the suburbs to the south and south-west. The aptly named  |Steep_Hill|Steep_Hill|  is a narrow, pedestrian street connecting the two . It passes through an archway known as the Stonebow.        This divide, peculiar to Lincoln, was once an important class distinction, with uphill more affluent and downhill less so. The distinction dates from the time of the  |Norman_conquest|Norman_Conquest| , when the religious and military elite occupied the hilltop. The construction and expansion of suburbs in both parts of the city since the mid-19th century has diluted the distinction, but uphill housing continues to fetch a premium.       The  |mute_swan|Mute_Swan|  is an iconic species for Lincoln. Many pairs nest each year beside the Brayford, and they feature on the universitys heraldic emblem. Other bird life within the city includes  |peregrine_falcon|Peregrine_Falcon| ,  |tawny_owl|Tawny_Owl|  and  |common_kingfisher|Common_Kingfisher| .   Mammals living on the citys edges include  |red_fox|Red_Fox| ,  |roe_deer|Roe_Deer|  and  |least_weasel|Least_Weasel| .   |European_perch|European_Perch| ,  |northern_pike|Northern_Pike|  and  |bream|Bream|  are among fish seen in the Witham and Brayford.  Nature reserves within and around the city include Greetwell Hollow SSSI, Swanholme SSSI,  |Whisby_Nature_Park|Whisby_Moor| ,  |Boultham_Mere|Boultham|  and  |Hartsholme_Country_Park|Hartsholme_Country_Park| .     Since about 2016,  |Little_egrets|Little_Egret|  have nested in the Birchwood area and  |otters|Eurasian_Otter|  have been seen in the River Witham. Both species are native to Britain and repopulating the area after extermination by humans.       Several invasive species of plants and animals have recently reached Lincoln.  |Japanese_knotweed|Japanese_Knotweed|  and  |Himalayan_balsam|Himalayan_Balsam|  are Asian plant species particularly concentrated around the River Witham.  |Galinsoga|Galinsoga|  and  |Amsinckia|Amsinckia|  are American species found among weeds in the city.  |American_mink|American_Mink|  are also occasionally sighted on the River Witham.       Lincoln has a typically East Midland  |maritime_climate|Maritime_Climate|  with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest  |Met_Office|Meteorological_Office|  weather station is at  |RAF_Waddington|Raf_Waddington| , about  to the south of the city centre.
