              The South African Republic  was an independent and  |internationally_recognised|Diplomatic_Recognition|  state located in what is now  |South_Africa|South_Africa| , from 1852 to 1902.     The republic defeated the  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  in what is often referred to as the  |First_Boer_War|First_Boer_War|  and remained independent until the end of the  |Second_Boer_War|Second_Boer_War|  on 31  May 1902, when it was forced to surrender to the British. After the war the territory of the ZAR became the  |Transvaal_Colony|Transvaal_Colony| . During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , there was an attempt at resurrecting the republic in the  |Maritz_rebellion|Maritz_Rebellion| .     The land area that was once the ZAR now comprises all or most of the provinces of  |Gauteng|Gauteng| ,  |Limpopo|Limpopo| ,  |Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga| , and  |North_West|North_West|  in the northeastern portion of modern-day  |Republic_of_South_Africa|Republic_Of_South_Africa| .       Constitutionally the name of the country was the . The ZAR was also commonly referred to as  in reference to the area over the  |Vaal_River|Vaal_River| ,  including by the British and European press. The British objected to the use of the name . After the end of the First Boer War, the ZAR became a British  |Suzerainty|Suzerainty|  and in the  |Pretoria_Convention|Pretoria_Convention|  of 3 August 1881,  the British insisted on the use of the name Transvaal State over . Irish University Press Series: British Parliamentary Papers Colonies Africa, This convention was renegotiated in the  |London_Convention|London_Convention|  dated 27 February 1884, a subsequent treaty between Britain and the ZAR, and Britain acquiesced and the ZAR reverted to the use of the previous name.      The name of the South African Republic was of such political significance that on 1 September 1900, the British declared by special proclamation that the name of the country be changed from  to the Transvaal. This proclamation was issued during the British occupation of the region in the  |Second_Boer_War|Second_Boer_War|  and while the ZAR was still nominally an independent country.     On 31 May 1902, the  |Treaty_of_Vereeniging|Treaty_Of_Vereeniging|  was signed with the government of the South African Republic, the Orange Free State government, and the British government, ending the war, and converted the ZAR into the  |Transvaal_Colony|Transvaal_Colony| . Following the establishment of the  |Union_of_South_Africa|Union_Of_South_Africa|  in 1910, the Transvaal Colony became  |Transvaal_Province|Transvaal| . The name Transvaal was finally changed in 1994, when the South African government broke up the province into four provinces and renamed the core region to  |Gauteng|Gauteng| .              In paleolithic times, between 2.2  and 3.3  million years ago, hominids lived within the geographic area of the ZAR. The earliest hominid bones, between 2.2  and 3.3  million years old, were discovered at  |Sterkfontein|Sterkfontein|  in 1994. In 1938  |Paranthropus_robustus|Paranthropus_Robustus|  bones were found at Kromdraai, and during 1947 several more examples of Australopithecus africanus were uncovered in Sterkfontein.       The South African Republic came into existence on 17 January 1852, when the British signed the  |Sand_River_Convention|Sand_River_Convention|  treaty with about 40,000   |Boer_people|Boer_People| , recognising their independence in the region to the north of the  |Vaal_River|Vaal_River| .     The first president of the ZAR was  |Marthinus_Wessel_Pretorius|Marthinus_Wessel_Pretorius| , elected in 1857, son of Boer leader  |Andries_Pretorius|Andries_Pretorius| , who commanded the Boers to victory at the  |Battle_of_Blood_River|Battle_Of_Blood_River| . The capital was established at  |Potchefstroom|Potchefstroom|  and later moved to  |Pretoria|Pretoria| . The parliament was called the  and had 24 members.       The unpopular presidency of  |Thomas_F_Burgers|Thomas_F_Burgers|  came to a head with his campaign against the  |Bapedi|Pedi_People|  under  |Sekhukune|Sekukuni| . The republic close to bankruptcy and his siege of Sekhukuneœ’s stronghold failed because commando members objected to Burgerss theology, calling him a heretic, and abandoned the siege in droves. Burgers, having failed to eliminate the threat off the Bapedi, resigned and left the country. A. N. Pelzer writes: Although made overtures for peace, he was not defeated and this fact, together with the shaky financial position, gave Sir  |Theophilus_Shepstone|Theophilus_Shepstone|  the pretext he required to annex the republic as the  |Transvaal|Transvaal_Colony| , a British colony, on 12 April 1877.  Alan F. Hattersley, The Annexation of the Transvaal, 1877. History 21.81 : 41-47.      Sir  |Garnet_Wolseley|Garnet_Wolseley| , High Commissioner for South East Africa, declared war on  |Sekhukune|Sekukuni| , and with the aid of British troops and allied troops – including the Swazis who had supported Burgers – and in 1879 defeated him and imprisoned him in Pretoria. With the threat of Sekhukune removed, the burghers were no longer so amenable to British rule.     On 13 December 1880, the members of the last  were summoned to a meeting at  |Paardekraal|Krugersdorp| , where authority was placed in the hands of a triumvirate comprising  |Paul_Kruger|Paul_Kruger| ,  |Piet_Joubert|Piet_Joubert|  and  |Marthinus_W_Pretorius|Marthinus_W_Pretorius| . They declared  |Heidelberg|Heidelberg_Gauteng|  their seat of government and hoisted the  |Vierkleur|Vierkleur|  there on 16 December. The war – not officially declared to the occupying British troops – opened with an irregular attack on a British regiment on the march at  |Bronkhorstspruit|Battle_Of_Bronkhorstspruit| . The British garrisons in the Transvaal were besieged, but only one fell to the republicans.     The British suffered defeat at  |Laing’s_Nek|Battle_Of_Laings_Nek|  and  |Ingogo|Ingogo| , and on 27 February 1881, at  |Majuba|Battle_Of_Majuba_Hill| , where General Sir  |George_Pomeroy_Colley|George_Pomeroy_Colley|  fell at the head of his troops. While the British would in other circumstances have sent more troops and defeated the rebels, Prime Minister  |William_Gladstone|William_Gladstone|  chose to make peace. Drawing up of the detailed peace treaty  was left in the hands of a royal commission comprising Sir  |Hercules_Robinson|Hercules_Robinson| , General Sir  |Evelyn_Wood|Evelyn_Wood|  and Justice  |John_de_Villiers|John_De_Villiers_1St_Baron_De_Villiers|  of the Cape Colony. Britain now referred to the territory as the Transvaal State, but the  regarded the old South African Republic as having been restored.       The ZAR became fully independent on the 27 February 1884, when the  |London_Convention|London_Convention|  was signed. The country independently also entered into various agreements with other foreign countries after that date. On 3 November 1884 the country signed a postal convention with the government of the  |Cape_Colony|Cape_Colony|  and later a similar convention with the  |Orange_Free_State|Orange_Free_State| .     In November 1859, the independent Republics of  |Lijdenburg|Republic_Of_Lydenburg|  and  |Utrecht|Republic_Of_Utrecht|  merged with the ZAR. On 9 May 1887,  |burghers|Burgher|  from the territories of  |Stellaland|Stellaland|  and  |Goosen|State_Of_Goshen|  were granted rights to the ZAR franchise. On 25 July 1895 the burghers that took part in the battle at  |Zoutpansberg|Zoutpansberg| , were granted citizenship of the ZAR.          The constitution of the ZAR was legally interesting for its time. It contained provisions for the division between the political leadership and office bearers in government administration. The legal system consisted of higher and lower courts and had adopted a jury system. Laws were enforced by the  |South_African_Republic_Police|South_African_Republic_Police|   which were divided into Mounted Police  and Foot Police.     On 10 April 1902, the Magistrates Court powers were extended to increase the civil ceiling amounts and to expand criminal jurisdiction to include all criminal cases not punishable by death or banishment. Also established were municipal government, the  |Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand|  District Court and the High Court of Transvaal.       Initially, the state and church were not separated in the constitution; citizens of the ZAR had to be members of the  |Nederduitsch_Hervormde_Kerk|Nederduitsch_Hervormde_Kerk|  – a breakaway of the  |Dutch_Reformed_Church|Dutch_Reformed_Church| . In 1858, these clauses were altered in the constitution to allow for the  to approve other Dutch Christian churches. The  |Reformed_Church|Reformed_Churches_In_South_Africa|  was approved by the  in 1858, which had the effect of allowing Paul Kruger, of the  |Gereformeerde_Kerk|Reformed_Churches_In_South_Africa|  to remain a citizen of the ZAR. The Bible itself was also often used to interpret the intention of legal documents. The Bible was also used to interpret a prisoner exchange agreement, reached in terms of the  |Sand_River_Convention|Sand_River_Convention| , between a commando of the ZAR, led by Kruger, and a Commando of the Orange Free State.     President  |Jacobus_Nicolaas_Boshof|Jacobus_Nicolaas_Boshoff|  had issued a death sentence over two ZAR citizens, for treason. Kruger argued with President Boshof that the Bible said punishment does not mean a death sentence and at the prisoner exchange, it was agreed that the accused would be punished if found guilty. After double-checking Commandant Kruger’s Bible, President Boshof commuted the sentences to lashes with a  |sjambok|Sjambok| .           Citizenship of the ZAR was legislated by the constitution as well as Law No 7 of 1882, as amended on 23 June 1890. Citizenship was gained by being born in the republic or by naturalisation. The voting age was 16 years. Persons not born in the republic could become citizens by taking the prescribed oath and procuring the letters of naturalisation. The oath involved abandoning, discarding and renouncing all allegiance and subjugation towards foreign sovereignties and in particular their previous citizenship.     Foreigners had to have been residing in the Republic for a period of two years, be of good character and have been accepted as member of the Dutch Reformed or Reformed Church. On 20 September 1893 the ZAR Constitution was amended so that two thirds of the Volksraad would have to agree to changes to the citizenship law. This proclamation, No 224, also changed Law No 7 with regard to voting.     All citizens who were born in the ZAR or had obtained their franchise prior to 23 June 1890 would have the right to vote for both the first and second  and in all other elections. Citizens who obtained their franchise through naturalization after 23 June 1890 would be able to vote in all elections, except those for the first . The total population of the republic in 1890 was an estimated 120,000 people.        The constitution promoted racism as it treated European people differently from native people. Although slavery was illegal in the constitution and foreigners were discriminated against, black foreigners had fewer rights than their white counterparts. Black and Asian foreigners could never become citizens of the ZAR; at this time in history, this was very similar to many European countries as well as some states in the New World.       The language spoken and written by the citizens of the ZAR was a variant of  |High_Dutch|High_Dutch| , locally referred to as .   On 3 October 1884. the  stated that they had reason to believe that in certain schools impure  |Dutch|Dutch_Language|   was being used. The  issued Proclamation 207 and compelled the Superintendent of Education to apply the language law Law number 1, Article 7 of 1882, Locale Wetten der Z.A Rep. I, 1071. enforcing the exclusive use of Dutch. On 30 July 1888, Dutch language was declared the sole official language, in court as well as education, trade and general use. All other languages were declared foreign . Law articles 1017/1025 dd. 13 Juli 1888 & article 1026/1027, dd. 14 Juli 1888 & article 1030, dd. 16 Juli 1888.     These changes to the ZAR laws made the use of all other foreign languages illegal in the ZAR. Use of any foreign language was subject to criminal penalty and fine of £20 for each offence. The British similarly had declared English to be the only language spoken in the Cape Colony some decades earlier to outlaw  the Dutch language. The discovery of gold in 1885 led to a major influx of foreigners. By 1896 the language of government and citizens remained Dutch but in many market places, shops and homes the English language was spoken.             |Hendrik_Potgieter|Hendrik_Potgieter|  was elected at the assembly of 1849 as commandant general for life and it became necessary, to avoid strife, to appoint three commandants general all possessing equal powers.  Commandant General  |Andries_Pretorius|Andries_Pretorius|  became commandant general of the  |Potchefstroom|Potchefstroom|  and  |Rustenburg|Rustenburg|  districts. On 16 December 1852, Commandant General Potgieter died and his son, Piet, was appointed in his stead as commandant general of the  |Lydenburg|Lydenburg|  and  |Zoutpansberg|Zoutpansberg|  districts.     There were some disputes over cattle which Mapela was raising on behalf of Potgieter and earlier Commandant Scholtz had confiscated a large number of rifles and amounts of ammunition, rifle repair equipment and materials of war from the home of English missionary, The Rev Mr Livingstone. Livingstone admitted to storing these for Secheli and by this he was acting in breach of the Sand River Convention of 1852, which prescribed that neither arms nor ammunition should be supplied to the natives.    In 1853, Herman Potgieter was called to Mapela to come and cull the elephant population.      When Herman arrived, Maphela took Herman, his son, his groom and a few other burghers to show them where the elephants were. On the way, Mapela and hundreds of natives attacked the Potgieter party. They killed Hermans son, Andries, and then dragged Herman up a hill, where they proceeded to skin him alive. They stopped once they had torn the entrails from his body.  At the same time of these events, the Ndebele chief Magobane attacked and killed an entire convoy of women and children traveling to Pretoria. The two chiefs had concluded an agreement to murder all the Europeans in their respective districts  and to keep the cattle that they were raising for the Europeans.     General Piet Potgieter set out with 100 men from Zoutpansberg and Commandant General Pretorius left Pretoria with 200 men. After the commandos met up, they first attacked Magobane and the natives were driven back to their caves in the mountains where they lived before. The Boers held them at siege in their caves and eventually hundreds of women and children came out.     Orphan children of the native tribes were booked in strictly controlled by legal process, at appointed Boer families to look after them until they came of age.  The administration was similar to the system of indentured workers, which was simply another form of slavery, with the exception that children so registered had to be released at age 16. The commando would return all such children to the nearest landdrost district, for registration and allocation to a Boer family.     As there were slavers and other criminals dealing in children, any burgher found in possession of an unregistered minor child was guilty of a criminal offence. These children were also often called oorlams in reference to being overly used to the Dutch culture, and in reference to a hand-raised orphan sheep, or hanslam . These children, even after their 16th birthday, and being free to come and go as they please, never re-connected with their own culture and own language and except for surviving and being cared for in terms of food and shelter, were basically forcefully divorced from their native tribe forever.     Among the casualties of this war was Commandant General Potgieter.  The natives were armed with rifles and were good shots. The general was killed by native sniper on the ridge of a trench and his body recovered by then commandant Paul Kruger whilst under heavy fire from the natives. What remained of the joint commando, now under command of General Pretorius focussed their attention on Mapela. By the time the commando had reached Mapela, the natives had fled. A few wagons, bloody clothes, chests and other goods were discovered at a kop near Mapela’s town. Mapela and his soldiers escaped and with their rifles and ammunition intact and Mapela was only captured much later, in 1858.          Commandant-General  |Stephanus_Schoeman|Stephanus_Schoeman|  did not accept the  proclamation of 20 September 1858, under which members of the  |Reformed_Churches_of_South_Africa|Reformed_Churches_Of_South_Africa|  would be entitled to citizenship of the ZAR. Consequently, Paul Kruger was not accepted as a citizen and disallowed from political intercourse. Acting President van Rensburg called a special meeting of the general council of the  |Dutch_Reformed_Church|Dutch_Reformed_Church| , which then voted in a special resolution to allow members of the Reformed Church access to the franchise.       In 1876, a war between the ZAR and the  |Bapedi|Bapedi|  broke out over cattle theft and land encroachment.  The  declared war on the Pedi leader,  |Sekhukune|Sekukuni| , on 16 May 1876. The war only began in July 1876. The president of the ZAR, Burgers led an army of 2000 burghers and was joined by a strong force of  |Swazi|Swazi_People|  warriors. The Swazis joined the war to aid Mampuru, who was ousted from his position of chieftain by Sekhukune.     One of the early battles occurred at  |Botsabelo_Mission_Station|Botshabelo_Mpumalanga|  on 13 July 1876, against Johannes Dinkwanyane, who was Sekhukune’s brother. The Boer forces were led by Commandant Coetzee and accompanied by Swazi warriors. The Swazi warriors launched a surprise and successful attack while the Boers held back. Seeing this, the Swazis refused to hand over to the Boers any spoils from the battle, thereafter leaving and returning to  |Swaziland|Swaziland| . Dinkwanyane’s followers also surrendered after this campaign.             On 12 April 1877, the British issued the Annexation of the S. A. Republic to the British Empire.  In it, the British stated that the country was unstable, ungovernable, bankrupt and facing civil war. The unsuccessful annexation did not suspend self-government and attempted to convert the ZAR into a colony of the British Empire.     The ZAR viewed this proclamation as an act of aggression, and resisted. Instead of declaring war, the country decided to send a delegation to the United Kingdom and the United States, to protest. This did not have any effect and the  |First_Boer_War|First_Boer_War|  formally broke out on 20 December 1880. The First Boer War was the first conflict since the American Revolution in which the British had been decisively defeated and forced to sign a peace treaty under unfavourable terms.     It would see the introduction of the khaki uniform, marking the beginning of the end of the famous Redcoat. The  |battle_of_Laings_Nek|Battle_Of_Laings_Nek|  would be the last occasion on which a British regiment carried its official regimental colours into battle. The  |Pretoria_Convention|Pretoria_Convention|  of 1881 was signed on 3 August 1881 and ratified on 25 October 1881 by the ZAR, where the  is referred to by the name Transvaal Territory . The  |Pretoria_Convention|Pretoria_Convention|  of 1881 was superseded in 1884 by the London Convention, and in which the British suzerainty over the South African Republic, was relinquished.     The British Government, in the London Convention, accepted the name of the country as the South African Republic. The convention was signed in duplicate in London on 27 February 1884, by  |Hercules_Robinson|Hercules_Robinson| ,  |Paul_Kruger|Paul_Kruger| ,  |Stephanus_Jacobus_du_Toit|Stephanus_Jacobus_Du_Toit|  and  |Nicolaas_Smit|Nicolaas_Smit| , and later ratified by the South African Republic . In 1885, rich gold reefs were discovered. ZAR burghers were farmers and not miners and much of the mining fell to immigrants. The immigrants were also referred to as outlanders . By 1897, immigrants had invested over 300,000,000  British Pounds in the ZAR goldfields.          The  |Malaboch_War|Malaboch_War|  was between Chief Malaboch of the Bahananwa people and the South African Republic Government led by Commandant-General  |Piet_Joubert|Piet_Joubert| . Malboch refused to pay taxes to the Transvaal after it was given back to the Boers in 1881 by the British, which resulted in a military drive against him by the South African Republic .             The British first attacked the ZAR with the December 1895  |Jameson_Raid|Jameson_Raid| , which ended in failure. British forces started building up troops and resources at the borders, followed by a demand for voting rights for the ZARs 60,000 foreign nationals—of whom 50,000 British. Kruger rejected the British demand and called for the withdrawal of British troops from the ZARs borders. When the British refused, Kruger declared war against Britain, Britain received assistance from Australia,  Canada,  and New Zealand  as well as forces and citizens of colonies like the Colony of Natal and the Cape Colony.     The  |Second_Boer_War|Second_Boer_War|  was a watershed for the  |British_Army|British_Army|  in particular and for the  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  as a whole. The British used  |concentration_camps|British_Concentration_Camps|  where women and children were held without adequate food or medical care.  The abhorrent conditions in these camps caused the death of 4,177  women and 22,074  children under 16; death rates were between 344 and 700 per 1000 per year.      The  |Treaty_of_Vereeniging|Treaty_Of_Vereeniging|  was signed on 31 May 1902. The treaty ended the existence of the ZAR and the  |Orange_Free_State|Orange_Free_State|  as independent Boer republics and placed them within the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| . On 20 May 1903, an Inter Colonial Council was established to manage the colonies of the British Government. The Boers were promised eventual limited self-government and this was granted in 1906 and 1907. The  |Union_of_South_Africa|Union_Of_South_Africa|  was established in 1910.          The  |Maritz_rebellion|Maritz_Rebellion|  was an armed insurrection which occurred in  |South_Africa|Union_Of_South_Africa|  in 1914 at the start of  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . It was led by Boers who created a provisional government and sought to reestablish the South African Republic in the Transvaal. Many members of the South African government were themselves former Boers who had fought with the Maritz rebels against the British in the Second Boer War. The rebel republic allied with  |Germany|German_Empire| , with whom the British was fighting at the time, and  |commandos|Boer_Commando| |_operated_in_and_out|South_West_Africa_Campaign|  of bordering  |German_territory|German_South_West_Africa| . By 1915, the rebellion had failed, and the ringleaders received heavy fines and terms of imprisonment.          The discovery of gold during the  |Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush|Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush|  in 1886 changed the economic fortunes of the formerly impoverished ZAR. The city of Johannesburg was founded as a gold mining town in the same year. Within 10 years it would be the largest city in the entire Southern Africa, surpassing Cape Town.     The discovery of gold allowed the construction of a railway network in the ZAR. The east-west railways in the ZAR, and notably the line from  |Pretoria|Pretoria|  to  |Lourenço_Marques|Lourenço_Marques|  in  |Portuguese_East_Africa|Portuguese_East_Africa| , were constructed by the  |Netherlands_South_African_Railway_Company|Netherlands_South_African_Railway_Company| . The construction of the Pretoria-Lourenço Marques line allowed the ZAR access to harbour facilities not controlled by the British Empire, a key policy of Paul Kruger who deemed it vital to the country’s long-term survival.       The  |flag_of_the_South_African_Republic|Flag_Of_The_South_African_Republic|  featured three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue  with a vertical green stripe at the hoist, and was known as the  . While the only legislation describing the flag required that the green panel be inscribed  , this was in fact rarely seen, and instead the motto was displayed with the republic’s coat of arms. The former  |flag_of_South_Africa_|Flag_Of_South_Africa| .
