In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , a monoid ring is a  |ring|Ring|  constructed from a ring and a  |monoid|Monoid| , just as a  |group_ring|Group_Ring|  is constructed from a ring and a  |group|Group| .       Let R be a ring and let G be a monoid. The monoid ring or monoid algebra of G over R, denoted RG or RG, is the set of formal sums   rg g ,   where rg   R for each g   G and r g 0 for all but finitely many g, equipped with coefficient-wise addition, and the multiplication in which the elements of R commute with the elements of G. More formally, RG is the set of functions  such that  is finite, equipped with addition of functions, and with multiplication defined by   :       .   If G is a  |group|Group| , then RG is also called the  |group_ring|Group_Ring|  of G over R.       Given R and G, there is a  |ring_homomorphism|Ring_Homomorphism|   sending each r to r1 ,   and a  |monoid_homomorphism|Monoid_Homomorphism|   sending each g to 1g .   We have that α commutes with β for all r in R and g in G.     The universal property of the monoid ring states that given a ring S, a ring homomorphism , and a monoid homomorphism  to the multiplicative monoid of S,   such that α commutes with β for all r in R and g in G, there is a unique ring homomorphism  such that composing α and β with γ produces α and β   .         The augmentation is the ring homomorphism  defined by   :     rg.     The  |kernel|Kernel|  of  & eta; is called the augmentation ideal. It is a  |free|Free_Module|  R- |module|Module|  with basis consisting of 1  –  g for all g in G not equal to 1.         Given a ring R and the monoid of  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number|  N , we obtain the ring R : Rx of  |polynomials|Polynomial|  over R.   The monoid N n gives the polynomial ring with n variables: RN n : RX 1 , ..., X n .       If G is a  |semigroup|Semigroup| , the same construction yields a semigroup ring RG .
