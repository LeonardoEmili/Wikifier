      David Wark Griffith was an American film director. Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation, he pioneered the feature-length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques, such as the  |close_up|Close_Up| .     His film  The Birth of a Nation  broke box-office records but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted  |African_Americans|African_Americans|  in a negative light and glorified the  |Ku_Klux_Klan|Ku_Klux_Klan| .  Intolerance  was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffiths later films were also successful, including  Broken Blossoms  ,  Way Down East  , and  Orphans of the Storm  , but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature,  The Struggle  .     Together with  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| ,  |Mary_Pickford|Mary_Pickford| , and  |Douglas_Fairbanks|Douglas_Fairbanks| , he founded  |United_Artists|United_Artists| , enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. Griffith was a founder member of the  |Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences|Academy_Of_Motion_Picture_Arts_And_Sciences| .            Griffith was born on a farm in  |Oldham_County_Kentucky|Oldham_County_Kentucky| , the son of Jacob Wark Roaring Jake Griffith  a  |Confederate_Army|Confederate_States_Army|  colonel in the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  who was elected as a Kentucky state legislator and Mary Perkins . Griffith was raised a  |Methodist|Methodist| ,  and he attended a one-room schoolhouse where he was taught by his older sister Mattie. His father died when he was ten, and the family struggled with poverty.     When Griffith was 14, his mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to  |Louisville_Kentucky|Louisville_Kentucky| ; there she opened a boarding house, which failed shortly afterward. Griffith then left high school to help support the family, taking a job in a dry goods store and later in a bookstore. He began his creative career as an actor in touring companies. Meanwhile, he was learning how to become a playwright, but had little success—only one of his plays was accepted for a performance.  He traveled to  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  in 1907 in an attempt to sell a script to  |Edison_Studios|Edison_Studios|  producer  |Edwin_Porter|Edwin_Porter| ; Porter rejected the script but gave him an acting part in  Rescued from an Eagles Nest  instead. He then decided to become an actor and appeared in many films as an extra.             In 1908, Griffith accepted a role as a stage extra in Professional Jealousy for the American Mutoscope and  |Biograph_Company|Biograph_Company| , where he met cameraman  |Billy_Bitzer|Billy_Bitzer| , and his career in the film industry changed forever.  In 1908, Biographs main director  |Wallace_McCutcheon_Sr_|Wallace_Mccutcheon_Sr_|  grew ill, and his son Wallace McCutcheon, Jr. took his place.  McCutcheon, Jr. did not bring the studio success; Biograph co-founder Harry Marvin gave Griffith the position, and he made the short  The Adventures of Dollie . He directed a total of 48 shorts for the company that year.     His short  In Old California  was the first film shot in  |Hollywood_California|Hollywood_California| . Four years later, he produced and directed his first feature film  Judith of Bethulia  , one of the earliest to be produced in the US. Biograph believed that longer features were not viable at that point. According to  |Lillian_Gish|Lillian_Gish| , the company thought that a movie that long would hurt eyes .           Griffith left Biograph because of company resistance to his goals and his cost overruns on the film. He took his company of actors with him and joined the  |Mutual_Film_Corporation|Mutual_Film_Corporation| . There, he co-produced  |The_Life_of_General_Villa|The_Life_Of_General_Villa| , a  |biographical|Biographical_Film| |_action|Action| – |drama_film|Drama|  starring  |Pancho_Villa|Pancho_Villa|  as himself, shot on location in México during a civil war. He formed a studio with Majestic Studio manager Harry Aitken  which became known as  |Reliance_Majestic_Studios|Reliance_Majestic_Studios|  and was later renamed Fine Arts Studio.  His new production company became an autonomous production unit partner in  |Triangle_Film_Corporation|Triangle_Film_Corporation|  along with  |Thomas_H_Ince|Thomas_H_Ince|  and  |Keystone_Studios|Keystone_Studios| |_Mack_Sennett|Mack_Sennett| . The Triangle Film Corporation was headed by Aitken, who was released from the Mutual Film Corporation, and his brother Roy.          Griffith directed and produced The Clansman through Reliance-Majestic Studios in 1915, which became known as  The Birth of a Nation  and is considered one of the first  |feature_length|Feature_Length|  American films.   The film was a success, but it aroused much controversy due to its depiction of  |slavery|Slavery_In_The_United_States| , the  |Ku_Klux_Klan|Ku_Klux_Klan| , and  |race_relations|Race_Relations|  in the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  and the  |reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States|Reconstruction_Era_Of_The_United_States| . It was based on  |Thomas_Dixon_Jr_s|Thomas_Dixon_Jr_|  1905 novel  The Clansman ; it depicts Southern slavery as benign, the enfranchisement of  |freedmen|Freedmen|  as a corrupt plot by the  |Republican_Party|Republican_Party| , and the Ku Klux Klan as a band of heroes restoring the rightful order. This view of the era was popular at the time and was endorsed for decades by historians of the  |Dunning_School|Dunning_School| , although it met with strong criticism from the  |National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People|National_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Colored_People|  and other groups.       The NAACP attempted to stop showings of the film. This was successful in some cities, but nonetheless it was shown widely and became the most successful box office attraction of its time. It is considered among the first blockbuster motion pictures, and broke all box office records that had been established until then. They lost track of the money it made , Lillian Gish remarked in a  |Kevin_Brownlow|Kevin_Brownlow|  interview.               Audiences in some major northern cities rioted over the films racial content, which was filled with action and violence.  Griffiths indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce Intolerance the following year, in which he portrayed the effects of intolerance in four different historical periods: the  |Fall_of_Babylon|Battle_Of_Opis| ; the  |Crucifixion_of_Jesus|Crucifixion_Of_Jesus| ; the events surrounding the  |St_Bartholomews_Day_massacre|St_Bartholomews_Day_Massacre|  ; and a modern story. Intolerance was not a financial success, although it had good box office turn-outs; it did not bring in enough profits to cover the lavish road show that accompanied it.  Griffith put a huge budget into the films production which could not be recovered in its box office.  He mostly financed Intolerance himself, contributing to his financial ruin for the rest of his life. Georges Sadoul . Dictionary of Films, P. Morris, ed. & trans.,  University of California Press.          Griffiths production partnership was dissolved in 1917 and he went to Artcraft, part of  |Paramount_Pictures|Paramount_Pictures| , and then to  |First_National_Pictures|First_National_Pictures|  . At the same time, he founded  |United_Artists|United_Artists|  together with  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| ,  |Mary_Pickford|Mary_Pickford| , and  |Douglas_Fairbanks|Douglas_Fairbanks| ; the studio was premised on allowing actors to control their own interests, rather than being dependent upon commercial studios.       He continued to make films, but he never achieved box office grosses as high as either The Birth of a Nation or Intolerance.        Though  |United_Artists|United_Artists|  survived as a company, Griffiths association with it was short-lived. While some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him. Griffith features from this period include  Broken Blossoms  ,  Way Down East  ,  Orphans of the Storm  ,  Dream Street  ,  One Exciting Night  and  America  . Of these, the first three were successes at the box office.  Griffith was forced to leave United Artists after  Isnt Life Wonderful  failed at the box office.          He made a part-talkie,  Lady of the Pavements  , and only two full-sound films,  Abraham Lincoln  and  The Struggle  . Neither was successful, and after The Struggle he never made another film.     In 1936, director  |Woody_Van_Dyke|Woody_Van_Dyke| , who had worked as Griffiths apprentice on  Intolerance , asked Griffith to help him shoot the famous earthquake sequence for  San Francisco , but did not give him any film credit. Starring  |Clark_Gable|Clark_Gable| ,  |Jeanette_MacDonald|Jeanette_Macdonald|  and  |Spencer_Tracy|Spencer_Tracy| , it was the top-grossing film of the year.      In 1939, the producer  |Hal_Roach|Hal_Roach|  hired Griffith to produce  Of Mice and Men  and  One Million B.C.  . He wrote to Griffith: I need help from the production side to select the proper writers, cast, etc. and to help me generally in the supervision of these pictures. Richard Lewis Ward, A History of the Hal Roach Studios, p. 109-110. Southern Illinois University, 2005. . In his  |Biograph|Biograph_Company|  days, Griffith had directed two films with prehistoric settings: Mans Genesis and  Brute Force  .     Although Griffith eventually disagreed with Roach over the production and parted, Roach later insisted that some of the scenes in the completed film were directed by Griffith. This would make the film the final production in which Griffith was actively involved. However, cast members accounts recall Griffith directing only the  |screen_tests|Screen_Test|  and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, Griffith asked that his name be removed. Ward, p. 110.     Although mostly forgotten by movie-goers of the time, Griffith was held in awe by many in the film industry. In the mid-1930s, he was given a special Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1946, he made an impromptu visit to the film location of  |David_O_Selznicks|David_O_Selznick|  epic western  Duel in the Sun , where some of his veteran actors,  |Lillian_Gish|Lillian_Gish| ,  |Lionel_Barrymore|Lionel_Barrymore|  and  |Harry_Carey|Harry_Carey| , were cast members. Gish and Barrymore found their old mentors presence distracting and became self-conscious. While the two were filming their scenes, Griffith hid behind set scenery.        On the morning of July 23, 1948, Griffith was discovered unconscious in the lobby at the  |Knickerbocker_Hotel|Knickerbocker_Hotel|  in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , California, where he had been living alone. He died of a  |cerebral_hemorrhage|Cerebral_Hemorrhage|  at 3:42 PM on the way to a Hollywood hospital. A public memorial service was held in his honor at the  |Hollywood_Masonic_Temple|Hollywood_Masonic_Temple| , but few stars came to pay their last respects. He is buried at Mount Tabor Methodist Church Graveyard in  |Centerfield_Kentucky|Centerfield_Kentucky| .  In 1950, The  |Directors_Guild_of_America|Directors_Guild_Of_America|  provided a stone and bronze monument for his gravesite. Schickel 1996 p. 605               Performer and director  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin|  called Griffith The Teacher of us All . Filmmakers such as  |Alfred_Hitchcock|Alfred_Hitchcock| ,   |Lev_Kuleshov|Lev_Kuleshov| ,   |Jean_Renoir|Jean_Renoir| ,   |Cecil_B_DeMille|Cecil_B_Demille| ,   |King_Vidor|King_Vidor| ,   |Victor_Fleming|Victor_Fleming| ,   |Raoul_Walsh|Raoul_Walsh| ,   |Carl_Theodor_Dreyer|Carl_Theodor_Dreyer| ,   |Sergei_Eisenstein|Sergei_Eisenstein| ,  and  |Stanley_Kubrick|Stanley_Kubrick|  have praised Griffith.           Griffith seems to have been the first to understand how certain film techniques could be used to create an expressive language; it gained popular recognition with the release of his  The Birth of a Nation  . His early shorts—such as Biographs  The Musketeers of Pig Alley  , the first gangster film —show that Griffiths attention to camera placement and lighting heightened mood and tension. In making Intolerance, the director opened up new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditional narrative.     In the 1951  Philco Television Playhouse  episode The Birth of the Movies , events from Griffiths film career were depicted. Griffith was played by  |John_Newland|John_Newland| .   In 1953, the  |Directors_Guild_of_America|Directors_Guild_Of_America|  instituted the D.  W.  Griffith Award, its highest honor. On December 15, 1999, DGA President  |Jack_Shea|Jack_Shea|  and the DGA National Board announced that the award would be renamed as the DGA Lifetime Achievement Award . They stated that, although Griffith was extremely talented, they felt his film The Birth of a Nation had helped foster intolerable racial stereotypes , and that it was thus better not to have the top award in his name.   In 1975, Griffith was honored on a ten-cent postage stamp by the United States.   D.W. Griffith Middle School in Los Angeles is named after Griffith.  Because of the association of Griffith and the racist nature of The Birth of a Nation, attempts have been made to rename the 100% minority-enrolled school.    In 2008 the  |Hollywood_Heritage_Museum|Hollywood_Heritage_Museum|  hosted a screening of Griffiths earliest films, to commemorate the centennial of his start in film.    On January 22, 2009 the Oldham History Center in  |La_Grange|La_Grange_Kentucky| , Kentucky, opened a 15-seat theatre in Griffiths honor. The theatre features a library of available Griffith films.       Griffith has six films preserved on the United States  |National_Film_Registry|National_Film_Registry| , deemed as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant . These are  Lady Helens Escapade  ,  A Corner in Wheat  ,  The Musketeers of Pig Alley  ,  The Birth of a Nation  ,  Intolerance: Loves Struggle Throughout the Ages  , and  Broken Blossoms  .
