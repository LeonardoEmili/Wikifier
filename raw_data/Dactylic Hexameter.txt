Dactylic hexameter is a form of  |meter|Meter|  or rhythmic scheme in poetry. It is traditionally associated with the quantitative meter of classical  |epic_poetry|Epic_Poetry|  in both  |Greek|Greek_Language|  and  |Latin|Latin|  and was consequently considered to be the grand style of Western classical poetry. Some premier examples of its use are  |Homers|Homer|   Iliad  and  Odyssey ,  |Virgils|Virgil|   Aeneid , and  |Ovids|Ovid|   Metamorphoses . Hexameters also form part of  |elegiac|Elegiac|  poetry in both languages, alternating with  |dactylic_pentameters|Dactylic_Pentameter| .       A dactylic hexameter has six   |feet|Foot| . In strict dactylic hexameter, each foot would be a  |dactyl|Dactyl|  , but classical meter allows for the substitution of a  |spondee|Spondee|  in place of a dactyl in most positions. Specifically, the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely. The fifth foot is usually a dactyl .     The sixth foot can be filled by either a  |trochee|Trochee|  or a spondee. Thus the dactylic line most normally is  |scanned|Scansion|  as follows:   :–⏕   –⏕   –⏕   –⏕   –⏑⏑   –X          Hexameters also have a primary  |caesura|Caesura|   a break between words, sometimes coinciding with a break in sense  at one of several normal positions: After the first syllable of the second foot; after the first syllable in the third foot ; after the second syllable in the third foot if the third foot is a dactyl ; after the first syllable of the fourth foot .     Hexameters are frequently  |enjambed|Enjambment| —the meaning runs over from one line to the next, without terminal punctuation—which helps to create the long, flowing narrative of epic. They are generally considered the most grandiose and formal meter.     An English-language example of the dactylic hexameter, in quantitative meter:     : Down in a   deep dark   dell sat an   old cow   munching a   beanstalk     The preceding line follows the rules of Greek and Latin prosody. Syllables containing long vowels, diphthongs and short vowels followed by two or more consonants count as long; all other syllables count as short. Such values may not correspond with the rhythms of ordinary spoken English.         The hexameter was first used by early Greek poets of the oral tradition, and the most complete extant examples of their works are the  Iliad  and the  Odyssey , which influenced the authors of all later classical epics that survive today. Early epic poetry was also accompanied by music, and  |pitch_changes|Pitch_Accent|  associated with the accented Greek must have highlighted the melody, though the exact mechanism is still a topic of discussion.

The Homeric poems arrange words so as to create an interplay between the metrical ictus—the first syllable of each foot—and the natural, spoken accent of words. If the ictus and accent coincide too frequently the hexameter becomes sing-songy . Thus in general, word breaks occur in the middle of metrical feet, while ictus and accent coincide more often near the end of the line.   The first line of Homer’s Iliad— Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilles —provides an example:     :     Dividing the line into metrical units:     :  dactyl, dactyl, spondee, dactyl, dactyl, spondee.     Note how the word endings do not coincide with the end of a metrical foot; for the early part of the line this forces the accent of each word to lie in the middle of a foot, playing against the ictus.     This line also includes a masculine caesura after , a break that separates the line into two parts. Homer employs a feminine caesura more commonly than later writers: an example occurs in Iliad I.5 ...and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment :     :   :   :     Homer’s hexameters contain a higher proportion of dactyls than later hexameter poetry. They are also characterised by a laxer following of verse principles than later epicists almost invariably adhered to. For example, Homer allows spondaic fifth feet , whereas many later authors never do.     Homer also altered the forms of words to allow them to fit the hexameter, typically by using a  |dialectal|Ancient_Greek_Dialects|  form: ptolis is an epic form used instead of the Attic polis as necessary for the meter. Proper names sometimes take forms to fit the meter, for example Pouludamas instead of the metrically unviable Poludamas.     Note also that some lines require a knowledge of the digamma for their scansion, e.g. Iliad I.108 you have not yet spoken a good word nor brought one to pass :     :     Here the word  was originally  in Ionian; the digamma, later lost, lengthened the last syllable of the preceding  and removed the apparent defect in the meter. A digamma also saved the hiatus in the third foot. This example demonstrates the oral tradition of the Homeric epics that flourished before they were written down sometime in the 7th century BC.     In spite of the occasional exceptions in early epic, most of the later rules of hexameter composition have their origins in the methods and practices of Homer.            The hexameter came into Latin as an adaptation from Greek long after the practice of singing the epics had faded. Consequentially, the properties of the meter were learned as specific rules rather than as a natural result of musical expression. Also, because the Latin language generally has a higher proportion of long syllables than Greek, it is by nature more spondaic. Thus the Latin hexameter took on characteristics of its own.     The earliest example of hexameter in Latin poetry is the Annales of  |Ennius|Ennius| , which established it as the standard for later Latin epics. Later Republican writers, such as  |Lucretius|Lucretius| ,  |Catullus|Catullus|  and even  |Cicero|Cicero| , wrote hexameter compositions, and it was at this time that many of the principles of Latin hexameter were firmly established, and followed by later writers such as  |Virgil|Virgil| ,  |Ovid|Ovid| ,  |Lucan|Marcus_Annaeus_Lucanus| , and  |Juvenal|Satires_Of_Juvenal| .  |Virgils|Virgil|  opening line for the  Aeneid  is a classic example::     :   : I sing of arms and the man, who first from the shores of Troy...     As in Greek, lines were arranged so that the metrically long syllables—those occurring at the beginning of a foot—often avoided the natural stress of a word. In the earlier feet of a line, meter and stress were expected to clash, while in the later feet they were expected to resolve and coincide—an effect that gives each line a natural dum-ditty-dum-dum rhythm to close. Such an arrangement is a balance between an exaggerated emphasis on the metre—which would cause the verse to be sing-songy—and the need to provide some repeated rhythmic guide for skilled recitation.     In the following example of Enniuss early Latin hexameter composition, metrical weight  falls on the first and last syllables of ; the ictus is therefore opposed to the natural stress on the second syllable when the word is pronounced. Similarly, the second syllable of the words  and  carry the metrical ictus even though the first is naturally stressed in typical pronunciation. In the closing feet of the line, the natural stress that falls on the third syllable of  and the second syllable of  coincide with the metrical ictus and produce the characteristic shave and a haircut ending:     :    : they were disputing whether they should call the city Roma or Remora.     Like their Greek predecessors, classical Latin poets avoided a large number of word breaks at the ends of foot divisions except between the fourth and fifth, where it was encouraged. In order to preserve the rhythmic close, Latin poets avoided the placement of a single syllable or four-syllable word at the end of a line. The caesura is also handled far more strictly, with Homers feminine caesura becoming exceedingly rare, and the second-foot caesura always paired with one in the fourth.     One example of the evolution of the Latin verse form can be seen in a comparative analysis of the use of spondees in Ennius time vs. the Augustan age. The repeated use of the heavily spondaic line came to be frowned upon, as well as the use of a high proportion of spondees in both of the first two feet. The following lines of Ennius would not have been felt admissible by later authors since they both contain repeated spondees at the beginning of consecutive lines:     :   :    : with these words: o daughter, tribulations must first be borne by you;   :later your fortune will rise again from the river.     However, it is from Virgil that the following famous, heavily spondaic line comes:     :    : a huge, shapeless, horrendous monster, whose light had been removed         By the age of Augustus, poets like Virgil closely followed the rules of the meter and approached it in a highly rhetorical way, looking for effects that can be exploited in skilled recitation. For example, the following line from the Aeneid describes the movement of rushing horses and how a hoof shakes the crumbling field with a galloping sound :   :     This line is made up of five dactyls and a closing spondee, an unusual rhythmic arrangement that imitates the described action. A similar effect is found in VIII.452, where Virgil describes how the blacksmith sons of Vulcan lift their arms with great strength one to another in forging Aeneas shield:   :     The line consists of all spondees except for the usual dactyl in the fifth foot, and is meant to mimic the pounding sound of the work. A third example that mixes the two effects comes from I.42, where Juno pouts that Athena was allowed to use Joves thunderbolts to destroy Ajax :     :     This line is nearly all dactyls except for the spondee at -lata e. This change in rhythm paired with the harsh elision is intended to emphasize the crash of Athenas thunderbolt.     Virgil will occasionally deviate from the strict rules of the meter to produce a special effect. One example from I.105 describing a ship at sea during a storm has Virgil violating metrical standards to place a single-syllable word at the end of the line:   :   :     The boat gives its side to the waves; there comes next in a heap a steep mountain of water. By placing the monosyllable mons at the end of the line, Virgil interrupts the usual shave and a haircut pattern to produce a jarring rhythm, an effect that echoes the crash of a large wave against the side of a ship. The Roman poet  |Horace|Horace|  uses a similar trick to highlight the comedic irony that Mountains will be in labor, and bring forth a ridiculous mouse in this famous line from his  Ars Poetica  :   :     Another amusing example that comments on the importance of these verse rules comes later in the same poem :   :     This line, which lacks a proper caesura, is translated Not every critic sees an inharmonious verse.         The verse innovations of the Augustan writers were carefully imitated by their successors in the Silver Age of  |Latin_literature|Latin_Literature| . The verse form itself then was little changed, as the quality of a poets hexameter was judged against the standard set by Virgil and the other Augustan poets, a respect for literary precedent encompassed by the Latin word . E.g., the younger Pliny, in referring to an orator who prided himself on not attempting to rival Cicero, replied,  –Letters I.5.12–3 Deviations were generally regarded as idiosyncrasies or hallmarks of personal style, and were not imitated by later poets.  |Juvenal|Juvenal| , for example, was fond of occasionally creating verses that placed a sense break between the fourth and fifth foot , but this technique—known as the bucolic diaeresis—did not catch on with other poets.     In the late empire, writers experimented again by adding unusual restrictions to the standard hexameter. The rhopalic verse of  |Ausonius|Ausonius|  is a good example; besides following the standard hexameter pattern, each word in the line is one syllable longer than the previous, e.g.:     :   :   :     Also notable is the tendency among late grammarians to thoroughly dissect the hexameters of Virgil and earlier poets. A treatise on poetry by  |Diomedes_Grammaticus|Diomedes_Grammaticus|  is a good example, as this work categorizes dactylic hexameter verses in ways that were later interpreted under the  |golden_line|Golden_Line|  rubric. Independently, these two trends show the form becoming highly artificial—more like a puzzle to solve than a medium for personal poetic expression.     By the Middle Ages, some writers adopted more relaxed versions of the meter.  |Bernard_of_Cluny|Bernard_Of_Cluny| , for example, employs it in his De Contemptu Mundi, but ignores classical conventions in favor of accentual effects and predictable rhyme both within and between verses, e.g.:     :   ::     Not all medieval writers are so at odds with the Virgilian standard, and with the rediscovery of classical literature, later Medieval and Renaissance writers are far more orthodox, but by then the form had become an academic exercise.  |Petrarch|Petrarch| , for example, devoted much time to his  Africa , a dactylic hexameter epic on  |Scipio_Africanus|Scipio_Africanus| , but this work was unappreciated in his time and remains little read today. In contrast,  |Dante|Dante|  decided to write his epic, the  Divine Comedy  in Italian—a choice that defied the traditional epic choice of Latin dactylic hexameters—and produced a masterpiece beloved both then and now.      With the  |New_Latin|New_Latin|  period, the language itself came to be regarded as a medium only for serious and learned expression, a view that left little room for Latin poetry. The emergence of  |Recent_Latin|Recent_Latin|  in the 20th century restored classical orthodoxy among Latinists and sparked a general interest in the beauty of Latin poetry. Today, the modern Latin poets who use the dactylic hexameter are generally as faithful to Virgil as Romes Silver Age poets.         Many poets have attempted to write dactylic hexameters in English, though few works composed in the meter have stood the test of time. Most such works are accentual rather than quantitative. Perhaps the most famous is  |Longfellows|Longfellow| |_Evangeline|Evangeline|  , whose first line is as follows:     : This is the   forest pri   meval. The   murmuring   pines and the   hemlocks     Poets who have written quantitative hexameters in English include  |Robert_Bridges|Robert_Bridges| .       Dactylic hexameter has proved more successful in German than in most modern languages.  |Friedrich_Gottlieb_Klopstocks|Friedrich_Gottlieb_Klopstock|  epic  Der Messias  popularized accentual dactylic hexameter in  |German|German_Language| . Subsequent German poets to employ the form include  |Goethe|Goethe|   and  |Schiller|Schiller| .      The Seasons   by  |Kristijonas_Donelaitis|Kristijonas_Donelaitis|  is a famous  |Lithuanian|Lithuanian_Language|  poem in quantitative dactylic hexameters. Because of the nature of Lithuanian, more than half of the lines of the poem are entirely spondaic save for the mandatory dactyl in the fifth foot.      |Jean_Antoine_de_Baïf|Jean_Antoine_De_Baïf|  elaborated a system which used original graphemes for regulating French versification by  |quantity|Syllable_Weight|  on the Greco-Roman model, a system which came to be known as  vers mesurés , or vers mesurés à lantique, which the French language of the Renaissance permitted.
