         Hugh Binning was a  |Scottish|Scotland| |_philosopher|Philosopher|  and  |theologian|Theology| . Binning was born in Scotland during the reign of  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England| , ordained in the   |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland|  and died during the time of  |Oliver_Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell|  and the  |Commonwealth_of_England|Commonwealth_Of_England| .     Binning was born in 1627, the son of John Binning of Dalvennan, Straiton. A precocious child, Binning at the age of 13 was admitted to the study of philosophy at the  |University_of_Glasgow|University_Of_Glasgow| . By the age of 19, he was appointed regent and professor of philosophy at the University of Glasgow . Binning has been described as an extraordinary instance of precocious learning and genius. At the early age of nineteen, he succeeded as Regent of Philosophy the celebrated  |James_Dalrymple|James_Dalrymple_1St_Viscount_Of_Stair| , who was afterward President of the Court of Session, and Viscount Stair. He was called 25 October 1649. As minister of Govan, he was the successor of Mr. William Wilkie. His ordination took place on the 8th of January 1649, when  |Mr_David_Dickson|David_Dickson| , one of the theological professors at the College of Glasgow, and author of Therapeutica Sacra, presided. He was ordained in January, at the age of 22, holding his regency till 14 May that year.  At that time Govan was a separate town rather than part of Glasgow.     He joined the Protesters in 1651. When  |Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell|  came to Glasgow in 1651, a discussion on some of the controverted points of the times was held in his presence, between his chaplains, the learned  |Dr_John_Owen|John_Owen| , Joseph Caryl, and others on the one side, and some Scots ministers on the other. Mr. Binning, who was one of the disputants, nonplussed, it is said, the Independents, which led Cromwell to ask, who was that learned and bold young man? His name, he was told, was Binning. He hath bound well, indeed, said he, but, laying his hand on his sword, this will loose all again. The late Mr. Orme was of opinion that there is nothing improbable in the account of the meeting, but that such a meeting took place is certain. This appears from two letters which were written by  |Principal_Baillie|Robert_Baillie| , who was at that time Professor of Theology at the University of Glasgow.     He died of  |consumption|Consumption|  at the age of 26 on September 1653. He was remarkably popular as a preacher, having been considered the most accomplished philosopher and divine in his time, and styled the Scottish  |Cicero|Cicero| . He married , Mary and had a son,John of Dalvennan. She was the daughter of Richard Simson, minister of Sprouston. After Binnings early death Mary married her second husband, James Gordon, minister of Comber, in Ireland. A marble tablet, with an inscription in classical Latin, was erected to his memory by his friend  |Mr_Patrick_Gillespie|Patrick_Gillespie| , who was then Principal of the University of Glasgow. It has been placed in the vestibule of the present parish church. The whole of his works are posthumous publications.     He was a follower of  |James_Dalrymple|James_Dalrymple_1St_Viscount_Of_Stair| . In later life, he was well known as an  |evangelical_Christian|Evangelical_Christian| .  |Andrew_Pyle|Andrew_Pyle|  , Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers , article pp. 90-95.       Hugh Binning was born two years after  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England|  became monarch of England, Ireland, and Scotland. At the time, each was an independent country sharing the same monarch. The  |Acts_of_Union_1707|Acts_Of_Union_1707|  integrated Scotland and England to form the  |Kingdom_of_Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain| , and the  |Acts_of_Union_1800|Acts_Of_Union_1800|  integrated Ireland to form the  |United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland| .     The period was dominated by both political and religious strife between the three independent countries. Religious disputes centered on questions such as whether religion was to be dictated by the monarch or was to be the choice of the people, and whether individuals had a direct relationship with God or needed to use an intermediary. Civil disputes centered on debates about the extent of the Kings power , and specifically whether the King had the right to raise taxes and armed forces without the  |Consent_of_the_governed|Consent_Of_The_Governed| . These wars ultimately changed the relationship between king and subjects.     In 1638, the  |General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland|General_Assembly_Of_The_Church_Of_Scotland|  voted to remove bishops and the  |Book_of_Common_Prayer|Book_Of_Common_Prayer|  that had been introduced by Charles I to impose the Anglican model on the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Public riots followed, culminating in the  |Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms|Wars_Of_The_Three_Kingdoms| , an interrelated series of conflicts that took place in the three countries. The first conflict, which was also the first of the  |Bishops_Wars|Bishops_Wars| , took place in 1639 and was a single border skirmish between England and Scotland, also known as the war the armys did not wanted to fight.     To maintain his English power base, Charles I made secret alliances with Catholic Ireland and Presbyterian Scotland to invade Anglican England, promising that each country could establish their own separate state religion. Once these secret entreaties became known to the English  |Long_Parliament|Long_Parliament| , the  |Congregationalist_faction|Independent|   took matters into its own hands and Parliament established an army separate from the King. Charles I was executed in January 1649, which led to the rule of  |Cromwell|Cromwell|  and the establishment of the  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_England| . The conflicts concluded with  |The_English_Restoration|The_English_Restoration|  of the monarchy and the return of  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  in 1660.     The  |Act_of_Classes|Act_Of_Classes|  was passed by the Parliament of Scotland on 23 January 1649; the act banned  |Royalists|Royalists|  from holding political or military office. In exile, Charles II signed the  |Treaty_of_Breda_|Treaty_Of_Breda|  with the Scottish Parliament; among other things, the treaty established Presbyterianism as the national religion. Charles was crowned King of Scots at  |Scone|Scone_Scotland|  in January 1651. By September 1651, Scotland was annexed by England, its legislative institutions abolished, Presbyterianism dis-established, and Charles was forced into exile in France.     The Scottish Parliament rescinded the Act of Classes in 1651, which produced a split within Scottish Society. The sides of the conflict were called the Resolutioners  and the Protesters ; Binning sided with the Protestors.          When Cromwell had sent troops to Scotland, he was also attempting to dis-establish  |Presbyterian|Presbyterian| ism and the  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland| , Binning spoke against Cromwells act. On Saturday 19 April 1651, Cromwell entered Glasgow and the next day he heard a sermon by three ministers who condemned Cromwell for invading Scotland. That evening, Cromwell summoned those ministers and others, to a debate on the issue. At the debate, Rev Hugh Binning is said to have out-debated Cromwells ministers so completely that he silenced Cromwells ministers.          Hugh Binnings political views were based on his theology. Binning was a  |Covenanter|Covenanter| , a movement that began in Scotland at  |Greyfriars_Kirkyard|Greyfriars_Kirkyard|  in 1638 with the National Covenant and continued with the 1643  |Solemn_League_and_Covenant|Solemn_League_And_Covenant|  – in effect a treaty between the English  |Long_Parliament|Long_Parliament|  and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in exchange for troops to confront the threat of Irish Catholic troops joining the  |Royalist|Royalist|  army. Binning could also be described as a Protestor; both political positions were taken because of their religious implications. However, he saw the evils of the politics of his day was not a “fomenter of factions” writing “A Treatise of Christian Love” as a response.        Because of the turmoil time in which Hugh Binning lived, politics and religion were inexorably intertwined. Binning was a  |Calvinist|Calvinist|  and follower of  |John_Knox|John_Knox| . As a profession, Binning was trained as a Philosopher, and he believed that  |philosophy|Philosophy|  was the servant of  |theology|Theology| . He thought that both Philosophy and Theology should be taught in parallel. Binnings writing, which is primarily a collection of his sermons, “forms an important bridge between the 17th century, when philosophy in Scotland was heavily dominated by Calvinism, and the 18th century when figures such as  |Francis_Hutcheson|Francis_Hutcheson|  re-asserted a greater degree of independence between the two and allied philosophy with the developing human sciences.”            Religiously, Hugh Binning was, what we would call today, an  |Evangelical|Evangelical| |_Calvinist|Calvinist| . He spoke on the primacy of Gods love as the ground of salvation:   :… our salvation is not the business of Christ alone, but the whole Godhead is interested in it deeply, so deeply that you cannot say who loves it most, or who likes it most. The Father is the very fountain of it, his love is the spring of all.      With regards to the extent of the ‘atonement’, Hugh Binning, did not hold that the offer of redemption applied only to the few that are  |elect|Unconditional_Election|  but said that “the ultimate ground of faith is in the electing will of God.” In Scotland, during the 1600s, the questions concerning atonement revolved around the terms in which the offer was expressed.     Binning believed that forgiveness is based on Christs death, understood as a satisfaction and as a sacrifice: If he had pardoned sin without any satisfaction what rich grace it had   been! But truly, to provide the Lamb and sacrifice himself, to find out   the ransom, and to exact it of his own Son, in our name, is a testimony   of mercy and grace far beyond that. But then, his justice is very conspicuous   in this work.           All of the works of Hugh Binning were published posthumously and were primarily collections of his sermons. Of his speaking style, it was said: There is originality without any affectation, a rich imagination, without anything fanciful or extravert, the utmost simplicity, without an thing mean or trifling.        The Common Principles of the Christian Religion, Clearly Proved, and Singularly Improved; or, A Practical Catechism published by  |Patrick_Gillespie|Patrick_Gillespie|  in 1660    An analysis of the  |Westminster_Confession_of_Faith|Westminster_Confession_Of_Faith| . The work was translated into Dutch in 1678 by James Koelman, a minister of Sluys in Flanders.      Quotations from the publication include:   ::On the love of God   :::And what is love but the very motion of the soul to God? And so till it have attained that, to be in him, it can find no place of rest.      ::On the free grace of the Gospel   :::I am guilty, and can say nothing against it, while I stand alone. But though I cannot satisfy, and have not; yet there is one, Jesus Christ, who gave his life a ransom for many, and whom God hath given as a propitiation for sins. He hath satisfied and paid the debt in my name; go and apprehend the cautioner, since he hath undertaken it, nay, he hath done it, and is absolved. Kindle Locations 2597-2600   ::On Learning   :::Be not ignorant as beasts, that know no other things than to follow the drove; quæ pergunt, non quo eundum est, sed quo itur; they follow not whither they ought to go, but whither most go. You are men, and have reasonable souls within you; therefore I beseech you, be not composed and fashioned according to custom and example, that is, brutish, but according to some inward knowledge and reason. Retire once from the multitude, and ask in earnest at God, What is the way? Him that fears him he will teach the way that he should choose. The way to his blessed end is very strait, very difficult; you must have a guide in it,—you must have a lamp and a light in it,—else you cannot but go wrong.

The first of the sermons was preached July 1650   Learnedly and Accurately Discussed and Resolved, Concerning Associations and Confederacies with Idolaters, Infidels, Heretics, Malignants or any other Known Enemies of Truth and Godliness.  The treatise was used by the  |Covenanters|Covenanters|  and seems to have been originally published in Holland in 1693. There is a reference to the treatise at a general meeting of Society people ... at Edinburgh 28 May 1683. The treatise expressed the opinion that Scotland should not support Charles I without some restraint placed on relatively absolute royal power and without assurance the Presbyterian religion could be maintained.      The documents seems to have been presented to the Society either by Hugh Binnings son, John, or his widow, Barbara Gordon . In the treatise Binning writes:   ::Where God hath given us liberty by the law of nature, or his word, no king can justly tie us, and when God binds and obliges us by any of these, no king or parliament can loose or untie us. Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 15527-15528   A Treatise of Christian Love a sermon based on John 13:35, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” and 1 Corinthians 13. Binning explores the concept that as a believer in Christ, there is a need for Christians to show by their love for one another.       Binning argues:   ::But Christ’s last words persuade this, that unity in affection is more essential and fundamental. This is the badge he left to his disciples. If we cast away this upon every different apprehension of mind, we disown our Master, and disclaim his token and badge. Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 16396-16398   ::On Charity   :::Charity “thinketh no evil.” Charity is apt to take all things in the best sense. If a thing may be subject to diverse acceptations, it can put the best construction on it. It is so benign and good in its own nature that it is not inclinable to suspect others. It desires to condemn no man, but would gladly, as far as reason and conscience will permit, absolve every man. It is so far from desire of revenge, that it is not provoked or troubled with an injury. For that were nothing else but to wrong itself because others have wronged it already, and it is so far from wronging others, that it will not willingly so much as think evil of them. Yet if need requires, charity can execute justice, and inflict chastisement, not out of desire of another’s misery, but out of love and compassion to mankind. Charitas non punit quia peccatum est, sed ne peccaretur, it looks more to prevention of future sin, than to revenge of a bypast fault, and can do all without any discomposure of spirit, as a physician cuts a vein without anger. Quis enim cut medetur irascitur? “Who is angry at his own patient?” Kindle Locations 16505-16513     In 1735, the collections of Binnings works were published posthumously, originally edited by Rev. M. Leishman, D.D., a minister who was a later successor to Hugh in the parish of Govan, which contained sermons not previously published. There have been several editions of the Complete Works of the Rev. Hugh Binning , one of the latest was published by Forgotten Books in 2012          Hugh Binning was the son of John Binning and Margaret MKell. Margaret was the daughter of Rev. Matthew MKell, Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 20469-20474   Matthew M’Kell, was a minister in the parish of  |Bothwell|Bothwell| , near Glasgow. “After having been, on different occasions brought before the Privy council, and imprisoned, he was, on the 8th of January, 1674, upon his refusing to engage not to preach, ordered to confine himself to the parish of  |Carluke|Carluke| , and security was required from him that he would appear before the Council at their summons…. He died at Edinburgh, in March 1681”.   who was a minister in the parish of Bothwell, Scotland, and sister of Hugh MKell, a minister in Edinburgh.   Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 20476-20478   Some authors suggest that Matthew MKell was either the grandfather or uncle to Hugh MKail , which would make Hugh MKail a brother-in-law to Hugh Binning. The spelling of names was not as precise in those days, e.g. when describing Hugh Binning in the same document, there are variations of the spelling of the Binning name.   Hugh M’Kell was arrested for being concerned in the insurrection at  |Pentland_Rising|Pentland_Rising| . Hugh MKeil was imprisoned and tortured . In the end, MKell was executed in Edinburgh on 22 December 1666 because he would not sign the  |Test_Act|Test_Act|  – because his preaching would not conform to the Anglican tradition. The address of young M’Kail on the scaffold concluded with these sublime expressions—“Farewell, father and mother, friends and relations. Farewell the world, and all delights. Farewell meat and drink. Farewell sun, moon and stars. Welcome God and Father! Welcome sweet Lord Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant! Welcome blessed Spirit of grace, and God of all consolation! Welcome glory! Welcome eternal life! Welcome death!”   We are told by Kirkton that “when Mr. M’Kail died, there was such a lamentation as was never known in Scotland before, not one dry cheek upon all the street or in all the numberless windows in the market place”   It was discovered afterwards, that  |Alexander_Burnet|Alexander_Burnet| , then the archbishop of Glasgow, had in his possession at the time, a letter from the king, forbidding any more blood to be shed. But to the disgrace of his sacred profession, and of his feelings as a man, “Burnet let the execution go on, before he produced his letter, pretending there was no council day between”             Hugh Binning was born on the estate of his father in Dalvennan,  |Straiton|Straiton| , in the  |shire_of_Ayr|Ayrshire| . The family owned other lands in the parishes of  |Straiton|Straiton|  and  |Colmonell|Colmonell|  as well as  |Maybole|Maybole|  in  |Carrick|Carrick_Scotland| .            In 1645,  |James_Dalrymple_1st_Viscount_of_Stair|James_Dalrymple_1St_Viscount_Of_Stair| , who was Hughs master in the study of philosophy, announced he was retiring from the University of Glasgow. After a national search for a replacement on the faculty, three men were selected to compete for the position. Hugh was one of those selected, but was at a disadvantage because of his extreme youth and because he was not of noble birth. However, he had strong support from the existing faculty, who suggested that the candidates speak extemporaneously on any topic of the candidates choice. After hearing Hugh speak, the other candidates withdrew, making Hugh a regent and professor of philosophy, while he was still 18 years old. Scottish Worthies p 203      On 7 February 1648, Hugh was appointed an Advocate before the Court of Sessions . In the same year, he married Barbara Simpson , daughter of Rev. James Simpson a minister in Ireland. Their son, John, was born in 1650.     Hugh died around September 1653 and was buried in the churchyard of Govan, where  |Patrick_Gillespie|Patrick_Gillespie| , then principal of the University of Glasgow, ordered a monument inscribed in Latin, roughly translated:   :Here lies Mr. Hugh Binning, a man distinguished for his piety and eloquence, learned in philology, philosophy, and theology, a Prelate, faithful to the Gospel, and finally an excellent preacher. In the middle of a series of events, he was taken at the age of 26, in the year of our Lord 1653. Alive, he changed the society of his own land because he walked with God. And if you wish to make other inquires, the rest should keep silence, since neither you nor the marble can comprehend it. Binning, Hugh . The Works of the Rev. Hugh Binning . Kindle Edition.     Hughs widow, Barbara , then remarried James Gordon, an Anglican priest at Cumber in Ireland. Together they had a daughter, Jean who married Daniel MacKenzie, who was on the winning side of the  |Battle_of_Bothwell_Bridge|Battle_Of_Bothwell_Bridge|  serving as an ensign under Lieutenant-Colonel William Ramsay , in the Earl of Mars Regiment of Foot.     Hughs son, John Binning, married Hanna Keir, who was born in Ireland. The Binnings were  |Covenanters|Covenanters| , a resistance movement that objected to the return of Charles II . They were on the losing side in the 1679  |Battle_of_Bothwell_Bridge|Battle_Of_Bothwell_Bridge| . Most of the rebels who were not executed were exiled to the Americas; about 30 Covenanters were exiled to the Carolinas on the Carolina Merchant in 1684. After the battle, John and Hanna were separated.            In the aftermath of the battle at Bothwell Bridge, Hughs widow tried to reclaim the family estate at Dalvennan by saying that John and his wife owed his stepfather a considerable some of money. The legal action was successful and Dalvennan became the possession of Johns half-sister Jean, and her husband Daniel MacKenzie. In addition, Jean came into possession Hanna Keirs property in Ireland.     By 1683, Jean was widowed. John Binning was branded a traitor, was sentenced to death and forfeited his property to the Crown. Johns wife was branded as a traitor and forfeited her property in Ireland. In 1685, Jean donated the Binning familys home at Dalvennan and other properties, along with the Keir properties to Roderick MacKenzie, who was a Scottish advocate of  |James_II_|James_Ii_Of_England| , and the  |baillie|Baillie|  of  |Carrick|Carrick_Scotland| . According to an act of the Scottish Parliament, Roderick MacKenzie was also very effective in “suppressing the rebellious, fanatical party in the western and other shires of this realm, and putting the laws to vigorous execution against them”          Since Bothwell Bridge, Hanna had been hiding from the authorities. In 1685, Hanna was in Edinburgh where she was found during a sweep for subversives and imprisoned in the  |Tolbooth|Tolbooth|  of Edinburgh, a combination city hall and prison. Those arrested with Hanna were exiled to North America, however, she developed  |Dysentery|Dysentery|  and remained behind. By 1687, near death, Hanna petitioned the  |Privy_Council_of_Scotland|Privy_Council_Of_Scotland|  for her release; she was exiled to her family in Ireland, where she died around 1692.     In 1690, the Scottish Parliament rescinded Johns fines and forfeiture, but he was not able to recover his familys estates, the courts suggesting that John had relinquished his claim to Dalvennan in exchange for forgiveness of debt, rather than forfeiture.          There is little documentation about John after his wifes death. John received a small income from royalties on his father Hughs works after parliament extended copyrights on Hughs writings to him. However, the income was not significant and John made several petitions to the Scottish parliament for money, the last occurring in 1717. It is thought that John died in  |Somerset|Somerset|  county, in southwestern England.
