      Anastasius , known in English as Anastasios II or Anastasius II , was the  |Byzantine_Emperor|Byzantine_Emperor|  from 713 to 715.       Anastasios was originally named Artemius and had served as a bureaucrat and Imperial secretary  for his predecessors. After the  |Opsician|Opsician|  army in  |Thrace|Thrace|  had overthrown Emperor  |Philippikos_Bardanes|Philippikos_Bardanes|  , they acclaimed Artemius as Emperor. He chose Anastasius as his  |regnal_name|Regnal_Name| . Soon after his accession, Anastasius II imposed discipline on the army and executed those officers who had been directly involved in the conspiracy against Philippikos.     Anastasios upheld the decisions of the  |Sixth_Ecumenical_Council|Sixth_Ecumenical_Council|  and deposed the  |Monothelete|Monothelitism| |_Patriarch_John_VI_of_Constantinople|Patriarch_John_Vi_Of_Constantinople| , replacing him with the orthodox  |Patriarch_Germanus|Patriarch_Germanos_I_Of_Constantinople|  in 715. This also put an end to the short-lived local schism with the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| .     The advancing  |Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad_Caliphate|  surrounded the Empire by land and sea , and Anastasios attempted to restore peace by diplomatic means. His emissaries having failed in  |Damascus|Damascus| , he undertook the restoration of  |Constantinoples|Constantinople| |_walls|Walls_Of_Constantinople|  and the rebuilding of the Roman fleet. However, the death of the  |Caliph|Caliph| |_al_Walid_I|Al_Walid_I|  in 715 gave Anastasius an opportunity to turn the tables on his rival. He dispatched an army under  |Leo_the_Isaurian|Leo_Iii_The_Isaurian| , afterwards emperor, to invade  |Syria|Bilad_Al_Sham| , and he had his fleet concentrate on  |Rhodes|Rhodes|  with orders not only to resist the approach of the enemy but to destroy their naval stores.     These troops of the Opsician  theme , resenting the Emperors strict measures, mutinied, slew the admiral John, and proclaimed as emperor  |Theodosius_III|Theodosius_Iii|  , a tax-collector of low extraction. After a six-month siege, Constantinople was taken by Theodosius; Anastasios, who had fled to  |Nicaea|IÌ‡Znik| , was eventually compelled to submit to the new emperor in 716 and retired to a  |monastery|Monastery|  in  |Thessalonica|Thessaloniki| .      In 719, Anastasios headed a revolt against Leo III, who had succeeded Theodosius, receiving considerable support, including auxiliaries reportedly provided by  |Tervel_of_Bulgaria|Tervel_Of_Bulgaria| . However the chronicler  |Theophanes_the_Confessor|Theophanes_The_Confessor| , who offers this information elsewhere, confuses Tervel with his eventual successor  |Kormesiy|Kormesiy_Of_Bulgaria| , so perhaps Anastasios was allied with the younger ruler. In any case, the rebel forces advanced on Constantinople. The enterprise failed, and Anastasios fell into Leos hands and was put to death by his orders.
