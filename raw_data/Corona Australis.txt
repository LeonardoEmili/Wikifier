     Corona Australis is a  |constellation|Constellation|  in the  |Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere|Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere| . Its Latin name means southern crown , and it is the southern counterpart of  |Corona_Borealis|Corona_Borealis| , the northern crown. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| , and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with  |Sagittarius|Sagittarius|  or  |Centaurus|Centaurus| . Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a  |rock_hyrax|Rock_Hyrax| .     Although fainter than its northern counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive.  |Alpha|Alpha_Coronae_Australis|  and  |Beta_Coronae_Australis|Beta_Coronae_Australis|  are the two brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1.  |Epsilon_Coronae_Australis|Epsilon_Coronae_Australis|  is the brightest example of a  |W_Ursae_Majoris_variable|W_Ursae_Majoris_Variable|  in the southern sky. Lying alongside the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| , Corona Australis contains one of the closest  |star-forming_regions|Star_Formation|  to the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| —a dusty  |dark_nebula|Dark_Nebula|  known as the  |Corona_Australis_Molecular_Cloud|Corona_Australis_Molecular_Cloud| , lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars  |R|R_Coronae_Australis|  and  |TY_Coronae_Australis|Ty_Coronae_Australis|  light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.         The name of the constellation was entered as Corona Australis when the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  established the 88 modern constellations in 1922.     In 1932, the name was instead recorded as Corona Austrina when the IAUs commission on notation approved a list of four-letter abbreviations for the constellations.    The four-letter abbreviations were repealed in 1955.  The IAU presently uses Corona Australis exclusively.         Corona Australis is a small constellation bordered by  |Sagittarius|Sagittarius|  to the north,  |Scorpius|Scorpius|  to the west,  |Telescopium|Telescopium|  to the south, and  |Ara|Ara|  to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is CrA. The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments . In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between −36.77° and −45.52°. Covering 128 square degrees, Corona Australis  |culminates|Culmination|  at midnight around the 30th of June and ranks 80th in area. Only visible at latitudes south of  |53°_north|53Rd_Parallel_North| , Corona Australis cannot be seen from the British Isles as it lies too far south, but it can be seen from southern Europe and readily from the southern United States.          While not a bright constellation, Corona Australis is nonetheless distinctive due to its easily identifiable pattern of stars, which has been described as horseshoe- or oval-shaped. Though it has no stars brighter than 4th magnitude, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye .  |Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille|Nicolas_Louis_De_Lacaille|  used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether.  |Mu_Coronae_Australis|Mu_Coronae_Australis| , a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III and apparent magnitude 5.21, was labelled by  |Johann_Elert_Bode|Johann_Elert_Bode|  and retained by  |Benjamin_Gould|Benjamin_Apthorp_Gould| , who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.          The only star in the constellation to have received a name is  |Alfecca_Meridiana_or_Alpha_CrA|Alpha_Coronae_Australis| . The name combines the  |Arabic|Arabic|  name of the constellation with the  |Latin|Latin|  for southern . In Arabic, Alfecca means break , and refers to the shape of both Corona Australis and Corona Borealis. Also called simply Meridiana , it is a white  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  star located 125 light years away from Earth, with an  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  of 4.10 and  |spectral_type|Stellar_Classification|  A2Va. A rapidly rotating star, it spins at almost 200  km per second at its equator, making a complete revolution in around 14 hours. Like the star  |Vega|Vega| , it has  |excess_infrared_radiation|Infrared_Excess| , which indicates it may be ringed by a disk of dust. It is currently a  |main-sequence_star|Main-Sequence_Star| , but will eventually  |evolve|Stellar_Evolution|  into a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf| ; currently, it has a luminosity 31 times greater, and a radius and mass of 2.3 times that of the Sun.  |Beta_Coronae_Australis|Beta_Coronae_Australis|  is an orange  |giant|Giant_Star|  474 light years from Earth. Its spectral type is K0II, and it is of apparent magnitude 4.11. Since its formation, it has evolved from a  |B-type_star|B-Type_Star|  to a  |K-type_star|K-Type_Star| . Its  |luminosity_class|Luminosity_Class|  places it as a  |bright_giant|Bright_Giant| ; its luminosity is 730 times that of the Sun, designating it one of the highest-luminosity K0-type stars visible to the naked eye. 100 million years old, it has a radius of 43  |solar_radii|Solar_Radius|   and a mass of between 4.5 and 5  |solar_mass|Solar_Mass| es . Alpha and Beta are so similar as to be indistinguishable in brightness to the naked eye.     Some of the more prominent double stars include  |Gamma_Coronae_Australis|Gamma_Coronae_Australis| —a pair of yellowish white stars 58 light years away from Earth, which orbit each other every 122 years. Widening since 1990, the two stars can be seen as separate with a 100  mm aperture telescope; they are separated by 1.3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees. They have a combined visual magnitude of 4.2; each component is an F8V  |dwarf_star|Dwarf_Star|  with a magnitude of 5.01.  |Epsilon_Coronae_Australis|Epsilon_Coronae_Australis|  is an  |eclipsing_binary|Binary_Stareclipsing_Binaries|  belonging to a class of stars known as  |W_Ursae_Majoris_variables|W_Ursae_Majoris_Variable| . These star systems are known as  |contact_binaries|Contact_Binary|  as the component stars are so close together they touch. Varying by a quarter of a magnitude around an average apparent magnitude of 4.83 every seven hours, the star system lies 98 light years away. Its spectral type is F4VFe-0.8+. At the southern end of the crown asterism are the stars  |Eta¹|Eta¹_Coronae_Australis|  and  |Eta²_Coronae_Australis|Eta²_Coronae_Australis| , which form an  |optical_double|Optical_Double| . Of magnitude 5.1 and 5.5, they are separable with the naked eye and are both white.  |Kappa_Coronae_Australis|Kappa_Coronae_Australis|  is an easily resolved optical double—the components are of apparent magnitudes 6.3 and 5.6 and are about 1000 and 150 light years away respectively. They appear at an angle of 359 degrees, separated by 21.6 arcseconds.  |Kappa²|Kappa2_Coronae_Australis|  is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white, with a spectral type of B9V, while  |Kappa¹|Kappa1_Coronae_Australis|  is of spectral type A0III. Lying 202 light years away,  |Lambda_Coronae_Australis|Lambda_Coronae_Australis|  is a double splittable in small telescopes. The primary is a white star of spectral type A2Vn and magnitude of 5.1, while the companion star has a magnitude of 9.7. The two components are separated by 29.2 arcseconds at an angle of 214 degrees.      |Zeta_Coronae_Australis|Zeta_Coronae_Australis|  is a rapidly rotating main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 light years from Earth. The star has blurred lines in its hydrogen spectrum due to its rotation. Its spectral type is B9V.  |Theta_Coronae_Australis|Theta_Coronae_Australis|  lies further to the west, a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and apparent magnitude 4.62. Corona Australis harbours  |RX_J1856.5-3754|Rx_J1856.5-3754| , an isolated  |neutron_star|Neutron_Star|  that is thought to lie 140 parsecs, or 460 light years, away, with a diameter of 14  km. It was once suspected to be a  |strange_star|Quark_Starstrange_Star| , but this has been discounted.              In the north of the constellation is the  |Corona_Australis_Molecular_Cloud|Corona_Australis_Molecular_Cloud| , a dark  |molecular_cloud|Molecular_Cloud|  with many embedded  |reflection_nebulae|Reflection_Nebula| , including  |NGC_6729|Ngc_6729| ,  |NGC_6726|Ngc_6726| –7, and  |IC_4812|Ic_4812| . A  |star-forming_region|Star_Formation|  of around , it contains  |Herbig–Haro_objects|Herbig–Haro_Object|   and some very young stars. About 430 light years away, it is one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by  |Johann_Friedrich_Julius_Schmidt|Johann_Friedrich_Julius_Schmidt|  in 1865. The  |Coronet_cluster|Coronet_Cluster| , about 554 light years away at the edge of the  |Gould_Belt|Gould_Belt| , is also used in studying star and  |protoplanetary_disk|Protoplanetary_Disk|  formation.       |R_Coronae_Australis|R_Coronae_Australis|  is an irregular variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a  |comet|Comet|  for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width.  |S_Coronae_Australis|S_Coronae_Australis|  is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a  |T_Tauri_star|T_Tauri_Star| . Nearby, another young variable star,  |TY_Coronae_Australis|Ty_Coronae_Australis| , illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and the brightness of the nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S,  |T|T_Coronae_Australis| , TY and  |VV_Coronae_Australis|Vv_Coronae_Australis| , are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the  |globular_cluster|Globular_Cluster|  known as  |NGC_6723|Ngc_6723| , which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.     Near Epsilon and Gamma Coronae Australis is  |Bernes_157|Bernes_157| , a  |dark_nebula|Dark_Nebula|  and star forming region. It is a large nebula, 55 by 18 arcminutes, that possesses several stars around magnitude 13. These stars have been dimmed by up to 8 magnitudes by its dust clouds.      |IC_1297|Ic_1297|  is a  |planetary_nebula|Planetary_Nebula|  of apparent magnitude 10.7, which appears as a green-hued roundish object in higher-powered amateur instruments. The nebula surrounds the variable star RU Coronae Australis, which has an average apparent magnitude of 12.9 and is a WC class  |Wolf–Rayet_star|Wolf–Rayet_Star| . IC 1297 is small, at only 7 arcseconds in diameter; it has been described as a square with rounded edges in the eyepiece, elongated in the north-south direction. Descriptions of its color encompass blue, blue-tinged green, and green-tinged blue.     Corona Australis location near the Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen.  |NGC_6768|Ngc_6768|  is a magnitude 11.2 object 35′ south of IC 1297. It is made up of two galaxies merging, one of which is an elongated  |elliptical_galaxy|Elliptical_Galaxy|  of classification E4 and the other a  |lenticular_galaxy|Lenticular_Galaxy|  of classification S0.  |IC_4808|Ic_4808|  is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of  |Beta_Sagittarii|Beta_Sagittarii| . However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.     Southeast of Theta and southwest of Eta lies the  |open_cluster|Open_Cluster| |ESO_281-SC24|Eso_281-Sc24| , which is composed of the yellow 9th magnitude star GSC 7914 178 1 and five 10th to 11th magnitude stars. Halfway between Theta Coronae Australis and  |Theta_Scorpii|Theta_Scorpii|  is the dense globular cluster  |NGC_6541|Ngc_6541| . Described as between magnitude 6.3 and magnitude 6.6, it is visible in binoculars and small telescopes. Around 22000 light years away, it is around 100 light years in diameter. It is estimated to be around 14 billion years old. NGC 6541 appears 13.1 arcminutes in diameter and is somewhat resolvable in large amateur instruments; a 12-inch telescope reveals approximately 100 stars but the core remains unresolved.         The  |Corona_Australids|Corona_Australids|  are a meteor shower that takes place between 14 and 18 March each year, peaking around 16 March. This meteor shower does not have a high peak hourly rate. In 1953 and 1956, observers noted a maximum of 6 meteors per hour and 4 meteors per hour respectively; in 1955 the shower was barely resolved . However, in 1992, astronomers detected a peak rate of 45 meteors per hour. The Corona Australids rate varies from year to year. At only six days, the showers duration is particularly short, and its  |meteoroids|Meteoroid|  are small; the stream is devoid of large meteoroids. The Corona Australids were first seen with the unaided eye in 1935 and first observed with  |radar|Radar|  in 1955. Corona Australid meteors have an entry velocity of 45 kilometers per second. In 2006, a shower originating near Beta Coronae Australis was designated as the Beta Coronae Australids. They appear in May, the same month as a nearby shower known as the May Microscopids, but the two showers have different trajectories and are unlikely to be related.                 Corona Australis may have been recorded by ancient  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| ns in the  |MUL.APIN|Mul.Apin| , as a constellation called MA.GUR . However, this constellation, adjacent to SUHUR.MASH , may instead have been modern  |Epsilon_Sagittarii|Epsilon_Sagittarii| . As a part of the southern sky, MA.GUR was one of the fifteen stars of  |Ea|Ea|  .     In the 3rd century BC, the Greek  |didactic|Didacticism|  poet  |Aratus|Aratus|  wrote of, but did not name the constellation, instead calling the two crowns Στεφάνοι . The Greek astronomer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  described the constellation in the 2nd century AD, though with the inclusion of  |Alpha_Telescopii|Alpha_Telescopii| , since transferred to Telescopium. Ascribing 13 stars to the constellation, he named it Στεφάνος νοτιος , Southern Wreath , while other authors associated it with either Sagittarius or Centaurus; with the former, it was called Corona Sagittarii. Similarly, the Romans called Corona Australis the Golden Crown of Sagittarius . It was known as Parvum Coelum in the 5th century. The 18th-century French astronomer  |Jérôme_Lalande|Jérôme_Lalande|  gave it the names Sertum Australe  and Orbiculus Capitis, while German poet and author  |Philippus_Caesius|Philipp_Von_Zesen|  called it Corolla or Spira Australis , and linked it with the Crown of Eternal Life from the New Testament. Seventeenth-century celestial cartographer  |Julius_Schiller|Julius_Schiller|  linked it to the Diadem of Solomon. Sometimes, Corona Australis was not the wreath of Sagittarius but arrows held in his hand.        Corona Australis has been associated with the myth of  |Bacchus|Dionysis|  and  |Stimula|Semele| .  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  had impregnated Stimula, causing  |Juno|Juno|  to become jealous. Juno convinced Stimula to ask Jupiter to appear in his full splendor, which the mortal woman could not handle, causing her to burn. After Bacchus, Stimulas unborn child, became an adult and the god of wine, he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky.     In  |Chinese_astronomy|Chinese_Astronomy| , the stars of Corona Australis are located within the  |Black_Tortoise_of_the_North|Black_Tortoise|  . The constellation itself was known as tien pieh and during the  |Western_Zhou|Western_Zhou|  period, marked the beginning of winter. However,  |precession|Axial_Precession|  over time has meant that the Heavenly River  became the more accurate marker to the ancient Chinese and hence supplanted the turtle in this role. Arabic names for Corona Australis include Al Ķubbah the Tortoise , Al Ĥibā the Tent or Al Udḥā al Naām the Ostrich Nest . It was later given the name Al Iklīl al Janūbiyyah, which the European authors  |Chilmead|Edmund_Chilmead| ,  |Riccioli|Giovanni_Battista_Riccioli|  and Caesius transliterated as Alachil Elgenubi, Elkleil Elgenubi and Aladil Algenubi respectively.     The  |ǀXam|ǀXam_Language|  speaking  |San_people|San_People|  of South Africa knew the constellation as ≠nabbe ta !nu house of branches —owned originally by the Dassie , and the star pattern depicting people sitting in a semicircle around a fire.     The indigenous  |Boorong|Wergaia|  people of northwestern Victoria saw it as Won, a boomerang thrown by Totyarguil . The  |Aranda_people|Aranda_People|  of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a  |coolamon|Coolamon|  carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth by a group of sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created  |Gosses_Bluff_crater|Gosses_Bluff_Crater| , 175  km west of  |Alice_Springs|Alice_Springs| . The  |Torres_Strait_Islanders|Torres_Strait_Islanders|  saw Corona Australis as part of a larger constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of  |Scorpiuss|Scorpius|  tail; the  |Pleiades|Pleiades|  and  |Orion|Orion|  were also associated. This constellation was Tagais canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the Usiam, and Orion, called the Seg. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpiuss tail represents a  |suckerfish|Remora| , while  |Eta_Sagittarii|Eta_Sagittarii|  and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe. On the island of  |Futuna|Futuna| , the figure of Corona Australis was called Tanuma and in the  |Tuamotus|Tuamotus| , it was called Na Kaua-ki-Tonga.
