In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a metric space is a  |set|Set|  together with a  |metric_on_the_set|Metric_Definition| . The metric is a  |function|Function|  that defines a concept of distance between any two  |members|Element|  of the set, which are usually called  |points|Point| . The metric satisfies a few simple properties. Informally:   the distance from a point to itself is zero,   the distance between two distinct points is positive,   the distance from A to B is the same as the distance from B to A, and   the distance from A to B is less than or equal to the distance from A to B via any third point C.     A metric on a space induces  |topological_properties|Topological_Properties|  like  |open|Open_Set|  and  |closed_sets|Closed_Set| , which lead to the study of more abstract  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space| .     The most familiar metric space is  |3-dimensional_Euclidean_space|3-Dimensional_Euclidean_Space| . In fact, a metric is the generalization of the  |Euclidean_metric|Euclidean_Metric|  arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric defines the distance between two points as the length of the  |straight|Straight_Line| |line_segment|Line_Segment|  connecting them. Other metric spaces occur for example in  |elliptic_geometry|Elliptic_Geometry|  and  |hyperbolic_geometry|Hyperbolic_Geometry| , where distance on a  |sphere|Sphere|  measured by angle is a metric, and the  |hyperboloid_model|Hyperboloid_Model|  of hyperbolic geometry is used by  |special_relativity|Special_Relativity|  as a metric space of  |velocities|Velocities| .            In 1906  |Maurice_Fréchet|Maurice_Fréchet|  introduced metric spaces in his work Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel. Rendic. Circ. Mat. Palermo 22 1–74 However the name is due to  |Felix_Hausdorff|Felix_Hausdorff| .       A metric space is an  |ordered_pair|Ordered_Pair|  where M is a set and d is a  |metric|Metric|  on M , i.e., a  |function|Function|      : d   M   M         such that for any x, y, z   M , the following holds:         :     Given the above three axioms, we also have that d   0 for any x, y   M . This is deduced as follows:     :     The function d is also called distance function or simply distance. Often, d is omitted and one just writes M for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.     Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldnt be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours arent shortcuts. If the distance between two points is zero, the two points are indistinguishable from one-another. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea.        The  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  with the distance function d   y - x   given by the  |absolute_difference|Absolute_Difference| , and, more generally,  |Euclidean_-space|Euclidean_Space|  with the  |Euclidean_distance|Euclidean_Distance| , are  |complete|Complete_Space|  metric spaces. The  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number|  with the same distance function also form a metric space, but not a complete one.   The  |positive_real_numbers|Positive_Real_Numbers|  with distance function d       is a complete metric space.   Any  |normed_vector_space|Normed_Vector_Space|  is a metric space by defining d   y - x   , see also  |metrics_on_vector_spaces|Metric_Metrics_On_Vector_Spaces| .  Examples:   The  |Manhattan_norm|Norm_Taxicab_Norm_Or_Manhattan_Norm|  gives rise to the  |Manhattan_distance|Manhattan_Distance| , where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates.   The  |maximum_norm|Maximum_Norm|  gives rise to the  |Chebyshev_distance|Chebyshev_Distance|  or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a  |chess_king|King|  would take to travel from x to y .   The  |British_Rail|British_Rail|  metric  on a  |normed_vector_space|Normed_Vector_Space|  is given by d   x   +   y   for distinct points x and y , and d 0 . More generally   .   can be replaced with a function f taking an arbitrary set S to non-negative reals and taking the value 0 at most once: then the metric is defined on S by d f + f for distinct points x and y , and d 0 . The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys to proceed via London irrespective of their final destination.   If is a metric space and X is a  |subset|Subset|  of M , then becomes a metric space by restricting the domain of d to X   X .   The  |discrete_metric|Discrete_Metric| , where d 0 if xy and d 1 otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all sets. This, in particular, shows that for any set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an  |open_ball|Open_Ball| , and therefore every subset is open and the space has the  |discrete_topology|Discrete_Topology| .   A finite metric space is a metric space having a  |finite|Finite_Set|  number of points. Not every finite metric space can be  |isometrically|Isometry|  embedded in a  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space| .  |Nathan_Linial|Nati_Linial| .   Open problems on embeddings of finite metric spaces, edited by Jirīı Matoušek, 2007    The  |hyperbolic_plane|Hyperbolic_Geometrymodels_Of_The_Hyperbolic_Plane|  is a metric space. More generally:   If M is any  |connected|Connectedness| |Riemannian_manifold|Riemannian_Manifold| , then we can turn M into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the  |infimum|Infimum|  of the lengths of the paths  connecting them.   If X is some set and M is a metric space, then, the set of all  |bounded_functions|Bounded_Function|  f   X   M  can be turned into a metric space by defining d   d for any two bounded functions f and g . Searcóid, . This metric is called the  |uniform_metric|Uniform_Metric|  or supremum metric, and If M is complete, then this  |function_space|Function_Space|  is complete as well. If X is also a topological space, then the set of all bounded  |continuous|Continuous_Function|  functions from X to M , will also be a complete metric if M is.   If G is an  |undirected_connected_graph|Graph_Theory| , then the set V of vertices of G can be turned into a metric space by defining d to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices x and y . In  |geometric_group_theory|Geometric_Group_Theory|  this is applied to the  |Cayley_graph|Cayley_Graph|  of a group, yielding the  |word_metric|Word_Metric| .    |Graph_edit_distance|Graph_Edit_Distance|  is a measure of dissimilarity between two  |graphs|Graph| , defined as the minimal number of  |graph_edit_operations|Graph_Operations|  required to transform one graph into another.   The  |Levenshtein_distance|Levenshtein_Distance|  is a measure of the dissimilarity between two  |strings|String|  u and v , defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform u into v . This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an  |edit_distance|Edit_Distance| .   Given a metric space and an increasing  |concave_function|Concave_Function|  f   0, xy.
