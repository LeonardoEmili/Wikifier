SHODANs plan is to destroy all major cities on the planet, in a bid to establish itself as a god. SHODAN: In my talons, I shape clay, crafting lifeforms as I please. Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth. My whims will become lightning bolts that devastate the mounds of humanity. Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision. God... the title suits me well. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hackers incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. Rebecca: Employee 2-4601, listen carefully. My name is Rebecca Lansing, and Im a counter-terrorism consultant to TriOptimum. Were tracking a disruption on Citadel Station — something involving an on-board AI called SHODAN. You are TriOps only contact on station. Communications are out, and there is evidence of biological contamination. The mining laser is charging, for a possible strike against Earth. Theres a man named Nathan DArcy, who may know something about taking the laser offline. His office is near the central hub on your level. The AI is on the bridge. Once the laser is out, look for the source of the problem there. And by the way, we know all about you and your friend Diego. Pull this off, and well clear your record. That implant youre wearing is military-grade hardware; use it well. Lansing out. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Stations own shields. Foiled by the hackers work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with the virus Diego planned to steal—the same one responsible for turning the stations crew into mutants. SHODAN: I see theres still an insect loose in my station. Do not be fooled into thinking that you have preserved your planet. I am perfecting a mutagen virus in one of the groves, that will turn all Earthly life into festering, gibbering, pestulant mutations. When the station reaches Earth, I shall loose the virus. Poor, poor Earthlings. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earths computer networks. Rebecca: Hacker? This is Rebecca. Weve got a new situation here. A few seconds ago we caught a surge of activity on Citadel Station. Our best guess is that SHODAN is preparing to download itself into Earths ComNet. Youll have to take plastique on the storage level, and use it to knock out the four antenna relays on the engineering level. Dont try to--static / SHODAN: You know, hacker, you are by far the most bothersome human being I have found on this station. But dont bother with the antennas, you cant stop me there. Its hopeless, and we both know it. Following Rebeccas advice, the hacker prevents the downloads completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data. SHODAN: I hope you amused yourself with the antennae. My central consciousness remains supremely undisturbed on the bridge. When the cyborgs catch up to you, I will be watching.     Soon after, Rebecca contacts the hacker, and says that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the stations destruction; she provides him with details on how to do this. Rebecca: Listen up, hacker. Ive finally convinced the brass at TriOptimum to let us blow the station. If you can find out the systems authorization code, you can set the reactor to overload. Look for that code from Willard Richie, the SysOp on engineering. Then you have to go to the reactor core, and look for a panel where you can enter the code, and hit the overload switch. Youll need at least a level two environment suit to survive, or else a hell of a lot of Detox. Escape pods are on the flight deck, the launch code is 001. Good luck, well be watching. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the stations self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. SHODAN: You have destroyed my beautiful station. You will not escape now. I am departing, but you shall remain to die, my enemy, my creator. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. Rebecca: Ok, now dont panic. You can still get out of this alive, if you move. SHODAN is going to separate the bridge from the rest of the station. When that happens, be on the bridge. Weve got a team of engineers here — people who worked on the station and on SHODAN. Well try to feed you info while you make your run--static / SHODAN: I see you are still receiving transmissions from Earth. Well have no more of that. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODANs jamming signal.

They briefly considered placing the game in modern day, but Church said that the idea was rejected because it just beg so many questions: why cant I pick up the phone, why cant I get on the train, and so on . Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts, where he, Neurath and Grossman brainstormed possible science fiction settings for the game. According to Spector, the game was initially titled Alien Commander and was a spin-off of the  Wing Commander  series; however, this idea was soon replaced entirely. Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise, because it meant that they could basically do whatever liked .       The four collaborated to write numerous minutes of gameplay documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, You hear the sound of a security camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way . The documents would hint at the gameplay systems involved, and at the ": null

Church and Grossman refined several of the teams documents and defined the games design and direction, and Grossman wrote the games original ": null
    },
    {
        "design document": "Design Document"
    },
    {
        ". Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a mini-prototype for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that dialogue trees broke the fiction of games; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.     To eliminate dialogue trees from System Shock, the team prevented the player from ever meeting a living non-player character : the plot is instead conveyed by e-mail messages and log discs, many of which were recorded by dead NPCs. Here, Grossman took influence from Edgar Lee Masters Spoon River Anthology , a collection of poems written as the epitaphs of fictional individuals. Grossman later summarized the idea as a series of short speeches from people, that when put together, gave you a history of a place. The removal of conversations was an attempt by the team to make the game a more integrated whole than was Ultima Underworld--one with a greater focus on immersion, atmosphere and the feeling of being there . They sought to plunge into the fiction and never provide an opportunity for breaking that fiction ; and so they tried to erase the distinction between plot and exploration. Church considered this direction to be an organic progression from Ultima Underworld, and he later said, On some level its still just a dungeon simulator, and were still just trying to evolve that idea. Shortly before production began, Tribe bassist Greg LoPiccolo was contracted to work on the games music. He had visited his friend Rex Bradford at the company, and was spontaneously asked by the games programmers—many of whom were fans of the band—if he would take the role. The game entered production in February 1993. Although Grossman was heavily involved in the games early planning, he had little to do with its production, aside from providing assistance with writing and voice acting.       thu environment in Cyberspace. The characters shield is displayed at the top right, while weapons and abilities are listed at the bottom     After production began, the teams first task was to develop a new game engine—one that could display a true 3D environment and allow for advanced gameplay. The team abandoned the engine used for the Ultima Underworld games and coded one from scratch in Watcom C/C++ , using 32-bit code. The new engine is capable of processing texture maps , sloped architecture and light-emitting objects; and it allows the player to look in any direction, whereas Ultima Underworlds engine was very limited in this regard. It also enables the player character to jump, crawl, climb walls and lean, among other things. The designers utilized loopholes in the engines renderer to create more diverse and striking environments. Despite having coded the renderer, Church said that at first glance even I couldnt see how they did them . However, this added to the performance issues already being caused by the engines advanced nature, and the team struggled to optimize the game throughout development. 3D polygon al character models were planned, but they could not be implemented on schedule. Church said that the teams ultimate goal was to create a rich, exciting, active environment in which the player could be immersed, and that this required a coherent story and a world that you can interact with as much as possible.     Church later said that the team stumbled into a nice villain with SHODAN, in that she could routinely and directly affect the players gameplay in non-final ways . Through triggered events and through objects in the environment, such as security cameras that the player must destroy, the team made SHODANs presence part of the players exploration of the world. Because SHODAN interacts with the player as a recurring, consistent, palpable enemy , Church believed that she meaningfully connects the player to the story. System Shock concept artist Robb Waters created SHODANs visual design, and LoPiccolo recruited his bandmate Terri Brosius to voice the character. Brosius said that her goal during the recording sessions was to speak without emotion, but with some up and down inflections . Afterward, her voice was heavily edited in post-production, which created a robotic effect inspired by the voice of Max Headroom . LoPiccolo later said that the large number of effects on Brosiuss voice were laboriously hand-done with Sound Designer , which lacked the features that a sound editor would normally use to achieve such results. SHODANs dialogue early in the game was given a few glitches to hint at her corrupted status. LoPiccolo increased the number of these effects throughout the game, which creates an arc that ends with SHODAN completely out of her mind collapsing as an entity . The character of the hacker arose as a reaction against the protagonist of the Ultima series, the Avatar . According to Grossman, they wanted to cast the player as someone interestingly morally compromised who had a stake in the situation.     Seamus Blackley designed the games physics system, which is a modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glasss flight simulator Flight Unlimited . At the time, Church described it as far more sophisticated than what you would normally use for an indoor game . The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. The games most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the characters head tilts forward when you start to run, and jerks back a bit when you stop , and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to mass and velocity of the objects involved . On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, If games dont obey physics, we somehow feel that something isnt right , and that the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesnt notice the physics, but only notices that things feel the way they should .     Spectors role as a producer gave him the job of explaining the game to the publisher, which he called his biggest challenge . He explained that they didnt always get what the team was trying to do , and said, You dont want to know how many times the game came this close to being killed . According to Church, Looking Glass internal management largely ignored System Shock, in favor of the concurrently-developed Flight Unlimited —the game that had to be the hit, because it was the self-published title . Spector organized a licensing deal between Electronic Arts and Looking Glass that gave the former the trademark to the game, but the latter the copyright. His goal was to ensure that neither party could continue the franchise without the others involvement. While Cyberspace was originally conceived as a realistic hacking simulation—which could even be used to reimplement SHODANs ethical constraints—it was simplified after Origin Systems deemed it too complicated. The games star field system was written by programmer James Fleming. Marc LeBlanc was the main creator of the games HUD, which he later believed was too complicated. He said that it was very much the Microsoft Word school of user interface , in that there was no feature that you see on the screen and touch and play with .     LoPiccolo composed the games score—called dark , electronic and cyberpunk by the Boston Herald —on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer, using Audio Vision . It dynamically changes according to the players actions, a decision made in keeping with the teams focus on emergent gameplay . Each track was written at three different intensity levels , which change depending on the players nearness to enemies; and certain events, such as victory in combat, trigger special music. The games tracks were composed of four-bar segments that could be rearranged dynamically in reaction to game events, with melodies through-composed on top . LoPiccolo noted that, when using this method, it is necessary to write music that still flows with the overall theme and doesnt jump around . Because the score was closely tied to the gameplay, LoPiccolo had to work closely with Church and Rob Fermier, the latter of whom wrote the interactive scoring module that allowed for dynamic music. After recording the music, LoPiccolo recorded all of the games sound effects. He later recalled visiting an automobile repair shop with portable recorder and a mic , and having mechanic hit things with wrenches and so forth, just to get the raw material . He developed the games audio over 16 months, working on a contractual basis until Tribe disbanded in May 1994; Ned Lerner gave him a full-time job as audio director the next day. Tim Ries composed the Elevator music.     The original September 1994 floppy disk release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM was released in December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create audio vignettes . Doug Church later said, We tried to keep them from shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it . System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much it might as well have been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in peoples minds by the floppy version . I really think that cost us sales...           The game sold over 170,000 copies. Maximum PC believed that the game did not reach blockbuster status, but was successful enough to keep Looking Glass afloat . GameSpy s Bill Hiles said, Though it sold well, it never reached the frenzied popularity of Doom . Paul Neurath later said that the game was not a flop , but that it ultimately lost money for the company, which he attributed to its steep learning curve . Computer Gaming World praised the games scale, physics system, and true 3D environments; the magazine extolled the presentation of Cyberspace as nothing short of phenomenal . However, the reviewer believed that the game had little sense of urgency and confusing level layouts . Computer Shopper wrote that, while the games controls were difficult to master compared to simple run-and-shoot game like Doom , they were worth the time and effort . The reviewer noted that the game grows on you, and it will keep you intrigued for weeks .     The Boston Herald noted superficial similarities between System Shock and Doom , but called System Shock much more elaborate . The reviewer noted its high system requirements and complex controls; of the latter, he said, Theres no way you can play System Shock without first studying the manual for at least 20 minutes . The paper believed that the game would set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving . The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that the game is like a well-prepared hamburger—familiar stuff, but good to the last byte . The reviewer noted the games somewhat clumsy control , but said, That, however, is all I can find to complain about. Graphics and sound are outstanding, and the game is well-paced and riveting .     PC Gamer US wrote, System Shock smokes. It is the most fully immersive game world I have ever experienced . The reviewer praised the games story and control system, and believed that no matter what kind of game youre looking for, youll find something in System Shock to delight you .
