           The CNO cycle  is one of the two known sets of  |fusion|Nuclear_Fusion| |reactions|Nuclear_Reaction|  by which  |stars|Star|  convert  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  to  |helium|Helium| , the other being the  |proton–proton_chain_reaction|Proton–Proton_Chain_Reaction|  . Unlike the latter, the CNO cycle is a  |catalytic_cycle|Catalytic_Cycle| . It is dominant in stars that are more than 1.3 times as  |massive_as_the_Sun|Solar_Mass| .     In the CNO cycle, four  |protons|Proton|  fuse, using carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes as catalysts, to produce one  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle| , two  |positrons|Positron|  and two  |electron_neutrinos|Electron_Neutrino| . Although there are various paths and catalysts involved in the CNO cycles, all these cycles have the same net result:   :4   +   2   →     +   2   +   2   +   2   +   3   +   24.7  MeV  →     +   2   +   7   +   26.7  MeV     The positrons will almost instantly  |annihilate_with_electrons|Electron–Positron_Annihilation| , releasing energy in the form of  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray| . The neutrinos escape from the star carrying away some energy. One nucleus goes on to become carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes through a number of transformations in an endless loop.     The proton–proton chain is more prominent in stars the mass of the Sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reaction starts at temperatures around   , making it the dominant energy source in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO chain starts at approximately , but its energy output rises much more rapidly with increasing temperatures  so that it becomes the dominant source of energy at approximately .      The Sun has a  |core|Solar_Core|  temperature of around , and only  of  nuclei produced in the Sun are   born in the CNO cycle. The  |CNO-I|Cno-I|  process was independently proposed by  |Carl_von_Weizsäcker|Carl_Friedrich_Von_Weizsäcker|        and  |Hans_Bethe|Hans_Bethe|     in the late 1930s.       Under typical conditions found in stars, catalytic hydrogen burning by the CNO cycles is limited by  |proton_captures|Proton_Capture| . Specifically, the timescale for  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  of the  |radioactive_nuclei|Radionuclide|  produced is faster than the timescale for fusion. Because of the long timescales involved, the cold CNO cycles convert hydrogen to helium slowly, allowing them to power stars in quiescent equilibrium for many years.       The first proposed catalytic cycle for the conversion of hydrogen into helium was initially called the carbon–nitrogen cycle , also referred to as the Bethe–Weizsäcker cycle in honor of the independent work of  |Carl_von_Weizsäcker|Carl_Friedrich_Von_Weizsäcker|  in 1937-38 and  |Hans_Bethe|Hans_Bethe| . Bethes 1939 papers on the CN-cycle  drew on three earlier papers written in collaboration with  |Robert_Bacher|Robert_Bacher|  and  |Milton_Stanley_Livingston|Milton_Stanley_Livingston|     and which came to be known informally as Bethes Bible. It was considered the standard work on nuclear physics for many years and was a significant factor in his being awarded the  |1967_Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|List_Of_Nobel_Laureates_In_Physics| .  Bethes original calculations suggested the CN-cycle was the Suns primary source of energy. This conclusion arose from what is now-known as a mistaken belief: that the  |abundance_of_nitrogen_in_the_sun|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  is approximately 10%, when it is actually less than half a percent. The CN-cycle, named as it contains no stable isotope of oxygen involves the following cycle of transformations:   →    →    →    →    →    →  .    This cycle is now understood as being the first part of a larger process, the CNO-cycle, and the main reactions in this part of the cycle are:    N-13 + y + 1.95 MeV   N-13 -  .
