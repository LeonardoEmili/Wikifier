              The resurrection of Jesus, or anastasis is the  |Christian|Christianity|  belief that  |God|God|  raised  |Jesus|Jesus|  after  |his_crucifixion|Crucifixion_Of_Jesus|  as  |first_of_the_dead|Firstborn| , starting his exalted life as Christ and Lord. In  |Christian_theology|Christian_Theology| , the death and resurrection of Jesus are the most important events, a foundation of the Christian faith, and commemorated by  |Easter|Easter| . His resurrection is the guarantee that all the Christian dead will be resurrected at Christs  parousia . For the Christian tradition, the bodily resurrection was the restoration to life of a  |transformed_body|Spiritual_Body|  powered by  |spirit|Pneuma| , as described by Paul and the Gospels,  that led to the establishment of Christianity.     In secular and liberal Christian scholarship, the appearances of Jesus are explained as  |visionary_experiences|Vision_Theory_Of_Jesus_Appearances|  that gave the impetus to the belief in the exaltation of Jesus and a resumption of the missionary activity of Jesus followers.                 The idea of any resurrection at all first emerges clearly in the 2nd-century BC  |Book_of_Daniel|Book_Of_Daniel| , but as a belief in the resurrection of the soul alone.  |Josephus|Josephus|  tells of the three main Jewish sects of the 1st century AD, that the  |Sadducees|Sadducees|  held that both  |soul|Soul|  and body perished at death; the  |Essenes|Essenes|  that the soul was immortal but the flesh was not; and the  |Pharisees|Pharisees|  that the soul was immortal and that the body would be  |resurrected|Resurrection_Of_The_Dead|  to house it. Of these three positions, Jesus and the early Christians appear to have been closest to that of the Pharisees. Steve Mason notes that for the Pharisees, the new body is a special, holy body, which is different from the old body, a view shared to some extent by the ex-Pharisee Paul .      Endsjø notes that the evidence from Jewish texts and from tomb inscriptions points to a more complex reality. For example, when the 2nd century BC author the  |Book_of_Daniel|Book_Of_Daniel|  wrote that many of those sleeping in the dust shall awaken , he probably had in mind rebirth as stars in Gods Heaven, stars having been identified with angels from early times – such a rebirth would rule out a bodily resurrection, as angels were believed to be fleshless. Other texts range from the traditional Old Testament view that the soul would spend eternity in the underworld, to a metaphorical belief in the raising of the spirit. Most avoided defining what resurrection might imply, but a resurrection of the flesh was a marginal belief.          The Greeks held that a meritorious man could be resurrected as a god , and the successors of  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East through coins bearing his image, a privilege previously reserved for gods. The idea was adopted by the Roman emperors, and in Imperial Roman apotheosis the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor was replaced by a new and divine one as he ascended into heaven. The apotheosised dead remained recognisable to those who met them, as when  |Romulus|Romulus|  appeared to witnesses after his death, but as the biographer  |Plutarch|Plutarch|  explained of this incident, while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled .               According to the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| , God raised him from the dead , he  |ascended_to_heaven|Ascension_Of_Jesus_Christ| , to the  |right_hand_of_God|Session_Of_Christ|  , and will  |return_again|Second_Coming|  to fulfill the rest of  |Messianic_prophecy|Messianic_Prophecy|  such as the resurrection of the dead, the  |Last_Judgment|Last_Judgment|  and establishment of the  |Kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| .     The writings in the New Testament do not contain any descriptions of the moment of resurrection itself, but rather two types of eyewitness descriptions: appearances of Jesus to various people, and accounts of seeing the tomb empty.               The earliest surviving Christian writings are the letters of  |Paul|Apostle_Paul| , written between 50–57 . The  |First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians|First_Epistle_To_The_Corinthians|  contains one of the earliest  |Christian_creeds|Creedchristian_Creeds|   reporting post-mortem appearances of Jesus, and expressing the belief that he was raised from the dead, namely         In the Jerusalem ekklēsia, from which Paul received this creed, the phrase died for our sins probably was an apologetic rationale for the death of Jesus as being part of Gods plan and purpose, as evidenced in the scriptures. For Paul, it gained a deeper significance, providing a basis for the salvation of sinful Gentiles apart from the Torah.  The phrase died for our sins was derived from  |Isaiah|Isaiah| , especially , and Maccabees 4, especially . Raised on the third day is derived from         Paul says that Jesus subsequently appeared to him in the same way he did to the others. In  |2_Corinthians_12|2_Corinthians_12|  Paul describes a man in Christ who ... was caught up to the third heaven , and while the language is obscure it is plausible that he saw Jesus enthroned at the right hand of God.     It is widely accepted that this creed predates the Apostle Paul. Scholars have contended that in his presentation of the resurrection, Paul refers to an earlier authoritative tradition, transmitted in a rabbinic style, that he received and has passed on to the church at Corinth.  |Geza_Vermes|Geza_Vermes|  writes that the creed is a tradition he has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus . The creeds ultimate origins are probably within the Jerusalem apostolic community, having been formalised and passed on within a few years of the resurrection. Hans Grass argues for an origin in Damascus, Hans Grass, Ostergeschen und Osterberichte, Second Edition p. 96 and according to Paul Barnett, this creedal formula, and others, were variants of the one basic early tradition that Paul received in Damascus from Ananias in about 34 after his conversion.                    All four gospels climax with appearances of Jesus after his crucifixion, preparing the reader for his resurrection by having Jesus predict it   , or through allusions that only the reader will understand ,  and elsewhere |rse_9-|Rse_9-| deificationtwo works from the same author |irituali|Irituali| Winter 2015 Editioned.Flew 1966: 146; cf.
