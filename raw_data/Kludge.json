A source of some confusion has been Granholms jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer, Phineas Burling, of the firm Fink and Wiggles  as confirming the Germanic origin of the word.     A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word kludge first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between Kings Lynn and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.     The word kludge is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German klug , originally meaning smart or witty . In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word Kludge eventually came to mean not so smart or pretty ridiculous . Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole.     It is in this latter sense that Kludge is used by computer hardware men. Today kludge forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly.

        " Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker then current in the Armed Forces, in which a kluge was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function.      The term kluge as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to 1947, as evidenced by the article in the New York Folklore Quarterly, but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense. The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above:     On being drafted into the navy, Murgatroyd gave his profession as kluge maker . Not wanting to seem ignorant, the clerk simply wrote this down. Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing, he said he was making a kluge, and actually he was one of the worlds best kluge makers. Not wanting to seem ignorant, his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions, until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore.     One day the admiral came to inspect the ship. When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker, the admiral asked him what a kluge was  – the first person ever to do so. Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain, but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was. After a couple of days, he returned with a complex object.     Interesting, said the admiral, but what does it do? In reply, Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship. As the thing sank, it went kluge .      The Jargon File further includes kluge around to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge , kluge up to lash together a quick hack to perform a task . After Granholms 1962 How to Design a Kludge article popularized the kluge variant kludge, both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:   The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as kludge. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the words meaning.         Another hypothesis dates to 1907, when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from ": null

In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair  — but oh, so clever! The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing claims that the term kluge was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for hardware kluges .  The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, ": null
