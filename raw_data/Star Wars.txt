In 2012, Lucas sold  |his_company|Lucasfilm|  to  |Disney|Disney| , and in 2014, most existing spin-off media was made non-canon and rebranded as  Star Wars Legends  . The episodic  |Skywalker_saga|Skywalker_Saga|  and the TV series  The Clone Wars  define the canon, along with most other works released after April 2014, though a few Legends-universe media are still released, and some Legends characters are sometimes re-introduced into the canon, for example  |the_titular_character|Grand_Admiral_Thrawn|  from  |Timothy_Zahns|Timothy_Zahn| |Thrawn_trilogy|Thrawn_Trilogy|  of novels.

In 2018, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at billion, and it is currently the  |fifth-highest-grossing_media_franchise|List_Of_Highest-Grossing_Media_Franchises|  of all-time.               The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ,  in which  |humans|Human|  and many species of  |aliens|List_Of_Star_Wars_Creatures|   co-exist with  |robots|Robot| , or  |droids|Droid| , who may assist them in their daily routines;  |space_travel|Spaceflight|  between planets is common due to  |hyperspace|Hyperspacestar_Wars|  technology.        A mystical power known as  |the_Force|The_Force|  is described in the original film as an energy field created by all living things ... binds the galaxy together.  Through training and meditation, those whom the Force is strong with are able to perform various  |superpowers|Superpower|  .  The Force is wielded by two major  |knighthood_orders|Military_Order|  at conflict with each other: the  |Jedi|Jedi| , peacekeepers of the Old Republic ruthlessly hunted by Imperial authorities, who act on the light side of the Force through  |non-attachment|Detachment|  and  |arbitration|Arbitration| , and the  |Sith|Sith| , ancient enemies of the galactic democracy, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.      Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the rest of the average population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called  |lightsaber|Lightsaber| , which is the cylinder-like  |hilt|Hilt|  of a sword , but when turned on ignites a  |laser|Laser|  blade that can cut through virtually any surface. Fights between the two factions result in duels, which are a mix between sword skills and the use of the Force. The rest of the average population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered  |blaster|Blaster| |firearms|Firearm| , which Force-users can deflect using lightsabers.       The rises and falls of different regimes are chronicled throughout the saga, which is split into three eras:    The Age of Republic |prequel_trilogy|Prequel_Trilogy| , in which the democratic  |Galactic_Republic|Galactic_Republic|  is corrupted by its  |Supreme_Chancellor|Supreme_Chancellor| ,  |Palpatine|Palpatine|  —secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious. After orchestrating the  |Clone_Wars|Clone_Wars|  between the government and a Separatist  |confederation|Confederation| , Palpatine  |overthrows|Coup_Détat|  the Republic, and establishes the  |Galactic_Empire|Galactic_Empire| , declaring himself Emperor.    The prequels feature a relatively sleek and new design aesthetic in comparison to the original trilogy.    The Age of Rebellion |original_trilogy|Original_Trilogy| , in which the Empire is fought by the  |Rebel_Alliance|Rebel_Alliance|  in a  |Galactic_Civil_War|Galactic_Civil_War|  that spans several years, climaxing with the apparent death of the Emperor. The surviving Rebellion gives rise to the  |New_Republic|New_Republic| .  The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in  |George_Lucass|George_Lucas|  depiction of a used universe .    The Age of Resistance |sequel_trilogy|Sequel_Trilogy| , in which the remnants of the Empire reform as the  |First_Order|First_Order| .  Heroes of the former rebellion lead the  |Resistance|Resistance|  against the oppressive dictatorship. Rather than depend on an overabundant use of  |computer-generated_imagery|Computer-Generated_Imagery| ,  The Force Awakens  director  |J._J._Abrams|J._&_Nbsp;J._Abrams|  determined not to lose the wonderful preposterousness of puppetry and practical effects that were used to create the classic trilogy.                  The Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, which is collectively referred to as the Skywalker saga . They were produced non-chronologically, with Episodes IV–VI being released between 1977 and 1983, Episodes I–III being released between 1999 and 2005, and Episodes VII–IX , being released between 2015 and 2019. Each trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive  |Skywalker_family|Skywalker_Family| . The original trilogy depict the heroic development of  |Luke_Skywalker|Luke_Skywalker| , the prequels tell of the downfall of his father  |Anakin|Anakin_Skywalker| , while the sequels feature Lukes nephew,  |Kylo_Ren|Kylo_Ren| .     An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy,  described by Disney  |CFO|Chief_Financial_Officer| |Jay_Rasulo|Jay_Rasulo|  as  |origin_stories|Origin_Story| .  The first entry,  Rogue One  , tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before Episode IV.    Solo: A Star Wars Story  focuses on  |Han_Solos|Han_Solo|  backstory, also featuring  |Chewbacca|Chewbacca|  and  |Lando_Calrissian|Lando_Calrissian| .     Lucasfilm has a number of Star Wars movies in development, including a trilogy of films produced and written by  Game of Thrones  creators/ |showrunners|Showrunner| |David_Benioff|David_Benioff|  and  |D._B._Weiss|D._B._Weiss| .  The installments were scheduled to be released in December 2022, 2024, and 2026.   This changed in October 2019, when it was announced that the duo stepped away from their Star Wars films, stating that their contract with  |Netflix|Netflix|  making it so that they could not effectively work on the films.  |Kathleen_Kennedy|Kathleen_Kennedy|  acknowledged that the studio would be open to the pair returning to work on their trilogy when their schedule allows.      Another trilogy will be written by  The Last Jedi  writer/director  |Rian_Johnson|Rian_Johnson| .  It will be independent from the Skywalker saga.  In September 2019, it was announced that Kennedy and  |Kevin_Feige|Kevin_Feige|  will collaborate to develop an additional Star Wars film.                In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the  |Flash_Gordon_serial|Flash_Gordon| , but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own  |space_opera|Space_Opera| .   After directing  American Graffiti  , he wrote a two-page synopsis, which  |20th_Century_Fox|20Th_Century_Fox|  decided to invest in.    By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.   |The_subsequent_movies|Star_Wars|  success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate  |film_serial|Film_Serial| .   With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies. Steranko, George Lucas , Prevue 42, September–October 1980. Most of the main cast would return for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were self-financed by  |Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm| .     Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977 and first subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope in the 1979 book  The Art of Star Wars .  Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, Episode VI – Return of the Jedi was released on May 25, 1983. The story of the original trilogy focuses on  |Luke_Skywalkers|Luke_Skywalker|  quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent  |Darth_Vader|Darth_Vader| , and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Empire.             According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.  In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,  but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981. In 1983, Lucas explained that There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday. Worrell, Denise. Icons: Intimate Portraits. p. 185.     Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery , inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be unbelievably expensive.  In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy. A theatrical  |rerelease|Changes_In_Star_Wars_Re-Releases|  of the original trilogy in 1997 updated the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.     Episode I – The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, and Episode II – Attack of the Clones on May 16, 2002. Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, the first  film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005.  The first two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. The trilogy begins 32 years before Episode IV and follows the  |Jedi|Jedi|  training of  |Anakin_Skywalker|Anakin_Skywalker| , Lukes father, and creation of the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well as the corruption of the  |Galactic_Republic|Galactic_Republic|  and rise of the  |Empire|Galactic_Empire|  of  |Darth_Sidious|Palpatine| . Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as the tragedy of Darth Vader .      In 2004, for their  |DVD|Dvd|  release, the original trilogy films were furtherly altered in order to bring continuity with the prequels, for example replacing Palpatines depiction in The Empire Strikes Back and Anakins in Return of the Jedi to match their prequel selves, using their prequel portrayers.               Prior to releasing the original film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned three trilogies of nine films.  He announced this to  Time  in 1978,  and confirmed that he had outlined them in 1981.  |Kerry_OQuinn|Kerry_Oquinn| . The George Lucas Saga Chapter 3: The Revenge of the Box Office.

However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.       Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more Star Wars films.  In October of that year,  |The_Walt_Disney_Company|The_Walt_Disney_Company|  agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that Episode VII would be released in 2015.  The co-chairman of Lucasfilm,  |Kathleen_Kennedy|Kathleen_Kennedy| , became president of the company and served as executive producer of new Star Wars feature films.  Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,  but in 2015 it was revealed Lucass sequel outline had been discarded.   The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the existing  |Star_Wars_expanded_universe|Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe| , which was discarded to give maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.     Episode VII – The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015, Episode VIII – The Last Jedi on December 15, 2017, and Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker is due to be released on December 20, 2019. Episode VII was met with both critical and box office success, and Episode VIII, while also meeting critical and financial success, had a mixed reception from audiences. The sequel trilogy starts 30 years after Episode VI and focuses on the journey of the Force-sensitive orphan  |Rey|Rey| , guided by Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper  |Finn|Finn|  and ace X-Wing pilot  |Poe_Dameron|Poe_Dameron| , Rey helps the  |Resistance|Resistance|  led by Leia fight the  |First_Order|First_Order|  commanded by Han and Leias son ,  |Kylo_Ren|Kylo_Ren| .

On February 5, 2013, Disney CEO  |Bob_Iger|Bob_Iger|  made public the development of the Kasdan film.  Disney  |CFO|Chief_Financial_Officer| |Jay_Rasulo|Jay_Rasulo|  has described the standalone films as  |origin_stories|Origin_Story| .     Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the Star Wars anthology series . Focused on how the Rebels obtained the  |Death_Star|Death_Star|  plans introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film,  Rogue One , was released on December 16, 2016 to favorable reviews and box office success. The second,  Solo: A Star Wars Story , centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018 to mixed reviews and underperformance at the box office. Despite this, more anthology films are expected to be released,  following a hiatus after 2019s The Rise of Skywalker.        The Star Wars franchise has been spun off to various television productions, including two animated series released in the mid-1980s. Further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the  |Clone_Wars|Clone_Wars| . After Disneys acquisition of Lucasfilm, only  |the_later_one|Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars|  remained  |canon|Canon| . Three live-action Star Wars series will be released on  |Disney+|Disney+| . The first,  The Mandalorian , premiered on November 12.                           From 1976 to 2014, the term Expanded Universe was an umbrella term for all officially licensed Star Wars storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.  Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the Star Wars Legends label, with downloadable content for the  |massively_multiplayer_online_game|Massively_Multiplayer_Online_Game|   The Old Republic  the only Legends material to still be produced. The Star Wars canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film  The Clone Wars  , and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.  Multiple comics series from  |Marvel|Marvel_Comics|  and novels published by  |Del_Rey|Del_Rey_Books|  were produced after the announcement.

In  The Courtship of Princess Leia  by  |Dave_Wolverton|Dave_Wolverton| , set immediately before the Thrawn trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to  |Prince_Isolder|Prince_Isolder|  of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry.    |Steve_Perrys|Steve_Perry|   Shadows of the Empire  , set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.

Del Rey took over Star Wars book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called  The New Jedi Order  . Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.   The bestselling multi-author series  Legacy of the Force  chronicles the crossover of Han and Leias son  |Jacen_Solo|Jacen_Solo|  to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Lukes wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the  |Sith|Sith| . Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in The Force Awakens with Han and Leias son  |Ben_Solo|Kylo_Ren| , who has become the dark Kylo Ren.

The 1977 installments were the first original Star Wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series.  From 1985–1987, the animated childrens series  Ewoks  and  Droids  inspired comic series from Marvels  |Star_Comics|Star_Comics|  line.        In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new Star Wars comic it had in development, which was picked up by  |Dark_Horse_Comics|Dark_Horse_Comics|  and published as the popular Dark Empire series .  Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including  Tales of the Jedi  ,  X-wing Rogue Squadron  ,  Star Wars: Republic  ,  Star Wars Tales  ,  Star Wars: Empire  , and  Knights of the Old Republic  .

Radio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated  |campus_radio|Campus_Radio|  station of his alma mater the  |University_of_Southern_California|University_Of_Southern_California| , licensed the Star Wars radio rights to  |KUSC-FM|Kusc-Fm|  for US$1. The production used John Williams original film score, along with  |Ben_Burtts|Ben_Burtt|  sound effects.     The first was written by science-fiction author  |Brian_Daley|Brian_Daley|  and directed by  |John_Madden|John_Madden| .

The Star Wars franchise has spawned over one hundred  computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest  |home_consoles|Video_Game_Console| . Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical  |Expanded_Universe|Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe|  . Star Wars games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to  |Electronic_Arts|Electronic_Arts| .       The first era began with the first officially licensed electronic Star Wars game:  |Kenners|Kenner_Products|  1979 table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command.   In 1982,  |Parker_Brothers|Parker_Brothers|  published the first Star Wars video game for the  |Atari_2600|Atari_2600| ,  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back .  It was followed in 1983 by  |Ataris|Atari| |rail_shooter|Rail_Shooter| |arcade_game|Arcade_Game|   Star Wars , which used  |vector_graphics|Vector_Graphics|  to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.  The next game,  Star Wars: Return of the Jedi  , used more traditional  |raster_graphics|Raster_Graphics| ,  while the following  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back  returned to vector graphics.   Star Wars  was released for the  |Nintendo_Entertainment_System|Nintendo_Entertainment_System|  in 1991, followed by a  |sequel|Star_Wars:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back|  the following year.  Super Star Wars  was also released in 1992, followed by two sequels over the next two years.          The beginning of the second era is marked by the prominence of LucasArts and modern self-published games. LucasArts was founded after Star Wars creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice overs and CGI  |cutscenes|Cutscene| . Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  flight combat games. In 1993,  |LucasArts|Lucasarts|  released  Star Wars: X-Wing , the first self-published Star Wars video game and the first  |space_flight_simulator|Space_Simulator|  based on the franchise.  It was one of the best-selling video games of 1993 and established its own  |series_of_games|Star_Wars:_X-Wing| . The  |Rogue_Squadron_series|Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron|  was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.      Dark Forces  , a hybrid  |adventure_game|Adventure_Game|  incorporating puzzles and strategy,  was the first Star Wars  |first-person_shooter|First-Person_Shooter| .  It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts custom-designed  |game_engine|Game_Engine| , the  |Jedi|Jedi| .

According to  |Adam_Driver|Adam_Driver| , sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is doing what he thinks is right .  George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.

Each character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.  A defining step of the journey is Atonement with the Father .  Obi-Wans loss of a  |father_figure|Father_Figure|  could have impacted his relationship with Anakin,  whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.

The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture| ,  with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.  Phrases like evil empire and  |May_the_Force_be_with_you|May_The_Force_Be_With_You|  have become part of the popular lexicon.  The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,  enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.  The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making  |science-fiction_films|Science-Fiction_Film|  a mainstream genre.  The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including  Hardware Wars ,  Spaceballs ,  The Family Guy Trilogy  and  Robot Chicken: Star Wars .     In 1989, the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress|  selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U.S.  |National_Film_Registry|National_Film_Registry| , as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.  The Empire Strikes Back, was selected in 2010.   35mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,   but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.        The original Star Wars film was a huge success for  |20th_Century_Fox|20Th_Century_Fox| , and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the films release, the studios stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Foxs greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million. The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt  |production_company|Production_Company|  to a thriving media conglomerate.      Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of  |Hollywood|Cinema_Of_The_United_States|  films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and  |irony|Irony|  to sprawling special-effects-laden  |blockbusters|Blockbuster| , as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before Star Wars, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.  The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. Along with  Jaws , Star Wars started the tradition of the summer  |blockbuster|Blockbuster|  film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable  |franchises|Media_Franchise|  are important.  It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.     The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history. For a sampling of the reviews, read the following:       Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star Wars, including  |Damon_Lindelof|Damon_Lindelof| ,  |Dean_Devlin|Dean_Devlin| ,  |Roland_Emmerich|Roland_Emmerich| ,  |John_Lasseter|John_Lasseter| ,   |David_Fincher|David_Fincher| ,  |Joss_Whedon|Joss_Whedon| ,  |John_Singleton|John_Singleton| ,  |Kevin_Smith|Kevin_Smith| ,  and later Star Wars directors  |J._J._Abrams|J._&_Nbsp;J._Abrams|  and  |Gareth_Edwards|Gareth_Edwards| .   |Christopher_Nolan|Christopher_Nolan|  cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film  Inception .  Lucass concept of a used universe particularly influenced  |Ridley_Scotts|Ridley_Scott|   Blade Runner  and  Alien  ,  |James_Camerons|James_Cameron|   Aliens  as well as  The Terminator  ,  |George_Millers|George_Miller|   Mad Max 2 , and  |Peter_Jacksons|Peter_Jackson| |The_Lord_of_the_Rings_trilogy|The_Lord_Of_The_Rings| .     Regarding the return and expansion of the franchise,  |Lawrence_Kasdan|Lawrence_Kasdan|  noted that the spin-offs were expanding the franchise into more of a  |shared_universe|Shared_Universe|  beyond the previously linear saga, adding that one of the strengths of the franchise was how it all fell under the same continuity in comparison to other franchises. Kasdan also contrasted Star Wars to the  |Marvel_Cinematic_Universe|Marvel_Cinematic_Universe| , noting that Star Wars features less  |comedy|Comedy|  than the latter, and adding that he felt a more comedic approach would not be Star Wars to him.       Film critic  |Roger_Ebert|Roger_Ebert|  wrote in his book  The Great Movies , Like  The Birth of a Nation  and  Citizen Kane , Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after. It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new,  |high-concept|High-Concept|  genre for filmmakers to build upon. Finally, along with  |Steven_Spielbergs|Steven_Spielberg|   Jaws , it shifted the film industrys focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget  |blockbusters|Blockbuster|  for younger audiences.   |Shone,_Tom|Tom_Shone|  .  Blockbuster: How Hollywood Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Summer . London: Simon & Schuster. p. 64. .     Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from sophisticated films such as  The Godfather ,  Taxi Driver , and  Annie Hall  to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.  One such critic,  |Peter_Biskind|Peter_Biskind| , complained, When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and  |New_Hollywood|New_Hollywood|  films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s  |Golden_Age_of_movies|Classical_Hollywood_Cinema| ... They marched backward through the looking-glass.  |Biskind,_Peter|Peter_Biskind|  . Star Bucks . Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood. New York:  |Simon_&_Schuster|Simon_&_Schuster| . pp. 336–337, 343. . In an opposing view,  |Tom_Shone|Tom_Shone|  wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg didnt betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect , which was a kind of rebirth .          The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing  |fan_fiction|Fan_Fiction|  to creating  |fan_films|Fan_Film| . In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual  |Official_Star_Wars_Fan_Film_Awards|The_Official_Star_Wars_Fan_Film_Awards| , officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential  |copyright|Copyright|  and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to  |parodies|Parody| ,  |mockumentaries|Mockumentary| , and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.  Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.        As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.  Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.  Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of  |psychopathology|Psychopathology| .
