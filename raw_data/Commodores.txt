      Commodores is an American  |funk|Funk| / |soul|Soul_Music|  band, which was at its peak in the late 1970s through the mid 1980s. The members of the group met as mostly  |freshmen|Freshmen|  at Tuskegee Institute  in 1968, and signed with  |Motown|Motown|  in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for  |the_Jackson_5|The_Jackson_5|  while on  |tour|Concert_Tour| .     The groups most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when  |Lionel_Richie|Lionel_Richie|  was the co-lead singer. The bands biggest  |hit_singles|Hit_Record|  are  |ballads|Sentimental_Ballad|  such as  |Easy|Easy|  ,  |Three_Times_a_Lady|Three_Times_A_Lady|  , and  |Nightshift|Nightshift|  ; and  |funk|Funk| y dance hits which include  |Brick_House|Brick_House|  , Fancy Dancer ,  |Lady_|Lady|  , and  |Too_Hot_ta_Trot|Too_Hot_Ta_Trot|  . In 1986, the Commodores won their first Grammy for the song Nightshift .       The Commodores originally came together from two former student groups, the Mystics and the Jays. Richie described some members of the Mystics as jazz buffs .    Together, a six-man band was created from which the notable individuals were  |Lionel_Richie|Lionel_Richie| ,  |Thomas_McClary|Thomas_Mcclary| , and William King from the Mystics; Andre Callahan, Michael Gilbert, and  |Milan_Williams|Milan_Williams|  were from the Jays. They wanted to change the name. To choose a new name, William King opened a dictionary and randomly picked a word. We lucked out, he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to  People  magazine. We almost became The Commodes.      The band originated while its members attended  |Tuskegee_University|Tuskegee_University|  in Alabama. After winning the universitys annual freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to college students. They performed mostly cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram . Ingram, older than the rest of the band, left to serve active duty in  |Vietnam|Vietnam| , and was later replaced by Walter Clyde Orange, who wrote, or co-wrote, many of their hit tunes.  |Lionel_Richie|Lionel_Richie|  and Orange alternated as lead singers.      The early band was managed by Benny Ashburn, who brought them to his familys vacation lodge on Marthas Vineyard in 1971 and 1972. There, Ashburn test marketed the group by having them play at outdoor spaces such as parking lots and summer festivals.     The Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film  Thank God Its Friday . They performed the song Too Hot ta Trot during the dance contest; the songs Brick House and Easy were also played during the movie.      |Machine_Gun|Machine_Gun|  , the instrumental title track from the bands debut album, became a staple at American sporting events, and is similarly featured in many films, including  Boogie Nights  and  Looking for Mr. Goodbar .  It reached No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. Another instrumental,  |Cebu|Cebu|  , later became a staple in the  |Quiet_storm|Quiet_Storm|  format. Three albums released in 1975 and 1976  are considered the peak of their harder funk period. After those recordings the group started to move towards a softer sound. That move was hinted at in their 1976 Top Ten hits Sweet Love and  |Just_to_Be_Close_to_You|Just_To_Be_Close_To_You|  . In 1977 the Commodores released  |Easy|Easy|  , which became the groups biggest hit yet, reaching No. 4 in the U.S., followed by Brick House , also top 5, both from their album The Commodores, as was Zoom . The group reached No. 1 in 1978 with  |Three_Times_a_Lady|Three_Times_A_Lady|  . In 1979 the Commodores scored another top-five ballad, Sail On , before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad,  |Still|Still|  . In 1981 they released two top-ten hits with Oh No and their first upbeat single in almost five years,  |Lady_|Lady|  .     In 1982, Lionel Richie left to pursue a solo career. Skyler Jett replaced Richie as co-lead singer. Also in 1982, their manager Benjamin Ashburn who also managed another band  |Platinum_Hook|Platinum_Hook|  died of a heart attack aged 54.       Over time, several founding members left - McClary left in 1983 to pursue a solo career and to develop a  |gospel_music|Gospel_Music|  company. McClary was replaced by guitarist-vocalist  |Sheldon_Reynolds|Sheldon_Reynolds| , while LaPread left in 1986 and moved to  |Auckland|Auckland| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| . Reynolds departed for  |Earth_Wind_Fire|Earth_Wind_Fire|  in 1987, which prompted trumpeter William WAK King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances. Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989 after allegedly refusing to tour  |South_Africa|South_Africa| .     The group also gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial pop arena. In 1984 former  |Heatwave|Heatwave|  singer James Dean J.D. Nicholas assumed co-lead vocal duties with drummer Walter Orange. The band remained hitless until 1985 when their final  |Motown|Motown|  album, Nightshift, produced by Dennis Lambert—all prior albums were produced by James Anthony Carmichael—delivered the title track  |Nightshift|Nightshift|  , a loving tribute to  |Marvin_Gaye|Marvin_Gaye|  and  |Jackie_Wilson|Jackie_Wilson| , both of whom had died the previous year. Nightshift won the Commodores their first  |Grammy|Grammy_Award|  for  |Best_R_B_Performance_by_a_Duo_or_Group_With_Vocals|Grammy_Award_For_Best_R_B_Performance_By_A_Duo_Or_Group_With_Vocals|  in 1985.     In 2010 a new version was recorded, dedicated to  |Michael_Jackson|Michael_Jackson| .  The Commodores were on a European tour performing at  |Wembley_Arena|Wembley_Arena| ,  |London|London| , on June 25, 2009, when they walked off the stage after they were told that Michael Jackson had died. Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night at  |Birminghams|Birmingham| |_NIA_Arena|Barclaycard_Arena| , J.D. Nicholas added Jacksons name into the lyrics of the song, and thenceforth the Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R & B singers. Thus came the inspiration upon the one-year anniversary of Jacksons death, to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song Nightshift as a tribute.     In 1990 the Commodores formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as Commodores Hits Vol. I & II. They have  |recorded|Sound_Recording_And_Reproduction|  a live album  Commodores Live!  along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled Commodores Christmas. In 2012, the band was working on new material, some contributions written by current and former members.     The Commodores now consist of Walter Clyde Orange, James Dean J.D. Nicholas, and William WAK King, along with their five-piece band, known as the Mean Machine . The group continues to perform, playing at arenas, theaters, and festivals around the world.          ;Current members    |William_WAK_King|William_King|  – trumpet, rhythm guitar, keyboards, vocals   Walter Orange – drums, vocals   James Dean J.D.
