          In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , especially in  |order_theory|Order_Theory| , a preorder or quasiorder is a  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|  that is  |reflexive|Reflexive_Relation|  and  |transitive|Transitive_Relation| . Preorders are more general than  |equivalence_relations|Equivalence_Relation|  and  |partial_orders|Partial_Order| , both of which are special cases of a preorder. An  |antisymmetric|Antisymmetric_Relation|  preorder is a partial order, and a  |symmetric|Symmetric_Relation|  preorder is an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation| .     The name preorder comes from the idea that preorders are almost orders, but not quite; they are neither necessarily antisymmetric nor  |asymmetric|Asymmetric_Relation| . Because a preorder is a binary relation, the symbol ≤ can be used as the notational device for the relation. However, because they are not necessarily antisymmetric, some of the ordinary intuition associated to the symbol ≤ may not apply. On the other hand, a preorder can be used, in a straightforward fashion, to define a partial order and an equivalence relation. Doing so, however, is not always useful or worthwhile, depending on the problem domain being studied.     In words, when , one may say that b covers a or that a precedes b, or that b reduces to a. Occasionally, the notation ← or ≲ is used instead of ≤.     To every preorder, there corresponds a  |directed_graph|Directed_Graph| , with elements of the set corresponding to vertices, and the order relation between pairs of elements corresponding to the directed edges between vertices. The converse is not true: most directed graphs are neither reflexive nor transitive. In general, the corresponding graphs may contain  |cycles|Cycle| . A preorder that is antisymmetric no longer has cycles; it is a partial order, and corresponds to a  |directed_acyclic_graph|Directed_Acyclic_Graph| . A preorder that is symmetric is an equivalence relation; it can be thought of as having lost the direction markers on the edges of the graph. In general, a preorders corresponding directed graph may have many disconnected components.         Consider some  |set|Set|  P and a  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|  ≤ on P. Then ≤ is a preorder, or quasiorder, if it is  |reflexive|Reflexive_Relation|  and  |transitive|Transitive_Relation| ; i.e., for all a, b and c in P, we have that:   : a ≤ a   : if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c     A set that is equipped with a preorder is called a preordered set . For proset , see e.g. .     If a preorder is also  |antisymmetric|Antisymmetric_Relation| , that is,  and  implies , then it is a  |partial_order|Partially_Ordered_Set| .     On the other hand, if it is  |symmetric|Symmetric_Relation| , that is, if  implies , then it is an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation| .     A preorder is  |total|Total_Preorder|  if either  or  for all a, b.     Equivalently, the notion of a preordered set P can be formulated in a  |categorical_framework|Category_Theory|  as a  |thin_category|Thin_Category| ; i.e., as a category with at most one morphism from an object to another. Here the  |objects|Object|  correspond to the elements of P, and there is one morphism for objects which are related, zero otherwise. Alternately, a preordered set can be understood as an  |enriched_category|Enriched_Category| , enriched over the category .     A  |preordered_class|Preordered_Class|  is a  |class|Class|  equipped with a preorder. Every set is a class and so every preordered set is a preordered class.       The  |reachability|Reachability|  relationship in any  |directed_graph|Directed_Graph|  gives rise to a preorder, where  in the preorder if and only if there is a path from x to y in the directed graph. Conversely, every preorder is the reachability relationship of a directed graph . However, many different graphs may have the same reachability preorder as each other. In the same way, reachability of  |directed_acyclic_graphs|Directed_Acyclic_Graph| , directed graphs with no cycles, gives rise to  |partially_ordered_sets|Partially_Ordered_Set|  .   Every  |finite_topological_space|Finite_Topological_Space|  gives rise to a preorder on its points by defining  if and only if x belongs to every  |neighborhood|Neighborhood|  of y. Every finite preorder can be formed as the  |specialization_preorder|Specialization_Order|  of a topological space in this way. That is, there is a  |one-to-one_correspondence|One-To-One_Correspondence|  between finite topologies and finite preorders. However, the relation between infinite topological spaces and their specialization preorders is not one-to-one.   A  |net|Net|  is a  |directed|Directed_Set|  preorder, that is, each pair of elements has an  |upper_bound|Upper_Bound| . The definition of convergence via nets is important in  |topology|Topology| , where preorders cannot be replaced by  |partially_ordered_sets|Partially_Ordered_Set|  without losing important features.   The relation defined by  if , where f is a function into some preorder.   The relation defined by  if there exists some  |injection|Injective_Function|  from x to y. Injection may be replaced by  |surjection|Surjection| , or any type of structure-preserving function, such as  |ring_homomorphism|Ring_Homomorphism| , or  |permutation|Permutation| .   The  |embedding|Embedding|  relation for countable  |total_order|Total_Order| ings.   The  |graph-minor|Graph-Minor|  relation in  |graph_theory|Graph_Theory| .   A  |category|Category|  with at most one  |morphism|Morphism|  from any object x to any other object y is a preorder. Such categories are called  |thin|Thin_Category| . In this sense, categories generalize preorders by allowing more than one relation between objects: each morphism is a distinct preorder relation.     In computer science, one can find examples of the following preorders.    |Many-one|Many-One_Reduction|  and  |Turing_reductions|Turing_Reduction|  are preorders on complexity classes.   The  |subtyping|Subtype|  relations are usually preorders.    |Simulation_preorders|Simulation_Preorder|  are preorders .    |Reduction_relations|Reduction_Relation|  in  |abstract_rewriting_systems|Abstract_Rewriting_System| .   The  |encompassment_preorder|Encompassment_Preorder|  on the set of  |terms|Term| , defined by  if a  |subterm|Term_Operations_With_Terms|  of t is a  |substitution_instance|Substitution_Instance|  of s.     Example of a  |total_preorder|Strict_Weak_Orderingtotal_Preorders| |Preference|Preference| , according to common models.       Preorders play a pivotal role in several situations:   Every preorder can be given a topology, the  |Alexandrov_topology|Alexandrov_Topology| ; and indeed, every preorder on a set is in one-to-one correspondence with an Alexandrov topology on that set.   Preorders may be used to define  |interior_algebras|Interior_Algebra| .   Preorders provide the  |Kripke_semantics|Kripke_Semantics|  for certain types of  |modal_logic|Modal_Logic| .         Every binary relation R on a set S can be extended to a preorder on S by taking the  |transitive_closure|Transitive_Closure|  and  |reflexive_closure|Binary_Relationoperations_On_Binary_Relations| , R + . The transitive closure indicates path connection in  if and only if there is an R- |path|Path|  from x to y.     Given a preorder ≲ on S one may define an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation|  ~ on S such that  if and only if  and .     Using this relation, it is possible to construct a partial order on the quotient set of the equivalence, S / ~, the set of all  |equivalence_class|Equivalence_Class| es of ~. Note that if the preorder is R + ,  is the set of R- |cycle|Cycle|  equivalence classes:  if and only if  or x is in an R-cycle with y. In any case, on  we can define  if and only if . By the construction of ~, this definition is independent of the chosen representatives and the corresponding relation is indeed well-defined. It is readily verified that this yields a partially ordered set.     Conversely, from a partial order on a partition of a set S one can construct a preorder on S. There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs .     For a preorder ≲ , a relation  .
