                 According to Roman tradition, Lucretia , anglicized as Lucrece, was a  |noblewoman_in_ancient_Rome|Women_In_Ancient_Rome|  whose rape by  |Sextus_Tarquinius|Sextus_Tarquinius|  , an Etruscan kings son, was the cause of a rebellion that  |overthrew_the_Roman_monarchy|Overthrow_Of_The_Roman_Monarchy|  and led to the transition of Roman government from a  |kingdom|Roman_Kingdom|  to a  |republic|Roman_Republic| . There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian  |Livy|Livy|  and Greco-Roman historian  |Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus|Dionysius_Of_Halicarnassus| .     The incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome,  |Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus|Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus| . As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted  |Etruscan|Etruscan_Civilization|  and  |Latian|Latins|  intervention. As a result of its sheer impact, the rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.     One of the first two  |consuls|Consul|  of the Roman Republic,  |Lucius_Tarquinius_Collatinus|Lucius_Tarquinius_Collatinus|  was Lucretias husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretias story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretias story is not considered a  |myth|Myth|  by most historians, but rather a historical  |legend|Legend|  about an early history that was already a major part of Roman  |folklore|Folklore|  before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.     As the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the fasti. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year at the beginning of the sixty-eighth  |Olympiad|Olympiad|  ...  |Isagoras|Isagoras|  being the annual  |archon|Archon|  at  |Athens|Athens|  ; D.H. V.1. that is, 508/507  BC . Lucretia therefore died in 508  BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.            |Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus|Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus| , last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of  |Ardea|Ardea| , sent his son,  |Tarquin|Sextus_Tarquinius| , on a military errand to  |Collatia|Collatia| . Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governors mansion, home of  |Lucius_Tarquinius_Collatinus|Lucius_Tarquinius_Collatinus| , son of the kings nephew,  |Arruns_Tarquinius|Arruns_Tarquinius| , former governor of Collatia and first of the  |Tarquinii_Collatini|Tarquinius| . Collatinus wife, Lucretia, daughter of  |Spurius_Lucretius|Spurius_Lucretius| , prefect of Rome, a man of distinction, D.H. IV.64. made sure that the kings son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.     In a variant of the story, T.L. I.57. Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.     At night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex . In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretias room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.       Tarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her fathers house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicants position , weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her fathers arms, with the women present  |keening|Keening|  and lamenting. This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants. D.H. IV.66.     In the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were  |Publius_Valerius_Publicola|Publius_Valerius_Publicola|  from Rome and  |Lucius_Junius_Brutus|Lucius_Junius_Brutus|  from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance— Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished. — T.L. I.58. and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.     In another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mothers side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of  |Lucius_Tarquinius_Priscus|Lucius_Tarquinius_Priscus| , the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his fathers side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment. D.H. IV.68.        Collatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger, D.H. IV.70. he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.     He passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livys version is: T.L. I.59.     By this blood—most pure before the outrage wrought by the kings son—I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.                The newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse to the  |Roman_Forum|Roman_Forum|  and arriving there heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army. Brutus urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes. The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.     Brutus happened to be Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, but one which as a magistracy gave him the theoretical power to summon the  |curiae|Curiae| , an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to harangue them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.     He began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He leveled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the kings tyranny, the forced labor of the  |plebeians|Plebeians|  in the ditches and sewers of Rome. He pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of  |Servius_Tullius|Servius_Tullius| , his wifes father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents. The kings wife,  |Tullia|Tullia| , was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.     Brutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many  |patricians|Patrician|  spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an  |interrex|Interrex|  to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They had decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.     A final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began: D.H. IV.78.          A general election was held. The vote was for the republic. The monarchy was at an end, even while Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.     The constitutional consequences of this event were, formally at least, to reverberate for more than two thousand years. Rome would never again have a hereditary king, even if  |later_emperors|Roman_Empire|  were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  and  |Octavian_Augustus|Octavian_Augustus|  from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several  |republican_offices|Roman_Republic|  onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their  |successors|Roman_Emperor|  both in  |Rome|Western_Roman_Empire|  and in  |Constantinople|Byzantine_Emperor|  adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and even the office of German  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  remained typically elective rather than hereditary—up to its abolition in the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , 2314 years later.          Hearing of the doings at Rome, the king, his sons and a party of retainers rode posthaste for the city, leaving Titus Herminius and Marcus Horatius in command of the troops at Ardea. The gates of Rome being barred and armed men on the wall, they returned to camp. Meanwhile, letters had arrived from the revolutionary committee and were read to the troops by Herminius and Horatius. The men were assembled by unit for a vote, by which the revolution was confirmed. In one story the Tarquins escaped to Gabii. A 15-year truce was made with Ardea. The troops returned to Rome.     Superbus was not long in Gabii. He had to retire with his men to  |Tarquinii|Tarquinii| , where he raised the standard of intervention among the Etruscans. In an alternative story he went directly to Tarquinii with two of his sons; the third, Tarquin, attempted to resume control of Gabii, but was assassinated. The Romans had to face one intervention by the Etruscans  and another by the  |Latin_League|Latin_League|  . Sentiment ran high against the Tarquins. Collatinus was asked to resign over constitutional issues. He complied and was replaced by  |Publius_Valerius_Publicola|Publius_Valerius_Publicola| .             |Livys|Livy|  account in  Ab Urbe Condita Libri  is the earliest surviving full historical treatment. In his account her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his  Fasti , published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later,  |St._Augustine|Augustine_Of_Hippo|  made use of the figure of Lucretia in  The City of God  to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.     The story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages. Lucretia appears to  |Dante|Dante|  in the section of Limbo reserved to the nobles of Rome and other virtuous pagans in Canto IV of the  |Inferno|Inferno| .  |Christine_de_Pizan|Christine_De_Pizan|  used Lucretia just as St. Augustine of Hippo did in her City of Ladies, defending a womans sanctity.     It is recounted in  |Geoffrey_Chaucers|Geoffrey_Chaucer|   The Legend of Good Women ,  |John_Gowers|John_Gower|   Confessio Amantis  , and  |John_Lydgates|John_Lydgate|   Fall of Princes . Lucretias rape and suicide is also the subject of William Shakespeares 1594 long poem  The Rape of Lucrece , which draws extensively on Ovids treatment of the story; Shakespeares Poems: Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece and the Shorter Poems, ed. by Katherine Duncan Jones , Introduction, passim. he also mentioned her in  Titus Andronicus , in  As You Like It , and in  Twelfth Night  in which Malvolio authenticates his fateful letter by spotting Olivias Lucrece seal, and alludes to her in  Macbeth , and in  Cymbeline  he further refers to the story, though without mentioning Lucretia by name. Niccolò Machiavellis comedy  |La_Mandragola|The_Mandrake|  is loosely based on the Lucretia story.     She is also mentioned in the poem  |Appius_and_Virginia|Appius_And_Virginia|  by  |John_Webster|John_Webster|  and  |Thomas_Heywood|Thomas_Heywood| , which includes the following lines:           |Thomas_Heywoods|Thomas_Heywood|  play The Rape of Lucretia dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century;  |André_Obeys|André_Obey|  1931 play  was adapted by librettist  |Ronald_Duncan|Ronald_Duncan|  for  The Rape of Lucretia , a 1946 opera by  |Benjamin_Britten|Benjamin_Britten|  which premiered at Glyndebourne.  |Ernst_Krenek|Ernst_Krenek|  set  |Emmet_Laverys|Emmet_Lavery| |libretto|Libretto|   Tarquin  , a version in a contemporary setting.      |Jacques_Gallot|Jacques_Gallot|   composed the allemandes  |Lucrèce|Lucrèce|  and  |Tarquin|Tarquin|  for baroque lute.     In  |Samuel_Richardsons|Samuel_Richardson|  1740 novel  Pamela , Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet  |Sor_Juana_Inés_de_la_Cruz|Sor_Juana_Inés_De_La_Cruz|  also mentions Lucrecia in her poem Redondillas, a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.     In 1769, doctor  |Joan_Ramis|Joan_Ramis|  wrote a tragedy in  |Menorca|Menorca|  entitled Lucrecia. The play is written in the  |Catalan_language|Catalan_Language|  using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.     In 1932, the play Lucrece was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress  |Katharine_Cornell|Katharine_Cornell|  in the title part. It was mostly performed in  |pantomime|Pantomime| .     In  |Donna_Leons|Donna_Leon|  2009 Venetian novel, About Face, Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in  |Ovids|Ovid|   Fasti  to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.       Since the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including  |Titian|Titian| ,  |Rembrandt|Rembrandt| ,  |Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer| ,  |Raphael|Raphael| ,  |Botticelli|Botticelli| ,  |Jörg_Breu_the_Elder|Jörg_Breu_The_Elder| ,  |Johannes_Moreelse|Johannes_Moreelse| ,  |Artemisia_Gentileschi|Artemisia_Gentileschi| ,  |Damià_Campeny|Damià_Campeny| ,  |Eduardo_Rosales|Eduardo_Rosales| ,  |Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder|Lucas_Cranach_The_Elder| , and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.     The subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as  |Susanna|Susanna| ,  |Dido_of_Carthage|Dido_Of_Carthage| , and  |Verginia|Verginia| . Russell, Nos 1–14 These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the  |Power_of_Women|Power_Of_Women| , showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in  |Northern_Renaissance|Northern_Renaissance|  art. The story of  |Esther|Esther|  lay somewhere between these two extremes. Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16     The subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by  |Hendrick_Goltzius|Hendrick_Goltzius| , which also includes a banquet. , Story of Lucretia.     ;Examples with articles:    |Tarquin_and_Lucretia|Tarquin_And_Lucretia| — life-size image of the rape by  |Titian|Titian| |The_Story_of_Lucretia|The_Story_Of_Lucretia| —three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide    |The_Suicide_of_Lucretia|The_Suicide_Of_Lucretia| —single figure painting    |Lucretia_and_her_Husband|Lucretia_And_Her_Husband| —distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.
