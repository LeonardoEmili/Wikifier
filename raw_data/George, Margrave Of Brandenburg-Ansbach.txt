         George of Brandenburg-Ansbach  , known as George the Pious, was a  |Margrave|Margrave|  of  |Brandenburg_Ansbach|Principality_Of_Ansbach|  from the  |House_of_Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern| .             He was born in  |Ansbach|Ansbach| , the third of eight sons of Margrave  |Frederick_the_Elder|Frederick_I_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|  and his wife  |Sophia_of_Poland|Sophia_Of_Poland| , daughter of  |Casimir_IV_of_Poland|Casimir_Iv_Of_Poland|  and  |Elisabeth_of_Habsburg|Elisabeth_Of_Austria| . Through his mother, he was related to the royal court in  |Buda|Buda| . He entered the service of his uncle, King  |Vladislaus_II_of_Bohemia_and_Hungary|Vladislaus_Ii_Of_Bohemia_And_Hungary| , living at his court from 1506. The king received him as an adopted son, entrusted him in 1515 with the  |Duchy_of_Oppeln|Duchy_Of_Opole| , and in 1516 made him member of the tutelary government instituted for  |Hungary|Hungary| , and tutor of his son  |Louis_II_of_Hungary_and_Bohemia|Louis_Ii_Of_Hungary_And_Bohemia| . In 1521 he made an arrangement with  |Petar_Keglević|Petar_Keglević|  and pulled back from Hungary and Croatia; this arrangement, accepted by Louis II in 1526, was not accepted by  |Holy_Roman_Emperor_Ferdinand_I|Ferdinand_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  until 1559.       At the court of Hungary there were two parties arrayed against each other: the  |Magyar|Magyars|  party under the leadership of  |Zápolyas|Zápolya|  and the German party under the leadership of George of Brandenburg, whose authority was increased by the acquisition of the  |duchies_of_Ratibor|Duchy_Of_Racibórz|  and Oppeln by hereditary treaties with their respective dukes and of the territories of  |Oderberg|Bohumín| ,  |Beuthen|Bytom| , and  |Tarnowitz|Tarnowskie_Góry|  as pledges from the  |king_of_Bohemia|King_Of_Bohemia| , who could not redeem his debts.     By the further appropriation of the  |Duchy_of_Jägerndorf|Duchy_Of_Krnov| , George came into possession of all  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia| . As the owner and mortgagee of these territories he prepared the way for the introduction of the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , here as well as in his native  |Franconia|Franconia| . Earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the Hohenzollern line including even his younger brother  |Albert|Albert_I_Duke_Of_Prussia| , the  |Grand_Master|Hochmeister|  of the  |Teutonic_Order|Teutonic_Knights| , he turned his eyes and heart to the new faith proceeding from  |Wittenberg|Wittenberg| .       The first reformatory writings began the work of winning him over to the evangelical cause.  |Martin_Luthers|Martin_Luther|  powerful testimony of faith at the  |Diet_of_Worms|Diet_Of_Worms|  in 1521 made an indelible impression upon his mind, and the vigorous sermons of evangelical preachers in the pulpits of  |St_Lawrence|St_Lawrence|  and  |St_Sebald|St_Sebaldus_Church|  in  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg| , during the diet there in 1522, deepened the impression. The study of  |Luthers_translation|Luther_Bible|  of the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| , which appeared in 1522, established his faith on personal conviction. Moreover, he entered into correspondence with Luther, discussing with him the most important problems of faith, and in 1524 he met him personally during the negotiations concerning his brother  |Alberts|Albert_I_Duke_Of_Prussia|  secularization of the  |Teutonic_Orders_state_of_Prussia|State_Of_The_Teutonic_Order|  into the secular  |Duchy_of_Prussia|Duchy_Of_Prussia| .     After the accession of King Louis II, George was aided in his reforming efforts by  |Queen_Maria|Mary_Of_Habsburg| , a sister of  |Charles_V|Charles_V_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and  |Ferdinand_I|Ferdinand_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , who was favorably inclined toward the new doctrine. As the adviser of the young king, George firmly advocated the cause of the new gospel against the influences and intrigues of his clerical opponents and successfully prevented their violent measures. His relationship with Duke  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii_Of_Legnica|  of  |Liegnitz|Duchy_Of_Legnica| ,  |Brieg|Duchy_Of_Brzeg| , and  |Wohlau|Wołów| , and with Duke  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Duke_Of_Münsterberg_Oels|  of  |Münsterberg|Duchy_Of_Münsterberg| - |Oels|Duchy_Of_Oels| , who had both admitted the Reformation into their territories, contributed not a little to the expansion of the gospel in his own lands. But it was his own personal influence, energy, and practical spirit that introduced the new doctrine and founded a new evangelical and churchly life. He made efforts to secure preachers of the new gospel from Hungary, Silesia, and Franconia, and tried to introduce the church order of Brandenburg-Nuremberg, which had already found acceptance in the Franconian territories.       In the hereditary lands  |Brandenburg_Ansbach|Brandenburg_Ansbach|  in Franconia, where with his older brother  |Casimir|Casimir_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg_Bayreuth|  of  |Brandenburg_Kulmbach|Brandenburg_Kulmbach|  he had assumed the regency in place of their father, he encountered greater difficulties, although the popular spirit was inclined toward the Reformation. Owing to his marriage with a Bavarian princess and to his military command in the imperial service, his brother was allied more closely with the old church and resisted the new reforming efforts. But the pressure of the estates of the land soon compelled him to allow preaching according to Luthers doctrine, although he ensured retention of the old church ceremonies, even of those that were contrary to the new faith.     George protested against such half-measures and showed his dissatisfaction with the half-hearted resolutions of the state assembly of October 1526. It was only after the death of his brother that as sole ruler he could successfully undertake and carry out reformation in the Franconian territories, with the assistance of councillors such as  |Johann_von_Schwarzenberg|Johann_Von_Schwarzenberg|  and through the new resolutions of the state assembly of Brandenburg-Ansbach . At the same time George maintained his correspondence with Luther and  |Philipp_Melanchthon|Philipp_Melanchthon| , discussing such questions as the evangelization of monasteries, the use of monastic property for evangelical purposes, and especially the foundation of lower schools for the people and of higher schools for the education of talented young men for the service of church and state. He tried to gain, by his continued correspondence with Luther and other reformers such as  |Urbanus_Rhegius|Urbanus_Rhegius| , efficient men for the preaching of the gospel and for the organization of the evangelical church. Hand in hand with the Council of Nuremberg he worked for the institution of a church visitation on the model of that of the  |Electorate_of_Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony| , from which after repeated revisions and emendations the excellent  |church_order|Kirchenordnung|  of Brandenburg-Nuremberg of 1533 was developed. After its introduction in Nuremberg and his territories in Franconia, it was also introduced in his dominions in Upper Silesia.       Georges influence manifested itself also in the development of the German Reformation as a whole. When a union of the evangelicals in upper and lower Germany was contemplated as a means of improved defense against the retaliatory measures of the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| , George had a meeting with Elector  |John|John_Elector_Of_Saxony|  of  |Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony|  at  |Schleitz|Schleitz|  in 1529, where they agreed on certain articles of faith and confession to be drawn up by Luther; the commission was executed in the seventeen articles of  |Schwabach|Schwabach|  on the basis of the fifteen theses of the  |Marburg_Colloquy|Marburg_Colloquy| .     But neither at the Convention of Schwabach nor at that of  |Schmalkalden|Schmalkalden|  did George approve armed resistance against the emperor and his party, even in self-defense. He opposed the emperor energetically at the  |Diet_of_Augsburg|Diet_Of_Augsburg|  in 1530, when the emperor demanded the prohibition of evangelical preaching. King Ferdinand made George the most alluring offers of Silesian possessions if he would support the emperor, but he strongly rejected them. Next to the elector of Saxony, he stands foremost among the princes who defended the reformed faith. After the death of his cousin,  |Joachim_I|Joachim_I_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| , who was a strict Romanist, he assisted his sons in the introduction of the Reformation in the territories of the  |Electorate_of_Brandenburg|Electorate_Of_Brandenburg| . He took part in the  |religious_colloquy_of_Regensburg|Religious_Colloquy_Of_Regensburg|  in 1541 where Elector  |Joachim_II|Joachim_Ii_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  made a last attempt to bridge the differences between the Romanists and evangelicals and with his nephew requested Luthers cooperation. The  |Diet_of_Regensburg|Diet_Of_Regensburg|  was the last religious meeting which he attended.     He is one of the figures on the  Prussian Homage  painting by  |Jan_Matejko|Jan_Matejko| .             George went on to marry three times: First to  |Beatrice_de_Frangepan|Beatrice_De_Frangepan|  ; the marriage produced no children.     Georges second wife was  |Hedwig_of_Münsterberg_Oels|Hedwig_Of_Münsterberg_Oels|  , daughter of  |Charles_I_of_Münsterberg_Oels|Charles_I_Duke_Of_Münsterberg_Oels| ; their marriage produced two daughters:    |Anna_Maria_of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|Anna_Maria_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|  who married  |Christoph_Duke_of_Württemberg|Christoph_Duke_Of_Württemberg|  in 1544.    |Sabina_of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|Sabina_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|  married  |John_George_Elector_of_Brandenburg|John_George_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| .     His third wife was  |Emilie_of_Saxony|Emilie_Of_Saxony|  , daughter of  |Henry_IV_Duke_of_Saxony|Henry_Iv_Duke_Of_Saxony|  and  |Catherine_of_Mecklenburg|Catherine_Of_Mecklenburg|  on August 25, 1533:    |Sophie_of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|Sophie_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|  married  |Henry_XI_of_Legnica|Henry_Xi_Of_Legnica|  on November 11, 1560.   Barbara of Brandenburg-Ansbach    |Dorothy_Catherine_of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|Dorothy_Catherine_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|  married in 1556  |Henry_V_of_Plauen|Henry_V_Burgrave_Of_Plauen| , Burgrave of  |Meissen|Meissen| .    |George_Frederick|George_Frederick_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach|  , who became Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Regent of the  |Duchy_of_Prussia|Duchy_Of_Prussia| .
