The Kordofanian languages are a geographic grouping of five language groups spoken in the  |Nuba_Mountains|Nuba_Mountains|  of the  |Kurdufan|Kurdufan| ,  |Sudan|Sudan| |Talodi–Heiban_languages|Talodi–Heiban_Languages| ,  |Lafofa_languages|Lafofa_Languages| ,  |Rashad_languages|Rashad_Languages| ,  |Katla_languages|Katla_Languages|  and  |Kadu_languages|Kadu_Languages| . The first four groups are branches of the  |Niger–Congo|Niger–Congo_Languages|  family, whereas Kadu is now widely seen as a branch of the  |Nilo-Saharan|Nilo-Saharan_Languages|  family.       In 1963,  |Joseph_Greenberg|Joseph_Greenberg|  added them to the  |Niger–Congo_family|Niger–Congo_Languages| , creating his Niger–Kordofanian proposal. The Kordofanian languages have not been shown to be more distantly related than other branches of Niger–Congo, however, and they have not been shown to constitute a valid group. Today, the  |Kadu_languages|Kadu_Languages|  are excluded, and the others are usually included in Niger–Congo proper.      |Roger_Blench|Roger_Blench|  notes that the Talodi and Heiban families have the  |noun_class|Noun_Class|  systems characteristic of the  |Atlantic–Congo|Atlantic–Congo_Languages|  core of Niger–Congo but that the two Katla languages have no trace of ever having had such a system. However, the Kadu languages and some of the Rashad languages appear to have acquired noun classes as part of a  |Sprachbund|Sprachbund|  rather than having inherited them. Blench concludes that Talodi and Heiban are core Niger–Congo whereas Katla and Rashad form a peripheral branch along the lines of  |Mande|Mande_Languages| .               The Heiban languages, also called Koalib or Koalib–Moro, and the Talodi languages, also called Talodi–Masakin, are part of the  |Talodi–Heiban_group|Talodi–Heiban_Languages| .

Lafofa was for a time classified with Talodi, but appears to be a separate branch of Niger–Congo.          The number of Rashad languages, also called Tegali–Tagoi, varies among descriptions, from two , three , to eight . Tagoi has a noun-class system like the Atlantic–Congo languages, which is apparently borrowed, but Tegali does not.          The two Katla languages have no trace of ever having had a Niger–Congo-type noun-class system.          Since the work of  |Thilo_Schadeberg|Thilo_Schadeberg|  in 1981, the  |Tumtum_or_Kadu_branch|Kadu_Languages|  is now widely seen as  |Nilo-Saharan|Nilo-Saharan_Languages|.
