His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as marriage in heaven , children in heaven , time and space in heaven , the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits , the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell , the eternity of Hell , and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.       The Spiritual Combat , a written work by Lorenzo Scupoli , states that four assaults are attempted by the evil one at the hour of death. http://stjudetheapostleparish.org/pdf/books/spiritualcombat.pdfpage35 The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged , the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. In the 1990s, the Catechism of the Catholic Church defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinners self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.         The notion of purgatory is associated particularly with the Catholic Church . In the Catholic Church, all those who die in Gods grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire although it is not always called purgatory.     Anglican s of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. John Wesley , the founder of Methodism , believed in an intermediate state between death and the resurrection of the dead and in the possibility of continuing to grow in holiness there , but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of helping by prayer any who may be in that state. Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials , quoted in and in       The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred. Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the Nicene Creed , Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner. Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that the location of ones final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative. Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply ones uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience. For instance, St. Isaac the Syrian observes that those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners ... bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability. St. Isaac the Syrian, Homily 28, In The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian, trans. Dana Miller , 141. In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God. Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus judgment in John 3:19–21 as their model: 19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God. As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. Thomas Hopko writes, is precisely the presence of Gods mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives... . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be all and in all, with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in Gods gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain. Fr. Thomas Hopko, Foreword, in The Orthodox Church, Sergius Bulgakov , xiii.     Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ": null
    },
    {
        "apokatastasis": "Apokatastasis"
    },
    {
        ", or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by Origen , but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including Gregory of Nyssa . The Second Council of Constantinople affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origens brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesnt teach. It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as Olivier Clément , Metropolitan Kallistos Ware , and Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev . Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a theologoumena , it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection. As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved, Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church , 262. as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.         fram   Joseph F. Smith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or hell where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World . They believe that Christ visited spirit prison and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the Harrowing of Hell doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths. Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned permanently to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived – Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial. Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.     The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where the righteous can live eternally with their families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to True to the Faith , The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have received the testimony of Jesus and been made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood . To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins.       Jehovahs Witnesses occasionally use terms such as afterlife to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand Ecclesiastes 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul. Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the Great Flood or at Armageddon , are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of both righteous and unrighteous dead . Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise. After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death .       The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God a living soul. Like Jehovahs Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. . Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is immortal . Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus second coming. Until then, all those who have died are asleep . When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever. White, E.G. . The great controversy.

This ultimate goal is recited in one of the most prominent verses in Quraan, the first Sura in the Quraan, named Alfateha in the 5th verse Ehdina al serata al mostaqeem meaning guide us to the straight path , and the following verses follows describing this path as The way of those on whom you have bestowed your grace, not the way of those who earned your anger, nor of those who went astray .     In the Quran, Allah gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife , and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with Him.     Islam teaches that the purpose of Mans entire creation is to worship God alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life, including animals, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individuals ultimate abode, be it Hell or Paradise in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.     Jannah and Jahannam both have different levels. Jannah has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. Jahannam possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting places during Judgment Day , which commences after the Angel Israfil blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be judged by God and assigned between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.     In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.     A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will come to an end and God will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.     Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.     The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body .     On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by God according to their deeds. Ones eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.       Ahmadi believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad , the founder of Ahmadiyya religion, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an embryonic soul begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of ones own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.       The Sufi scholar Ibn Arabi defined Barzakh as the intermediate realm or isthmus. It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, is anything that separates two things . It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.             Sheol , in the Hebrew Bible , is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.     The inhabitants of Sheol are the shades , entities without personality or strength. Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the Witch of Endor contacts the shade of Samuel for Saul , but such practices are forbidden .     While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the Second Temple period a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone. When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek in ancient Alexandria around 200 BC, the word Hades was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the New Testament where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the evil it represents.       The Talmud offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the Olam Haba or world to come . Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a re-schooling , with the soul gaining wisdom as ones errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of eternal damnation , so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.     Maimonides describes the Olam Haba in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the Messianic era . According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was housed during its earthly existence.     The Zohar describes Gehenna not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.       Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings, Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.     Shraga Simmons commented that within the Bible itself, the idea is intimated in Deut. 25:5–10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.     Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism . The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. Onkelos , a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, Let Reuben live and not die  ... to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, Nachmanides , attributed Jobs suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Jobs saying God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to  ... the light of the living .

Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. Martin Buber s early collection of stories of the Baal Shem Tov s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives. Martin Buber, Legende des Baalschem in Die Chassidischen Bücher, Hellerau 1928, especially Die niedergestiegene Seele     Among well known rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are Saadia Gaon , David Kimhi , Hasdai Crescas , Yedayah Bedershi , Joseph Albo , Abraham ibn Daud , the Rosh and Leon de Modena . Saadia Gaon, in Emunoth ve-Deoth concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of metempsychosis . While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.     Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, Abraham Isaac Kook , Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter, and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban , Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

        ", The Gates of Reincarnation , is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.     Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute notes that Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews.                 Buddhists maintain that rebirth takes place without an unchanging self or soul passing from one form to another. The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the persons actions . For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a hungry ghost or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness , compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.     Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to Theravada Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.     Pure Land Buddhism of Mahayana believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called Pure Land . It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddhas name.     In Tibetan Buddhism the Tibetan Book of the Dead explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different Buddha s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the Dharma and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.     Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition.           The Upanishads describe reincarnation  . The Bhagavad Gita , an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, Krishna says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death.

Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of narkas or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad karmas and dealt with accordingly.     Hindus also believe in karma. Karma is the accumulated sums of ones good or bad deeds. Satkarma means good deeds, vikarma means bad deeds. According to Hinduism the basic concept of karma is As you sow, you shall reap. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands.

They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.         Sikhism may have a belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However its been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhisms belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in ": null

    {
        "Guru Granth Sahib": "Guru Granth Sahib"

    {
        ", but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.     Also it has been noted by many scholars that the Guru Granth Sahib includes poetic renditions from multiple saints and religious traditions like that of Kabir , Farid and Ramananda . The essential doctrine is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles. http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf     But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in Guru Granth Sahib and in ": null

    {
        ", so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.         Traditional African religion s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. Hunter-gatherer societies such as the Hadza have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence. Ancestor cults are found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa , including cultures like the Yombe , Beng , Yoruba and Ewe , e belief that the dead come back into life and are reborn into their families is given concrete expression in the personal names that are given to children....What is reincarnated are some of the dominant characteristics of the ancestor and not his soul. For each soul remains distinct and each birth represents a new soul. The Yoruba, Dogon and LoDagoa have eschatological ideas similar to Abrahamic religions, but in most African societies, there is a marked absence of such clear-cut notions of heaven and hell, although there are notions of God judging the soul after death. In some societies like the Mende , multiple beliefs coexist. The Mende believe that people die twice: once during the process of joining the secret society , and again during biological death after which they become ancestors. However, some Mende also believe that after people are created by God they live ten consecutive lives, each in progressively descending worlds. One cross-cultural theme is that the ancestors are part of the world of the living, interacting with it regularly.         It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a Buddhist funeral at the time of death.

This yomi very closely resembles the Greek Hades ; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even Elysium -like descriptions such as in the legend of Okuninushi and Susanoo . Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called kegare. However, death is also viewed as a path towards apotheosis in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor Ojin who was enshrined as Hachiman the God of War after his death.       Some Unitarian Universalist s believe in universalism : that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell. Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue. Mark W. Harris . The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism. p. 147 Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife. Robyn E. Lebron . Searching for Spiritual Unity  ... Can There Be Common Ground? p. 582,       According to Edgar Cayce , the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercurys realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the souls ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.     Mainstream Spiritualist s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayces nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of soulfulness and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.       The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as The Summerland . Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.
