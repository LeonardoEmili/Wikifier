Compositions from this phase include  Kreuzspiel  , the  Klavierstücke I–IV  , and the first versions of  Punkte  and Kontra-Punkte . However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition , that of group composition , found in Stockhausens works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career . This principle was first publicly described by Stockhausen in a radio talk from December 1955, titled Gruppenkomposition:  Klavierstück I  .

His position as the leading German composer of his generation  was established with Gesang der Jünglinge and three concurrently composed pieces in different media:  Zeitmaße  for five woodwinds, Gruppen for three orchestras, and  Klavierstück XI  . The principles underlying the latter three compositions are presented in Stockhausens best-known theoretical article, . . . wie die Zeit vergeht . . . , first published in 1957 in vol. 3 of  Die Reihe  .     His work with electronic music and its utter fixity led him to explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance may determine certain aspects of a composition. He called this variable form . In other cases, a work may be presented from a number of different perspectives. In  Zyklus  , for example, he began using ": null

In the summer of 1968, Stockhausen met with Bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the centre, surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different latitudes around the interior walls of the sphere .     Although Stockhausen and Pienes planned multimedia project, titled Hinab-Hinauf, was developed in detail , the World Fair committee rejected their concept as too extravagant and instead asked Stockhausen to present daily five-hour programs of his music . Stockhausens works were performed for 5½ hours every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners . According to Stockhausens biographer, Michael Kurtz, Many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general hubbub, and after a while it became one of the main attractions of Expo 1970 .
