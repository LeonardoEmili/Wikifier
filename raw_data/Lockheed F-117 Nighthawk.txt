                   The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk is a retired American single-seat,  |twin_engine|Twinjet| |_stealth|Stealth_Aircraft| |_attack_aircraft|Attack_Aircraft|  that was developed by  |Lockheeds|Lockheed_Corporation|  secretive  |Skunk_Works|Skunk_Works|  division and operated by the  |United_States_Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force|  . The F-117 was based on the  Have Blue  technology demonstrator.     The Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft to be designed around  |stealth_technology|Stealth_Technology| . Its  |maiden_flight|Maiden_Flight|  took place in 1981 at  |Groom_Lake_Nevada|Groom_Lake_Nevada| , and the aircraft achieved  |initial_operating_capability|Initial_Operating_Capability|  status in 1983. The Nighthawk was shrouded in secrecy until it was revealed to the public in 1988. Of the 64 F-117s built, 59 were production versions, with the other five being prototypes.     The F-117 was widely publicized for its role in the Persian  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War|  of 1991. Although it was commonly referred to as the Stealth Fighter , it was strictly a ground-attack aircraft. F-117s took part in the conflict in  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslav_Wars| , where  |one_was_shot_down|1999_F_117A_Shootdown|  by a  |surface_to_air_missile|Surface_To_Air_Missile|  in 1999; it was the only Nighthawk to be lost in combat. The U.S. Air Force retired the F-117 in 2008, primarily due to the fielding of the  |F_22_Raptor|Lockheed_Martin_F_22_Raptor| .         Have Blue      In 1964,  |Pyotr_Ufimtsev|Pyotr_Ufimtsev| , a  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  mathematician, published a seminal paper titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction in the journal of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering, in which he showed that the strength of the  |radar|Radar|  return from an object is related to its edge configuration, not its size. Ufimtsev was extending theoretical work published by the German physicist  |Arnold_Sommerfeld|Arnold_Sommerfeld| . Ufimtsev demonstrated that he could calculate the  |radar_cross_section|Radar_Cross_Section|  across a wings surface and along its edge. The obvious and logical conclusion was that even a large aircraft could reduce its radar signature by exploiting this principle. However, the resulting design would make the aircraft  |aerodynamically_unstable|Relaxed_Stability| , and the state of computer technology in the early 1960s could not provide the kinds of flight computers which would later allow aircraft such as the F-117 and  |B_2_Spirit|Northrop_Grumman_B_2_Spirit|  to stay airborne. By the 1970s, when Lockheed analyst Denys Overholser found Ufimtsevs paper, computers and software had advanced significantly, and the stage was set for the development of a stealth airplane.        The F-117 was born after combat experience in the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  when increasingly sophisticated  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| |surface_to_air_missiles|Surface_To_Air_Missile|  downed heavy bombers. It was a  |black_project|Black_Project| , an ultra-secret program for much of its life: very few people in  |the_Pentagon|The_Pentagon|  knew the program even existed, until the F-117s were revealed to the public in 1988. The project began in 1975 with a model called the Hopeless Diamond . The following year, the  |Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency|Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency|  issued Lockheed Skunk Works a contract to build and test two Stealth Strike Fighters, under the code name  Have Blue  . These subscale aircraft incorporated jet engines of the  |Northrop_T_38A|Northrop_T_38_Talon| ,  |fly_by_wire|Fly_By_Wire|  systems of the  |F_16|General_Dynamics_F_16_Fighting_Falcon| , landing gear of the  |A_10|Fairchild_Republic_A_10_Thunderbolt_Ii| , and  |environmental_systems|Built_Environment|  of the  |C_130|Lockheed_C_130_Hercules| . By bringing together existing technology and components, Lockheed built two demonstrators under budget, at $35  million for both aircraft, and in record time.     The  |maiden_flight|Maiden_Flight|  of the demonstrators occurred on 1  December 1977. Although both aircraft were lost during the demonstration program, test data proved positive. The success of Have Blue led the government to increase funding for  |stealth_technology|Stealth_Technology| . Much of that increase was allocated towards the production of an operational stealth aircraft, the Lockheed F-117A, under the program code name Senior Trend .     Senior Trend  |Burbank_California|Burbank_California| . The program was led by  |Ben_Rich|Ben_Rich| , with Alan Brown as manager of the project.  Rich called on Bill Schroeder, a Lockheed mathematician, and Denys Overholser, a computer scientist, to exploit Ufimtsevs work. The three designed a computer program called Echo , which made it possible to design an airplane with flat panels, called facets, which were arranged so as to scatter over 99% of a radars signal energy painting the aircraft.     The first YF-117A, serial number 79-10780, made its maiden flight from Groom Lake , Nevada, on 18 June 1981, only 31 months after the full-scale development decision. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October 1983. The  |4450th_Tactical_Group|4450Th_Tactical_Group|  stationed at  |Nellis_AFB|Nellis_Afb| ,  |Nevada|Nevada|  were tasked with the operational development of the early F-117, and between 1981 and 1989 they used  |LTV_A_7_Corsair_IIs|Ltv_A_7_Corsair_Ii|  for training, to bring all pilots to a common flight training baseline and later as chase planes for F-117A tests.      The F-117 was secret for much of the 1980s. Many news articles discussed what they called a  |F_19|F_19|  stealth fighter, and the  |Testor_Corporation|Testor_Corporation|  produced a very inaccurate  |scale_model|Scale_Model| . When a F-117 crashed in  |Sequoia_National_Forest|Sequoia_National_Forest|  in July 1986, killing the pilot and starting a fire, the Air Force established  |restricted_airspace|Restricted_Airspace| . Armed guards prohibited entry, including firefighters, and a  |helicopter_gunship|Helicopter_Gunship|  circled the site. All F-117 debris was replaced with remains of a  |F_101A_Voodoo|F_101A_Voodoo|  crash stored at Area 51. When another fatal crash in October 1987 occurred inside Nellis, the military again provided little information to the press.     The Air Force denied the existence of the aircraft until 10 November 1988, when Assistant Secretary of Defense  |J_Daniel_Howard|J_Daniel_Howard|  displayed a grainy photograph at a Pentagon press conference, disproving the many inaccurate rumors about the shape of the F-19 . After the announcement pilots could fly the F-117 during daytime and no longer needed to be associated with the A-7, flying the T-38  |supersonic|Supersonic|  trainer for travel and training instead. In April 1990, two F-117 aircraft were flown into  |Nellis_Air_Force_Base|Nellis_Air_Force_Base| , Nevada, arriving during daylight and publicly displayed to a crowd of tens of thousands. Gregos, J.  dreamlandresort.com. Retrieved: 27 April 2012.     Five Full Scale Development aircraft were built, designated YF-117A . The last of 59 production F-117s were delivered on 3 July 1990.        As the Air Force has stated, Streamlined management by Aeronautical Systems Center,  |Wright_Patterson_AFB|Wright_Patterson_Afb| ,  |Ohio|Ohio| , combined breakthrough stealth technology with concurrent development and production to rapidly field the aircraft... The F-117A program demonstrates that a stealth aircraft can be designed for reliability and maintainability.       The operational aircraft was officially designated F-117A . Most modern U.S. military aircraft use  |post_1962_designations|1962_United_States_Tri_Service_Aircraft_Designation_System|  in which the designation F is usually an  |air_to_air_fighter|Fighter_Aircraft| , B is usually a  |bomber|Bomber| , A is usually a ground-attack aircraft, etc.  The F-117 is primarily an attack aircraft,  so its F designation is inconsistent with the  |DoD|United_States_Department_Of_Defense|  system. This is an inconsistency that has been repeatedly employed by the  |U_S_Air_Force|U_S_Air_Force|  with several of its attack aircraft since the late 1950s, including the  |Republic_F_105_Thunderchief|Republic_F_105_Thunderchief|  and  |General_Dynamics_F_111_Aardvark|General_Dynamics_F_111_Aardvark| . A televised documentary quoted project manager Alan Brown as saying that  |Robert_J_Dixon|Robert_J_Dixon| , a four-star Air Force general who was the head of  |Tactical_Air_Command|Tactical_Air_Command|  felt that the top-notch USAF fighter pilots required to fly the new aircraft were more easily attracted to an aircraft with an F designation for fighter, as opposed to a bomber or attack designation.      The designation F-117 seems to indicate that it was given an official designation prior to the 1962 U.S. Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System and could be considered numerically to be a part of the earlier Century series of fighters. The assumption prior to the revealing of the aircraft to the public was that it would likely receive the  |F_19|F_19|  designation as that number had not been used. However, there were no other aircraft to receive a 100 series number following the F-111. Soviet fighters obtained by the U.S. via various means under the  |Constant_Peg|Constant_Peg|  program were given F-series numbers for their evaluation by U.S. pilots, and with the advent of the  |Teen_Series|Teen_Series|  fighters, most often  |Century_Series|Century_Series|  designations.      As with other exotic military aircraft types flying in the southern Nevada area, such as captured fighters, an arbitrary radio call of 117 was assigned. This same radio call had been used by the enigmatic  |4477th_Test_and_Evaluation_Squadron|4477Th_Test_And_Evaluation_Squadron| , also known as the Red Hats or Red Eagles , that often had flown expatriated  |MiG_jet_fighters|Mikoyanlist_Of_Mig_Aircraft|  in the area, but there was no relationship to the call and the formal F-19 designation then being considered by the Air Force. Apparently, use of the 117 radio call became commonplace and when Lockheed released its first flight manual , F-117A was the designation printed on the cover.            When the Air Force first approached Lockheed with the stealth concept, Skunk Works Director Kelly Johnson proposed a rounded design. He believed smoothly blended shapes offered the best combination of speed and stealth. However, his assistant, Ben Rich, showed that faceted-angle surfaces would provide significant reduction in radar signature, and the necessary aerodynamic control could be provided with computer units. A May 1975 Skunk Works report, Progress Report No. 2, High Stealth Conceptual Studies , showed the rounded concept that was rejected in favor of the flat-sided approach.      The resulting unusual design surprised and puzzled experienced pilots; a  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  pilot, who flew it as an  |exchange_officer|Exchange_Officer|  while it was still a secret project, stated that when he first saw a photograph of the F-117, he promptly giggled and thought to this clearly cant fly.  Early stealth aircraft were designed with a focus on minimal  |radar_cross_section|Radar_Cross_Section|  rather than aerodynamic performance. Highly-stealthy aircraft like the F-117 Nighthawk are aerodynamically unstable in all three  |aircraft_principal_axes|Aircraft_Principal_Axes|  and require constant flight corrections from a  |fly_by_wire|Fly_By_Wire|  flight system to maintain controlled flight. Rich and Janos, Skunk Works, pp. 30–31, 46. It is shaped to deflect radar signals and is approximately the size of an F-15 Eagle.     The single-seat Nighthawk is powered by two non-afterburning  |General_Electric_F404|General_Electric_F404|  turbofan engines. It is  |air_refuelable|Aerial_Refueling|  and features a  |V_tail|V_Tail| . The maximum speed is  at high altitude, the max rate of climb is  per minute, and service ceiling is . Dorr, Robert F. .

The cockpit was quite spacious, with ergonomic displays and controls, but the field of view was somewhat obstructed with a large blind spot to the rear. Nijboer, Donald . Fighting Cockpits: In the Pilots Seat of Great Military Aircraft from World War I to Today, p. 210. Zenith Press. .       It has quadruple-redundant  |fly_by_wire|Fly_By_Wire|  flight controls. To lower development costs, the avionics, fly-by-wire systems, and other parts were derived from the  |General_Dynamics_F_16_Fighting_Falcon|General_Dynamics_F_16_Fighting_Falcon| ,  |McDonnell_Douglas_F_A_18_Hornet|Mcdonnell_Douglas_F_A_18_Hornet|  and  |McDonnell_Douglas_F_15E_Strike_Eagle|Mcdonnell_Douglas_F_15E_Strike_Eagle| . The parts were originally described as spares on budgets for these aircraft, to keep the F-117 project secret.        The aircraft is equipped with sophisticated navigation and attack systems integrated into a digital avionics suite. It navigates primarily by  |GPS|Global_Positioning_System|  and high-accuracy  |inertial_navigation|Inertial_Navigation| . Missions are coordinated by an automated planning system that can automatically perform all aspects of an attack mission, including weapons release. Targets are acquired by a  |thermal_imaging|Thermal_Imaging| |_infrared|Infrared|  system, slaved to a  |laser_rangefinder|Laser_Rangefinder| / |laser_designator|Laser_Designator|  that finds the range and designates targets for  |laser_guided_bombs|Laser_Guided_Bomb| . The F-117As split internal bay can carry  of ordnance. Typical weapons are a pair of  |GBU_10|Gbu_10| ,  |GBU_12|Gbu_12| , or  |GBU_27|Gbu_27|  laser-guided bombs, two  |BLU_109|Blu_109|  penetration bombs, or two Joint Direct Attack Munitions , a GPS/INS guided stand-off bomb.            The F-117 has a  |radar_cross_section|Radar_Cross_Section|  of about . Among the penalties for stealth are lower engine thrust due to losses in the inlet and outlet, a very low wing  |aspect_ratio|Aspect_Ratio| , and a high  |sweep_angle|Sweep_Angle|  needed to deflect incoming radar waves to the sides. With these design considerations and no  |afterburner|Afterburner| , the F-117 is limited to subsonic speeds.     The F-117A carries no radar, which lowers emissions and cross-section, and whether it carries any radar detection equipment is classified.     The F-117As  |faceted|Faceting|  shape resulted from the limitations of the 1970s-era computer technology used to calculate its radar cross-section. Later  |supercomputers|Supercomputer|  made it possible for subsequent aircraft like the  |B_2_bomber|B_2_Bomber|  to use curved surfaces while maintaining stealth, through the use of far more computational resources to perform the additional calculations.     An exhaust plume contributes a significant  |infrared_signature|Infrared_Signature| . The F-117 reduces IR signature with a non-circular  |tail_pipe|Exhaust_System|  to minimize the exhaust cross-sectional volume and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air. The F-117 lacks  |afterburners|Afterburner| , because the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature, and breaking the  |sound_barrier|Sound_Barrier|  would produce an obvious  |sonic_boom|Sonic_Boom| , as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, its performance in  |air_combat_maneuvering|Air_Combat_Maneuvering|  required in a  |dogfight|Dogfight|  would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft. This was unimportant in the case of this aircraft since it was designed to be a bomber.      |Passive_radar|Passive_Radar| ,  |bistatic_radar|Bistatic_Radar|   and especially  |multistatic_radar|Multistatic_Radar|  systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional  |monostatic_radars|Monostatic_Radar| , since first-generation stealth technology reflects energy away from the transmitters  |line_of_sight|Line_Of_Sight_Propagation| , effectively increasing the  |radar_cross_section|Radar_Cross_Section|  in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.            During the programs early years, from 1984 to mid-1992, the F-117A fleet was based at  |Tonopah_Test_Range_Airport|Tonopah_Test_Range_Airport| ,  |Nevada|Nevada| , where it served under the 4450th Tactical Group. Because the F-117 was classified during this time, the unit was officially located at  |Nellis_Air_Force_Base|Nellis_Air_Force_Base| , Nevada, and equipped with  |A_7_Corsair_II|A_7_Corsair_Ii|  aircraft. All military personnel were permanently assigned to Nellis AFB, and most personnel and their families lived in Las Vegas. This required commercial air and trucking to transport personnel between Las Vegas and Tonopah each week. The 4450th was absorbed by the  |37th_Tactical_Fighter_Wing|37Th_Fighter_Wing|  in 1989. In 1992, the entire fleet was transferred to  |Holloman_Air_Force_Base|Holloman_Air_Force_Base| ,  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico| , under the command of the  |49th_Fighter_Wing|49Th_Fighter_Wing| . This move also eliminated the  |Key_Air|Key_Air|  and  |American_Trans_Air|American_Trans_Air|  contract flights to Tonopah, which flew 22,000 passenger trips on 300 flights from Nellis to Tonopah per month.     The F-117 reached  |initial_operating_capability|Initial_Operating_Capability|  status in 1983. The Nighthawks pilots called themselves Bandits . Each of the 558 Air Force pilots who have flown the F-117 has a Bandit number, such as Bandit 52 , that indicates the sequential order of their first flight in the F-117. Pilots told friends and families that they flew the  |Northrop_F_5|Northrop_F_5|  in  |aggressor_squadrons|Aggressor_Squadron|  against Tactical Air Command.      The F-117 has been used several times in war. Its first mission was during the  |United_States_invasion_of_Panama|United_States_Invasion_Of_Panama|  in 1989. During that invasion two F-117A Nighthawks dropped two bombs on Rio Hato airfield.     During the  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War|  in 1991, the F-117 flew approximately 1,300 sorties and scored direct hits on 1,600 high-value targets in Iraq over 6,905 flight hours.  |Leaflet_drops|Leaflet_Drop|  on Iraqi forces displayed the F-117 destroying ground targets and warned Escape now and save yourselves . Initial claims of its effectiveness were later found to be overstated. For instance it was claimed that the F-117 made up 2.5% of  |Coalition|Coalition_Of_The_Gulf_War|  tactical aircraft in Iraq and they attacked more than 40% of the strategic targets; this ignored the fact that only 229 Coalition aircraft could drop and designate laser-guided bombs of which 36 F-117 represented 15.7%, and only the USAF had the I-2000 bombs intended for hardened targets, so the F-117 represented 32% of all coalition aircraft that could deliver such bombs.  Initial reports of F-117s hitting 80% of their targets were later scaled back to 41–60% . GAO/NSIAD-97-134 p132 On the first night, they failed to hit 40% of their assigned air-defense targets, including the Air Defense Operations Center in Baghdad, and 8 such targets remained functional out of 10 that could be assessed. GAO/NSIAD-97-134 pp. 136–37 In their Desert Storm white paper, the USAF claimed that the F-117 was the only airplane that the planners dared risk over downtown Baghdad and that this area was particularly well defended. GAO/NSIAD-97-134 pp. 137–38. Dozens of F-16s were routinely tasked to attack Baghdad in the first few days of the war. In fact, most of the air defenses were on the outskirts of the city and many other aircraft hit targets in the downtown area, with minimal casualties when they attacked at night like the F-117. This meant they avoided the optically aimed  |AAA|Anti_Aircraft_Cannonaa_Warfare_Systems|  and infra-red  |SAMs|Surface_To_Air_Missile|  which were the biggest threat to Coalition aircraft. GAO/NSIAD-97-134 p. 105     The aircraft was operated in secret from Tonopah for almost a decade, but after the Gulf War the aircraft moved to Holloman in 1992—however, its integration with the USAFs non-stealth iron jets occurred slowly. As one senior F-117A pilot later said: Because of ongoing secrecy others continued to see the aircraft as none of their business, a stand-alone system . The F-117A and the men and women of the 49th Fighter Wing were deployed to Southwest Asia on multiple occasions. On their first deployment, with the aid of aerial refueling, pilots flew non-stop from Holloman to Kuwait, a flight of approximately 18.5 hours—a record for single-seat fighters that stands today.               One F-117 was lost to enemy action. It was downed during a mission against the  |Army_of_Yugoslavia|Army_Of_Yugoslavia|  on 27 March 1999, during  |Operation_Allied_Force|1999_Nato_Bombing_Of_Yugoslavia| . The aircraft was acquired by a fire control radar at a distance of 13  km and an altitude of 8  km: SA-3s were then launched by a Yugoslav version of the Soviet  |Isayev_S_125_Neva_|S_125_Neva_Pechora|  anti-aircraft missile system. The launcher was run by the 3rd Battalion of the  |250th_Air_Defence_Missile_Brigade|250Th_Air_Defence_Missile_Brigade|  under the command of Colonel  |Zoltán_Dani|Zoltán_Dani| .     After the explosion, the aircraft became uncontrollable, forcing the pilot to eject. The pilot was recovered six hours later by a  |United_States_Air_Force_Pararescue|United_States_Air_Force_Pararescue|  team.  The stealth technology from the downed F-117 may have been acquired by Russia and China, but the United States did not destroy the wreckage because its technology was two decades old.     Some American sources state that a second F-117A was damaged during the same campaign, allegedly on 30 April 1999; the aircraft returned to base, but it supposedly never flew again.          Use of the aircraft as part of  |Operation_Allied_Force|Nato_Bombing_Of_Yugoslavia|  continued, and it was later used in the  |Operation_Enduring_Freedom|Operation_Enduring_Freedom|  in 2001 and  |Operation_Iraqi_Freedom|Iraq_War|  in 2003. It was operated by the U.S. Air Force.     The loss in Serbia caused the USAF to create a subsection of their existing weapons school to improve tactics. More training was done with other units, and the F-117A began to participate in  |Red_Flag_exercises|Exercise_Red_Flag| . Though advanced for its time, the F-117s stealthy faceted airframe required a large amount of maintenance and was eventually superseded by streamlined shapes produced with  |computer_aided_design|Computer_Aided_Design| . Other weapon systems began to take on the F-117s roles, such as the  |F_22_Raptor|Lockheed_Martin_F_22_Raptor|  gaining ability to drop guided bombs. Miller, Jay. Lockheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor, Stealth Fighter, p. 44. Aerofax, 2005.  By 2005, the aircraft was used only for certain missions, such as if a pilot needed to verify that the correct target had been hit, or when minimal  |collateral_damage|Collateral_Damage|  was vital.     The Air Force had once planned to retire the F-117 in 2011, but Program Budget Decision 720 , dated 28 December 2005, proposed retiring it by October 2008 to free up an estimated $1.07  billion to buy more F-22s. PBD 720 called for 10 F-117s to be retired in FY2007 and the remaining 42 in FY2008, stating that other Air Force planes and missiles could stealthily deliver precision ordnance, including the  |B_2_Spirit|Northrop_Grumman_B_2_Spirit| , F-22 and  |JASSM|Agm_158_Jassm| . The planned introduction of the multirole  |F_35_Lightning_II|Lockheed_Martin_F_35_Lightning_Ii|  also contributed to the retirement decision.     In late 2006, the Air Force closed the F-117 formal training unit , and announced the retirement of the F-117. The first six aircraft to be retired took their last flight on 12 March 2007 after a ceremony at Holloman AFB to commemorate the aircrafts career.  |Brigadier_General|Brigadier_General| |_David_L_Goldfein|David_L_Goldfein| , commander of the  |49th_Fighter_Wing|49Th_Fighter_Wing| , said at the ceremony, With the launch of these great aircraft today, the circle comes to a close—their service to our nations defense fulfilled, their mission accomplished and a job well done. We send them today to their final resting place—a home they are intimately familiar with—their first, and only, home outside of Holloman.        Unlike most other Air Force aircraft that are retired to  |Davis_Monthan_AFB|Davis_Monthan_Afb|  for scrapping, or dispersal to museums, most of the F-117s were placed in Type 1000 storage According to a statement by the United States Air Force, Aircraft in Type-1000 storage are to be maintained until recalled to active service, should the need arise. Type 1000 aircraft are termed inviolate, meaning they have a high potential to return to flying status and no parts may be removed from them. These aircraft are re-preserved every four years. in their original hangars at the  |Tonopah_Test_Range_Airport|Tonopah_Test_Range_Airport| . At Tonopah, their wings were removed and the aircraft are stored in their original climate-controlled hangars. The decommissioning occurred in eight phases, with the operational aircraft retired to Tonopah in seven waves from 13 March 2007 until the last waves arrival on 22 April 2008. Four aircraft were kept flying beyond April by the  |410th_Flight_Test_Squadron|410Th_Flight_Test_Squadron|  at Palmdale for flight test. By August, two were remaining. The last F-117 left Palmdale to fly to Tonopah on 11 August 2008. With the last aircraft retired, the 410th was inactivated in a ceremony on 1 August 2008.     Five aircraft were placed in museums, including the first four YF-117As and some remains of the F-117 shot down over Serbia. Through 2009, one F-117 had been scrapped; AF Serial No. 79-0784 was scrapped at the Palmdale test facility on 26 April 2008. It was the last F-117 at Palmdale and was scrapped to test an effective method for destroying F-117 airframes.     Congress had ordered that all F-117s mothballed from 30 September 2006 onwards were to be maintained in a condition that would allow recall of that aircraft to future service as part of the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act. By April 2016, lawmakers appeared ready to remove the requirement that certain F-117 aircraft be maintained in a condition that would allow recall of those aircraft to future service , which would move them from storage to the aerospace maintenance and regeneration yard in Arizona to be scavenged for hard-to-find parts, or completely disassembled. . Flightglobal.com, 27 April 2016. On 11 September 2017, it was reported that in accordance with the  |National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2017|National_Defense_Authorization_Act_For_Fiscal_Year_2017| , signed into law on 23 December 2016, the Air Force will remove four F-117s every year to fully divest them—a process known as demilitarizing aircraft .      Although officially retired, the F-117 fleet remains intact and photos show the aircraft carefully mothballed. Some of the aircraft are flown periodically,  A Real Retirement for the Nighthawk, Air Force Magazine and have been spotted flying as recently as February 2019.    In March 2019, it was reported that four F-117s had been secretly deployed to the Middle East in 2016 and that one had to make an emergency landing at Ali Al Salem , Kuwait sometime late that year.   An F-117 was also photographed in 2019 carrying unit markings previously unassociated with the aircraft – a band on the tail bearing the name Dark Knights, suggesting an either official or unofficial squadron is maintaining the Nighthawks.  In July 2019, one Nighthawk was spotted flying above  |Death_Valley|Death_Valley| , trailing behind a  |KC_135R_Stratotanker|Kc_135R_Stratotanker|  in a hybrid aggressor scheme.            The  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  tested the F-117 in 1984 but determined it was not suitable for  |carrier|Aircraft_Carrier|  use.  In the early 1990s, Lockheed proposed an upgraded, carrier-capable variant of the F-117 dubbed the Seahawk to the Navy as an alternative to the canceled A/F-X program. The unsolicited proposal was received poorly by the Department of Defense, which had little interest in the single mission capabilities of such an aircraft, particularly as it would take money away from the Joint Advanced Strike Technology program, which evolved into the  |Joint_Strike_Fighter|Joint_Strike_Fighter| . The new aircraft would have differed from the land-based F-117 in several ways, including the addition of elevators, a bubble canopy, a less sharply swept wing and reconfigured tail . The N variant would also be re-engined to use  |General_Electric_F414|General_Electric_F414|  turbofans instead of the older  |General_Electric_F404s|General_Electric_F404| . The aircraft would be optionally fitted with hardpoints, allowing for an additional  of payload, and a new ground-attack radar with air-to-air capability. In that role the F-117N could carry  |AIM_120_AMRAAM|Aim_120_Amraam|  air-to-air missiles.       After being rebuffed by the Navy, Lockheed submitted an updated proposal that included afterburning capability and a larger emphasis on the F-117N as a multi-mission aircraft, rather than just an attack aircraft. To boost interest, Lockheed also proposed an F-117B land-based variant that shared most of the F-117N capabilities. This variant was proposed to the USAF and the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force| . Several RAF exchange officers flew the F-117 during its service, two RAF pilots formally evaluated the aircraft in 1986 as a reward for British help with the  |American_bombing_of_Libya|1986_United_States_Bombing_Of_Libya|  that year, and the British declined an offer during the  |Reagan_administration|Presidency_Of_Ronald_Reagan|  to purchase the aircraft.  This renewed F-117N proposal was also known as the A/F-117X. Neither the F-117N nor the F-117B were ordered.

It was repainted to resemble the first F-117A used to drop weapons in combat. This aircraft was used for acoustics and navigation system testing. While wearing a flag painted on its bottom surface, this aircraft revealed the types existence to high-ranking officials at  |Groom_Lake|Groom_Lake|  on 14 December 1983, the first semi-public unveiling of the aircraft.

The aircrafts official name is Night Hawk , however the alternative form Nighthawk is frequently used.     As it prioritized stealth over aerodynamics, it earned the nickname Wobblin Goblin due to its alleged instability at low speeds. However, F-117 pilots have stated the nickname is undeserved. Wobblin Goblin is likely a holdover from the early Have Blue / Senior Trend days of the project when instability was a problem. In the USAF, Goblin persists as a nickname because of the aircrafts appearance. During  |Operation_Desert_Storm|Gulf_War| , Saudis dubbed the aircraft Shaba , which is Arabic for Ghost .  Some pilots also called the airplane the Stinkbug .
