   Joachim I Nestor was a  |Prince_elector|Prince_Elector|  of the  |Margraviate_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg|  , the fifth member of the  |House_of_Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern| . His nickname was taken from King  |Nestor|Nestor|  of  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| .       The eldest son of  |John_Cicero_Elector_of_Brandenburg|John_Cicero_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| , Joachim received an excellent education under the supervision of  |Dietrich_von_Bülow|Dietrich_Von_Bülow| ,  |Bishop_of_Lebus|Bishop_Of_Lebus|  and Chancellor of Frankfurt University. He became  |Elector_of_Brandenburg|Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  upon his fathers death in January 1499, and soon afterwards married  |Elizabeth_of_Denmark|Elizabeth_Of_Denmark_Norway_And_Sweden| , daughter of King  |John|John_Of_Denmark_Norway_And_Sweden|  of  |Denmark|Denmark| . They had five children:      |Joachim_II_Hektor|Joachim_Ii_Hector_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| |_Anna|Anna_Of_Brandenburg_Duchess_Of_Mecklenburg|  married  |Albert_VII_Duke_of_Mecklenburg_Güstrow|Albert_Vii_Duke_Of_Mecklenburg_Güstrow| |_Elisabeth|Elisabeth_Of_Brandenburg_Duchess_Of_Brunswick_Calenberg_Göttingen| |_Margaret|Margaret_Of_Brandenburg|  , married on 23 January 1530  |George_I_Duke_of_Pomerania|George_I_Duke_Of_Pomerania|  and after his death in 1534  |John_V_Prince_of_Anhalt_Zerbst|John_V_Prince_Of_Anhalt_Zerbst| .    |John|John_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg_Küstrin|      Joachim took some part in the political complications of the Scandinavian kingdoms, but the early years of his reign were mainly spent in the administration of his electorate, where he succeeded in restoring some degree of order through stern measures. He also improved the administration of justice, aided the development of commerce, and was sympathetic to the needs to the towns. On the approach of the  |imperial|Holy_Roman_Empire|  election of 1519, Joachims vote was eagerly solicited by the partisans of King  |Francis_I_of_France|Francis_I_Of_France| , and  |Charles_of_Burgundy|Charles_V_Holy_Roman_Emperor| . Having treated with both parties, and received lavish promises from them, he appears to have hoped to be Emperor himself; but when the election came, he turned to the winning side and voted for Charles. In spite of this, relations between the Emperor and the Elector were not friendly, and during the next few years Joachim was frequently in communication with Charles enemies.     In the course of  |Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern|  power politics Joachim Nestor and his brother managed to get the latter,  |Albert_of_Mainz|Albert_Of_Mainz| , first onto the  |sees|Episcopal_See|  of  |Magdeburg|Archbishopric_Of_Magdeburg|  and then its suffragan of  |Halberstadt|Prince_Bishopric_Of_Halberstadt| , both  |prince_bishoprics|Prince_Bishopric|  also comprising princely territories. Since prince-episcopal sees were so influential, competing candidates usually ran for them. A candidature could turn into a bribery competition, without ever knowing exactly how much competitors paid to obtain office. The expenditures involved, as far as they exceeded ones own potential, were usually advanced by creditors and had then to be recovered by levying dues from the subjects and parishioners in the prince-bishoprics and  |dioceses|Diocese|  that were just acquired. The acquisition in 1514 of the very influential  |Prince_Archbishopric_Electorate_of_Mainz|Electorate_Of_Mainz|  for Albert was a coup that provided the Hohenzollerns with control over two of the seven electoral votes in imperial elections and many suffragan dioceses to levy dues.     According to  |canon_law|Canon_Law| , Albert was too young to hold such a position and since he would not give up the archiepiscopal see of Magdeburg , the Hohenzollerns had to dispense ever greater briberies at the  |Holy_See|Holy_See| . This exhausted their means and caused them to incur vast debts with the  |Fuggers|Fugger| .     To assist in the recovery of the enormous expenditures employed to assist Albert, mediators stipulated with the Holy See that  |the_pope|Leo_X|  would allow Albert to sell  |indulgences|Indulgence|  to the believers in his archdioceses and their  |suffragans|Suffragan| . The sales proceeds had to cover the amortisation and servicing of the debts; a share for the Holy See, for allowing this exploitation of the believers; the expenditure paid from the Hohenzollerns own pockets; and the charges involved with the sales. Fuggers accountants and preachers were travelling together from parish to parish. The preachers would sufficiently frighten the parishioners with the tortures of the  |purgatory|Purgatory| , so that they would spend their scarce money for buying a reduction of years in the repurgatory - a so-called indulgence - for themselves, living and dead family and friends.     The neighbouring  |Electorate_of_Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony|  also bid for the See of Mainz, but failed to secure it. The Saxon elector  |Frederick_the_Wise|Frederick_The_Wise|  had debts of his own as a result, but no see to show for it and no privilege to sell indulgences to recover his expenditures. Frustrated, he forbade the sale of indulgences in his electorate and allowed  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  to polemicize against them.     Joachim Nestor, in contrast, became known as a pugnacious adherent of  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic_Church|  orthodoxy who needed the sales of indulgences and the necessary intimidation of the believers in order to recover his expenditures. Joachim Nestors brother,  |Archbishop|Archbishopric_Of_Mainz|  Albert, was the initial object of Luthers attack. He urged on the Emperor the need to enforce the  |Edict_of_Worms|Edict_Of_Worms| , and at several diets was prominent among the enemies of the Reformers.     A patron of learning, Joachim Nestor established the  |Viadrina_university|Viadrina_European_University|  of  |Frankfurt_|Frankfurt|  in 1506. He promoted  |Georg_von_Blumenthal|Georg_Von_Blumenthal| , the Pillar of Catholicism , as Chancellor of Frankfurt University, Bishop of Lebus and a Privy Counsellor. He was among those who met at  |Dessau|Dessau|  in July 1525 and was a member of the league established at  |Halle|Halle_Saxony_Anhalt|  in November 1533. But his wife, against his will, like her brother King Christian of Denmark, became Lutheran, and in 1528 fled for safety to  |Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony| . He experienced the mortification of seeing Protestantism also favoured by other members of his family. He died at  |Stendal|Stendal|  in 1535.
