The Diets of Nuremberg, also called the  |Imperial_Diets|Imperial_Diet|  of  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg| , took place at different times between the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  and the 17th century.     The first Diet of Nuremberg, in 1211, elected the future emperor  |Frederick_II_of_Hohenstaufen|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  as German king.     At the Diet of 1356 the  |Emperor_Charles_IV|Charles_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  issued the  |Golden_Bull_of_1356|Golden_Bull_Of_1356| , which required each  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  to summon the first Imperial  |Diet|Diet|  after his election at Nuremberg. Apart from that, a number of other diets were held there.     Important to  |Protestantism|Protestantism|  were the Diets of 1522 , 1524 and 1532 .       This Diet has become known mostly for the reaction of the papacy to the decision made on  |Luther|Martin_Luther|  at the  |Diet_of_Worms|Diet_Of_Worms|  the previous year. The new pope,  |Adrian_VI|Adrian_Vi| , sent his nuncio  |Francesco_Chieregati|Francesco_Chieregati|  to the Diet, to insist both that the  |Edict_of_Worms|Edict_Of_Worms|  be executed, and that action be taken promptly against Luther. This demand, however, was coupled with a promise of thorough reform in the Roman hierarchy, frankly admitting the partial guilt of the Vatican in the decline of the Church.     In the recess drafted on 9 February 1523, however, the German princes rejected this appeal. Using Adrians admissions, they declared that they could not have it appear as though they wished to oppress evangelical truth and assist unchristian and evil abuses.       This Diet generally took the same line as the previous one. The Estates reiterated their decision from the previous Diet. The Cardinal-legate, Campeggio, who was present, showed his disgust at the behaviour of the Estates. On 18 April, the Estates decided to call a general gathering of the German nation, to meet at  |Speyer|Speyer|  the following year and to decide what would be done until the meeting of the general council of the Church which they demanded. This resulted in the  |Diet_of_Speyer|Diet_Of_Speyer| , which in turn was followed by the  |Diet_of_Speyer|Diet_Of_Speyer| . The latter included the  |Protestation_at_Speyer|Protestation_At_Speyer| .
