           The recorded  begins with the arrival of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  in the  |1st_century|1St_&_Nbsp;Century| , when the  |province|Roman_Province|  of  |Britannia|Roman_Britain|  reached as far north as the  |Antonine_Wall|Antonine_Wall| . North of this was  |Caledonia|Caledonia| , inhabited by the Picti, whose uprisings forced Romes legions back to  |Hadrians_Wall|Hadrians_Wall| . As Rome finally  |withdrew_from_Britain|Roman_Withdrawal_From_Britain| ,  |Gaelic|Gaels|  raiders called the  Scoti  began colonising Western Scotland and Wales. Prior to Roman times,  |prehistoric_Scotland|Prehistoric_Scotland|  entered the  |Neolithic_Era|Neolithic_Era|  about 4000  BC, the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  about 2000  BC, and the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  around 700  BC.     The Gaelic kingdom of  |Dál_Riata|Dál_Riata|  was founded on the west coast of Scotland in the 6th century. In the following century,  |Irish|History_Of_Christianity_In_Ireland|  missionaries introduced the previously  |pagan_Picts|Pictish_Religion|  to  |Celtic_Christianity|Celtic_Church| . Following  |Englands|Saxon_England| |Gregorian_mission|Gregorian_Mission| , the Pictish king  |Nechtan|Nechtan_Mac_Der-Ilei|  chose to abolish most Celtic practices in favour of the  |Roman_rite|Roman_Catholicism| , restricting Gaelic influence on his kingdom and avoiding war with  |Anglian|Anglo-Saxons| |Northumbria|Northumbria| .  Towards the end of the 8th century, the  |Viking_invasions|Viking_Invasions_Of_Scotland|  began, forcing the Picts and Gaels to cease their historic hostility to each other and to unite in the 9th century, forming the  |Kingdom_of_Scotland|Kingdom_Of_Scotland| .     The Kingdom of Scotland was united under the  |House_of_Alpin|House_Of_Alpin| , whose members fought among each other during frequent disputed successions. The last Alpin king,  |Malcolm_II|Malcolm_Ii_Of_Scotland| , died without issue in the early 11th century and the kingdom passed through his daughters son to the  |House_of_Dunkeld|House_Of_Dunkeld|  or Canmore. The last Dunkeld king,  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Scotland| , died in 1286. He left only his infant granddaughter  |Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway|Margaret,_Maid_Of_Norway|  as heir, who died herself four years later. England, under  |Edward_I|Edward_I_Of_England| , would take advantage of this questioned succession to launch a series of conquests, resulting in the  |Wars_of_Scottish_Independence|Wars_Of_Scottish_Independence| , as Scotland passed back and forth between the  |House_of_Balliol|House_Of_Balliol|  and the  |House_of_Bruce|House_Of_Bruce| . Scotlands ultimate victory confirmed Scotland as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom.     When  |King_David_II|David_Ii_Of_Scotland|  died without issue, his nephew  |Robert_II|Robert_Ii_Of_Scotland|  established the  |House_of_Stuart|House_Of_Stuart| , which would rule Scotland uncontested for the next three centuries.  |James_VI|James_I_Of_England| , Stuart king of Scotland, also inherited the throne of England in 1603, and the Stuart kings and queens ruled both independent kingdoms until the  |Acts_of_Union|Acts_Of_Union,_1707|  in 1707 merged the two kingdoms into a new state, the  |Kingdom_of_Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain| .    |Union_with_England_Act_1707|S:Act_Of_Union_1707| , Article II. Ruling until 1714,  |Queen_Anne|Anne,_Queen_Of_Great_Britain|  was the last Stuart monarch. Since 1714, the succession of the  |British_monarchs|British_Monarchs|  of the houses of  |Hanover|House_Of_Hanover|  and  |Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha|House_Of_Saxe-Coburg_And_Gotha|  has been due to their descent from  |James_VI_and_I|James_Vi_And_I|  of the House of Stuart.     During the  |Scottish_Enlightenment|Scottish_Enlightenment|  and  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , Scotland became one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Later, its  |industrial_decline|De-Industrialization|  following the Second World War was particularly acute. In recent decades Scotland has enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent  |financial_services|Financial_Services|  sector and the proceeds of  |North_Sea_oil|North_Sea_Oil|  and gas. Since the 1950s, nationalism has become a strong political topic, with serious debates on  |Scottish_independence|Scottish_Independence| , and a referendum in 2014 about leaving the British Union.                  People lived in Scotland for at least 8,500 years before Britains  |recorded_history|Recorded_History| . At times during the last  |interglacial_period|Quaternary_Glaciation|  Europe had a climate warmer than todays, and early humans may have made their way to Scotland, with the possible discovery of pre- |Ice_Age|Ice_Age|  axes on  |Orkney|Orkney|  and mainland Scotland.  Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600  BC. F. Pryor, Britain B.C.: Life in Britain and Ireland before the Romans , p. 99.  |Upper_Paleolithic|Upper_Paleolithic|  hunter-gatherer encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near  |Biggar|Biggar,_South_Lanarkshire|  to around 12000  BC.

Moffat, Before Scotland, pp. 236–37.     The  |Roman_invasion_of_Britain|Roman_Invasion_Of_Britain|  began in earnest in AD  43, leading to the establishment of the Roman province of  |Britannia|Britannia|  in the south. By the year 71, the  |Roman_governor|List_Of_Roman_Governors_Of_Britain| |Quintus_Petillius_Cerialis|Quintus_Petillius_Cerialis|  had launched an invasion of what is now Scotland. Moffat, Before Scotland, pp. 229–33. In the year 78,  |Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola|Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola|  arrived in Britain to take up his appointment as the new governor and began a series of major incursions. He is said to have pushed his armies to the estuary of the River Taus  and established forts there, including a legionary fortress at  |Inchtuthil|Inchtuthil| . After his victory over the northern tribes at  |Mons_Graupius|Mons_Graupius|  in 84, a series of forts and towers were established along the  |Gask_Ridge|Gask_Ridge| , which marked the boundary between the Lowland and Highland zones, probably forming the first Roman limes or frontier in Scotland. Agricolas successors were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. Moffat, Before Scotland, p. 245. By the year 87, the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the  |Tyne|River_Tyne|  and  |Solway_Firth|Solway_Firth| .

The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as  |Hadrians_Wall|Hadrians_Wall|  from coast to coast.     Around 141, the Romans undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new  limes  between the Firth of Forth and the  |Firth_of_Clyde|Firth_Of_Clyde| , which became the  |Antonine_Wall|Antonine_Wall| .

After the death of Severus in 210 they withdrew south to Hadrians Wall, which would be Roman frontier until it collapsed in the 5th century. Hanson, The Roman presence: brief interludes , p. 198. By the close of the Roman occupation of southern and central Britain in the 5th century, the  |Picts|Picts|  had emerged as the dominant force in northern Scotland, with the various  |Brythonic|Britons|  tribes the Romans had first encountered there occupying the southern half of the country. Roman influence on Scottish culture and history was not enduring. Moffat, Before Scotland, p. 226.             In the centuries after the departure of the Romans from Britain, there were four groups within the borders of what is now Scotland. In the east were the Picts, with kingdoms between the river Forth and Shetland. In the late 6th century the dominant force was the Kingdom of  |Fortriu|Fortriu| , whose lands were centred on  |Strathearn|Strathearn|  and  |Menteith|Menteith|  and who raided along the eastern coast into modern England. In the west were the Gaelic -speaking people of  |Dál_Riata|Dál_Riata|  with their royal fortress at  |Dunadd|Dunadd|  in Argyll, with close links with the island of Ireland, from whom comes the name Scots.

Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 78.     Scotland was largely converted to Christianity by Irish-Scots missions associated with figures such as  |St_Columba|St_Columba| , from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions tended to found  |monastic|Monastery|  institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. O.

Partly as a result of these factors, some scholars have identified a distinctive form of  |Celtic_Christianity|Celtic_Christianity| , in which  |abbots|Abbot|  were more significant than bishops, attitudes to  |clerical_celibacy|Clerical_Celibacy|  were more relaxed and there was some significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of  |tonsure|Tonsure|  and the method of  |calculating_Easter|Computus| , although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-7th century.

Corning, The Celtic and Roman Traditions: Conflict and Consensus in the Early Medieval Church .          Conversion to Christianity may have sped a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians debate whether it was a Pictish takeover of Dál Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of  |Cínaed_mac_Ailpín|Kenneth_I_Of_Scotland|  in the 840s, which brought to power the  |House_of_Alpin|House_Of_Alpin| . B.

Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish History, A.D. 500 to 1286 , vol. i, p. 395. The term Scotia was increasingly used to describe the kingdom between North of the Forth and Clyde and eventually the entire area controlled by its kings was referred to as Scotland. B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity , p. 22.        The long reign of  |Causantín|Constantine_Ii_Of_Scotland|  is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at  |Brunanburh|Brunanburh|  was followed by his retirement as a  |Culdee|Culdee|  monk at St. Andrews. A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 – 1070 , p. 128. The period between the accession of his successor  |Máel_Coluim_I|Malcolm_I_Of_Scotland|  and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda was marked by good relations with the  |Wessex|Wessex| |rulers_of_England|Kings_Of_England| , intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, Máel Coluim I annexed Strathclyde as part of a deal with King  |Edmund_of_England|Edmund_I_Of_England| , where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later 9th century, B.

Hudson, Kings of Celtic Scotland, p. 124. MacBeth ruled for seventeen years before he was overthrown by  |Máel_Coluim|Malcolm_Iii_Of_Scotland| , the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeths  |step-son|Stepfamily|  and successor Lulach to become King Máel Coluim III . J. D. Mackie, A History of Scotland , p. 43.     It was Máel Coluim III, who acquired the nickname Canmore , which he passed to his successors and who did most to create the  |Dunkeld_dynasty|House_Of_Dunkeld|  that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Particularly important was his second marriage to the Anglo-Hungarian princess  |Margaret|Saint_Margaret_Of_Scotland| . A. A. M. Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, The Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 1 , p. 119. This marriage, and raids on northern England, prompted  |William_the_Conqueror|William_I_Of_England|  to invade and Máel Coluim submitted to his authority, opening up Scotland to later claims of sovereignty by English kings. Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, p. 120. When Malcolm died in 1093, his brother  |Domnall_III|Donald_Iii_Of_Scotland|  succeeded him. However,  |William_II_of_England|William_Ii_Of_England|  backed Máel Coluims son by his first marriage,  |Donnchad|Duncan_Ii| , as a pretender to the throne and he seized power. His murder within a few months saw Domnall restored with one of Máel Coluim sons by his second marriage,  |Edmund|Edmund_Of_Scotland| , as his heir. The two ruled Scotland until two of Edmunds younger brothers returned from exile in England, again with English military backing. Victorious,  |Edgar|Edgar_Of_Scotland| , the oldest of the three, became king in 1097. Webster, Medieval Scotland, pp. 23–4. Shortly afterwards Edgar and the King of Norway,  |Magnus_Barefoot|Magnus_Iii_Of_Norway|  concluded a treaty recognising Norwegian authority over the Western Isles. In practice Norse control of the Isles was loose, with local chiefs enjoying a high degree of independence. He was succeeded by his brother  |Alexander|Alexander_I_Of_Scotland| , who reigned 1107–24. A. Forte, R. D. Oram and F. Pedersen, Viking Empires , p. 238.        When Alexander died in 1124, the crown passed to Margarets fourth son  |David_I|David_I_Of_Scotland| , who had spent most of his life as a Norman French baron in England. His reign saw what has been characterised as a  |Davidian_Revolution|Davidian_Revolution|  , by which native institutions and personnel were replaced by English and French ones, underpinning the development of later Medieval Scotland.

Members of the Anglo-Norman nobility took up places in the Scottish aristocracy and he introduced a system of  |feudal|Feudalism|  land tenure, which produced  |knight_service|Knight_Service| , castles and an available body of heavily armed cavalry. He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of  |justicar|Justicar|  to oversee justice, and local offices of  |sheriffs|Sheriffs|  to administer localities. He established the first  |royal_burghs|Royal_Burgh|  in Scotland, granting rights to particular settlements, which led to the development of the first true Scottish towns and helped facilitate economic development as did the introduction of the first recorded Scottish coinage. He continued a process begun by his mother and brothers helping to establish foundations that brought reform to Scottish monasticism based on those at  |Cluny|Cluny_Abbey|  and he played a part in organising diocese on lines closer to those in the rest of Western Europe. Webster, Medieval Scotland, pp. 29–37.     These reforms were pursued under his successors and grandchildren  |Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland|Malcolm_Iv_Of_Scotland|  and  |William_I|William_I_Of_Scotland| , with the crown now passing down the main line of descent through primogeniture, leading to the first of a series of minorities. The benefits of greater authority were reaped by Williams son  |Alexander_II|Alexander_Ii_Of_Scotland|  and his son  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Scotland| , who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following  |Haakon_Haakonarsons|Haakon_Iv_Of_Norway|  ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the  |Battle_of_Largs|Battle_Of_Largs|  with the  |Treaty_of_Perth|Treaty_Of_Perth|  in 1266.

The death of King Alexander III in 1286, and the death of his granddaughter and heir  |Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway|Margaret,_Maid_Of_Norway|  in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked  |Edward_I_of_England|Edward_I_Of_England|  to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing  |John_Balliol|John_Balliol| , the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292. R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland , p. 40.  |Robert_Bruce,_5th_Lord_of_Annandale|Robert_Bruce,_5Th_Lord_Of_Annandale| , the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.

Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 43–4. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305, he fell into the hands of the English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he owed no allegiance to England. A. Tuck, Crown and Nobility: England 1272–1461 , p. 31.

Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by  |Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V| , his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir  |James_Douglas|James_Douglas,_Lord_Of_Douglas|  and  |Thomas_Randolph|Thomas_Randolph,_1St_Earl_Of_Moray|  only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling remained under English control.

In 1320, the  |Declaration_of_Arbroath|Declaration_Of_Arbroath| , a remonstrance to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince  |Pope_John_XXII|Pope_John_Xxii|  to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotlands sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The Declaration has also been seen as one of the most important documents in the development of a Scottish national identity. M. Brown, The Wars of Scotland, 1214–1371 , p. 217.     In 1326, what may have been the first full  |Parliament_of_Scotland|Parliament_Of_Scotland|  met. The parliament had evolved from an earlier council of nobility and clergy, the colloquium, constituted around 1235, but perhaps in 1326 representatives of the  |burghs|Burgh|  – the burgh commissioners – joined them to form the  |Three_Estates|Three_Estates| .

M. H. Keen, England in the Later Middle Ages: a Political History , pp. 86–8. However, four years after Roberts death in 1329, England once more invaded on the pretext of restoring  |Edward_Balliol|Edward_Balliol| , son of John Balliol, to the Scottish throne, thus starting the Second War of Independence. Despite victories at  |Dupplin_Moor|Battle_Of_Dupplin_Moor|  and  |Halidon_Hill|Battle_Of_Halidon_Hill| , in the face of tough Scottish resistance led by  |Sir_Andrew_Murray|Sir_Andrew_Murray| , the son of Wallaces comrade in arms, successive attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in the fate of his protégé after the outbreak of the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War|  with France. In 1341,  |David_II|David_Ii_Of_Scotland| , King Roberts son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364. P. Armstrong, Otterburn 1388: Bloody Border Conflict , p. 8.                 After David IIs death,  |Robert_II|Robert_Ii_Of_Scotland| , the first of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was followed in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the  |regnal_name|Regnal_Name| |Robert_III|Robert_Iii_Of_Scotland| . During Robert IIIs reign , actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother,  |Robert_Stewart,_Duke_of_Albany|Robert_Stewart,_Duke_Of_Albany| . S. H. Rigby, A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages , pp. 301–2. After the suspicious death of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future  |James_I|James_I_Of_Scotland| , sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son  |Murdoch|Murdoch_Stewart,_Duke_Of_Albany| . When Scotland finally paid the ransom in 1424, James, aged 32, returned with his English bride determined to assert this authority. Several of the Albany family were executed; but he succeeded in centralising control in the hands of the crown, at the cost of increasing unpopularity, and was assassinated in 1437. His son  |James_II|James_Ii_Of_Scotland|  , when he came of age in 1449, continued his fathers policy of weakening the great noble families, most notably taking on the powerful  |Black_Douglas_family|House_Of_Douglas|  that had come to prominence at the time of the Bruce.     In 1468, the last significant acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when  |James_III|James_Iii_Of_Scotland|  was engaged to  |Margaret_of_Denmark|Margaret_Of_Denmark,_Queen_Of_Scotland| , receiving the  |Orkney_Islands|Orkney_Islands|  and the  |Shetland_Islands|Shetland_Islands|  in payment of her dowry.

With the death of James III in 1488 at the  |Battle_of_Sauchieburn|Battle_Of_Sauchieburn| , his successor  |James_IV|James_Iv_Of_Scotland|  successfully ended the quasi-independent rule of the  |Lord_of_the_Isles|Lord_Of_The_Isles| , bringing the Western Isles under effective Royal control for the first time. In 1503, he married  |Margaret_Tudor|Margaret_Tudor| , daughter of  |Henry_VII_of_England|Henry_Vii_Of_England| , thus laying the foundation for the 17th-century  |Union_of_the_Crowns|Union_Of_The_Crowns| .

Scotland advanced markedly in educational terms during the 15th century with the founding of the  |University_of_St_Andrews|University_Of_St_Andrews|  in 1413, the  |University_of_Glasgow|University_Of_Glasgow|  in 1450 and the  |University_of_Aberdeen|University_Of_Aberdeen|  in 1495, and with the passing of the  |Education_Act_1496|Education_Act_1496| , which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools.

James IVs reign is often considered to have seen a flowering of Scottish culture under the influence of the European  |Renaissance|Renaissance| . J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-formed, 1488–1587 , p. 117.        In 1512, the Auld Alliance was renewed and under its terms, when the French were attacked by the English under  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii_Of_England| , James IV invaded England in support. The invasion was stopped decisively at the  |Battle_of_Flodden_Field|Battle_Of_Flodden_Field|  during which the King, many of his nobles, and a large number of ordinary troops were killed, commemorated by the song  Flowers of the Forest . Once again Scotlands government lay in the hands of regents in the name of the infant  |James_V|James_V_Of_Scotland| . G. Menzies The Scottish Nation , p. 179.     James V finally managed to escape from the custody of the regents in 1528. He continued his fathers policy of subduing the rebellious  |Highlands|Scottish_Highlands| , Western and Northern isles and the troublesome borders. M. Nicholls, A History of the Modern British Isles, 1529–1603: the Two Kingdoms , pp. 82–4. He also continued the French alliance, marrying first the French noblewoman  |Madeleine_of_Valois|Madeleine_Of_Valois|  and then after her death  |Marie_of_Guise|Marie_Of_Guise| . James Vs domestic and foreign policy successes were overshadowed by another disastrous campaign against England that led to defeat at the  |Battle_of_Solway_Moss|Battle_Of_Solway_Moss|  . James died a short time later, a demise blamed by contemporaries on a broken heart . The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who would become  |Mary,_Queen_of_Scots|Mary,_Queen_Of_Scots| . M. Nicholls, A History of the Modern British Isles, 1529–1603: the Two Kingdoms , p. 87.     Once again, Scotland was in the hands of a regent. Within two years, the  |Rough_Wooing|Rough_Wooing|  began, Henry VIIIs military attempt to force a marriage between Mary and his son,  |Edward|Edward_Vi_Of_England| . This took the form of border skirmishing and several English campaigns into Scotland. In 1547, after the death of Henry VIII, forces under the English regent  |Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset|Edward_Seymour,_1St_Duke_Of_Somerset|  were victorious at the  |Battle_of_Pinkie_Cleugh|Battle_Of_Pinkie_Cleugh| , the climax of the Rough Wooing, and followed up by the occupation of  |Haddington|Siege_Of_Haddington| . Mary was then sent to France at the age of five, as the intended bride of the heir to the French throne. Her mother, Marie de Guise, stayed in Scotland to look after the interests of Mary – and of France – although the  |Earl_of_Arran|James_Hamilton,_2Nd_Earl_Of_Arran|  acted officially as regent. Dawson, Scotland Re-formed, 1488–1587 Guise responded by calling on French troops, who helped stiffen resistance to the English occupation. By 1550, after a change of regent in England, the English withdrew from Scotland completely.     From 1554, Marie de Guise, took over the regency, and continued to advance French interests in Scotland. French cultural influence resulted in a large influx of French vocabulary into  |Scots|Scots_Language| . But anti-French sentiment also grew, particularly among  |Protestants|Protestant| , who saw the English as their natural allies. In 1560, Marie de Guise died, and soon after the Auld Alliance also ended, with the signing of the  |Treaty_of_Edinburgh|Treaty_Of_Edinburgh| , which provided for the removal of French and English troops from Scotland. The  |Scottish_Reformation|Scottish_Reformation|  took place only days later when the  |Scottish_Parliament|Scottish_Reformation_Parliament|  abolished the  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  religion and outlawed the  |Mass|Mass| . Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 115–17.        Meanwhile, Queen Mary had been raised as a Catholic in France, and married to the  |Dauphin|Dauphin_Of_France| , who became king as  |Francis_II|Francis_Ii_Of_France|  in 1559, making her queen consort of France. J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 , p. 208. When Francis died in 1560, Mary, now 19, returned to Scotland to take up the government. Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary,  |David_Riccio|David_Riccio| , was followed by that of her unpopular second husband  |Lord_Darnley|Henry_Stuart,_Lord_Darnley| , and her abduction by and marriage to the  |Earl_of_Bothwell|James_Hepburn,_4Th_Earl_Of_Bothwell| , who was implicated in Darnleys murder. Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 129–33. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at  |Carberry_Hill|Battle_Of_Carberry_Hill|  and after their forces melted away, he fled and she was captured by Bothwells rivals. Mary was imprisoned in  |Loch_Leven_Castle|Loch_Leven_Castle| , and in July 1567, was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son  |James_VI|James_I_Of_England| . D. H. Willson, King James VI & I , p. 19. Mary eventually escaped and attempted to regain the throne by force. After her defeat at the  |Battle_of_Langside|Battle_Of_Langside|  in 1568, she took refuge in England, leaving her young son in the hands of regents. In Scotland the regents fought a  |civil_war|Edinburgh_Castle16Th_Century_And_The_Lang_Siege|  on behalf of James VI against his mothers supporters. In England, Mary became a focal point for Catholic conspirators and was eventually tried for treason and executed on the orders of her kinswoman Elizabeth I. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, p. 183. J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 , pp. 316–7.             During the 16th century, Scotland underwent a  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  that created a predominantly Calvinist national Kirk, which became Presbyterian in outlook and severely reduced the powers of bishops. In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  and then  |John_Calvin|John_Calvin|  began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars, often training for the priesthood, who had visited Continental universities. The Lutheran preacher  |Patrick_Hamilton|Patrick_Hamilton|  was executed for heresy in  |St._Andrews|St._Andrews|  in 1528. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 102–4. The execution of others, especially the  |Zwingli|Zwingli| -influenced  |George_Wishart|George_Wishart| , who was burnt at the stake on the orders of Cardinal Beaton in 1546, angered Protestants. Wisharts supporters assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain  |John_Knox|John_Knox| , were condemned to be galley slaves in France, stoking resentment of the French and creating martyrs for the Protestant cause. M. F. Graham, Scotland , in A. Pettegree, The Reformation World , p. 414.     Limited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves  |Lords_of_the_Congregation|Lords_Of_The_Congregation|  in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by  |Parliament_in_1560|Scottish_Reformation_Parliament| , while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 120–1.     Knox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva as a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure of the period. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. The reformed Kirk gave considerable power to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy. There were widespread, but generally orderly outbreaks of  |iconoclasm|Iconoclasm| . At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the Kirk found it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 121–33.     Women shared in the religiosity of the day. The egalitarian and emotional aspects of Calvinism appealed to men and women alike. Historian Alasdair Raffe finds that, Men and women were thought equally likely to be among the elect....Godly men valued the prayers and conversation of their female co-religionists, and this reciprocity made for loving marriages and close friendships between men and women. Furthermore, there was an increasingly intense relationship in the pious bonds between minister and his women parishioners. For the first time, laywomen gained numerous new religious roles,And took a prominent place in prayer societies. Alasdair Raffe, Female Authority and Lay Activism in Scottish   Presbyterianism, 1660–1740 in Sarah Apetrei and Hannah Smith, eds. Religion and Women in Britain, c. 1650–1760 pp 61–78.          In 1603,  |James_VI_King_of_Scots|James_Vi_Of_Scotland|  inherited the throne of the  |Kingdom_of_England|Kingdom_Of_England| , and became King James I of England, leaving  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh|  for London, uniting England and Scotland under one monarch.  The Union was a  |personal|Personal_Union|  or  |dynastic_union|Dynastic_Union| , with the  |Crowns|The_Crown|  remaining both distinct and separate—despite Jamess best efforts to create a new imperial throne of Great Britain . D. L. Smith, A History of the Modern British Isles, 1603–1707: The Double Crown , ch. 2. The acquisition of the Irish crown along with the English, facilitated a process of settlement by Scots in what was historically the most troublesome area of the kingdom in  |Ulster|Ulster| , with perhaps 50,000 Scots settling in the province by the mid-17th century. Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 175. James adopted a different approach to impose his authority in the western Highlands and Islands. The additional military resource that was now available, particularly the English navy, resulted in the enactment of the  |Statutes_of_Iona|Statutes_Of_Iona|  which compelled integration of Hebridean clan leaders with the rest of Scottish society.   Attempts to found a Scottish colony in North America in  |Nova_Scotia|Nova_Scotia|  were largely unsuccessful, with insufficient funds and willing colonists. Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 176.                    Although James had tried to get the Scottish Church to accept some of the High Church Anglicanism of his southern kingdom, he met with limited success. His son and successor,  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England| , took matters further, introducing an English-style Prayer Book into the Scottish church in 1637. This resulted in anger and widespread rioting.  J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland , p. 203. Representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the  |National_Covenant|National_Covenant|  in 1638, objecting to the Kings liturgical innovations. In November of the same year matters were taken even further, when at a meeting of the General Assembly in Glasgow the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 205–6. Charles gathered a military force; but as neither side wished to push the matter to a full military conflict, a temporary settlement was concluded at  |Pacification_of_Berwick|Berwick-Upon-Tweedenglish_Rule| . Matters remained unresolved until 1640 when, in a renewal of hostilities, Charless northern forces were defeated by the Scots at the  |Battle_of_Newburn|Battle_Of_Newburn|  to the west of Newcastle. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 208–9. During the course of these Bishops Wars Charles tried to raise an army of Irish Catholics, but was forced to back down after a storm of protest in Scotland and England. The backlash from this venture provoked a  |rebellion_in_Ireland|Irish_Rebellion_Of_1641|  and Charles was forced to appeal to the English Parliament for funds. Parliaments demands for reform in England eventually resulted in the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War| . This series of civil wars that engulfed England, Ireland and Scotland in the 1640s and 1650s is known to modern historians as the  |Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms|Wars_Of_The_Three_Kingdoms| . Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 209–10. The  |Covenanters|Covenanters|  meanwhile, were left governing Scotland, where they raised a large army of their own and tried to impose their religious settlement on  |Episcopalians|Scottish_Episcopal_Church|  and  |Roman_Catholics|Roman_Catholics|  in the north of the country. In England his religious policies caused similar resentment and he ruled without recourse to parliament from 1629. M. B. Young, Charles I , p. 73.                As the civil wars developed, the English  |Parliamentarians|Roundhead|  appealed to the Scots Covenanters for military aid against the King. A  |Solemn_League_and_Covenant|Solemn_League_And_Covenant|  was entered into, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 211–2. Scottish troops played a major part in the defeat of Charles I, notably at the  |battle_of_Marston_Moor|Battle_Of_Marston_Moor| . An army under the Earl of Leven occupied the North of England for some time. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 213–4.     However, not all Scots supported the Covenanters taking arms against their King. In 1644,  |James_Graham,_1st_Marquess_of_Montrose|James_Graham,_1St_Marquess_Of_Montrose|  attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the  |Irish_Confederates|Confederate_Ireland|  under  |Alasdair_MacDonald|Alasdair_Mac_Colla| , and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A  |Scottish_Civil_War|Scotland_In_The_Wars_Of_The_Three_Kingdoms|  began in September 1644 with his victory at  |battle_of_Tippermuir|Battle_Of_Tippermuir| . After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the  |Battle_of_Philiphaugh|Battle_Of_Philiphaugh| . Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 217–8.     The following year Charles, while he was being held captive in Carisbrooke Castle, entered into an agreement with moderate Scots Presbyterians. In this secret  |Engagement|Engagers| , the Scots promised military aid in return for the Kings agreement to implement Presbyterianism in England on a three-year trial basis. The  |Duke_of_Hamilton|Duke_Of_Hamilton|  led an invasion of England to free the King, but he was defeated by  |Oliver_Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell|  in August 1648 at the Battle of Preston. Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 225–6.                The  |execution_of_Charles_I|Execution_Of_Charles_I|  in 1649 was carried out in the face of objections by the Covenanter government and his son was immediately proclaimed as King  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  in Edinburgh. Oliver Cromwell led an invasion of Scotland in 1650, and defeated the Scottish army at  |Dunbar|Battle_Of_Dunbar|  and then defeated a Scottish invasion of England at  |Worcester|Battle_Of_Worcester|  on 3 September 1651 . Cromwell emerged as the leading figure in the English government and Scotland was occupied by an English force under  |George_Monck|George_Monck| . The country was incorporated into the Puritan-governed  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_England|  and lost its independent church government, parliament and legal system, but gained access to English markets. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 221–4. Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwells problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657 . Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 225–6.     After the death of Cromwell and the regimes collapse, Charles II was restored in 1660 and Scotland again became an independent kingdom. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 241–5. Scotland regained its system of law, parliament and kirk, but also the  |Lords_of_the_Articles|Lords_Of_The_Articles|  , bishops and a king who did not visit the country. He ruled largely without reference to Parliament, through a series of commissioners. These began with  |John,_Earl_of_Middleton|John_Middleton,_1St_Earl_Of_Middleton|  and ended with the kings brother and heir,  |James,_Duke_of_York|James_Ii_Of_England|  . Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 239. The  |English_Navigation_Acts|English_Navigation_Acts|  prevented the Scots engaging in what would have been lucrative trading with Englands colonies. W. Ferguson, Scotlands Relations with England: A Survey to 1707 , p. 153. The restoration of episcopacy was a source of trouble, particularly in the south-west of the country, an area with strong Presbyterian sympathies. Abandoning the official church, many of the inhabitants began to attend illegal field assemblies, known as  |conventicles|Conventicle| . Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 253. Official attempts to suppress these led to a rising in 1679, defeated by  |James,_Duke_of_Monmouth|James,_Duke_Of_Monmouth| , the Kings illegitimate son, at the  |Battle_of_Bothwell_Bridge|Battle_Of_Bothwell_Bridge| . Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 238. In the early 1680s a more intense phase of persecution began, later to be called  |the_Killing_Time|The_Killing_Time|  . When Charles died in 1685 and his brother, a Roman Catholic, succeeded him as  |James_VII_of_Scotland|James_Ii_Of_England| , matters came to a head. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 241.             James put Catholics in key positions in the government and attendance at conventicles was made punishable by death. He disregarded parliament, purged the Council and forced through  |religious_toleration|Religious_Toleration|  to Roman Catholics, alienating his Protestant subjects. It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of  |William_of_Orange|William_Iii_Of_England| , Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir,  |James_Francis_Edward_Stuart|James_Francis_Edward_Stuart| , it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless  |Glorious_Revolution|Glorious_Revolution|  . The Estates issued a  Claim of Right  that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power. The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops who had generally supported James. However, William, who was more tolerant than the Kirk tended to be, passed acts restoring the Episcopalian clergy excluded after the Revolution. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 252–3.     Although Williams supporters dominated the government, there remained a significant following for James, particularly in the Highlands. His cause, which became known as  |Jacobitism|Jacobitism| , from the Latin  for James, led to a series of risings. An initial Jacobite military attempt was led by  |John_Graham,_Viscount_Dundee|John_Graham,_Viscount_Dundee| . His forces, almost all Highlanders, defeated Williams forces at the  |Battle_of_Killiecrankie|Battle_Of_Killiecrankie|  in 1689, but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting. Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the  |Battle_of_Dunkeld|Battle_Of_Dunkeld| . Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 283–4. In the aftermath of the Jacobite defeat on 13 February 1692, in an incident since known as the  |Massacre_of_Glencoe|Massacre_Of_Glencoe| , 38 members of the  |Clan_MacDonald_of_Glencoe|Clan_Macdonald_Of_Glencoe|  were killed by members of the Earl of Argylls Regiment of Foot, on the grounds that they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 287–8.              The closing decade of the 17th century saw the generally favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the Restoration come to an end. There was a slump in trade with the Baltic and France from 1689 to 1691, caused by French protectionism and changes in the Scottish cattle trade, followed by four years of failed harvests , an era known as the seven ill years . Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 291–2 and 301-2. The result was severe famine and depopulation, particularly in the north. K. J. Cullen, Famine in Scotland: The Ill Years of the 1690s . The Parliament of Scotland of 1695 enacted proposals to help the desperate economic situation, including setting up the  |Bank_of_Scotland|Bank_Of_Scotland| . The  |Company_of_Scotland_Trading_to_Africa_and_the_Indies|Company_Of_Scotland|  received a charter to raise capital through public subscription. Mitchison, A History of Scotland, p. 314.          With the dream of building a lucrative overseas colony for Scotland, the Company of Scotland invested in the  |Darien_scheme|Darien_Scheme| , an ambitious plan devised by  |William_Paterson|William_Paterson|  to establish a colony on the  |Isthmus_of_Panama|Isthmus_Of_Panama|  in the hope of establishing trade with the Far East. E. Richards, Britannias Children: Emigration from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland since 1600 , p. 79. The Darién scheme won widespread support in Scotland as the landed gentry and the merchant class were in agreement in seeing overseas trade and colonialism as routes to upgrade Scotlands economy. Since the capital resources of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower classes volunteered as colonists. D. R. Hidalgo, To Get Rich for Our Homeland: The Company of Scotland and the Colonization of the Darién , Colonial Latin American Historical Review, 10 , p. 156. But the English government opposed the idea: involved in the  |War_of_the_Grand_Alliance|War_Of_The_Grand_Alliance|  from 1689 to 1697 against France, it did not want to offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of  |New_Granada|New_Kingdom_Of_Granada| . The English investors withdrew. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised 400,000 pounds in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3,000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; under attack by the Spanish from nearby  |Cartagena|Cartagena,_Colombia| ; and refused aid by the English in the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| , the colonists abandoned their project in 1700. Only 1,000 survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland.          Scotland was a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3  million in 1755. Although Scotland lost home rule, the Union allowed it to break free of a stultifying system and opened the way for the  |Scottish_enlightenment|Scottish_Enlightenment|  as well as a great expansion of trade and increase in opportunity and wealth. Edinburgh economist  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith|  concluded in 1776 that By the union with England, the middling and inferior ranks of people in Scotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy which had always before oppressed them.  Historian  |Jonathan_Israel|Jonathan_Israel|  holds that the Union proved a decisive catalyst politically and economically, by allowing ambitious Scots entry on an equal basis to a rich expanding empire and its increasing trade.      Scotlands transformation into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly in the next 150 years, following its union with England in 1707 and its integration with the advanced English and imperial economies. Henry Hamilton, An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century The transformation was led by two cities that grew rapidly after 1770.  |Glasgow|History_Of_Glasgow| , on the river Clyde, was the base for the tobacco and sugar trade with an emerging textile industry.  |Edinburgh|History_Of_Edinburgh|  was the administrative and intellectual centre where the Scottish Enlightenment was chiefly based. James Buchan, Crowded with Genius: the Scottish Enlightenment; Edinburghs Moment of the Mind .          By the start of the 18th century, a  |political_union|Political_Union|  between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing English Empire. With economic stagnation since the late 17th century, which was particularly acute in 1704, the country depended more and more heavily on sales of cattle and linen to England, who used this to create pressure for a union. T. C. Smout, The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 I: The Economic Background , Economic History Review, vol. 16, April , pp. 455–67. T. C. Smout, Scottish Trade on the Eve of the Union, 1660–1707 . The Scottish parliament voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69, to adopt the  |Treaty_of_Union|Treaty_Of_Union| . It was also a full economic union; indeed, most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as Great Britain . It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. Scottish law remained separate from English law, and the religious system was not changed. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth. H. Campbell, The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 II: The Economic Consequences , Economic History Review, April , vol. 16, pp. 468–477.             Jacobitism was revived by the unpopularity of the union. M. Pittock, Jacobitism , p. 32. In 1708, James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of James VII, who became known as The Old Pretender , attempted an invasion with a French fleet carrying 6,000 men, but the Royal Navy prevented it from landing troops. Pittock, Jacobitism, p. 33. A more serious attempt occurred in 1715, soon after the death of Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian king, the eldest son of Sophie, as  |George_I_of_Great_Britain|George_I_Of_Great_Britain| . This rising  envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales, Devon, and Scotland. However, government arrests forestalled the southern ventures. In Scotland, John Erskine,  |Earl_of_Mar|Earl_Of_Mar| , nicknamed Bobbin John, raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier. Mar captured Perth, but let a smaller government force under the  |Duke_of_Argyll|John_Campbell,_2Nd_Duke_Of_Argyll|  hold the Stirling plain. Part of Mars army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the  |Battle_of_Preston|Battle_Of_Preston| , surrendering on 14 November 1715. The day before, Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the  |Battle_of_Sheriffmuir|Battle_Of_Sheriffmuir| . At this point, James belatedly landed in Scotland, but was advised that the cause was hopeless. He fled back to France. An attempted Jacobite invasion with Spanish assistance in 1719 met with little support from the clans and ended in defeat at the  |Battle_of_Glen_Shiel|Battle_Of_Glen_Shiel| . Mitchison, A History of Scotland, pp. 269–74.     In 1745, the Jacobite rising known as The Forty-Five began.  |Charles_Edward_Stuart|Charles_Edward_Stuart| , son of the Old Pretender, often referred to as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed on the island of  |Eriskay|Eriskay|  in the  |Outer_Hebrides|Outer_Hebrides| .  |M._McLaren|Moray_Mclaren| , Bonnie Prince Charlie , pp. 39–40. Several clans unenthusiastically joined him. At the outset he was successful, taking Edinburgh McLaren, Bonnie Prince Charlie, p. 59. and then defeating the only government army in Scotland at the  |Battle_of_Prestonpans|Battle_Of_Prestonpans| . McLaren, Bonnie Prince Charlie, pp. 69–75. The Jacobite army marched into England, took Carlisle and advanced as far as south as Derby. However, it became increasingly evident that England would not support a Roman Catholic Stuart monarch. The Jacobite leadership had a crisis of confidence and they retreated to Scotland as two English armies closed in and Hanoverian troops began to return from the continent. McLaren, Bonnie Prince Charlie, pp. 98–108. Charles position in Scotland began to deteriorate as the Whig supporters rallied and regained control of Edinburgh. After an unsuccessful attempt on Stirling, he retreated north towards Inverness. He was pursued by the  |Duke_of_Cumberland|Prince_William_Augustus,_Duke_Of_Cumberland|  and gave battle with an exhausted army at  |Culloden|Battle_Of_Culloden|  on 16 April 1746, where the Jacobite cause was crushed. McLaren, Bonnie Prince Charlie, pp. 145–150. Charles hid in Scotland with the aid of Highlanders until September 1746, when he escaped back to France. McLaren, Bonnie Prince Charlie, pp. 157–62. There were bloody reprisals against his supporters and foreign powers abandoned the Jacobite cause, with the court in exile forced to leave France. The Old Pretender died in 1760 and the Young Pretender, without legitimate issue, in 1788. When his brother,  |Henry,_Cardinal_of_York|Henry_Benedict_Stuart| , died in 1807, the Jacobite cause was at an end. Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 298.          With the advent of the  |Union|Acts_Of_Union_1707|  and the demise of Jacobitism, access to London and the Empire opened up very attractive career opportunities for ambitious middle-class and upper-class Scots, who seized the chance to become entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and soldiers. T. M. Divine, The Scottish Nation , pp. 22–25. Thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent  |British_Empire|British_Empire| . Historian Neil Davidson notes that after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland . Davidson also states that far from being ‘peripheral’ to the British economy, Scotland – or more precisely, the Lowlands – lay at its core . N. Davidson, The Origins of Scottish Nationhood , pp. 94–5. British officials especially appreciated Scottish soldiers. As the Secretary of War told Parliament in 1751, I am for having always in our army as many Scottish soldiers as possible...because they are generally more hardy and less mutinous . Linda Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation 1707–1837 , p. 120. The national policy of aggressively recruiting Scots for senior civilian positions stirred up resentment among Englishmen, ranging from violent diatribes by  |John_Wilkes|John_Wilkes| , to vulgar jokes and obscene cartoons in the popular press, Colley, Britons, pp. 105–22. and the haughty ridicule by intellectuals such as  |Samuel_Johnson|Samuel_Johnson|  that was much resented by Scots. In his great Dictionary Johnson defined oats as, a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people. To which Lord Elibank retorted, Very true, and where will you find such men and such horses? William Prideaux Courtney and David Nichol Smith, A Bibliography of Samuel Johnson , p. 47.     Scottish politics in the late 18th century was dominated by the  |Whigs|Whig| , with the benign management of  |Archibald_Campbell,_3rd_Duke_of_Argyll|Archibald_Campbell,_3Rd_Duke_Of_Argyll|  , who was in effect the viceroy of Scotland from the 1720s until his death in 1761. Scotland generally supported the king with enthusiasm during the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| .  |Henry_Dundas|Henry_Dundas,_1St_Viscount_Melville|  dominated political affairs in the latter part of the century. Dundas put a brake on intellectual and social change through his ruthless manipulation of patronage in alliance with Prime Minister  |William_Pitt_the_Younger|William_Pitt_The_Younger| , until he lost power in 1806. B. P. Lenman, Enlightenment and Change: Scotland 1746–1832 .     The main unit of local government was the parish, and since it was also part of the church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including fornication, drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking. The main focus was on the poor and the landlords and gentry, and their servants, were not subject to the parishs control. The policing system weakened after 1800 and disappeared in most places by the 1850s. T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation, pp. 84–89.             The clan system of the Highlands and Islands had been seen as a challenge to the rulers of Scotland from before the 17th century.  |James_VIs|James_Vi_And_I|  various measures to exert control included the  |Statutes_of_Iona|Statutes_Of_Iona| , an attempt to force clan leaders to become integrated into the rest of Scottish society. This started a slow process of change which, by the second half of the 18th century, saw clan chiefs start to think of themselves as commercial landlords, rather than as patriarchs of their people. To their tenants, initially this meant that monetary rents replaced those paid in kind. Later, rent increases became common.   In the 1710s the Dukes of Argyll started putting leases of some of their land up for auction; by 1737 this was done across the Argyll property. This commercial attitude replaced the principle of , which included the obligation on clan chiefs to provide land for clan members. The shift of this attitude slowly spread through the Highland elite . As clan chiefs became more integrated into Scottish and British society, many of them built up large debts. It became easier to borrow against the security of a Highland estate from the 1770s onwards. As the lenders became predominantly people and organisations outside the Highlands, there was a greater willingness to foreclose if the borrower defaulted. Combined with an astounding level of financial incompetence among the Highland elite, this ultimately forced the sale of the estates of many Highland landed families over the period 1770–1850.       The Jacobite rebellion of 1745 gave a final period of importance to the ability of Highland clans to raise bodies of fighting men at short notice. With the defeat at Culloden, any enthusiasm for continued warfare disappeared and clan leaders returned to their transition to being commercial landlords. This was arguably accelerated by some of the punitive laws enacted after the rebellion. Stephen Conway, War, State, and Society in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and Ireland by Stephen Conway , p. 139. These included the  |Heritable_Jurisdictions_Act|Heritable_Jurisdictions_Act|  of 1746, which removed judicial roles from clan chiefs and gave them to the Scottish law courts.  |T._M._Devine|Tom_Devine|  warns against seeing a clear cause and effect relationship between the post-Culloden legislation and the collapse of clanship. He questions the basic effectiveness of the measures, quoting  |W._A._Speck|W._A._Speck|  who ascribes the pacification of the area more to a disinclination to rebel than to the governments repressive measures. Devine points out that social change in Gaeldom did not pick up until the 1760s and 1770s, as this coincided with the increased market pressures from the industrialising and urbanising Lowlands.     41 properties belonging to rebels were forfeited to the Crown in the aftermath of the 45. The vast majority of these were sold by auction to pay creditors. 13 were retained and managed on behalf of the government between 1752 and 1784.     The changes by the Dukes of Argyll in the 1730s displaced many of the  |tacksmen|Tacksmen|  in the area. From the 1770s onwards, this became a matter of policy throughout the Highlands. The restriction on subletting by tacksmen meant that landlords received all the rent paid by the actual farming tenants – thereby increasing their income. By the early part of the 19th century, the tacksman had become a rare component of Highland society.  |T._M._Devine|Tom_Devine|  describes the displacement of this class as one of the clearest demonstrations of the death of the old Gaelic society.  Many emigrated, leading parties of their tenants to North America. These tenants were from the better off part of Highland peasant society, and, together with the tacksmen, they took their capital and entrepreneurial energy to the New World, unwilling to participate in economic changes imposed by their landlords which often involved a loss of status for the tenant.        |Agricultural_improvement|Scottish_Agricultural_Revolution|  was introduced across the Highlands over the relatively short period of 1760-1850. The evictions involved in this became known as the  |Highland_clearances|Highland_Clearances| . There was regional variation. In the east and south of the Highlands, the old townships or , which were farmed under the  |run_rig|Run_Rig|  system were replaced by larger enclosed farms, with fewer people holding leases and proportionately more of the population working as employees on these larger farms. In the north and west, including the Hebrides, as land was taken out of run rig,  |Crofting|Crofting|  communities were established. Much of this change involved establishing large pastoral sheep farms, with the old displaced tenants moving to new crofts in coastal areas or on poor quality land. Sheep farming was increasingly profitable at the end of the 18th century, so could pay substantially higher rents than the previous tenants. Particularly in the Hebrides, some crofting communities were established to work in the kelp industry. Others were engaged in fishing. Croft sizes were kept small, so that the occupiers were forced to seek employment to supplement what they could grow. This increased the number of seasonal migrant workers travelling to the Lowlands. The resulting connection with the Lowlands was highly influential on all aspects of Highland life, touching on income levels, social attitudes and language. Migrant working gave an advantage in speaking English, which came to be considered the language of work .     In 1846 the  |Highland_potato_famine|Highland_Potato_Famine|  struck the crofting communities of the North and West Highlands. By 1850 the charitable relief effort was wound up, despite the continuing crop failure, and landlords, charities and the government resorted to encouraging emigration. The overall result was that almost 11,000 people were provided with assisted passages by their landlords between 1846 and 1856, with the greatest number travelling in 1851. A further 5,000 emigrated to Australia, through the  |Highland_and_Island_Emigration_Society|Highland_And_Island_Emigration_Society| . To this should be added an unknown, but significant number, who paid their own fares to emigrate, and a further unknown number assisted by the Colonial Land and Emigration commission.   This was out of a famine-affected population of about 200,000 people. Many of those who remained became even more involved in temporary migration for work in the Lowlands, both out of necessity during the famine and having become accustomed to working away by the time the famine ceased. Much longer periods were spent out of the Highlands – often for much of the year or more. One illustration of this migrant working was the estimated 30,000 men and women from the far west of the Gaelic speaking area who travelled to the east coast fishing ports for the herring fishing season – providing labour in an industry that grew by 60% between 1854 and 1884.     The clearances were followed by a period of even greater emigration from the Highlands, which continued up to the start of the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| .             Historian  |Jonathan_Israel|Jonathan_Israel|  argues that by 1750 Scotlands major cities had created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and design oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment .  A. Herman, How the Scots Invented the Modern World . In France  |Voltaire|Voltaire|  said we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization, and the Scots in turn paid close attention to French ideas.  Historian Bruce Lenman says their central achievement was a new capacity to recognize and interpret social patterns. R. A. Houston and W. W. J. Knox, The New Penguin History of Scotland , p. 342. The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was  |Francis_Hutcheson|Francis_Hutcheson| , who held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. A moral philosopher who produced alternatives to the ideas of  |Thomas_Hobbes|Thomas_Hobbes| , one of his major contributions to world thought was the  |utilitarian|Utilitarianism|  and  |consequentialist|Consequentialism|  principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers . Much of what is incorporated in the  |scientific_method|Scientific_Method|  and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés  |David_Hume|David_Hume|  and  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| .  Hume became a major figure in the  |skeptical_philosophical|Philosophical_Skepticism|  and  |empiricist|Empiricist|  traditions of philosophy. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what he called a  |science_of_man|Science_Of_Man| ,  which was expressed historically in works by authors including  |James_Burnett|James_Burnett,_Lord_Monboddo| ,  |Adam_Ferguson|Adam_Ferguson| ,  |John_Millar|John_Millar|  and  |William_Robertson|William_Robertson| , all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of  |modernity|Modernity| . Modern sociology largely originated from this movement  and Humes philosophical concepts that directly influenced  |James_Madison|James_Madison|  and when popularised by  |Dugald_Stewart|Dugald_Stewart| , would be the basis of classical liberalism. D. Daiches, P. Jones and J. Jones, A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment, 1730–1790 . Adam Smith published  The Wealth of Nations , often considered the first work on modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and in the 21st century still framed discussions on  |globalisation|Globalisation|  and tariffs. M. Fry, Adam Smiths Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics . The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of the physician and chemist  |William_Cullen|William_Cullen| , the agriculturalist and economist  |James_Anderson|James_Anderson_Of_Hermiston| ,  chemist and physician  |Joseph_Black|Joseph_Black| , natural historian  |John_Walker|John_Walker|   and  |James_Hutton|James_Hutton| , the first modern geologist. J. Repcheck, The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earths Antiquity , pp. 117–143.             With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable. However, Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3  million. Henry Hamilton, An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century . Some progress was visible: agriculture in the Lowlands was steadily upgraded after 1700 and standards remained high. Thomas Martin Devine, The transformation of rural Scotland: social change and the agrarian economy, 1660–1815 . There were the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow  |Tobacco_Lords|Tobacco_Lords|  after 1740.  Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the citys emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. T. M. Devine, The Colonial Trades and Industrial Investment in Scotland, c. 1700–1815 , Economic History Review, Feb 1976, vol. 29 , pp. 1–13. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution , when its sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began to make up for the loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. T. M. Devine, An Eighteenth-Century Business Élite: Glasgow-West India Merchants, c 1750–1815 , Scottish Historical Review, April 1978, vol. 57 , pp. 40–67.     Linen was Scotlands premier industry in the 18th century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute, Louise Miskell and C. A. Whatley, Juteopolis in the Making: Linen and the Industrial Transformation of Dundee, c. 1820–1850 ,  Textile History , Autumn 1999, vol. 30 pp. 176–98. and woollen industries.  Scottish industrial policy was made by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. Alastair Durie, Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen , Journal of Design History, 1993, vol. 6 , pp. 71–6. The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. C. A. Malcolm, The History of the British Linen Bank . It joined the established Scottish banks such as the Bank of Scotland and the  |Royal_Bank_of_Scotland|Royal_Bank_Of_Scotland|  . R. Saville, Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695–1995 . Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7,000 people, double the level in England, where banks were also more heavily regulated. Historians have emphasised that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century. M. J. Daunton, Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700–1850 , p. 344.      German sociologist  |Max_Weber|Max_Weber|  mentioned Scottish Presbyterianism in  |The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism|The_Protestant_Ethic_And_The_Spirit_Of_Capitalism|  , and many scholars in recent decades argued that this worldly asceticism of Calvinism was integral to Scotlands rapid economic modernisation. Callum G. Brown, Religion and society in Scotland since 1707 , p. 178.             In the 1690s the Presbyterian establishment purged the land of Episcopalians and heretics, and made blasphemy a capital crime. Thomas Aitkenhead, the son of an Edinburgh surgeon, aged 18, was indicted for blasphemy by order of the Privy Council for calling the New Testament The History of the Imposter Christ ; he was hanged in 1696. T. M. Divine, The Scottish Nation , pp. 64–65. Their extremism led to a reaction known as the Moderate cause that ultimately prevailed and opened the way for liberal thinking in the cities.     The early 18th century saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland| . These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the hard-line  |Evangelicals|Evangelicals|  and the theologically more tolerant  |Moderate_Party|Moderate_Party| . The battle was over fears of fanaticism by the former and the promotion of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. The Patronage Act of 1712 was a major blow to the evangelicals, for it meant that local landlords could choose the minister, not the members of the congregation. T. M. Divine, The Scottish Nation , pp. 73–75. Schisms erupted as the evangelicals left the main body, starting in 1733 with the  |First_Secession|First_Secession|  headed by figures including  |Ebenezer_Erskine|Ebenezer_Erskine| . The second schism in 1761 lead to the foundation of the independent  |Relief_Church|Relief_Church| . J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5 , pp. 416–7. These churches gained strength in the  |Evangelical_Revival|Evangelical_Revival|  of the later 18th century. G. M. Ditchfield, The Evangelical Revival , p. 91. A key result was the main Presbyterian church was in the hands of the Moderate faction, which provided critical support for the Enlightenment in the cities.     Long after the triumph of the Church of Scotland in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to an old-fashioned Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices. The remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the  |SSPCK|Scottish_Spck|  missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. G. Robb, Popular Religion and the Christianization of the Scottish Highlands in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries , Journal of Religious History, 1990, 16: 18–34. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions also grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. Also important was Episcopalianism, which had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes of regime in the 17th century. Since most Episcopalians had given their support to the Jacobite rebellions in the early 18th century, they also suffered a decline in fortunes.              Although Scotland increasingly adopted the English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation.  |Allan_Ramsay|Allan_Ramsay|  laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the  |Habbie_stanza|Habbie_Stanza|  as a  |poetic_form|Poetic_Form| . Buchan, Crowded with Genius, p. 311.  |James_Macpherson|James_Macpherson|  was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by  |Ossian|Ossian| , he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the  |Classical|Classical_Antiquity| |epics|Epic_Poetry| . Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the  |Romantic_movement|Romanticism|  in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing  |Herder|Johann_Gottfried_Von_Herder|  and  |Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| . Buchan, Crowded with Genius, p. 163. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.  Both the major literary figures of the following century,  |Robert_Burns|Robert_Burns|  and Walter Scott, would be highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the  |national_poet|List_Of_National_Poets|  of Scotland and a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected  |folk_songs|Folk_Music|  from across Scotland, often revising or  |adapting|Literary_Adaptation|  them. His poem  |Auld_Lang_Syne|Auld_Lang_Syne|  is often sung at  |Hogmanay|Hogmanay|  , and  |Scots_Wha_Hae|Scots_Wha_Hae|  served for a long time as an unofficial  |national_anthem|National_Anthem|  of the country.              A legacy of the Reformation in Scotland was the aim of having a school in every parish, which was underlined by an act of the Scottish parliament in 1696 . In rural communities this obliged local landowners to provide a schoolhouse and pay a schoolmaster, while ministers and local  |presbyteries|Presbyterian_Polity|  oversaw the quality of the education. The headmaster or dominie was often university educated and enjoyed high local prestige. William F. Hendrie, The dominie: a profile of the Scottish headmaster . The kirk schools were active in the rural lowlands but played a minor role in the Highlands, the islands, and in the fast-growing industrial towns and cities. Devine, Scottish Nation , p. 99; R. D. Anderson, Education and the Scottish People, 1750–1918 . The schools taught in English, not in Gaelic, because that language was seen as a leftover of Catholicism and was not an expression of Scottish nationalism. R. D. Anderson, Education and the Scottish people , p. 217. In cities such as Glasgow the Catholics operated their own schools, which directed their youth into clerical and middle class occupations, as well as religious vocations. Francis J. OHagan, The Contribution of the Religious Orders to Education in Glasgow During the Period, 1847–1918 .     A democratic myth emerged in the 19th century to the effect that many a lad of pairts had been able to rise up through the system to take high office and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England. R. Anderson, The history of Scottish Education pre-1980 , in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution , pp. 219–28. Historical research has largely undermined the myth. Kirk schools were not free, attendance was not compulsory and they generally imparted only basic literacy such as the ability to read the Bible. Poor children, starting at age 7, were done by age 8 or 9; the majority were finished by age 11 or 12. The result was widespread basic reading ability; since there was an extra fee for writing, half the people never learned to write. Scots were not significantly better educated than the English and other contemporary nations. A few talented poor boys did go to university, but usually they were helped by aristocratic or gentry sponsors. Most of them became poorly paid teachers or ministers, and none became important figures in the Scottish Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution. Devine, Scottish Nation , pp. 96–100.     By the 18th century there were five universities in Scotland, at  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh_University| ,  |Glasgow|Glasgow_University| ,  |St._Andrews|St._Andrews_University|  and  |Kings|Kings_College,_Aberdeen|  and  |Marischial|Marischal_College|  Colleges in Aberdeen, compared with only two in England. Originally oriented to clerical and legal training, after the religious and political upheavals of the 17th century they recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry. It helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking.           Scotlands transformation into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly. The population grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. A. K. Cairncross, The Scottish economy p. 10. The economy, long based on agriculture, began to industrialise after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. In 1861, the American Civil War suddenly cut off the supplies of raw cotton and the industry never recovered. Thanks to its many entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, Scotland became a world centre for engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870. Olive Checkland and Sydney Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832 – 1914 .       The  |Scottish_Reform_Act_1832|Scottish_Reform_Act_1832|  increased the number of Scottish MPs and significantly widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From this point until the end of the century, the Whigs and their successors the  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party| , managed to gain a majority of the Westminster Parliamentary seats for Scotland, although these were often outnumbered by the much larger number of English and Welsh Conservatives. T. M. Devine and R. J. Finlay, Scotland in the Twentieth Century , pp. 64–5. The English-educated Scottish peer  |Lord_Aberdeen|George_Hamilton-Gordon,_4Th_Earl_Of_Aberdeen|  led a coalition government from 1852–5, but in general very few Scots held office in the government. M. Oaten, Coalition: the Politics and Personalities of Coalition Government from 1850 , pp. 37–40. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and when the Conservative  |Lord_Salisbury|Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_3Rd_Marquess_Of_Salisbury|  became prime minister in 1885 he responded to pressure by reviving the post of  |Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland|Secretary_Of_State_For_Scotland| , which had been in abeyance since 1746.

K. Kumar, The Making of English National Identity , p. 183. In the later 19th century the issue of  |Irish_Home_Rule|Irish_Home_Rule|  led to a split among the Liberals, with a minority breaking away to form the  |Liberal_Unionists|Liberal_Unionists|  in 1886. The growing importance of the working classes was marked by  |Keir_Hardies|Keir_Hardie|  success in the  |1888_Mid_Lanarkshire_by-election|1888_Mid_Lanarkshire_By-Election| , leading to the foundation of the  |Scottish_Labour_Party|Scottish_Labour_Party| , which was absorbed into the  |Independent_Labour_Party|Independent_Labour_Party|  in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader. D. Howell, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888–1906 , p. 144.          From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  cut off the supplies of raw cotton. W. O. Henderson, The Lancashire Cotton Famine 1861–65 , p. 122. The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production. C. A. Whatley, The Industrial Revolution in Scotland , p. 51. Coal mining continued to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. By 1914, there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. A. Campbell, The Scottish Miners, 1874–1939 , The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; Christopher A. Whatley, Scottish collier serfs, British coal workers? Aspects of Scottish collier society in the eighteenth century, Labour History Review, Fall 1995, Vol. 60 Issue 2, pp. 66–79. that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled the miners everywhere, with a strong emphasis on masculinity, equalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.

Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between  |Monkland|Monklands|  and  |Kirkintilloch|Kirkintilloch| , opened in 1831. C. F. Marshall, A History of Railway Locomotives Until 1831 p. 223. Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the  |Aberdeen_Angus|Aberdeen_Angus|  to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation. O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832–1914 , pp. 17–52. By 1900, Scotland had 3500 miles of railway; their main economic contribution was moving supplies in and product out for heavy industry, especially coal-mining.         Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800. William Ferguson, The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest  The industrial belt ran across the country from southwest to northeast; by 1900 the four industrialised counties of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Dunbartonshire, and Ayrshire contained 44 per cent of the population.

MacKenzie, The second city of the Empire: Glasgow – imperial municipality , in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity , pp. 215–23. Shipbuilding on  |Clydeside|Clydeside|  began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the  |Scott_familys|Scotts_Shipbuilding_And_Engineering_Company|  shipyard at Greenock. After 1860, the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron , which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the worlds pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. Clydebuilt became an industry benchmark of quality, and the rivers shipyards were given contracts for warships. J. Shields, Clyde Built: a History of Ship-Building on the River Clyde .       The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. C. H. Lee, Scotland and the United Kingdom: the Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century , p. 43. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to endorse government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class. J. Melling, Employers, industrial housing and the evolution of company welfare policies in Britains heavy industry: west Scotland, 1870–1920 , International Review of Social History, Dec 1981, vol. 26 , pp. 255–301.          While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the mathematicians and physicists  |James_Clerk_Maxwell|James_Clerk_Maxwell| ,  |Lord_Kelvin|William_Thomson,_1St_Baron_Kelvin| , and the engineers and inventors  |James_Watt|James_Watt|  and  |William_Murdoch|William_Murdoch| , whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain. E. Wills, Scottish Firsts: a Celebration of Innovation and Achievement .     In literature the most successful figure of the mid-nineteenth century was  |Walter_Scott|Walter_Scott| , who began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work,  |Waverley|Waverley|  in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.  It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.  In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations.  |Robert_Louis_Stevensons|Robert_Louis_Stevenson|  work included the  |urban_Gothic|Urban_Gothic|  novella  Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  , and played a major part in developing the historical adventure in books like  Kidnapped  and  Treasure Island .  |Arthur_Conan_Doyles|Arthur_Conan_Doyle|   Sherlock Holmes  stories helped found the tradition of detective fiction. The  |kailyard_tradition|Kailyard_School|  at the end of the century, brought elements of  |fantasy|Fantasy|  and  |folklore|Folklore|  back into fashion as can be seen in the work of figures like  |J._M._Barrie|J._M._Barrie| , most famous for his creation of  |Peter_Pan|Peter_Pan| , and  |George_MacDonald|George_Macdonald| , whose works, including  Phantasies , played a major part in the creation of the fantasy genre.      Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The  |Glasgow_School|Glasgow_School| , which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the  |Celtic_Revival|Celtic_Revival|  the  |Arts_and_Crafts_Movement|Arts_And_Crafts_Movement| , and  |Japonisme|Japonisme| , which found favour throughout the  |modern_art|Modern_Art|  world of continental Europe and helped define the  |Art_Nouveau|Art_Nouveau|  style. Among the most prominent members were the loose collective of The Four: acclaimed architect  |Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh|Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh| , his wife the painter and  |glass_artist|Studio_Glass| |Margaret_MacDonald|Margaret_Macdonald| , her sister the artist  |Frances|Frances_Macdonald| , and her husband, the artist and teacher  |Herbert_MacNair|Herbert_Macnair| . Stephan Tschudi-Madsen, The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide , pp. 283–4.             This period saw a process of rehabilitation for highland culture. Tartan had already been adopted for highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars|  in 1815, but by the 19th century it had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people. In the 1820s, as part of the  |Romantic_revival|Romanticism| , tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, J. L. Roberts, , pp. 193–5. M. Sievers,  , pp. 22–5. prompted by the popularity of Macphersons Ossian cycle P. Morère, Scotland and France in the Enlightenment , pp. 75–6. William Ferguson,  , p. 227. and then Walter Scotts Waverley novels. The world paid attention to their literary redefinition of Scottishness, as they forged an image largely based on characteristics in polar opposition to those associated with England and modernity. This new identity made it possible for Scottish culture to become integrated into a wider European and North American context, not to mention tourist sites, but it also locked in a sense of otherness which Scotland began to shed only in the late 20th century. Divine, Scottish Nation pp. 292–95; for the antecedents created by the Stuarts see Murray Pittock, The Invention of Scotland: The Stuart Myth and the Scottish Identity, 1638 to the Present Scotts staging of the royal  |Visit_of_King_George_IV_to_Scotland|Visit_Of_King_George_Iv_To_Scotland|  in 1822 and the kings wearing of tartan, resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and became a major symbol of Scottish identity. N. C. Milne,  , p. 138. The fashion for all things Scottish was maintained by  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria| , who helped secure the identity of Scotland as a tourist resort, with  |Balmoral_Castle|Balmoral_Castle|  in Aberdeenshire becoming a major royal residence from 1852.       Despite these changes the highlands remained very poor and traditional, with few connections to the uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. M. Gray, The Highland Economy, 1750–1850 . A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of  |Argyll|Duke_Of_Argyll| ,  |Atholl|Duke_Of_Atholl| ,  |Buccleuch|Duke_Of_Buccleuch| , and  |Sutherland|Duke_Of_Sutherland| , owned large amounts of land and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. H. Pelling, Social Geography of British Elections 1885–1910 , p. 373. Particularly after the end of the boom created by the  |Revolutionary|French_Revolutionary_Wars|  and Napoleonic Wars , these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans.  |Potato_blight|Potato_Blight|  reached the Highlands in 1846, where 150,000 people  |faced_disaster|Highland_Potato_Famine|  because their food supply was largely potatoes . They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in  |Ireland|Great_Famine| . T. C. Smout, A Century of the Scottish People: 1830–1950 , pp. 12–14. As the famine continued, landlords, charities and government agencies provided assisted passages for destitute tenants to emigrate to Canada and Australia; in excess of 16,000 people emigrated, with most travelling in 1851.        Caused by the advent of  |refrigeration|Refrigeration|  and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.  Land prices subsequently plummeted, too, and accelerated the process of the so-called Balmoralisation of Scotland, an era in the second half of the 19th century that saw an increase in tourism and the establishment of large estates dedicated to  |field_sports|Hunting|  like  |deer_stalking|Deer_Stalking|  and  |grouse_shooting|Driven_Grouse_Shooting| , especially in the Scottish Highlands.  The process was named after  |Balmoral_Estate|Balmoral_Estate| , purchased by Queen Victoria in 1848, that fueled the romanticisation of upland Scotland and initiated an influx of newly the wealthy acquiring similar estates in the following decades. By the late 19th century just 118 people owned half of Scotland, with nearly 60 per cent of the whole country being part of shooting estates. While their relative importance has somewhat declined due to changing recreational interests throughout the 20th century, deer stalking and grouse shooting remain of prime importance on many private estates in Scotland.       The unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional subject and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The politically powerless poor crofters embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian  |revival|Christian_Revival|  after 1800, Divine, The Scottish Nation. and the breakaway Free Church after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. This energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords, preparing them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the  |Highland_Land_League|Highland_Land_League| .  Violence began on the  |Isle_of_Skye|Isle_Of_Skye|  when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quieted when the government stepped in passing the  |Crofters_Holdings_Act,_1886|Crofters_Holdings_Act,_1886|  to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless.  In 1885, three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, leading to explicit security for the Scottish smallholders; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants; and creating a  |Crofting_Commission|Crofting_Commission| . The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the Liberal Party gained most of their votes.           The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. A. K. Cairncross, The Scottish Economy: A Statistical Account of Scottish Life by Members of the Staff of Glasgow University , p. 10. Even with the development of industry there were insufficient good jobs; as a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. Scotland lost a much higher proportion of its population than England and Wales, F. M. L. Thompson, The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750 –1950: People and Their Environment , pp. 9–10. reaching perhaps as much as 30.2 per cent of its  |natural_increase|Natural_Increase|  from the 1850s onwards. C. Williams, A Companion to Nineteenth-Century Britain , p. 508. This not only limited Scotlands population increase, but meant that almost every family lost members due to emigration and, because more of them were young males, it skewed the sex and age ratios of the country.     Scots-born emigrants that played a leading role in the foundation and development of the United States included cleric and revolutionary  |John_Witherspoon|John_Witherspoon| , J. H. Morrison, John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic . sailor  |John_Paul_Jones|John_Paul_Jones| , industrialist and philanthropist  |Andrew_Carnegie|Andrew_Carnegie| , and scientist and inventor  |Alexander_Graham_Bell|Alexander_Graham_Bell| .

By the 21st century, there would be about as many people who were  |Scottish_Canadians|Scottish_Canadians|  and  |Scottish_Americans|Scottish_American|  as the 5 million remaining in Scotland. R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds., The New Penguin History of Scotland , p. xxxii.              After prolonged years of struggle, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the  |General_Assembly|General_Assembly_Of_The_Church_Of_Scotland|  and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted intrusive presentations to livings by patrons. The following Ten Years Conflict of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr  |Thomas_Chalmers|Thomas_Chalmers|  known as the Great  |Disruption_of_1843|Disruption_Of_1843| . Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate  |Free_Church_of_Scotland|Free_Church_Of_Scotland| . The evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church. Chalmerss ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotlands communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmerss idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation. J. Brown Stewart, Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmerss ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities. S. Mechie, The Church and Scottish social development, 1780–1870 .     In the late 19th century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the  |Free_Presbyterian_Church|Free_Presbyterian_Church_Of_Scotland|  in 1893. There were, however, also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the  |United_Secession_Church|United_Secession_Church|  in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the  |United_Presbyterian_Church|United_Presbyterian_Church_Of_Scotland| , which in turn joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the  |United_Free_Church_of_Scotland|United_Free_Church_Of_Scotland| . The removal of legislation on lay patronage would allow the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929. The schisms left small denominations including the  |Free_Presbyterians|Free_Presbyterian_Church_Of_Scotland|  and a remnant that had not merged in 1900 as the  |Free_Church|Free_Church_Of_Scotland| .      |Catholic_Emancipation|Catholic_Emancipation|  in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland. Episcopalianism also revived in the 19th century as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the  |Episcopal_Church_in_Scotland|Episcopal_Church_In_Scotland|  in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| .  |Baptist|Baptist_Union_Of_Scotland| ,  |Congregationalist|Congregational_Union_Of_Scotland|  and  |Methodist|Methodist|  churches had appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century, partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. From 1879 they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the  |Salvation_Army|Salvation_Army| , which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres.             Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants, then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship, and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation, pp. 91–100. Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch Education Department in London.  Education was now compulsory from five to thirteen and many new board schools were built. Larger urban school boards established higher grade schools as a cheaper alternative to the burgh schools. The Scottish Education Department introduced a Leaving Certificate Examination in 1888 to set national standards for secondary education and in 1890 school fees were abolished, creating a state-funded national system of free basic education and common examinations.     At the beginning of the 19th century, Scottish universities had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and could leave without qualifications. After two commissions of enquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in 1858 and 1889, the curriculum and system of graduation were reformed to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. Entrance examinations equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered 3-year ordinary and 4-year honours degrees and separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum. R. Anderson, The history of Scottish Education pre-1980 , in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution , p. 224. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as well as the upper class. It prepared students for non-commercial careers in government, the law, medicine, education, and the ministry and a smaller group for careers in science and engineering. Paul L.

St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Licentiate in Arts , which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century. M. F. Rayner-Canham and G. Rayner-Canham, Chemistry was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880–1949 , p. 264.              The years before the First World War were the golden age of the inshore fisheries. Landings reached new heights, and Scottish catches dominated Europes herring trade,  accounting for a third of the British catch. High productivity came about thanks to the transition to more productive steam-powered boats, while the rest of Europes fishing fleets were slower because they were still powered by sails. C. Reid, Intermediation, Opportunism and the State Loans Debate in Scotlands Herring Fisheries before World War I, International Journal of Maritime History, June 2004, vol. 16 , pp. 1–26.          In the  |Khaki_Election|Khaki_Election|  of 1900, nationalist concern with the  |Boer_War|Boer_War|  meant that the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy in the next election. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name  |Unionist_Party|Unionist_Party|  in Scotland. L. Bennie, J. Brand and J. Mitchell, How Scotland Votes , p. 60.

Daniel, Measures of enthusiasm: new avenues in quantifying variations in voluntary enlistment in Scotland, August 1914 – December 1915 , Local Population Studies, Spring 2005, Issue 74, pp. 16–35. Scotlands industries were directed at the war effort. For example,  |the_Singer_Clydebank_sewing_machine_factory|Singer_Corporation|  received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuses, and aeroplane parts, as well as grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70 percent female at wars end. Robert Bruce Davies, Peacefully working to conquer the world , p. 170.     With a population of 4.8  million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. I. F. W. Beckett and K. R. Simpson, eds. A Nation in Arms: a Social Study of the British Army in the First World War p. 11. R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds., The New Penguin History of Scotland , p. 426. Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment, were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female-dominated jute industry limited male employment, had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city.

Mackie,  Concern for their families standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled.

After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the  |Battle_of_Loos|Battle_Of_Loos| , where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. J. Buchanan, Scotland , p. 49. Some areas, like the thinly populated island of  |Lewis_and_Harris|Lewis_And_Harris| , suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain. Clydeside shipyards and the nearby engineering shops were the major centres of war industry in Scotland. In Glasgow, radical agitation led to industrial and political unrest that continued after the war ended. Bruce Lenman, An Economic History of Modern Scotland: 1660–1976 pp. 206–214. After the end of the war in June 1919 the  |German_fleet_interned_at_Scapa_Flow_was_scuttled|Scuttling_Of_The_German_Fleet_At_Scapa_Flow|  by its German crews, to avoid its ships being taken over by the victorious allies.

A boom was created by the First World War, with the shipbuilding industry expanding by a third, but a serious depression hit the economy by 1922. N. K. Buxton, Economic growth in Scotland between the Wars: the role of production structure and rationalization , Economic History Review, Nov 1980, vol. 33 , pp. 538–55. The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills. A. J.

Ratcliffe, eds., Trade and Transport: Essays in Economic History in Honour of T. S. Willan , pp. 258–78. The main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War. R. J. Finlay, National identity in crisis: politicians, intellectuals and the end of Scotland, 1920–1939, History, June 1994, vol. 79, , pp. 242–59.     A few industries did grow, such as chemicals and whisky, which developed a global market for premium Scotch . B. Weir, The History of the Distillers Company, 1877–1939: Diversification and Growth in Whisky and Chemicals . However, in general the Scottish economy stagnated leading to growing unemployment and political agitation among industrial workers.       After World War I the Liberal Party began to disintegrate and Labour emerged as the party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands. As a result, the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik|  revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. The fear of the left had been fuelled by the emergence of a radical movement led by militant trades unionists.  |John_MacLean|John_Maclean|  emerged as a key political figure in what became known as  |Red_Clydeside|Red_Clydeside| , and in January 1919, the British Government, fearful of a revolutionary uprising, deployed tanks and soldiers in central Glasgow. Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base in the Irish Catholic working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing and rent issues. However, the Reds operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; in the face of heavy unemployment the workers mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s. I. McLean, The Legend of Red Clydeside Scottish educated  |Bonar_Law|Bonar_Law|  led a Conservative government from 1922 to 1923 and another Scot,  |Ramsay_MacDonald|Ramsay_Macdonald| , would be the Labour Partys first Prime Minister in 1924 and again from 1929 to 1935.     With all the main parties committed to the Union, new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the  |National_Party_of_Scotland|National_Party_Of_Scotland|  in 1928 and  |Scottish_Party|Scottish_Party|  in 1930. They joined to form the  |Scottish_National_Party|Scottish_National_Party|  in 1934, with the goal of creating an  |independent_Scotland|Scottish_Independence| , but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system. C. Cook and J. Stevenson, The Longman Companion to Britain since 1945 , p. 93.             As in World War I,  |Scapa_Flow|Scapa_Flow|  in Orkney served as an important  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  base.

Wykeham, Fighter Command , p. 87.

R. Finlay, Modern Scotland: 1914–2000 , pp. 162–97.     In World War II, Prime Minister  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  appointed Labour politician  |Tom_Johnston|Tom_Johnston|  as  |Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland|Secretary_Of_State_For_Scotland|  in February 1941; he controlled Scottish affairs until the war ended. He launched numerous initiatives to promote Scotland, attracting businesses and new jobs through his new Scottish Council of Industry. He set up 32 committees to deal with social and economic problems, ranging from juvenile delinquency to sheep farming. He regulated rents, and set up a prototype national health service, using new hospitals set up in the expectation of large numbers of casualties from German bombing. His most successful venture was setting up a system of hydro electricity using water power in the Highlands. Devine, The Scottish Nation, pp. 553–4. A long-standing supporter of the  |Home_Rule|Home_Rule|  movement, Johnston persuaded Churchill of the need to counter the nationalist threat north of the border and created a Scottish Council of State and a Council of Industry as institutions to  |devolve|Devolved_Government|  some power away from  |Whitehall|Whitehall| . G. Walker, Thomas Johnston , pp. 153 and 174.     In World War II, despite extensive bombing by the Luftwaffe, Scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships. Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by . Devine, The Scottish Nation, pp. 549–50.       While emigration began to tail off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks of family and friends who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to retrace their paths. A. McCarthy, Personal Accounts of Leaving Scotland, 1921–1954 , Scottish Historical Review, Oct 2004, vol. 83 , Issue 216, pp. 196–215. When the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada and the numbers leaving fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass emigrations that had opened in the mid-18th century. S. M. Millett, The Scottish Settlers of America: the 17th and 18th centuries , p. 64.               In the early 20th century there was a new surge of activity in Scottish literature, influenced by  |modernism|Modernism|  and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance.  The leading figure in the movement was  |Hugh_MacDiarmid|Hugh_Macdiarmid|  . MacDiarmid attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature in poetic works including  |A_Drunk_Man_Looks_at_the_Thistle|A_Drunk_Man_Looks_At_The_Thistle|  , developing a form of  |Synthetic_Scots|Synthetic_Scots|  that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms. Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets  |Edwin_Muir|Edwin_Muir|  and  |William_Soutar|William_Soutar| , the novelists  |Neil_Gunn|Neil_Gunn| ,  |George_Blake|George_Blake| ,  |Nan_Shepherd|Nan_Shepherd| ,  |A._J._Cronin|A._J._Cronin| ,  |Naomi_Mitchison|Naomi_Mitchison| ,  |Eric_Linklater|Eric_Linklater|  and  |Lewis_Grassic_Gibbon|Lewis_Grassic_Gibbon| , and the playwright  |James_Bridie|James_Bridie| . All were born within a fifteen-year period and, although they cannot be described as members of a single school, they all pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues.          In the 20th century, the centre of the education system became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, but despite attempts to raise it to 15 this was only made law in 1939 and then postponed because of the outbreak of war. In 1918,  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  schools were brought into the state system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church.     The first half of the 20th century saw Scottish universities fall behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure. C. Harvie, No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-Century Scotland , p. 78.          Scotlands  |Scapa_Flow|Scapa_Flow|  was the main base for the Royal Navy in the 20th century. Angus Konstam, Scapa Flow: The Defences of Britains Great Fleet Anchorage 1914–45 . As the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  intensified in 1961, the United States deployed  |Polaris_ballistic_missiles|Polaris_Ballistic_Missile| , and submarines, in the  |Firth_of_Clydes|Firth_Of_Clyde| |Holy_Loch|Holy_Loch| . Public protests from  |CND|Cnd|  campaigners proved futile. The  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris-class submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RNs nuclear submarine base opened four  |Resolution_class|Resolution_Class_Submarine| |Polaris|Polaris_Missile|  submarines at the expanded  |Faslane_Naval_Base|Hmnb_Clyde|  on the  |Gare_Loch|Gare_Loch| . The first patrol of a  |Trident|Trident_Missile| -armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War. Andrew Marr, A History of Modern Britain , p. 211.          After World War II, Scotlands economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only began to change in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. This period saw the emergence of the  |Scottish_National_Party|Scottish_National_Party|  and movements for both  |Scottish_independence|Scottish_Independence|  and more popularly  |devolution|Devolution| . However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40 per cent of the electorate     A  |national_referendum|2014_Scottish_Independence_Referendum|  to decide on  |Scottish_independence|Scottish_Independence|  was held on 18 September 2014. Voters were asked to answer either Yes or No to the question: Should Scotland be an independent country?  55.3% of voters answered No and 44.7% answered Yes , with a  |voter_turnout|Voter_Turnout|  of 84.5%.              In the second half of the 20th century the Labour Party usually won most Scottish seats in the Westminster parliament, losing this dominance briefly to the  |Unionists|Unionist_Party|  in the 1950s. Support in Scotland was critical to Labours overall electoral fortunes as without Scottish MPs it would have gained only two UK electoral victories in the 20th century . L. Bennie, J. Brand and J. Mitchell, How Scotland Votes , p. 46. The number of Scottish seats represented by Unionists  went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997. S. Ball and I. Holliday, Mass Conservatism: the Conservatives and the Public Since the 1880s , p. 33. Politicians with Scottish connections continued to play a prominent part in UK political life, with Prime Ministers including the Conservatives  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan|  from 1957 to 1963 and  |Alec_Douglas-Home|Alec_Douglas-Home|  from 1963 to 1964.     The  |Scottish_National_Party|Scottish_National_Party|  gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974. However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the necessary support of 40 per cent of the electorate and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s. The introduction in 1989 by the  |Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher| -led  |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  government of the  |Community_Charge|Poll_Tax|  , one year before the rest of the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs.  The electoral success of New Labour in 1997 was led by two Prime Ministers with Scottish connections: Tony Blair from 1997 to 2007 and  |Gordon_Brown|Gordon_Brown|  from 2007 to 2010, opened the way for constitutional change. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of  |Battle_of_Stirling_Bridge|Battle_Of_Stirling_Bridge| , the  |Blair|Tony_Blair|  led  |Labour|Labour_Party|  government again held a referendum on the issue of devolution. A positive outcome led to the establishment of a devolved  |Scottish_Parliament|Scottish_Parliament|  in 1999. A  |coalition|Coalition|  government, which would last until 2007, was formed between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with  |Donald_Dewar|Donald_Dewar|  as  |First_Minister|First_Minister_Of_Scotland| .  The new  |Scottish_Parliament_Building|Scottish_Parliament_Building| , adjacent to  |Holyrood_House|Holyrood_House|  in Edinburgh, opened in 2004.  Although not initially reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the Scottish Parliamentary elections with their system of  |mixed_member_proportional_representation|Mixed_Member_Proportional_Representation| . It became the official opposition in 1999, a minority government in 2007 and a majority government from 2011.  In 2014, the  |independence_referendum|2014_Scottish_Independence_Referendum|  saw voters reject independence, choosing instead to remain in the United Kingdom. , BBC News, 19 September 2014.

After World War II, Scotlands economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. W. Knox, Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800 – present , p. 255. This only began to change in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant  |Forties_oilfield|Forties_Oilfield|  in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant  |Brent_oilfield|Brent_Oilfield|  in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. J. Vickers and G. Yarrow, Privatization: an Economic Analysis , p. 317. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries. P. L. Payne, The end of steelmaking in Scotland, c. 1967–1993 ,  Scottish Economic and Social History , 1995, vol. 15 , pp. 66–84. R. Finlay, Modern Scotland: 1914–2000 , ch. 9. This included a resurgent financial services industry and the  |electronics_manufacturing|Electronics_Manufacturing|  of  |Silicon_Glen|Silicon_Glen| .              In the 20th century existing Christian denominations were joined by other organisations, including the  |Brethren|Plymouth_Brethren|  and  |Pentecostal|Pentecostal|  churches. Although some denominations thrived, after World War II there was a steady overall decline in church attendance and resulting church closures for most denominations. Talks began in the 1950s aiming at a grand merger of the main Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist bodies in Scotland. The talks were ended in 2003, when the  |General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland|General_Assembly_Of_The_Church_Of_Scotland|  rejected the proposals. , The Scotsman, 20 May 2003.

The  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church_In_Scotland|  accounted for 15.9% of the population and is especially important in  |West_Central_Scotland|West_Central_Scotland|  and the  |Highlands|Scottish_Highlands| . In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through  |immigration|Immigration_To_The_United_Kingdom|  and higher birth rates among ethnic minorities, with a small number of  |converts|Religious_Conversion| .

Although plans to raise the school leaving age to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area of growth in the second half of the 20th century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the  |Scottish_Certificate_of_Education|Scottish_Certificate_Of_Education| |Ordinary_Grade|Ordinary_Grade|  and  |Higher_Grade|Higher_Grade|  qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study.

Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed Hugh MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including  |Robert_Garioch|Robert_Garioch|  and  |Sydney_Goodsir_Smith|Sydney_Goodsir_Smith| . Others demonstrated a greater interest in English language poetry, among them  |Norman_MacCaig|Norman_Maccaig| , George Bruce and  |Maurice_Lindsay|Maurice_Lindsay| .   |George_Mackay_Brown|George_Mackay_Brown|  from Orkney, and  |Iain_Crichton_Smith|Iain_Crichton_Smith|  from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet  |Edwin_Morgan|Edwin_Morgan|  became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first  |Scots_Makar|Scots_Makar|  , appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004.  Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as  |Muriel_Spark|Muriel_Spark| , with  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie  spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Successful mass-market works included the action novels of  |Alistair_MacLean|Alistair_Maclean| , and the historical fiction of  |Dorothy_Dunnett|Dorothy_Dunnett| .

From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around critic, poet and teacher  |Philip_Hobsbaum|Philip_Hobsbaum|  and editor  |Peter_Kravitz|Peter_Kravitz| . In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included  |Irvine_Welshs|Irvine_Welsh|   Trainspotting  , Warners  Morvern Callar  , Grays  Poor Things  and Kelmans  How Late It Was, How Late  . Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburghs  |Ian_Rankin|Ian_Rankin|  and his  |Inspector_Rebus|Inspector_Rebus|  novels.
