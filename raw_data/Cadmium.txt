         Cadmium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Cd and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in  |group_12|Group_12_Element| ,  |zinc|Zinc|  and  |mercury|Mercury| . Like zinc, it demonstrates  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal|  in  |groups_3|Group_3_Element|  through  |11|Group_11_Element| . Cadmium and its  |congeners|Congener|  in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earths crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million . It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by  |Stromeyer|Friedrich_Stromeyer|  and  |Hermann|Karl_Samuel_Leberecht_Hermann| , both in Germany, as an impurity in  |zinc_carbonate|Zinc_Carbonate| .     Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on  |steel|Steel| , and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow  |pigments|Cadmium_Pigments| , to color  |glass|Colored_Glass| , and to stabilize  |plastic|Plastic| . Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is  |toxic|Toxicity|   and  |nickel_cadmium_batteries|Nickel_Cadmium_Battery|  have been replaced with  |nickel_metal_hydride|Nickel_Metal_Hydride_Battery|  and  |lithium_ion|Lithium_Ion_Battery|  batteries. One of its few new uses is  |cadmium_telluride|Cadmium_Telluride_Photovoltaics| |solar_panels|Solar_Panel| .     Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase|  has been found in marine  |diatoms|Diatom| .           Cadmium is a soft,  |malleable|Malleable| ,  |ductile|Ductility| , silvery-white  |divalent|Divalent| |_metal|Metal| . It is similar in many respects to zinc but forms  |complex|Complex|  compounds.    Unlike most other metals, cadmium is resistant to  |corrosion|Corrosion|  and is used as a protective  |plate|Plating|  on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is  |insoluble|Insoluble|  in water and is not  |flammable|Flammability| ; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release  |toxic_fumes|Cadmium_Oxide| .               Although cadmium usually has an  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  of +2, it also exists in the +1 state. Cadmium and its  |congeners|Congener|  are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states.    Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous  |cadmium_oxide|Cadmium_Oxide|  ; the  |crystal|Crystal| line form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to  |zinc_oxide|Zinc_Oxide| .  |Hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| ,  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| , and  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  dissolve cadmium by forming  |cadmium_chloride|Cadmium_Chloride|  ,  |cadmium_sulfate|Cadmium_Sulfate|  , or  |cadmium_nitrate|Cadmium_Nitrate|  . The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and  |aluminium_chloride|Aluminium_Chloride| , forming the Cd 2 2+ cation, which is similar to the Hg 2 2+ cation in  |mercury_chloride|Mercury_Chloride| .   :Cd + CdCl 2 + 2 AlCl 3 → Cd 2 2   The structures of many cadmium complexes with  |nucleobases|Nucleobase| ,  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid| , and  |vitamins|Vitamin|  have been determined.                Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8  |isotopes|Isotope| . Two of them are  |radioactive|Radionuclide| , and three are expected to  |decay|Radioactive_Decay|  but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113 Cd  and 116 Cd . The other three are 106 Cd, 108 Cd , and 114 Cd ; only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes  – 110 Cd, 111 Cd, and 112 Cd  – are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are 109 Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and 115 Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known  |meta_states|Meta_State| , with the most stable being 113m Cd , 115m Cd , and 117m Cd .      The known isotopes of cadmium range in  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass|  from 94.950  |u|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  to 131.946 u . For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  is  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  and the dominant  |decay_product|Decay_Product|  is element 47 . Heavier isotopes decay mostly through  |beta_emission|Beta_Emission|  producing element 49 .     One isotope of cadmium, 113 Cd, absorbs neutrons with high selectivity: With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the cadmium cut-off will be absorbed; those higher than the cut-off will be transmitted. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5  eV, and neutrons below that level are deemed slow neutrons, distinct from intermediate and fast neutrons.        Cadmium is created via the  |s_process|S_Process|  in low- to medium-mass stars with masses of 0.6 to 10  |solar_masses|Sun| , over thousands of years. In that process, a  |silver|Silver|  atom captures a  |neutron|Neutron|  and then undergoes  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| .             Cadmium  was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  simultaneously in 1817 by  |Friedrich_Stromeyer|Friedrich_Stromeyer|     and  |Karl_Samuel_Leberecht_Hermann|Karl_Samuel_Leberecht_Hermann| , both in  |Germany|Germany| , as an impurity in zinc carbonate. Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in  |zinc_carbonate|Zinc_Carbonate|  , and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by  |roasting|Roasting|  and reducing the  |sulfide|Cadmium_Sulfide| . The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, but the lack of cadmium limited this application.              Even though cadmium and its compounds are toxic in certain forms and concentrations, the  |British_Pharmaceutical_Codex|British_Pharmaceutical_Codex|  from 1907 states that  |cadmium_iodide|Cadmium_Iodide|  was used as a  |medication|Medication|  to treat enlarged joints, scrofulous glands, and chilblains .        In 1907, the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  defined the international  |ångström|Ångström|  in terms of a red cadmium spectral line .   This was adopted by the 7th  |General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures|General_Conference_On_Weights_And_Measures|  in 1927. In 1960, the definitions of both the  |metre|Metre|  and ångström were changed to use  |krypton|Krypton| .        After the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for  |plating|Plating| .    In 1956, 24% of the cadmium in the United States was used for a second application in red, orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium.     The stabilizing effect of cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on  |PVC|Pvc|  led to an increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined as a result of environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.   At the same time, these decreases in consumption were compensated by a growing demand for cadmium for nickel-cadmium batteries, which accounted for 81% of the cadmium consumption in the United States in 2006.              Cadmium makes up about 0.1   |ppm|Parts_Per_Million|  of  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust| . It is much rarer than zinc, which makes up about 65  ppm.    No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. The only cadmium  |mineral|Mineral|  of importance,  |greenockite|Greenockite|  , is nearly always associated with  |sphalerite|Sphalerite|  . This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree,  |lead|Lead|  and  |copper|Copper| . Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap. Production in the United States began in 1907, but wide use began after World War I.           Metallic cadmium can be found in the  |Vilyuy_River|Vilyuy_River|  basin in  |Siberia|Siberia| .      Rocks mined for phosphate fertilizers contain varying amounts of cadmium, resulting in a cadmium concentration of as much as 300  mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils.   Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in flue dust.  Cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops such as rice.  |Chinese|China| |_ministry_of_agriculture|Ministry_Of_Agriculture_Of_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  measured in 2002 that 28% of  |rice|Rice|  it sampled had excess lead and 10% had excess cadmium above limits defined by law. Some plants such as  |willow_trees|Willow|  and  |poplars|Populus|  have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil.      Typical background concentrations of cadmium do not exceed 5  ng/m 3 in the atmosphere; 2  mg/kg in soil; 1  μg/L in freshwater and 50  ng/L in seawater.          The  |British_Geological_Survey|British_Geological_Survey|  reports that in 2001, China was the top producer of cadmium with almost one-sixth of the worlds production, closely followed by South Korea and Japan.        Cadmium is a common impurity in  |zinc|Zinc|  ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium.    In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc  |sulfide|Sulfide|  ores are roasted in the presence of  |oxygen|Oxygen| , converting the zinc sulfide to the  |oxide|Oxide| . Zinc metal is produced either by  |smelting|Smelting|  the oxide with  |carbon|Carbon|  or by  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  in  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| . Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by  |vacuum_distillation|Vacuum_Distillation|  if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is  |precipitate|Precipitate| d from the electrolysis solution.     |pigments|Cadmium_Pigments| , coatings, and electroplating.          In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in  |batteries|Battery| , predominantly in  |rechargeable|Rechargeable_Battery| |_nickel_cadmium_batteries|Nickel_Cadmium_Battery| . Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2   |V|Volt| . The cell consists of a positive  |nickel_hydroxide|Nickel_Hydroxide| |_electrode|Electrode|  and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an  |alkaline|Alkaline| |_electrolyte|Electrolyte|  .  The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%,  with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.  Another type of battery based on cadmium is the  |silver_cadmium_battery|Silver_Cadmium_Battery| .          Cadmium  |electroplating|Electroplating| , consuming 6% of the global production, is used in the aircraft industry to reduce  |corrosion|Corrosion|  of steel components.  This coating is passivated by  |chromate|Chromate_And_Dichromate|  salts.  A limitation of cadmium plating is  |hydrogen_embrittlement|Hydrogen_Embrittlement|  of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa should be coated by an alternative method .     Titanium embrittlement from cadmium-plated tool residues resulted in banishment of those tools in the A-12/SR-71, U-2, and subsequent aircraft programs that use titanium.        Cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, acting as a very effective neutron poison to control  |neutron_flux|Neutron_Flux|  in  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission| . When cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor, cadmium absorbs neutrons, preventing them from creating additional fission events, thus controlling the amount of reactivity. The  |pressurized_water_reactor|Pressurized_Water_Reactor|  designed by  |Westinghouse_Electric_Company|Westinghouse_Electric_Company|  uses an alloy consisting of 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.        |QLED_TVs|Quantum_Dot_Display|  have been starting to include cadmium in construction. Some companies have been looking to reduce the environmental impact of human exposure and pollution of the material in televisions during production.            |Cadmium_oxide|Cadmium_Oxide|  was used in black and white television phosphors and in the blue and green phosphors of color television cathode ray tubes.   |Cadmium_sulfide|Cadmium_Sulfide|  is used as a photoconductive surface coating for photocopier drums.         Various cadmium salts are used in paint pigments, with CdS as a  |yellow_pigment|Cadmium_Pigments|  being the most common.  |Cadmium_selenide|Cadmium_Selenide|  is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — so much so that during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into  |watercolors|Watercolor| ,  |gouaches|Gouache| ,  |acrylics|Acrylic_Paint| , and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a  |barrier_cream|Barrier_Cream|  on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin  even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.     In  |PVC|Polyvinyl_Chloride| , cadmium was used as heat, light, and weathering stabilizers.  Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of  |solder|Solder|  and bearing alloys, because it has a low  |coefficient_of_friction|Coefficient_Of_Friction|  and fatigue resistance. It is also found in some of the lowest-melting  |alloys|Alloy| , such as  |Woods_metal|Woods_Metal| .           Helium–cadmium lasers are a common source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422  nm in  |fluorescence_microscopes|Fluorescence_Microscope|  and various laboratory experiments.   Cadmium selenide  |quantum_dots|Quantum_Dot|  emit bright  |luminescence|Luminescence|  under UV excitation . The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a  |fluorescence_microscope|Fluorescence_Microscope| .      Cadmium is a component of some compound  |semiconductors|Semiconductor| , such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and  |cadmium_telluride|Cadmium_Telluride| , used for light detection and  |solar_cells|Solar_Cell| .  |HgCdTe|Hgcdte|  is sensitive to  |infrared|Infrared|  light and can be used as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.     In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in  |hypoxia|Hypoxia|  research to stimulate  |proteasome|Proteasome| -dependent degradation of  |Hif_1α|Hypoxia_Inducible_Factors| .        Cadmium-selective sensors based on the  |fluorophore|Fluorophore| |_BODIPY|Bodipy|  have been developed for imaging and sensing of cadmium in cells.    One of the most popular ways to monitor cadmium in aqueous environments is the use of  |electrochemistry|Electrochemistry| , one example is by attaching a  |self_assembled_monolayer|Self_Assembled_Monolayer|  that can help obtain a cadmium selective electrode with a  |ppt|Parts_Per_Notation| -level sensitivity.        Cadmium has no known function in higher organisms, Hogan, C. Michael .  E. Monosson and C. Cleveland . Washington DC. but a cadmium-dependent  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase|  has been found in some marine  |diatoms|Diatom| .  Administration of cadmium to cells causing the oxidative stress and increase the levels of antioxidants to protect the cells against macro molecular damage.  The diatoms live in environments with very low zinc concentrations and cadmium performs the function normally carried out by zinc in other anhydrases. This was discovered with X-ray absorption fluorescence spectroscopy .      The highest concentration of cadmium is absorbed in the kidneys of humans, and up to about 30  mg of cadmium is commonly inhaled throughout human childhood and adolescence.  Cadmium is under preliminary research for its  |toxicity|Toxicity|  in humans, potentially affecting mechanisms and risks of  |cancer|Cancer| ,  |cardiovascular_disease|Cardiovascular_Disease| , and  |osteoporosis|Osteoporosis| .           The biogeochemistry of cadmium and its release to the environment has been the subject of review, as has the speciation of cadmium in the environment.                       Individuals and organizations have been reviewing cadmiums bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity.    The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in  |metal_fume_fever|Metal_Fume_Fever|  but may progress to chemical  |pneumonitis|Pneumonitis| ,  |pulmonary_edema|Pulmonary_Edema| , and death.      Cadmium is also an environmental hazard. Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration. Bread, root crops, and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations. Mann, Denise  HealthDayBy via Yahoo        There have been a few instances of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , mining operations contaminated the  |Jinzū_River|Jinzū_River|  in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed  |itai_itai|Itai_Itai|  disease and renal abnormalities, including  |proteinuria|Proteinuria|  and  |glucosuria|Glucosuria| .  The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.     Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Unions  |Restriction_on_Hazardous_Substances|Rohs|  directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.    The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 58 Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans.     A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.      Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with a large number of illnesses including kidney disease, early atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.  , Medinews Direct, 7 September 2009 Although studies show a significant correlation between cadmium exposure and occurrence of disease in human populations, a necessary molecular mechanism has not been identified. One hypothesis holds that cadmium is an  |endocrine_disruptor|Endocrine_Disruptor|  and some experimental studies have shown that it can interact with different  |hormonal|Hormone|  signaling pathways. For example, cadmium can bind to the  |estrogen_receptor|Estrogen_Receptor|  alpha,   and affect signal transduction along the  |estrogen|Estrogen|  and  |MAPK|Mapk|  signaling pathways at low doses.        The  |tobacco_plant|Tobacco_Plant|  readily absorbs and accumulates  |heavy_metals|Heavy_Metals|  such as cadmium from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the users body following smoke inhalation.  Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. An estimated 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. Absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed.    On average, cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2–3 times greater than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from  |passive_smoking|Passive_Smoking| .      In a non-smoking population, food is the greatest source of exposure. High quantities of cadmium can be found in  |crustaceans|Crustacean| ,  |mollusks|Mollusca| ,  |offal|Offal| , and  |algae|Algae|  products. However, grains, vegetables, and starchy roots and tubers are consumed in much greater quantity in the US, and are the source of the greatest dietary exposure.  Most plants bio-accumulate metal toxins like Cd, and when composted to form organic fertilizers yield a product which can often contain high amounts of metal toxins for every kilo of fertilizer. Fertilizers made from animal dung or urban waste can contain similar amounts of Cd. The Cd added to the soil from fertilizers become bio-available and toxic only if the soil pH is low .     Zn, Cu, Ca, and Fe ions, and selenium with vitamin C are used to treat Cd intoxication, though it is not easily reversed.        Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the  |REACH_Regulation|Reach_Regulation| . . Eur-lex.europa.eu . Retrieved on 5 June 2011.     The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain specifies that 2.5 μg/kg body weight is a tolerable weekly intake for humans. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has declared 7 μg/kg bw to be the provisional tolerable weekly intake level.      The US  |Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration|Occupational_Safety_And_Health_Administration|  has set the  |permissible_exposure_limit|Permissible_Exposure_Limit|  for cadmium at a time-weighted average of 0.005 ppm. The  |National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health|National_Institute_For_Occupational_Safety_And_Health|  has not set a  |recommended_exposure_limit|Recommended_Exposure_Limit|  and has designated cadmium as a known human carcinogen. The  |IDLH|Idlh|  level for cadmium is 9  mg/m 3 .           In May 2006, a sale of the seats from  |Arsenal_F_C_s|Arsenal_F_C_|  old stadium,  |Highbury|Arsenal_Stadium|  in London, England was cancelled when the seats were discovered to contain trace amounts of cadmium.  Reports of high levels of cadmium use in childrens jewelry in 2010 led to a US  |Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission|Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission|  investigation.  The U.S. CPSC issued specific recall notices for cadmium content in jewelry sold by  |Claires|Claires|   and  |Wal_Mart|Wal_Mart|   stores.     In June 2010,  |McDonalds|Mcdonalds|  voluntarily recalled more than 12 million promotional  Shrek Forever After 3D  Collectible Drinking Glasses because of the cadmium levels in paint pigments on the glassware.  The glasses were manufactured by  |Arc_International|Arc_International| , of  |Millville_NJ|Millville_Nj| , USA.
