        Albertosaurus  is a  |genus|Genus|  of  |tyrannosaurid|Tyrannosaurid| |theropod|Theropod| |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|  that lived in western North America during the  |Late_Cretaceous|Late_Cretaceous| |Period|Period| , about 70   |million_years_ago|Million_Years_Ago| . The  |type_species|Type_Species| , A. sarcophagus, was apparently restricted in  |range|Range|  to the modern-day  |Canadian_province|Canadian_Province|  of  |Alberta|Alberta| , after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing  Gorgosaurus libratus  as a second species.     As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a  |biped|Biped| al  |predator|Predator|  with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the  |food_chain|Food_Chain|  in its local  |ecosystem|Ecosystem| . While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than 2 metric tons.     Since the first discovery in 1884,  |fossils|Fossil|  of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of  |pack|Pack_Hunter|  behaviour and allows studies of  |ontogeny|Ontogeny|  and  |population_biology|Population_Biology| , which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.          Albertosaurus was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as  Tarbosaurus  and Tyrannosaurus. Typical Albertosaurus adults measured up to  long,   while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over  long.  Several independent mass estimates, obtained by different methods, suggest that an adult Albertosaurus weighed between 1.3   |tonnes|Tonne|   and 1.7 tonnes .      Albertosaurus shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids. Typically for a theropod, Albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and  |torso|Torso|  with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the  |hallux|Hallux| , was short and did not reach the ground. The third digit was longer than the rest. Albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14−21  km/hour .  At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.     Two skin impressions from Albertosaurus are known, both showing  |scales|Scale| .  One patch is found with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long, unknown bone, indicating that the patch is from the belly. The scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape. Also preserved are two larger feature scales, placed 4,5  cm apart from each other. Another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body. These scales are small, diamond-shaped and arranged in rows.          The massive  |skull|Skull|  of Albertosaurus, which was perched on a short, S-shaped neck, was about  long in the largest adults.  Wide openings in the skull  reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for  |muscle|Muscle|  attachment and  |sensory_organs|Sensory_Organ| . Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth,  Gorgosaurus  at least 62. Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were  |heterodont|Heterodont| , with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The  |premaxilla|Premaxilla| ry teeth at the tip of the upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in  |cross_section|Cross_Section| . Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons.  Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate. Albertosaurus.

Lincolnwood, Illinois: Publications International, Ltd., 1993. pp.  106–107. .       |William_Abler|William_Abler|  observed in 2001 that Albertosaurus  |tooth_serrations|Tooth_Serrations|  resemble a  |crack|Fracture|  in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Abler, W.L. 2001. A kerf-and-drill model of tyrannosaur tooth serrations. p.  84–89. In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life. Ed.s Tanke, D. H., Carpenter, K., Skrepnick, M. W. Indiana University Press. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger  |surface_area|Surface_Area| , and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity to wood they work. The use of a  |drill|Drill|  to create an ampulla of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called kerfs and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like  |phytosaurs|Phytosaur|  and  Dimetrodon  had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.              Albertosaurus was named by  |Henry_Fairfield_Osborn|Henry_Fairfield_Osborn|  in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of Tyrannosaurus rex.   The name honours  |Alberta|Alberta| , the  |Canadian_province|Canadian_Province|  established the same year, in which the first remains were found. The generic name also incorporates the  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  term σαυρος/sauros , the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The  |type_species|Type_Species|  is Albertosaurus sarcophagus; the  |specific_name|Specific_Name|  is derived from Ancient Greek σαρκοφάγος  meaning flesh-eating and having the same  |etymology|Etymology|  as the  |funeral_container|Sarcophagus|  with which it shares its name: a combination of the Greek words σαρξ/ and φαγειν/ . More than 30 specimens of all ages are known to science.          The  |type_specimen|Type_Specimen|  is a partial skull, collected in the summer of 1884 from an  |outcrop|Outcrop|  of the  |Horseshoe_Canyon_Formation|Horseshoe_Canyon_Formation|  alongside the  |Red_Deer_River|Red_Deer_River| , in Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the  |Geological_Survey_of_Canada|Geological_Survey_Of_Canada| , led by the famous  |geologist|Geologist| |Joseph_Burr_Tyrrell|Joseph_Tyrrell| . Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrrells colleague  |Thomas_Chesmer_Weston|Thomas_Chesmer_Weston|  found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby.  The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species Laelaps incrassatus by  |Edward_Drinker_Cope|Edward_Drinker_Cope|  in 1892,  although the name Laelaps was  |preoccupied|International_Code_Of_Zoological_Nomenclature|  by a genus of  |mite|Mite|  and had been changed to  Dryptosaurus  in 1877 by  |Othniel_Charles_Marsh|Othniel_Charles_Marsh| . Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. However,  |Lawrence_Lambe|Lawrence_Lambe|  used the name Dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of Laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904,   a combination first coined by  |Oliver_Perry_Hay|Oliver_Perry_Hay|  in 1902. Hay, Oliver Perry, 1902 Bibliography and Catalogue of the Fossil Vertebrata of North America. Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey, N° 117, Government Printing Office. pp 868 Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that D. incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of D. aquilunguis, type species of Dryptosaurus, so Osborn created the new name Albertosaurus sarcophagus for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambes complete description the year before. Both specimens  are stored in the  |Canadian_Museum_of_Nature|Canadian_Museum_Of_Nature|  in  |Ottawa|Ottawa| . By the early twenty-first century, some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, Albertosaurus might be a  nomen dubium , a dubious name that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in 2010,  |Thomas_Carr|Thomas_Carr|  established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or  |autapomorphy|Autapomorphy| |palatine_bone|Palatine_Bone| , proving that Albertosaurus was a valid  |taxon|Taxon| .
