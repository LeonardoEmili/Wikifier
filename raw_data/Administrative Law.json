It is a part of the public law, which deals with the organization, the tasks and the acting of the public administration. It also contains rules, regulations, orders and decisions created by and related to administrative agencies, such as federal agencies, federal state authorities, urban administrations, but also admission offices and fiscal authorities etc. Administrative law in Germany follows three basic principles.     Principle of the legality of the authority, which means that there is no acting against the law and no acting without a law.   Principle of legal security, which includes a principle of legal certainty and the principle of nonretroactivity   Principle of proportionality, which says that an act of an authority has to be suitable, necessary and appropriate Oberath, öffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht pp. 12–14     Administrative law in Germany can be divided into general administrative law and special administrative law.

Oberath, öffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht p. 148     Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz , which was enacted in 1977, Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar No. 1 and 26 regulates the main administrative procedures of the federal government. It serves the purpose to ensure a treatment in accordance with the rule of law by the public authority. Furthermore, it contains the regulations for mass processes and expands the legal protection against the authorities. The VwVfG basically applies for the entire public administrative activities of federal agencies as well as federal state authorities, in case of making federal law. One of the central clause is § 35 VwVfG. It defines the administrative act, the most common form of action in which the public administration occurs against a citizen. The definition in § 35  says, that an administration act is characterized by the following features:     It is an official act Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No.59 of an authority Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No.65 in the field of public law Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No.70 to resolve an individual case Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No. 118 with effect to the outside.

There is however a single General Administrative Law Act that applies both to the making of administrative decisions and the judicial review of these decisions in courts. On the basis of the Awb, citizens can oppose a decision made by an administrative agency within the administration and apply for judicial review in courts if unsuccessful.     Unlike France or Germany, there are no special administrative courts of first instance in the Netherlands, but regular courts have an administrative chamber which specializes in administrative appeals. The courts of appeal in administrative cases however are specialized depending on the case, but most administrative appeals end up in the judicial section of the Council of State .     Before going to court, citizens must usually first object to the decision with the administrative body who made it. This is called bezwaar . This procedure allows for the administrative body to correct possible mistakes themselves and is used to filter cases before going to court. Sometimes, instead of bezwaar, a different system is used called administratief beroep . The difference with bezwaar is that administratief beroep is filed with a different administrative body, usually a higher ranking one, than the administrative body that made the primary decision.

Since the 1980s, the Peoples Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws is vastly inadequate in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.     In 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations were passed. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations changed the way government officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. The three regulations have been amended and upgraded into laws. In 1994, the State Compensation Law was passed, followed by the Administrative Penalties Law in 1996.

It is important to note, though, that agencies can only act within their congressionally delegated authority, New York v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 535 U.S. 1, 18 . and must comply with the requirements of the APA.     At state level the first version of the Model State Administrative Procedure Act was promulgated and published in 1946 by the Uniform Law Commission , in which year the Federal Administrative Procedure Act was drafted. It is incorporated basic principles with only enough elaboration of detail to support essential features, therefore it is a “model”, and not a “uniform”, act. A model act is needed because state administrative law in the states is not uniform, and there are a variety of approaches used in the various states. Later it was modified in 1961 and 1981. The present version is the 2010 Model State Administrative Procedure Act  which maintains the continuity with earlier ones. The reason of the revision is that, in the past two decades state legislatures, dissatisfied with agency rule-making and adjudication, have enacted statutes that modify administrative adjudication and rule-making procedure.
