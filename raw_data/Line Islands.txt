         The Line Islands, Teraina Islands or Equatorial Islands, is a chain of  |atolls|Atoll|   and  |coral_islands|Coral_Island|  .  |Kingman_Reef|Kingman_Reef|  is largely submerged and  |Filippo_Reef|Filippo_Reef|  is shown on some maps, although its existence is doubted. The islands were formed by volcanic activity and are located in the central  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| , south of the  |Hawaiian_Islands|Hawaiian_Islands| . The 11 islands stretch for  in a northwest–southeast direction, making it one of the longest island chains of the world. Eight of the islands form part of  |Kiribati|Kiribati| , while the remaining three are  |United_States|United_States|  territories grouped with the  |United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands|United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands| . Only  |Kiritimati|Kiritimati|  and  |Tabuaeran|Tabuaeran|  atolls and  |Teraina|Teraina|  Island have a permanent population.     The  |International_Date_Line|International_Date_Line|  passes through the Line Islands. The Line Islands that are part of Kiribati are in the worlds farthest forward  |time_zone|Time_Zone| ,  |UTC+14:00|Utc+14:00| . The time of day is the same as in the  |U.S._state|U.S._State|  of  |Hawaii|Hawaii| , but the date is one day ahead. The time is 1 day and 2 hours ahead of some other islands in  |Oceania|Oceania|  like  |Baker_Island|Baker_Island| , which uses  |UTC−12:00|Utc−12:00| .       Most 18th-century visitors to these isles overlooked the tell-tale signs of former Polynesian settlement. This is true of Captain Cook, who landed on Kiritimati in 1777, and Captain Fanning during his visits to Teraina and Tabuaeran in 1798. Archaeologists have since identified remains of coral marae platforms and/or village complexes on all three, as well as on Malden, Millennium Atoll and Flint Island. These remains are dateable as far back as the 14th century, and show that the inhabitants of the Line Islands were more than just castaways.        |Whaling|Whaling|  ships were regular visitors to the islands in the 19th century, in search of water, wood and provisions. The first recorded visit was by the whaler Coquette to  |Christmas_Island|Kiritimati|  in 1822. Robert Langdon Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands by American whalers in the 19th century, Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, 1984, p.149.  The islands of Fanning and Washington were annexed as part of the British Colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1916, Order in Council Annexing the Ocean, Fanning, and Washington islands to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, 1916 followed in 1919 by the similar annexation of Christmas Island. Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895, Annexing Christmas Island to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, 1919 However, these annexations were contested by the government of the United States, citing its  |Guano_Islands_Act_of_1856|Guano_Islands_Act_Of_1856| , which allowed for very wide-ranging territorial claims. The latter claims persisted until relinquished under the  |Treaty_of_Tarawa|Treaty_Of_Tarawa| , which recognised Kiribatis sovereignty over the majority of the Line Islands chain. In the meantime, the Line Islands featured briefly in biennial reports furnished by the Colonys resident commissioner to the Colonial Office and Parliament in London .     The group is geographically divided into three subgroups; The Northern, Central, and Southern Line Islands. The Central Line Islands are sometimes grouped with the Southern Line Islands. The table below lists the islands from North to South.            The lagoon areas marked with an asterisk are contained within the island areas of the previous column because they are, unlike in the case of a typical atoll, inland waters completely sealed off from the sea.     Kiritimati is the largest  |atoll|Atoll|  in the world in terms of land area. The islands were annexed by the  |UK|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland|  in 1888 with a view to laying the  |Pacific_cable|All_Red_Line| , with Tabuaeran as a relay station. The cable was laid and was operational between 1902 and 1963 except for a short period in 1914 .      |Copra|Copra|  and Petfish are the main export products .              On December 23, 1994, the Republic of Kiribati announced a change of  |time_zone|Time_Zone|  for the Line Islands, to take effect December 31, 1994. This adjustment effectively moved the International Date Line over  to the east within Kiribati, placing all of Kiribati on the Asian or western side of the date line, despite the fact that Carolines longitude of 150 degrees west corresponds to  |UTC−10|Utc-10|  rather than its official time zone of  |UTC+14|Utc+14| . Caroline Island now is at the same time as the Hawaiian Islands , but one day ahead.  This move made Caroline Island both the easternmost land in the earliest time zone , and one of the first points of land which would see sunrise on January 1, 2000 — at 5:43  a.m., as measured by local time.       The stated reason for the move was a campaign promise of Kiribati President  |Teburoro_Tito|Teburoro_Tito|  to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati straddling the Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days. However, Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt to capitalize on the nations new status as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000.  Other Pacific nations, including  |Tonga|Tonga|  and New Zealands  |Chatham_Islands|Chatham_Islands| , protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000.        In 1999, in order to further capitalize upon the massive public interest in celebrations marking  |the_arrival_of_the_year_2000|Millennium_Celebrations| , Caroline Island was officially renamed Millennium Island. Although uninhabited, a special celebration was held on the island, featuring performances by Kiribati native entertainers and attended by Kiribati president Tito.  Over 70 Kiribati singers and dancers traveled to Caroline from the capital  |Tarawa|South_Tarawa| , .
