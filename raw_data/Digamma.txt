           Digamma, waw, or wau is an  |archaic_letter|Archaic_Greek_Alphabets|  of the  |Greek_alphabet|Greek_Alphabet| . It originally stood for the sound  but it has remained in use principally as a  |Greek_numeral|Greek_Numeral|  for  |6|6| . Whereas it was originally called waw or wau, its most common appellation in classical Greek is digamma; as a numeral, it was called episēmon during the Byzantine era and is now known as  stigma  after the  |Byzantine_ligature|Greek_Ligature|  combining σ-τ as ϛ.     Digamma or wau was part of the original archaic Greek alphabet as initially adopted from  |Phoenician|Phoenician_Alphabet| . Like its model, Phoenician  |waw|Waw| , it represented the  |voiced_labial-velar_approximant|Voiced_Labial-Velar_Approximant|   and stood in the 6th position in the alphabet between  |epsilon|Epsilon|  and  |zeta|Zeta| . It is the consonantal doublet of the vowel letter  |upsilon|Upsilon|  , which was also derived from waw but was placed near the end of the Greek alphabet. Digamma or wau is in turn the ancestor of the  |Latin_letter|Latin_Alphabet| |F|F| . As an alphabetic letter, it is attested in archaic and dialectal  |ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek_Language| |inscriptions|Inscription|  until the classical period.     The shape of the letter went through a development from  through , , ,  to  or , which at that point was conflated with the σ-τ ligature . In modern print, a distinction is made between the letter in its original alphabetic role as a consonant sign, which is rendered as Ϝ or its modern lowercase variant ϝ , and the numeric symbol, which is represented by ϛ . In  |modern_Greek|Modern_Greek| , this is often replaced by the digraph .                The sound  existed in  |Mycenean_Greek|Mycenean_Greek| , as attested in  |Linear_B|Linear_B|  and archaic Greek inscriptions using digamma. It is also confirmed by the  |Hittite|Hittite_Language|  name of  |Troy|Troy| , Wilusa, corresponding to the Greek name Wilion.       The  sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period.     In  |Ionic|Ionic_Greek| ,  had probably disappeared before  |Homers|Homer|  epics were written down , but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the  |meter|Meter|  defective. For example, the word  |ἄναξ|Anax|  , and is attested in this form in Mycenaean Greek   wine  |tt|Tt|  .
