     The Cold War  is the period within the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  from the  |Truman_Doctrine|Truman_Doctrine|  in 1947 to the conclusion of the  |Korean_War|Korean_War|  in 1953. The  |Cold_War_emerged_in_Europe|Origins_Of_The_Cold_War|  a few years after the successful US–USSR–UK coalition won  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in Europe, and extended to 1989–91. In 1947,  |Bernard_Baruch|Bernard_Baruch| , the multimillionaire financier and adviser to presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman, coined the term “Cold War” to describe the increasingly chilly relations between two World War II Allies: the United States and the Soviet Union.     Some conflicts between the West and the USSR appeared earlier. In 1945–46 the US and UK strongly protested Soviet political takeover efforts in Eastern Europe and  |Iran|Iran_Crisis_Of_1946| , while the hunt for Soviet spies made the tensions more visible. However historians emphasize the decisive break between the US–UK and the USSR came in 1947–48 over such issues as the  |Truman_Doctrine|Truman_Doctrine| , the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan|  and the  |Berlin_Blockade|Berlin_Blockade| , followed by the formation of  |NATO|Nato|  in 1949.The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a partially different timing outside Europe.             During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the Soviet Union annexed several countries as  |Soviet_Socialist_Republics|Soviet_Socialist_Republics|  within the  |Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics|Union_Of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics| . Most of those countries had been ceded to it by the secret agreement portion of the  |Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|  with  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| .

The reality is that most of these Eastern European countries were also part of Stalins other secret agreement; this one with Winston Churchill, agreed to at the  |4th_Moscow_Conference_in_1944|Moscow_Conference|  and called the  |Percentages_Agreement|Percentages_Agreement| . This only became known about in 1953 when Churchill published his memoirs.  Resis research illustrates that Roosevelt was well aware of this agreement but only gave conditional support to Churchill after receiving updated information regarding the talks; however, prior to the meeting Roosevelt had informed Stalin that in this global war, there is no question, political or military, that the United States is not interested and as such, the 4th October 1944 is arguably the day the Cold War started.     The list of world leaders at the beginning of these years are as follows:     1947–49:  |Clement_Attlee|Clement_Attlee|  ;  |Harry_Truman|Harry_Truman|  ;  |Vincent_Auriol|Vincent_Auriol|  ;  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  ;  |Chiang_Kai_shek|Chiang_Kai_Shek|    1950–51:  |Clement_Attlee|Clement_Attlee|  ;  |Harry_Truman|Harry_Truman|  ;  |Vincent_Auriol|Vincent_Auriol|  ;  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  ;  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong|    1952–53:  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  ;  |Harry_Truman|Harry_Truman|  ;  |Vincent_Auriol|Vincent_Auriol|  ;  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  ;  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong|      In  |Hungary|Hungary| , when the Soviets installed a communist government,  |Mátyás_Rákosi|Mátyás_Rákosi|  was appointed  |General_Secretary|General_Secretary|  of the  |Hungarian_Communist_Party|Hungarian_Communist_Party| , Sugar, Peter F., Peter Hanak and  |Tibor_Frank|Tibor_Frank| , A History of Hungary, Indiana University Press, 1994, , pp. 375–77 which began one of the harshest dictatorships in Europe Granville, Johanna, The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956, Texas A & M University Press, 2004.

In  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| , toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union crossed the border and created the conditions for a communist  |coup_détat|Bulgarian_Coup_Détat_Of_1944|  on the following night.  The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the communists whom he instructed, including  |Kimon_Georgiev|Kimon_Georgiev|  , took full control of domestic politics in the  |Peoples_Republic_of_Bulgaria|Peoples_Republic_Of_Bulgaria| .     With Soviet backing, the  |Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|Communist_Party_Of_Czechoslovakia|  assumed undisputed control over the government of Czechoslovakia in the  |Czechoslovak_coup_détat_of_1948|Czechoslovak_Coup_Détat_Of_1948| , ushering in a dictatorship.    In the  |Romanian_general_election_of_1946|1946_Romanian_General_Election| , the  |Romanian_Communist_Party|Romanian_Communist_Party|  employed widespread intimidation tactics and electoral fraud to obtain 80 percent of the vote and, thereafter, eliminated the role of the centrist parties and forced mergers, the result of which was that, by 1948, most non-Communist politicians were either executed, in exile or in prison. In the  |December_1945_Albanian_election|1945_Albanian_Parliamentary_Election| , the only effective ballot choices were those of the communist  |Democratic_Front_|Democratic_Front| , led by  |Enver_Hoxha|Enver_Hoxha| .  In 1946, Albania was declared the  |Peoples_Republic_of_Albania|Peoples_Republic_Of_Albania| .     Initially, Stalin directed systems in the Eastern Bloc countries that rejected Western institutional characteristics of  |market_economies|Market_Economy| , democratic governance  and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.  They were economically communist and depended upon the Soviet Union for significant amounts of materials.  While in the first five years following World War II, massive emigration from these states to the West occurred, restrictions implemented thereafter stopped most East-West migration, except that under limited bilateral and other agreements.        The immediate post-1945 period may have been the historical high point for the popularity of  |communist|Communism|  ideology. The burdens the  |Red_Army|Red_Army|  and the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  endured had earned it massive respect which, had it been fully exploited by  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin| , had a good chance of resulting in a communist Europe. Communist parties achieved a significant popularity in such nations as  |China|China| ,  |Greece|Greece| ,  |Iran|Iran| , and the  |Republic_of_Mahabad|Republic_Of_Mahabad| . Communist parties had already come to power in  |Romania|Romania| ,  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| ,  |Albania|Albania| , and  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| . The  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  and the  |United_States|United_States|  were concerned that electoral victories by communist parties in any of these countries could lead to sweeping economic and political change in  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe| .             Having lost 27 million people in the war, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germanys capacity for another war, and pushed for such in wartime conferences. The resulting  |Morgenthau_plan|Morgenthau_Plan|  policy foresaw returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry. Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with  |Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| |_James_F_Byrnes|James_F_Byrnes|  speech  |Restatement_of_Policy_on_Germany|Restatement_Of_Policy_On_Germany| .  |John_Gimbel|John_Gimbel|   Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2. , pp. 242–269.     In January 1947, Truman appointed General  |George_Marshall|George_Marshall|  as Secretary of State, and enacted JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.  The directive comported with the view of General  |Lucius_D_Clay|Lucius_D_Clay|  and the  |Joint_Chief_of_Staff|Joint_Chief_Of_Staff|  over growing communist influence in  |Germany|Germany| , as well as of the failure of the rest of the European economy to recover without the German industrial base on which it previously had been dependent. Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister  |Vyacheslav_Molotov|Vyacheslav_Molotov|  and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.  After six weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned. Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems. The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer. In a June 5, 1947 speech, Marshall, George C,  The Marshal Plan Speech , June 5, 1947 comporting with the  |Truman_Doctrine|Truman_Doctrine| , Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan| .     Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet  |Eastern_bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  countries of the newly formed  |Cominform|Cominform|  from accepting  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan|  aid. In  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , that required a Soviet-backed  |Czechoslovak_coup_détat_of_1948|Czechoslovak_Coup_Détat_Of_1948| , Airbridge to Berlin, Eye of the Storm chapter the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.              Both East and West regarded  |Greece|Greece|  as a nation well within the  |sphere_of_influence|Sphere_Of_Influence|  of Britain. Stalin had respected the  |percentages_agreement|Percentages_Agreement|  with Winston Churchill to not intervene, but Yugoslavia and Albania defied the USSRs policy and sent supplies during the  |Greek_Civil_War|Greek_Civil_War|  to the army of the  |Communist_Party_of_Greece|Communist_Party_Of_Greece| , the  |DSE|Democratic_Army_Of_Greece|  . The UK had given aid to the royalist Greek forces, leaving the Communists at a disadvantaged position. However, by 1947, the near-bankrupt British government could no longer maintain its massive overseas commitments. In addition to granting  |independence_to_India|Partition_Of_India|  and handing back the  |Palestinian_Mandate|British_Mandate_For_Palestine|  to the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| , the British government decided to withdraw from both Greece and nearby Turkey. This would have left the two nations, in particular Greece, on the brink of a communist-led revolution.     Notified that British aid to Greece and Turkey would end in less than six weeks, and already hostile towards and suspicious of Soviet intentions, because of their  |reluctance_to_withdraw_from_Iran|Iran_Crisis_Of_1946| , the Truman administration decided that additional action was necessary. With  |Congress|United_States_Congress|  solidly in  |Republican|United_States_Republican_Party|  hands, and with  |isolationist|Isolationism|  sentiment strong among the U.S. public, Truman adopted an ideological approach. In a meeting with congressional leaders, the argument of apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one was used to convince them of the significance in supporting Greece and Turkey. It was to become the  |domino_theory|Domino_Theory|  . On the morning of March 12, 1947, President  |Harry_S_Truman|Harry_S_Truman|  appeared before Congress to ask for $400 million of aid to Greece and Turkey. Calling on congressional approval for the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures, or in short a policy of  |containment|Containment|  , Truman articulated a presentation of the ideological struggle that became known as the Truman Doctrine. Although based on a simplistic analysis of internal strife in Greece and Turkey, it became the single dominating influence over U.S. policy until at least the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| .     Trumans speech had a tremendous effect. The anti-communist feelings that had just begun to hatch in the U.S. were given a great boost, and a silenced Congress voted overwhelmingly in approval of aid. The United States would not withdraw back to the  |Western_Hemisphere|Western_Hemisphere|  as it had after  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . From then on, the U.S. actively fought communist advances anywhere in the globe under the ostensible causes of freedom , democracy and human rights. The U.S. brandished its role as the leader of the free world. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union brandished its position as the leader of the progressive and anti-imperialist camp.     Nazi–Soviet relations and Falsifiers of History   Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the  |U_S_State_Department|United_States_Department_Of_State|  also published a collection of documents titled Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office, which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|   revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the  |Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact_Negotiations| , including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,   the  |1939_German–Soviet_Commercial_Agreement|German–Soviet_Commercial_Agreement| ,  and  |discussions_of_the_Soviet_Union_potentially_becoming_the_fourth_Axis_Power|German–Soviet_Axis_Talks| .      In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published  Falsifiers of History , a Stalin edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.   The book did not attempt to directly counter or deal with the documents published in Nazi-Soviet Relations  and rather, focused upon Western culpability for the outbreak of war in 1939. It argues that Western powers aided Nazi rearmament and aggression, including that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward. The book also included the claim that, during the Pacts operation, Stalin rejected Hitlers offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning  |the_Soviet_offers_to_join_the_Axis|German–Soviet_Axis_Talks| .  Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events  |until_the_Soviet_Unions_dissolution|Dissolution_Of_The_Soviet_Union| .             After the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan| , the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased  |Reichsmark|Reichsmark|  and massive electoral losses for communist parties in 1946, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to  |Berlin|Berlin| . On the day of the Berlin Blockade, a Soviet representative told the other occupying powers We are warning both you and the population of Berlin that we shall apply economic and administrative sanctions that will lead to circulation in Berlin exclusively of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone.      Thereafter, street and water communications were severed, rail and barge traffic was stopped and the Soviets initially stopped supplying food to the civilian population in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.  Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the other occupying powers had previously relied on Soviet good will for access to Berlin, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.      By February 1948, because of massive post-war military cuts, the entire United States army had been reduced to 552,000 men.  Military forces in non-Soviet Berlin sectors totaled only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.  Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled one and a half million men.  The two United States regiments in Berlin would have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.  Believing that Britain, France and the United States had little option other than to acquiesce, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany celebrated the beginning of the blockade.  Thereafter, a massive aerial supply campaign of food, water and other goods was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries. MAC and the Legacy of the Berlin Airlift The Soviets derided the futile attempts of the Americans to save face and to maintain their untenable position in Berlin. , C.V. Glines The success of the airlift eventually caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.     However, the Soviet Army was still capable of conquering Western Europe without much difficulty. In September 1948, US military intelligence experts estimated that the Soviets had about 485,000 troops in their German occupation zone and in Poland, and some 1.785 million troops in Europe in total.  At the same time, the number of US troops in 1948 was about 140,000.           After disagreements between Yugoslavian leader  |Josip_Broz_Tito|Josip_Broz_Tito|  and the Soviet Union regarding Greece and the  |Peoples_Republic_of_Albania|Peoples_Republic_Of_Albania| , a  |Tito–Stalin_Split|Tito–Stalin_Split|  occurred, followed by Yugoslavia being expelled from the  |Cominform|Cominform|  in June 1948 and a brief failed Soviet putsch in Belgrade.  The split created two separate communist forces in Europe. A vehement campaign against Titoism was immediately started in the Eastern Bloc, describing agents of both the West and Tito in all places engaging in subversive activity. This resulted in the persecution of many major party cadres, including those in East Germany.           The United States joined Britain, France, Canada, Denmark, Portugal, Norway, Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, Italy, and the Netherlands in 1949 to form the  |North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|  , the United States first entangling European alliance in 170 years. West Germany, Spain, Greece, and Turkey would later join this alliance. The Eastern leaders retaliated against these steps by integrating the economies of their nations in  |Comecon|Comecon| , their version of the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan| ; exploding the first Soviet  |atomic_device|Nuclear_Weapon|  in 1949; signing an alliance with  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  in February 1950; and forming the  |Warsaw_Pact|Warsaw_Pact| , Eastern Europes counterpart to NATO, in 1955. The Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland founded this military alliance.       U.S. officials quickly moved to escalate and expand containment. In a secret 1950 document,  |NSC_68|Nsc_68| , they proposed to strengthen their alliance systems, quadruple defense spending, and embark on an elaborate propaganda campaign to convince the U.S. public to fight this costly cold war. Truman ordered the development of a  |hydrogen_bomb|Hydrogen_Bomb| . In early 1950, the U.S. took its first efforts to oppose communist forces in Vietnam; planned to form a West German army, and prepared proposals for a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases there.       The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a partially different timing and trajectory outside Europe. Odd Arne Westad, The Cold War: A World History pp. 2–7.     In Africa, decolonization took place first; it was largely accomplished in the 1950s. The main rivals then sought bases of support in the new national political alignments. James H. Meriwether, “Endangering the Security of the Free World: Africa, the United States, and the Cold War,” New England Journal of History 64 , pp. 90–101. In Latin America, the first major confrontation took place in Guatemala in 1954. When the new Castro government of Cuba turned to Soviets support in 1960, Cuba became the center of the anti-American Cold War forces, supported by the Soviet Union. Richard H. Immerman, Guatemala as Cold War History, Political Science Quarterly 953 : 629-653.  Lester Langley, ed. The United States, Cuba, and the Cold War; American Failure Or Communist Conspiracy?          As Japan collapsed in 1945 the civil war resumed in China between the  |Kuomintang|Kuomintang|  led by Generalissimo  |Chiang_Kai_shek|Chiang_Kai_Shek|  and the  |Communist_Party_of_China|Communist_Party_Of_China|  led by  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong| . The USSR had signed a Treaty of Friendship with the Kuomintang in 1945 and disavowed support for the Chinese Communists. The outcome was closely fought, with the Communists finally prevailing with superior military tactics. Although the Nationalists had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, initially controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries, and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the  |long_war_with_Japan|Second_Sino_Japanese_War|  and the attendant internal responsibilities. In addition, the Chinese Communists were able to fill the political vacuum left in  |Manchuria|Manchuria|  after Soviet forces withdrew from the area and thus gained Chinas prime industrial base. The Chinese Communists were able to fight their way from the north and northeast, and virtually all of  |mainland_China|Mainland_China|  was taken by the end of 1949. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  . Chiang Kai-shek and 600,000 Nationalist troops and 2 million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from the mainland to the island of  |Taiwan|Taiwan| . In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed  |Taipei|Taipei|  the temporary capital of the Republic of China and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.     The continued hostility between the Communists on the mainland and the Nationalists on Taiwan continued throughout the Cold War. Though the United States refused to aide Chiang Kai-shek in his hope to recover the mainland, it continued supporting the Republic of China with military supplies and expertise to prevent Taiwan from falling into PRC hands. Through the support of the Western bloc , the Republic of China on Taiwan retained  |Chinas_seat_in_the_United_Nations|China_And_The_United_Nations|  until 1971.             In early 1950, the United States made its first commitment to form a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases. Some observers  believed that the Japanese treaty led Stalin to approve a plan to invade U.S.-supported  |South_Korea|South_Korea|  on June 25, 1950.  |Korea|Korea|  had been divided at the end of World War II along the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones, in which a communist government was installed in the  |North|North_Korea|  by the Soviets, and an elected government in the South came to power after UN-supervised elections in 1948.     In June 1950,  |Kim_Il_sungs|Kim_Il_Sung| |_North_Korean_Peoples_Army|Korean_Peoples_Army|  invaded South Korea.  Fearing that communist Korea under a Kim Il Sung dictatorship could threaten Japan and foster other communist movements in Asia, Truman committed U.S. forces and obtained help from the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  to counter the North Korean invasion. The Soviets boycotted  |UN_Security_Council|Un_Security_Council|  meetings while protesting the Councils failure to seat the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  and, thus, did not veto the Councils approval of UN action to oppose the North Korean invasion. A joint UN force of personnel from South Korea, the  |United_States|United_States| ,  |Britain|United_Kingdom| ,  |Turkey|Turkey| ,  |Canada|Canada| ,  |Australia|Australia| ,  |France|France| , the  |Philippines|Philippines| , the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| ,  |Belgium|Belgium| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  and other countries joined to stop the invasion.

R., This Kind of War: The Classic Korean War History, Brasseys, 2001, , page 305 After a Chinese invasion to assist the North Koreans, fighting stabilized along the 38th parallel, which had separated the Koreas. Truman faced a hostile China, a Sino-Soviet partnership, and a defense budget that had quadrupled in eighteen months.     The  |Korean_Armistice_Agreement|Korean_Armistice_Agreement|  was signed in July 1953 after the death of Stalin, who had been insisting that the North Koreans continue fighting.  In North Korea, Kim Il-sung created a highly centralized and brutal  |dictatorship|Dictatorship| , according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable  |cult_of_personality|Cult_Of_Personality| .

Such bombs were first deployed in the 1960s.               Fear of a nuclear war spurred the production of public safety films by the  |United_States_federal_governments|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_States| |_Civil_Defense|Civil_Defense|  branch that demonstrated ways on protecting oneself from a Soviet nuclear attack. The 1951 childrens film  Duck and Cover  is a prime example.     George Orwells classic dystopia  |Nineteen_Eighty_Four|Nineteen_Eighty_Four|  was published in 1949. The novel explores life in an imagined future world where a totalitarian government has achieved terrifying levels of power and control. With Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell taps into the anti-communist fears that would continue to haunt so many in the West for decades to come. In a Cold War setting his descriptions could hardly fail to evoke comparison to Soviet communism and the seeming willingness of Stalin and his successors to control those within the Soviet bloc by whatever means necessary. Orwells famous allegory of totalitarian rule,  |Animal_Farm|Animal_Farm| , published in 1945, provoked similar anti-communist sentiments.       The Cold War generated innumerable documents.
