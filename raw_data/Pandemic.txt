     A pandemic  is an  |epidemic|Epidemic|  of  |disease|Disease|  that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple  |continents|Continents| , or even worldwide.   A widespread  |endemic|Endemic|  disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further,  |flu_pandemics|Influenza_Pandemic|  generally exclude recurrences of  |seasonal_flu|Seasonal_Flu| . Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as  |smallpox|Smallpox|  and  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| . One of the most devastating pandemics was the  |Black_Death|Black_Death| , which killed over 20 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the  |HIV|Hiv|  pandemic as well as the  |1918|1918_Flu_Pandemic|  and  |2009|2009_Flu_Pandemic| |H1N1|Influenza_A_Virus_Subtype_H1N1|  pandemics.            A pandemic is an  |epidemic|Epidemic|  occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.  Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms or in other organisms.     The  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.  , World Health Organization 2009     A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance,  |cancer|Cancer|  is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.      In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ad interim for Health Security and Environment, WHO said An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: What is a global outbreak? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus.      In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.    All versions of this document refer to influenza. The phases are defined by the spread of the disease;  |virulence|Virulence|  and  |mortality|Mortality_Rate|  are not mentioned in the current WHO definition, although these factors have previously been included.                     |HIV|Hiv|  originated in Africa, and spread to the United States via Haiti between 1966 and 1972.   |AIDS|Aids|  is currently a pandemic, with infection rates as high as 25% in southern and eastern Africa. In 2006, the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women in  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  was 29.1%.  Effective education about safer sexual practices and  |bloodborne_infection|Bloodborne_Infection|  precautions training have helped to slow down infection rates in several African countries sponsoring national education programs. Infection rates are rising again in Asia and the Americas. The AIDS death toll in  |Africa|Africa|  may reach 90–100 million by 2025.             There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human  |history|History| , generally  |zoonoses|Zoonosis|  which came about with the  |domestication|Domestication|  of animals, such as  |influenza|Influenza|  and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the mere destruction of cities:    |Plague_of_Athens|Plague_Of_Athens| , from 430 to 426 BC.

This disease fatally weakened the dominance of  |Athens|Athens| , but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years.

The New York Times, October 15, 1995.                     Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as  |Ebola_virus_disease|Ebola_Virus_Disease| ,  |Lassa_fever_virus|Lassa_Fever_Virus| ,  |Rift_Valley_fever|Rift_Valley_Fever| ,  |Marburg_virus|Marburg_Virus|  and  |Bolivian_hemorrhagic_fever|Bolivian_Hemorrhagic_Fever|  are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics.  Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected  |vector|Vector| , and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly  |quarantine|Quarantine|  vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.          Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as  |superbugs|Antibiotic_Resistance|  , may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.  . Pasteur.fr For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of  |multidrug-resistant_tuberculosis|Multidrug-Resistant_Tuberculosis|  are estimated to occur worldwide. . World Health Organization. China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB. . Guardian.co.uk. April 1, 2009 The  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of  |MDR_TB|Mdr_Tb|  were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis  was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates. . CNN.com     In the past 20 years, common bacteria including  Staphylococcus aureus ,  Serratia marcescens  and  |Enterococcus|Enterococcus| , have developed resistance to various  |antibiotics|Antibiotics|  such as  |vancomycin|Vancomycin| , as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the  |aminoglycosides|Aminoglycosides|  and  |cephalosporins|Cephalosporins| . Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated infections . In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years.        In 2003 the Italian physician  |Carlo_Urbani|Carlo_Urbani|  was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome  as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a  |coronavirus|Coronavirus|  dubbed  |SARS-CoV|Sars-Cov| . Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.            Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of  |influenza|Influenza|  A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.              In February 2004,  |avian_influenza|Avian_Influenza|  virus was detected in birds in  |Vietnam|Vietnam| , increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus , the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the  |Spanish_flu|Spanish_Flu| , or the lower mortality pandemics such as the  |Asian_Flu|Asian_Flu|  and the  |Hong_Kong_Flu|Hong_Kong_Flu| .     From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957  |Asian_Flu|Asian_Flu|  virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.      In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the worlds population.      In October 2005, cases of the avian flu  were identified in  |Turkey|Turkey| . EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China. Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in  |Romania|Romania| , and then  |Greece|Greece| . Possible cases of the virus have also been found in  |Croatia|Croatia| ,  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria|  and the United Kingdom.      By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the  |H5N1|H5N1|  strain had been identified across Europe.  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.     Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a pandemic , because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few cases of proven human-to-human transmission. WHO . Avian Influenza A Infection in Humans  Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.          An outbreak of  |Zika_virus|Zika_Virus|  began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in  |the_Americas|The_Americas| . The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.        In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.  The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.          In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged  |Crimea|Crimea| n city of  |Kaffa|Caffa|  . After a protracted siege, during which the  |Mongol|Mongol_Empire|  army under  |Jani_Beg|Jani_Beg|  was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the  |Black_Death|Black_Death|  in Europe.      The  |Native_American|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  population was devastated after contact with the  |Old_World|Old_World|  by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander  |Jeffery_Amherst|Jeffery_Amherst,_1St_Baron_Amherst|  and Swiss-British officer Colonel  |Henry_Bouquet|Henry_Bouquet| , their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to Extirpate this Execrable Race . During the  |siege_of_Fort_Pitt|Siege_Of_Fort_Pitt|  late in the  |French_and_Indian_War|French_And_Indian_War| , as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain,  |William_Trent|William_Trent| , on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of great numbers of Indians coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries. Fenn, Elizabeth A.  ; The Journal of American History, Vol. 86, No. 4, March, 2000 A devastating smallpox epidemic plagued Native American tribes in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes area through 1763 and 1764, but the effectiveness of individual instances of biological warfare remains unknown.
