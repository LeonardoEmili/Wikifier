Also known as the worldhouse concept, paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which encompasses most of the planets usable area. Taylor, 1992 The enclosure would consist of a transparent roof held one or more kilometers above the surface, pressurized with a breathable atmosphere, and anchored with tension towers and cables at regular intervals. The worldhouse concept is similar to the concept of a domed habitat, but one which covers all of the planet.
