In criminal cases, the  |prosecutor|Prosecutor|  brings the case against the defendant, but the key complaining party is often called the complainant .     In some  |jurisdictions|Jurisdiction| , a lawsuit is commenced by filing a  |summons|Summons| , claim form or a  |complaint|Complaint| . These documents are known as  |pleadings|Pleading| , that set forth the alleged wrongs committed by the  |defendant|Defendant|  or defendants with a demand for relief. In other jurisdictions, the action is commenced by service of  |legal_process|Legal_Process|  by delivery of these documents on the defendant by a process server; they are only filed with the court subsequently with an  |affidavit|Affidavit|  from the process server that they had been given to the defendant according to the rules of  |civil_procedure|Civil_Procedure| .

The word plaintiff can be traced to the year 1278, and stems from the Anglo-French word pleintif meaning complaining .

In  |England_and_Wales|Law_Of_England_And_Wales| , the term claimant replaced plaintiff after the  |Civil_Procedure_Rules|Civil_Procedure_Rules|  came into force on 26 April 1999.  The move, which brings England and Wales out of line with general usage in English-speaking jurisdictions, was reportedly based on an assessment that the word claimant is more acceptable as  |plain_English|Plain_English|  than the word plaintiff .
