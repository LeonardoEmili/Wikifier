It is the second-largest Dutch city after  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam| , and is located in the  |province|Provinces_Of_The_Netherlands|  of  |South_Holland|South_Holland| , at the mouth of the  |Nieuwe_Maas|Nieuwe_Maas|  channel leading into the  |Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt_delta|Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt_Delta|  at the  |North_Sea|North_Sea| . Its history goes back to 1270, when a  |dam|Dam|  was constructed in the  |Rotte|Rotte| , after which people settled around it for safety. In 1340, Rotterdam was granted city rights by the  |Count_of_Holland|Count_Of_Holland| .     A major logistic and economic centre, Rotterdam is  |Europes|Europe|  largest  |port|Port_Of_Rotterdam| , and had previously been the largest port of the world for a long time. It has a population of 634,660 and is home to 174 nationalities. ,  CBS StatLine , 2015 1,404,963 Greater Rijnmond  1,173,272 Rotterdam Metro  1,033,629 Rotterdam Urban     634,660 Rotterdam Municipality  Rotterdam is known for its  |Erasmus_University|Erasmus_University_Rotterdam| , its riverside setting, lively cultural life, maritime heritage and modern architecture. The near-complete destruction of the city centre in the  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| |Rotterdam_Blitz|German_Bombing_Of_Rotterdam|  has resulted in a varied architectural landscape, including sky-scrapers designed by renowned architects such as  |Rem_Koolhaas|Rem_Koolhaas| ,  |Piet_Blom|Piet_Blom|  and  |Ben_van_Berkel|Ben_Van_Berkel| .       The  |Rhine|Rhine| ,  |Meuse|Meuse|  and  |Scheldt|Scheldt|  give waterway access into the heart of Western Europe, including the highly industrialized  |Ruhr|Ruhr| . The extensive distribution system including rail, roads, and waterways have earned Rotterdam the nicknames Gateway to Europe and Gateway to the World .    Rotterdam will host the  |Eurovision_Song_Contest_2020|Eurovision_Song_Contest_2020| .               The settlement at the lower end of the  |fen|Fen|  stream  Rotte   dates from at least 900 CE. Around 1150, large  |floods|Flood|  in the area ended development, leading to the construction of protective  |dikes|Levee|  and dams, including Schielands Hoge Zeedijk along the northern banks of the present-day Nieuwe Maas. A dam on the Rotte was built in the 1260s and was located at the present-day Hoogstraat .     On 7 July 1340, Count  |Willem_IV_of_Holland|William_Ii,_Count_Of_Hainaut|  granted  |city_rights|City_Rights_In_The_Low_Countries|  to Rotterdam, whose population then was only a few thousand.  Around the year 1350, a shipping canal, the  Rotterdamse Schie  was completed, which provided Rotterdam access to the larger towns in the north, allowing it to become a local trans-shipment centre between the Netherlands,  |England|England|  and  |Germany|Germany| , and to  |urbanize|Urbanization| .           The port of Rotterdam grew slowly but steadily into a port of importance, becoming the seat of one of the six chambers of the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie , the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company| .     The greatest spurt of growth, both in port activity and population, followed the completion of the  |Nieuwe_Waterweg|Nieuwe_Waterweg|  in 1872. The city and harbor started to expand on the south bank of the river. The  Witte Huis  or White House skyscraper,  inspired by American office buildings and built in 1898 in the French Château-style, is evidence of Rotterdams rapid growth and success. When completed, it was the tallest office building in Europe, with a height of .             During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the city was the worlds largest spy centre because of Dutch neutrality and its strategic location in between Britain, Germany and German-occupied Belgium. Many spies who were arrested and executed in Britain were led by German secret agents operating from Rotterdam.  |MI6|Mi6|  had its main European office on de Boompjes. From there the British coordinated espionage in Germany and occupied Belgium. During World War I, an average of 25,000 Belgian refugees lived in the city, as well as hundreds of German deserters and escaped Allied prisoners of war. Ruis, Edwin. Spynest.British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914–1918. Brimscombe: The History Press, 2016.     During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. .  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  had hoped to conquer the country in just one day, but his forces met unexpectedly fierce resistance. The Dutch army was forced to capitulate on 15 May 1940, following the  |bombing_of_Rotterdam|Rotterdam_Blitz|  on 14 May and the threat of bombing of other Dutch cities.   The heart of Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed by the  |Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe| . Some 80,000 civilians were made homeless and 900 were killed; a relatively low number due to the fact that many had fled the city because of the warfare and bombing going on in Rotterdam since the start of the invasion three days earlier. The City Hall survived the bombing.  |Ossip_Zadkine|Ossip_Zadkine|  later attempted to capture the event with his statue  De Verwoeste Stad  . The statue stands near the Leuvehaven, not far from the  |Erasmusbrug|Erasmusbrug|  in the centre of the city, on the north shore of the river Nieuwe Maas.     Rotterdam was gradually rebuilt from the 1950s through to the 1970s. It remained quite windy and open until the city councils from the 1980s on began developing an active architectural policy. Daring and new styles of  |apartments|Apartment| , office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more  |livable|Quality_Of_Life|  city centre with a new skyline. In the 1990s, the  |Kop_van_Zuid|Kop_Van_Zuid|  was built on the south bank of the river as a new business centre. Rotterdam was voted 2015 European City of the Year by the Academy of Urbanism. A Guardian profile of Rem Koolhaas begins If you put the last 50 years of architecture in a blender, and spat it out in building-sized chunks across the skyline, you would probably end up with something that looked a bit like Rotterdam.             Rotterdam is divided into a northern and a southern part by the river  |Nieuwe_Maas|Nieuwe_Maas| , connected by : the Beneluxtunnel; the Maastunnel; the  Erasmusbrug  ; a subway tunnel; the Willemsspoortunnel ; the  Willemsbrug  ; the Koninginnebrug ; and the  Van Brienenoordbrug  . The former railway lift  |bridge|Bridge|  De Hef is preserved as a monument in lifted position between the Noordereiland and the south of Rotterdam.     The city centre is located on the northern bank of the Nieuwe Maas, although recent urban development has extended the centre to parts of southern Rotterdam known as De Kop van Zuid . From its inland core, Rotterdam reaches the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  by a swathe of predominantly harbour area.     Built mostly behind dikes, large parts of the Rotterdam are below sea level. For instance, the Prins Alexander Polder in the northeast of Rotterdam extends  below sea level, or rather below  |Normaal_Amsterdams_Peil|Normaal_Amsterdams_Peil|  or Amsterdam Ordnance Datum. The lowest point in the Netherlands  is situated just to the east of Rotterdam, in the municipality of  |Nieuwerkerk_aan_den_IJssel|Nieuwerkerk_Aan_Den_Ijssel| .        The  |Rotte|Rotte|  river no longer joins the Nieuwe Maas directly. Since the early 1980s, when the construction of Rotterdam’s second subway line interfered with the Rotte’s course, its waters have been pumped through a pipe into the Nieuwe Maas via the Boerengat.      Between the summers of 2003 and 2008, an artificial  |beach|Beach|  was created at the Boompjeskade along the Nieuwe Maas, between the Erasmus Bridge and the Willems Bridge.  |Swimming|Human_Swimming|  was not possible, digging pits was limited to the height of the layer of  |sand|Sand| , about . Alternatively people go the beach of  |Hoek_van_Holland|Hook_Of_Holland|  or one of the beaches in  |Zeeland|Zeeland| |Renesse|Renesse|  or the  |Zuid_Hollandse_Eilanden|Zuid_Hollandse_Eilanden| |Ouddorp|Ouddorp| ,  |Oostvoorne|Oostvoorne| .     Rotterdam forms the centre of the  |Rijnmond|Rijnmond|  conurbation, bordering the conurbation surrounding  |The_Hague|The_Hague|  to the north-west. The two conurbations are close enough to be a single conurbation. They share the  |Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport|Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport|  and a light rail system called  |RandstadRail|Randstadrail| . Consideration is being given to creating an official Metropolitan region Rotterdam The Hague , which would have a combined population approaching 2.5 million.     On its turn, the Rijnmond conurbation is part of the southern wing  of the  |Randstad|Randstad| , which is one of the most important economic and densely populated areas in the north-west of Europe. Having a population of 7.1 million, the Randstad is the  |sixth-largest|List_Of_Metropolitan_Areas_In_Europe| |urban_area|Urban_Area|  in  |Europe|Europe|  . The Zuidvleugel, situated in the province of  |South_Holland|South_Holland| , has a population of around 3 million.       Rotterdam experiences a temperate  |oceanic_climate|Oceanic_Climate|   similar to all of the coastal areas in Netherlands. Located near to the coast, its climate is slightly milder than locations further inland. Winters are cool with frequent cold days, while the summers are mild to warm, with occasional hot temperatures. Temperatures above 30  °C are not rare during summer, while temperatures rarely drop below -5  °C during winter. The following climate box is from the airport, which is slightly cooler than the city, being surrounded by water canals which make the climate milder and with a higher  |Relative_Humidity|Relative_Humidity| . The city experiences the  |Urban_heat_island|Urban_Heat_Island|  effect, especially inside the city centre.                      Overall the demographics differ per city area. According to a recent area analysis, the city centre has a singles population of 70%, between the ages of 20 and 40,  considerably more than other city areas. Also the city centre has a much larger population of people with higher education and higher income. Nonetheless, 80% of the homes are rented, not owned. The city centre also has a higher percentage of foreign-born citizens. The majority of shops are also run by foreign-born citizens. Gebiedsanalyse 2006, Centrumgebied, Gemeente Rotterdam.

As of 2019, the municipality itself occupies an area of 325.79  km 2 , 208.80  km 2 of which is land, and is home to 638,751 inhabitants.  Its population peaked at 731,564 in 1965, but the dual processes of  |suburbanization|Suburbanization|  and  |counterurbanization|Counterurbanization|  saw this number steadily decline over the next 2 decades, reaching 560,000 by 1985.   Although Rotterdam has experienced population growth since then, it has done so at a slower pace than comparable cities in the Netherlands, like Amsterdam, The Hague and Utrecht .
