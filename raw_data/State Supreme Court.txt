           In the  |United_States|United_States| , a state supreme court  is the ultimate judicial  |tribunal|Tribunal|  in the  |court_system|State_Court|  of a particular  |state|U.S._State|  . On matters of  |state_law|State_Law| , the decisions of a state supreme court are considered final and binding on state and even  |United_States_federal_courts|United_States_Federal_Courts| .     Generally, the state supreme court, like most appellate tribunals, is exclusively for hearing appeals of legal issues. It does not make any finding of  |facts|Fact| , and thus holds no  |trials|Trial| . In the case where the trial court made an  |egregious|Wikt:Egregious|  error in its finding of facts, the state supreme court will  |remand|Remand|  to the trial court for a new trial. This responsibility of correcting the errors of inferior courts is the origin of a number of the different names for supreme courts in various state court systems.     The court consists of a panel of judges selected by methods outlined in the  |state_constitution|State_Constitution| . State supreme courts are completely distinct from any United States federal courts located within the geographical boundaries of a states territory, or the federal  |United_States_Supreme_Court|United_States_Supreme_Court|  .       Under American  |federalism|Federalism| , a state supreme courts ruling on a matter of purely state law is final and  |binding|Legally_Binding|  and must be accepted in both state and federal courts. Where applicable, state supreme courts also apply federal law.     Federal appellate review of state supreme court rulings on federal matters may be sought by way of a petition for writ of  certiorari  to the  |Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States| . As the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in  Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins  , no part of the federal Constitution actually grants federal courts or the federal Congress the power to directly dictate the content of state law . Clause 1 of Section 2 of  |Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution|Article_Three_Of_The_United_States_Constitution|  describes the scope of federal judicial power, but only extended it to the Laws of the United States and not the laws of the several or individual states. It is this silence on that latter issue that gave rise to the American distinction between state and federal common law not found in other English-speaking common law federations like  |Australia|Australia|  and  |Canada|Canada| .     One of the informal traditions of the American legal system, derived from the common law, is that all litigants are guaranteed at least one appeal after a final judgment on the merits. However, appeal is merely a privilege provided by statute in 47 states and in federal judicial proceedings; the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that there is no federal constitutional right to an appeal. Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 270 n.5 ; M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 110 .     Since a few states lack intermediate appellate courts, the state supreme court may operate under mandatory review , in which it must hear all appeals from the trial courts. This was the case, for example, in Nevada . Such judicial systems are usually very congested. Valerie Miller, Judges renew their call for appeals court, Las Vegas Business Press 19, no. 3 : 1.     Most state supreme courts have implemented discretionary review, like their federal counterpart. Under such a system, intermediate appellate courts are entrusted with deciding the vast majority of appeals. Intermediate appellate courts generally focus on the mundane task of what appellate specialists call error correction, G. Alan Tarr, Judicial Process and Judicial Policymaking, 6th ed. , 37 and 139. which means their primary task is to decide whether the record reflects that the trial court correctly applied existing law.     For certain limited categories of cases, the state supreme court still operates under mandatory review, usually with regard to cases involving the interpretation of the state constitution or  |capital_punishment|Capital_Punishment| . But for the vast majority, the state supreme court possesses the discretion to grant  certiorari  . These cases usually pertain to issues which different appellate courts within its jurisdiction have decided differently, or highly controversial cases involving a completely new legal issue never seen in that state. In other words, once the state supreme court is able to offload the tedious burden of error correction to intermediate courts, it can then focus on the long-term task of developing a coherent body of case law for the people of its state.      |Iowa|Iowa| ,  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma| , and  |Nevada|Nevada|  have a unique procedure for appeals. In those states, all appeals are filed with the appropriate Supreme Court which then keeps all cases of first impression for itself to decide. It forwards the remaining caseswhich deal with points of law it has already addressedto the intermediate Court of Appeals. Under this so-called push-down or deflection model of appellate procedure, the state supreme court can immediately establish final statewide precedents on important issues of first impression as soon as they arise, rather than waiting several months or years for the intermediate appellate court to make a first attempt at resolving the issue .     Notably, the  |Supreme_Court_of_Virginia|Supreme_Court_Of_Virginia|  operates under discretionary review for nearly all cases, but the intermediate  |Court_of_Appeals_of_Virginia|Court_Of_Appeals_Of_Virginia|  hears appeals as a matter of right only in family and administrative cases. The result is that there is no first appeal of right for the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in that state. Appellants are still free to petition for review, of course, but such petitions are subject to severe length constraints and necessarily are more narrowly targeted than a long opening appellate brief to an intermediate appellate court . In turn, the vast majority of decisions of Virginia circuit courts in civil and criminal cases are thereby insulated from appellate review on the merits.     New Hampshire and West Virginia formerly also provided only discretionary review for nearly all cases, even though they had no intermediate appellate court. Both states gradually recognized that even if this arrangement did not offend the federal Constitution, it was unduly harsh for hapless appellants, and transitioned to mandatory review, respectively, in 2004  and 2010.         As noted above, the U.S. Supreme Court may hear appeals from state supreme courts only if there is a  |question_of_law|Question_Of_Law|  under the  |United_States_Constitution|United_States_Constitution|  , and those appeals are heard at the Courts sole discretion .     In theory, state supreme courts are bound by the precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court as to all issues of federal law, but in practice, the Supreme Court reviews very few decisions from state courts. For example, in 2007 the Court reviewed 244 cases appealed from federal courts and only 22 from state courts. Despite the relatively small number of decisions reviewed, Professors Sara Benesh and Wendy Martinek found that state supreme courts follow precedent more closely than federal courts in the area of  |search_and_seizure|Search_And_Seizure|  and appear to follow precedent in  |confessions|Confession|  as well. Sara C. Benesh and Wendy L. Martinek,  93 Marq. L. Rev. 795 .       Traditionally, state supreme courts are headquartered in the capital cities of their respective states,  though they may occasionally hold oral arguments elsewhere. The seven main exceptions are:   Alaska, whose supreme court is located in and usually sits in its largest city,  |Anchorage|Anchorage|  , but also sits in  |Fairbanks|Fairbanks|  and  |Juneau|Juneau|  , and in other Alaskan communities on an as-needed basis.   California, whose supreme court is headquartered in  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco|  and maintains only branch offices in the state capital,  |Sacramento|Sacramento| , and the states largest city,  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , and hears argument at all three locations each year.   Delaware, whose supreme court is located in  |Wilmington|Wilmington,_Delaware| .   Louisiana, whose supreme court is headquartered in  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans| |French_Quarter|French_Quarter| .   Maine, whose supreme court is headquartered in  |Portland|Portland,_Maine| .   Pennsylvania, whose supreme court has facilities at three coequal locations of  |Harrisburg|Harrisburg| ,  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| , and  |Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh| .   Tennessee, whose state constitution requires its supreme court to sit at three coequal locations of  |Nashville|Nashville,_Tennessee| ,  |Knoxville|Knoxville,_Tennessee| , and  |Jackson|Jackson,_Tennessee| .     As for the courts actual facilities, a state supreme court may be housed in the state capitol, in a nearby state office building shared with other courts or state executive branch agencies, or in a small  |courthouse|Courthouse|  reserved for its exclusive use. State supreme courts normally require a courtroom for oral argument, private chambers for all justices, a conference room, offices for  |law_clerks|Law_Clerk|  and other support staff, a  |law_library|Law_Library| , and a lobby with a window where the court clerk can accept filings and release new decisions in the form of slip opinions .         Because state supreme courts generally hear only appeals, some courts have names which directly indicate their functionin the states of  |New_York|New_York|  and  |Maryland|Maryland| , and in the  |District_of_Columbia|Washington,_D.C.| , the highest court is called the Court of Appeals . In New York, the  |Supreme_Court|New_York_Supreme_Court|  is the  |trial_court|Trial_Court|  of general unlimited jurisdiction and the intermediate appellate court is called the  |Supreme_Court_Appellate_Division|New_York_Supreme_Court,_Appellate_Division|  . Marylands jury trial courts are called Circuit Courts , and the intermediate appellate court is called the  |Court_of_Special_Appeals|Maryland_Court_Of_Special_Appeals|  .  |West_Virginia|West_Virginia|  mixes the two; its highest court is called the  |Supreme_Court_of_Appeals|Supreme_Court_Of_Appeals_Of_West_Virginia|  .     Other states supreme courts have used the term Appeals :  |New_Jerseys|New_Jersey|  supreme courts under the 1844 constitution and  |Delawares|Delaware|  supreme court were both the  |Court_of_Errors_and_Appeals|Court_Of_Errors_And_Appeals|  ; The term Errors refers to the now-obsolete  |writ_of_error|Writ_Of_Error| , which was used by state supreme courts to correct certain types of egregious errors committed by lower courts.        |Massachusetts|Massachusetts|  and  |New_Hampshire|New_Hampshire|  originally named their highest courts the Superior Court of Judicature. Currently, Massachusetts uses the names  |Supreme_Judicial_Court|Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court|  , while New Hampshire uses the name  |Supreme_Court|New_Hampshire_Supreme_Court|  . Additionally the highest court in  |Maine|Maine|  is named the  |Supreme_Judicial_Court|Maine_Supreme_Judicial_Court|  . This similar terminology is probably a holdover from the time when Maine was part of Massachusetts. In Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, the highest courts formerly used variations of the term Court of Errors, which indicated that the courts primary purpose was to correct the errors of lower courts.        |Oklahoma|Oklahoma|  and  |Texas|Texas|  have two separate supreme courts: one for criminal appeals and one for civil cases. In both states, the first is formally called the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the second is called the Supreme Court.                 Texas and Oklahoma have dual supreme courts. In Texas, both have nine justices. In Oklahoma the Supreme Court has nine justices and the Court of Criminal Appeals has five .     Thirty-two states have  |mandatory_retirement|Mandatory_Retirement|  ages for justices, nearly all from 70 to 75 years old. It varies whether justices must retire on their birthday, at the end of that year, or the end of that term in which they reach the retirement age. Rhode Island is the only state with neither terms for reelection or retention or a retirement age.       Judges are either appointed, selected through a merit process , or elected. The elections may be through partisan or nonpartisan elections. A nonpartisan election does not mean that the judges run and are selected with no regard to political beliefs. In many cases nonpartisan election merely means the prospective judges parties are not printed on the ballot. Political contributions to these campaigns may be allowed, including from trade associations and political action committees. . AmericanProgress.org. The plurality of states follow the  |Missouri_Plan|Missouri_Plan| , in which the governor makes an appointment from selection of candidates put forward by a judicial nominating commission. Gubernatorial appointments are typically subject to regular  |retention_elections|Retention_Election| .            Of the seven states that elect justices in partisan elections, Democrats have a majority in four and Republicans in three. Although Michigan and Ohio have nonpartisan general elections, candidates are nominated by parties; Republicans hold a majority in both states.     In other states with contested elections, ideological leanings may be ascertained from statements, endorsements, and donations. Judges appointed by governors typically share the partisanship or ideology of that governor, but this relationship may be constrained by the makeup of a nominating commission or confirmation body.
