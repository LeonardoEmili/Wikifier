      Seismology  is the scientific study of  |earthquakes|Earthquake|  and the propagation of  |elastic_waves|Linear_Elasticityelastic_Wave|  through the  |Earth|Earth|  or through other planet-like bodies. The field also includes studies of  |earthquake_environmental_effects|Earthquake_Environmental_Effects|  such as  |tsunamis|Tsunamis|  as well as diverse  |seismic_sources|Seismic_Source|  such as volcanic, tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric, and artificial processes such as explosions. A related field that uses  |geology|Geology|  to infer information regarding past earthquakes is  |paleoseismology|Paleoseismology| . A recording of earth motion as a function of time is called a  |seismogram|Seismogram| . A seismologist is a scientist who does research in seismology.       Scholarly interest in earthquakes can be traced back to antiquity. Early speculations on the natural causes of earthquakes were included in the writings of  |Thales|Thales|  of Miletus ,  |Anaximenes|Anaximenes_Of_Miletus|  of Miletus ,  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  and  |Zhang_Heng|Zhang_Heng|  .     In 132 CE, Zhang Heng of Chinas  |Han_dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  designed the first known  |seismoscope|Seismoscope| .        In the 17th century,  |Athanasius_Kircher|Athanasius_Kircher|  argued that earthquakes were caused by the movement of fire within a system of channels inside the Earth.  |Martin_Lister|Martin_Lister|  and  |Nicolas_Lemery|Nicolas_Lemery|  proposed that earthquakes were caused by chemical explosions within the earth.      The  |Lisbon_earthquake_of_1755|1755_Lisbon_Earthquake| , coinciding with the general flowering of science in Europe, set in motion intensified scientific attempts to understand the behaviour and causation of earthquakes. The earliest responses include work by  |John_Bevis|John_Bevis|  and  |John_Michell|John_Michell|  . Michell determined that earthquakes originate within the Earth and were waves of movement caused by shifting masses of rock miles below the surface .      From 1857,  |Robert_Mallet|Robert_Mallet|  laid the foundation of instrumental seismology and carried out seismological experiments using explosives. He is also responsible for coining the word seismology .      In 1897,  |Emil_Wiecherts|Emil_Wiechert|  theoretical calculations led him to conclude that the  |Earths_interior|Structure_Of_The_Earth|  consists of a mantle of silicates, surrounding a core of iron.      In 1906  |Richard_Dixon_Oldham|Richard_Dixon_Oldham|  identified the separate arrival of  |P-waves|P-Wave| , S-waves and surface waves on seismograms and found the first clear evidence that the Earth has a central core.      In 1910, after studying the April  |1906_San_Francisco_earthquake|1906_San_Francisco_Earthquake| ,  |Harry_Fielding_Reid|Harry_Fielding_Reid|  put forward the  |elastic_rebound_theory|Elastic-Rebound_Theory|  which remains the foundation for modern tectonic studies. The development of this theory depended on the considerable progress of earlier independent streams of work on the behaviour of elastic materials and in mathematics.      In 1926,  |Harold_Jeffreys|Harold_Jeffreys|  was the first to claim, based on his study of earthquake waves, that below the mantle, the core of the Earth is liquid.      In 1937,  |Inge_Lehmann|Inge_Lehmann|  determined that within the earths liquid outer core there is a solid inner core.      By the 1960s, earth science had developed to the point where a comprehensive theory of the causation of seismic events had come together in the now well-established theory of  |plate_tectonics|Plate_Tectonics| .             Seismic waves are  |elastic_waves|Elastic_Waves|  that propagate in solid or fluid materials. They can be divided into body waves that travel through the interior of the materials; surface waves that travel along surfaces or interfaces between materials; and normal modes, a form of standing wave.         There are two types of body waves, pressure waves or primary waves and  |shear|Shearing|  or secondary waves . P-waves are  |longitudinal_waves|Longitudinal_Wave|  that involve  |compression|Compression|  and  |expansion|Rarefaction|  in the direction that the wave is moving and are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the fastest moving waves through solids.  |S-waves|S-Waves|  are  |transverse_waves|Transverse_Wave|  that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S-waves are slower than P-waves. Therefore, they appear later than P-waves on a seismogram. Fluids cannot support perpendicular motion, so S-waves only travel in solids.        Surface waves are the result of P- and S-waves interacting with the surface of the Earth. These waves are  |dispersive|Dispersion| , meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main surface wave types are  |Rayleigh_waves|Rayleigh_Wave| , which have both compressional and shear motions, and  |Love_waves|Love_Wave| , which are purely shear. Rayleigh waves result from the interaction of P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves with the surface and can exist in any solid medium. Love waves are formed by horizontally polarized S-waves interacting with the surface, and can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. Surface waves travel more slowly than P-waves and S-waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earths surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves , and thus the shaking caused by surface waves is generally stronger than that of body waves. The primary surface waves are often the largest signals on earthquake seismograms. Surface waves are strongly excited when their source is close to the surface, as in a shallow earthquake or a near surface explosion, and are much weaker for deep earthquake sources.          Both body and surface waves are traveling waves; however, large earthquakes can also make the entire Earth ring like a resonant bell. This ringing is a mixture of  |normal_modes|Normal_Modes|  with discrete frequencies and periods of an hour or shorter. Motion caused by a large earthquake can be observed for up to a month after the event. The first observations of normal modes were made in the 1960s as the advent of higher fidelity instruments coincided with two of the largest earthquakes of the 20th century – the  |1960_Valdivia_earthquake|1960_Valdivia_Earthquake|  and the  |1964_Alaska_earthquake|1964_Alaska_Earthquake| . Since then, the normal modes of the Earth have given us some of the strongest constraints on the deep structure of the Earth.          One of the first attempts at the scientific study of earthquakes followed the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Other notable earthquakes that spurred major advancements in the science of seismology include the  |1857_Basilicata_earthquake|1857_Basilicata_Earthquake| , the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the 2004  |Sumatra-Andaman_earthquake|Sumatra-Andaman_Earthquake| , and the 2011  |Great_East_Japan_earthquake|Tohoku_Earthquake| .          Seismic waves produced by  |explosions|Explosion|  or vibrating controlled sources are one of the primary methods of  |underground_exploration_in_geophysics|Exploration_Geophysics|  . Controlled-source seismology has been used to map  |salt_domes|Salt_Dome| , anticlines and other geologic traps in  |petroleum|Petroleum| -bearing  |rocks|Rock| ,  |faults|Fault| , rock types, and long-buried giant  |meteor|Meteor| |craters|Impact_Crater| . For example, the  |Chicxulub_Crater|Chicxulub_Crater| , which was caused by an impact that has been  |implicated_in_the_extinction|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Extinction_Event|  of the  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur| , was localized to Central America by analyzing ejecta in the  |Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Boundary| , and then physically proven to exist using seismic maps from  |oil_exploration|Oil_Exploration| .            |Seismometers|Seismometer|  are sensors that detect and record the motion of the Earth arising from elastic waves. Seismometers may be deployed at the Earths surface, in shallow vaults, in boreholes, or  |underwater|Ocean-Bottom_Seismometer| . A complete instrument package that records seismic signals is called a  |seismograph|Seismograph| . Networks of seismographs continuously record ground motions around the world to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of global earthquakes and other sources of seismic activity. Rapid location of earthquakes makes  |tsunami|Tsunami|  warnings possible because seismic waves travel considerably faster than tsunami waves. Seismometers also record signals from non-earthquake sources ranging from explosions , to local noise from wind  or anthropogenic activities, to incessant signals generated at the ocean floor and coasts induced by ocean waves , to  |cryospheric|Cryosphere|  events associated with large icebergs and glaciers. Above-ocean meteor strikes with energies as high as 4.2 & times; 10 13  |J|Joule|  have been recorded by seismographs, as have a number of industrial accidents and terrorist bombs and events . A major long-term motivation for the global seismographic monitoring has been for the detection and study of  |nuclear_testing|Nuclear_Testing| .             Because seismic waves commonly propagate efficiently as they interact with the internal structure of the Earth, they provide high-resolution noninvasive methods for studying the planets interior. One of the earliest important discoveries was that the  |outer_core|Outer_Core|  of the earth is liquid. Since S-waves do not pass through liquids, the liquid core causes a shadow on the side of the planet opposite the earthquake where no direct S-waves are observed. In addition, P-waves travel much slower through the outer core than the mantle.     Processing readings from many seismometers using  |seismic_tomography|Seismic_Tomography| , seismologists have mapped the mantle of the earth to a resolution of several hundred kilometers. This has enabled scientists to identify  |convection_cells|Convection_Cell|  and other large-scale features such as the  |large_low-shear-velocity_provinces|Large_Low-Shear-Velocity_Provinces|  near the  |core–mantle_boundary|Core–Mantle_Boundary| .               Forecasting a probable timing, location, magnitude and other important features of a forthcoming seismic event is called  |earthquake_prediction|Earthquake_Prediction| . Various attempts have been made by seismologists and others to create effective systems for precise earthquake predictions, including the  |VAN_method|Van_Method| . Most seismologists do not believe that a system to provide timely warnings for individual earthquakes has yet been developed, and many believe that such a system would be unlikely to give useful warning of impending seismic events. However, more general forecasts routinely predict  |seismic_hazard|Seismic_Hazard| . Such forecasts estimate the probability of an earthquake of a particular size affecting a particular location within a particular time-span, and they are routinely used in  |earthquake_engineering|Earthquake_Engineering| .     Public controversy over earthquake prediction erupted after Italian authorities  |indicted|Indicted|  six seismologists and one government official for  |manslaughter|Manslaughter|  in connection with  |a_magnitude_6.3_earthquake_in_LAquila,_Italy_on_April_5,_2009|2009_Laquila_Earthquake| . The indictment has been widely perceived as an indictment for failing to predict the earthquake and has drawn condemnation from the  |American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science|American_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Science|  and the  |American_Geophysical_Union|American_Geophysical_Union| . The indictment claims that, at a special meeting in LAquila the week before the earthquake occurred, scientists and officials were more interested in pacifying the population than providing adequate information about earthquake risk and preparedness.        Engineering seismology is the study and application of seismology for engineering purposes.  It generally applied to the branch of seismology that deals with the assessment of the seismic hazard of a site or region for the purposes of earthquake engineering. It is, therefore, a link between  |earth_science|Earth_Science|  and  |civil_engineering|Civil_Engineering| .  There are two principal components of engineering seismology. Firstly, studying earthquake history  and  |tectonics|Tectonics|   to assess the earthquakes that could occur in a region and their characteristics and frequency of occurrence. Secondly, studying strong ground motions generated by earthquakes to assess the expected shaking from future earthquakes with similar characteristics. These strong ground motions could either be observations from  |accelerometers|Accelerometer|  or seismometers or those simulated by computers using various techniques  , which are then often used to develop ground motion prediction equations  .       Seismological instruments can generate large amounts of data. Systems for processing such data include:     CUSP         |RadExPro_seismic_software|Radexpro_Seismic_Software| |Aki,_Keiiti|Keiiti_Aki| |Nicholas_Ambraseys|Nicholas_Ambraseys| |Don_L._Anderson|Don_L._Anderson| |Bolt,_Bruce|Bruce_Bolt| |Claerbout,_Jon|Jon_Claerbout| |Dziewonski,_Adam_Marian|Adam_Dziewonski| |Ewing,_Maurice|Maurice_Ewing| |Galitzine,_Boris_Borisovich|Boris_Borisovich_Galitzine| |Gamburtsev,_Grigory_A.|Grigoriy_A._Gamburtsev| |Gutenberg,_Beno|Beno_Gutenberg| |Hough,_Susan|Susan_Hough| |Jeffreys,_Harold|Harold_Jeffreys| |Jones,_Lucy|Lucy_Jones| |Kanamori,_Hiroo|Hiroo_Kanamori| |Keilis-Borok,_Vladimir|Vladimir_Keilis-Borok| |Knopoff,_Leon|Leon_Knopoff| |Lehmann,_Inge|Inge_Lehmann| |Mallet,_Robert|Robert_Mallet| |Mercalli,_Giuseppe|Giuseppe_Mercalli| |Milne,_John|John_Milne| |Mohorovičić,_Andrija|Andrija_Mohorovičić| |Oldham,_Richard_Dixon|Richard_Dixon_Oldham| |Fusakichi_Omori|Fusakichi_Omori| |Sebastião_de_Melo,_Marquis_of_Pombal|Sebastião_José_De_Carvalho_E_Melo| |Press,_Frank|Frank_Press| |Richards,_Paul_G.|Paul_G._Richards| |Richter,_Charles_Francis|Charles_Francis_Richter| |Sekiya,_Seikei|Seikei_Sekiya| |Sieh,_Kerry|Kerry_Sieh| |Paul_G._Silver|Paul_Silver| |Tucker,_Brian|Brian_Tucker| |Vidale,_John|John_Vidale| |Wen,_Lianxing|Lianxing_Wen| |Winthrop,_John|John_Winthrop| |Zhang_Heng|Zhang_Heng|     .
