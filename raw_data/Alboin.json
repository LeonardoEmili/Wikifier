Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from the foreign policy of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.

As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars.

Jörg Jarnut proposes 100,000–150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen in Die Langobarden estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000. Christie 1998, pp. 63–64 Jarnut 1995, p. 30     As a precautionary move Alboin strengthened his alliance with the Avars, signing what Paul calls a foedus perpetuum and what is referred to in the 9th-century  Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani  as a pactum et foedus amicitiae , adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200  years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboins rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom. Pohl 1997, p. 98 Wolfram 1997, p. 286 Jarnut 1995, pp. 29–30     A further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinians successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, Whitby 2001, p. 91 it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as  foederati , to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses removal. Christie 1998, pp. 60–63 Pohl 1997, pp. 98–99 Collins 1991, p. 186              The Lombard migration started on Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision to combine the departure with a Christian celebration can be understood in the context of Alboins recent conversion to ": null

    {
        "Arian Christianity": "Arianism"

    {
        ", as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. Palmieri 1996, pp. 43–44 The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly by political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migrations cohesion, distinguishing the migrants from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as foederati. Gasparri 1990, pp. 24–25 It has been speculated that Alboins migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.     The season chosen for leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.     The road followed by Alboin to reach Italy has been the subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek.

According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.                  The Lombards penetrated into Italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops . The Byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty, and the border forts may well have been left unmanned.

The innovation adopted was part of Alboins borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the  comes civitatis  was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count  to duke  and from county  to duchy  also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.

Alboins problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band  of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.

However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative.

Alboin invited her to drink merrily with her father . This reignited the queens determination to avenge her father.

In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimunds skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemys skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queens answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.     The episode is read in a radically different way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness.
