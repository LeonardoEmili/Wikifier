   The politics of Russia take place in the framework of the  |federal|Federation| |_semi_presidential|Semi_Presidential_System| |_republic|Republic|  of  |Russia|Russia| . According to the  |Constitution_of_Russia|Constitution_Of_Russia| , the  |President_of_Russia|President_Of_Russia|  is  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| , and of a  |multi_party_system|Multi_Party_System|  with  |executive_power|Executive_Power|  exercised by the government, headed by the  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Russia| , who is appointed by the President with the parliaments approval.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in the  |two_houses|Bicameralism|  of the  |Federal_Assembly_of_the_Russian_Federation|Federal_Assembly_Of_The_Russian_Federation| , while the President and the government issue numerous legally binding by-laws.     Since the collapse of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  at the end of 1991, Russia has seen serious challenges in its efforts to forge a political system to follow nearly seventy-five years of Soviet governance. For instance, leading figures in the legislative and executive branches have put forth opposing views of Russias political direction and the governmental instruments that should be used to follow it. That conflict reached a climax in September and October 1993, when President  |Boris_Yeltsin|Boris_Yeltsin|  used military force to dissolve the parliament and called for new legislative elections . This event marked the end of Russias first constitutional period, which was defined by the much-amended  |constitution|Russian_Constitution_Of_1978|  adopted by the  |Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic|Supreme_Soviet_Of_Russia|  in 1978.  |A_new_constitution|Constitution_Of_Russia| , creating a strong presidency, was approved by referendum in December 1993.     With a new constitution and a new parliament representing diverse parties and factions, Russias political structure subsequently showed signs of stabilization. As the transition period extended into the mid-1990s, the power of the national government continued to wane as Russias regions gained political and economic concessions from  |Moscow|Moscow| . Although the struggle between executive and legislative branches was partially resolved by the new constitution, the two branches continued to represent fundamentally opposing visions of Russias future. Most of the time, the executive was the center of reform, and the lower house of the parliament,  |State_Duma|State_Duma| , was a bastion of communists and nationalists.           The  |first_constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union|1924_Soviet_Constitution| , as promulgated in 1924, incorporated a  |treaty_of_union|Treaty_On_The_Creation_Of_The_Ussr|  between various Soviet republics. Under the treaty, the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic became known as the  |Russian_Soviet_Federated_Socialist_Republic|Russian_Soviet_Federated_Socialist_Republic|  . Nominally, the borders of each subunit incorporated the territory of a specific nationality. The constitution endowed the new republics with sovereignty, although they were said to have voluntarily delegated most of their sovereign powers to the Soviet center. Formal sovereignty was evidenced by the existence of flags, constitutions, and other state symbols, and by the republics constitutionally guaranteed right to secede from the union. Russia was the largest of the Union republics in terms of territory and population. During the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  era ,   Because of the Russians dominance in the affairs of the union, the RSFSR failed to develop some of the institutions of governance and administration that were typical of public life in the other republics: a republic-level communist party, a Russian academy of sciences, and Russian branches of trade unions, for example. As the titular nationalities of the other fourteen union republics began to call for greater republic rights in the late 1980s, however, ethnic Russians also began to demand the creation or strengthening of various specifically Russian institutions in the RSFSR. Certain policies of Soviet leader  |Mikhail_Gorbachev|Mikhail_Gorbachev|   also encouraged nationalities in the union republics, including the Russian Republic, to assert their rights. These policies included  glasnost  , which made possible open discussion of democratic reforms and long-ignored public problems such as pollution. Glasnost also brought constitutional reforms that led to the election of new republic legislatures with substantial blocs of pro-reform representatives.     In the RSFSR a new legislature, called the  |Congress_of_Peoples_Deputies|Congress_Of_Peoples_Deputies_Of_Russia| , was  |elected_in_March_1990|1990_Russian_Legislative_Election|  in a largely free and competitive vote. Upon convening in May, the congress elected  |Boris_Yeltsin|Boris_Yeltsin| , a onetime Gorbachev protégé who had resigned/been exiled from the top party echelons because of his radical reform proposals and erratic personality, as president of the congresss permanent working body, the  |Supreme_Soviet|Supreme_Soviet_Of_Russia| . The next month, the Congress  |declared_Russias_sovereignty|Declaration_Of_State_Sovereignty_Of_The_Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic|  over its natural resources and the primacy of Russias laws over those of the central Soviet government. During 1990-1991, the RSFSR enhanced its sovereignty by establishing republic branches of organizations such as the Communist Party, the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, radio and television broadcasting facilities, and the Committee for State Security . In 1991 Russia created a new executive office, the  |presidency|President_Of_Russia| , following the example of Gorbachev, who had created such an office for himself in 1990. The  |Russian_presidential_election|1991_Russian_Presidential_Election|  of June 1991 conferred legitimacy on the office, whereas Gorbachev had eschewed such an election and had had himself appointed by the Soviet parliament. Despite Gorbachevs attempts to discourage Russias electorate from voting for him, Yeltsin won the popular election to become the president, handily defeating five other candidates with more than 57 percent of the vote.     Yeltsin used his role as president of Russia to trumpet Russian sovereignty and patriotism, and his legitimacy as president was a major cause of the collapse of the  |coup|Coup|  by hard-line government and party officials against Gorbachev in August 1991 Soviet Coup of 1991.  The coup leaders had attempted to overthrow Gorbachev in order to halt his plan to sign a  |New_Union_Treaty|New_Union_Treaty|  that they believed would wreck the Soviet Union. Yeltsin defiantly opposed the coup plotters and called for Gorbachevs restoration, rallying the Russian public. Most importantly, Yeltsins faction led elements in the power ministries that controlled the military, the police, and the KGB to refuse to obey the orders of the coup plotters. The opposition led by Yeltsin, combined with the irresolution of the plotters, caused the coup to collapse after three days.     Following the failed August coup, Gorbachev found a fundamentally changed constellation of power, with Yeltsin in de facto control of much of a sometimes recalcitrant Soviet administrative apparatus. Although Gorbachev returned to his position as Soviet president, events began to bypass him.  |Communist_Party|Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  activities were suspended. Most of the union republics quickly declared their independence, although many appeared willing to sign Gorbachevs vaguely-delineated confederation treaty. The Baltic states achieved full independence, and they quickly received diplomatic recognition from many nations. Gorbachevs rump government recognized the independence of  |Estonia|Estonia| ,  |Latvia|Latvia| , and  |Lithuania|Lithuania|  in August and September 1991.     In late 1991 the Yeltsin government assumed budgetary control over Gorbachevs rump government. Russia did not declare its independence, and Yeltsin continued to hope for the establishment of some form of confederation. In December, one week after the Ukrainian Republic approved independence by referendum, Yeltsin and the leaders of Ukraine and Belarus  |met_to_form|Belavezha_Accords|  the  |Commonwealth_of_Independent_States|Commonwealth_Of_Independent_States|  . In response to calls by the Central Asian and other union republics for admission, another meeting took place in  |Alma_Ata|Alma_Ata| , on 21 December, to form an expanded CIS. At that meeting, all parties declared that the 1922 treaty of union, which had established the Soviet Union, annulled and that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev announced the decision officially on 25 December 1991. Russia gained international recognition as the principal  |successor|Succession_Of_States|  to the Soviet Union, receiving the  |Soviet_Unions_permanent_seat|Soviet_Union_And_The_United_Nations|  on the  |United_Nations_Security_Council|United_Nations_Security_Council|  and positions in other international and regional organizations. The CIS states also agreed that Russia initially would take over  |Soviet_embassies|Foreign_Relations_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  and other properties abroad.     In October 1991, during the honeymoon period after his resistance to the Soviet coup, Yeltsin had convinced the legislature to grant him special executive powers for one year so that he might implement his economic reforms. In November 1991 Yeltsin appointed a new government, with himself as acting prime minister, a post he held until the appointment of  |Yegor_Gaidar|Yegor_Gaidar|  as acting prime minister in June 1992.       During 1992 Yeltsin and his reforms came under increasing attack from former members and officials of the  |Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union|Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , from  |extreme_nationalists|Radical_Nationalism_In_Russia| , and from others calling for reform to be slowed or even halted in Russia. A locus of this opposition was increasingly the two-chamber parliament, the  |Supreme_Soviet_of_Russia|Supreme_Soviet_Of_Russia| , comprising the  |Soviet_of_the_Republic|Soviet_Of_The_Republic|  and the  |Soviet_of_Nationalities|Soviet_Of_Nationalities| . The Chair of the Supreme Soviet,  |Ruslan_Khasbulatov|Ruslan_Khasbulatov| , became Yeltsins most vocal opponent. Under the  |1978_constitution|Russian_Constitution_Of_1978| , the parliament was the supreme organ of power in Russia. After Russia added the office of president in 1991, the division of powers between the two branches remained ambiguous, while the  |Congress_of_Peoples_Deputies_of_Russia|Congress_Of_Peoples_Deputies_Of_Russia|  retained its obvious power to examine and resolve any matter within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation . In 1992 the Congress was even further empowered, gaining the ability to suspend any articles of the Constitution, per amended article 185 of the 1978 Constitution of the Russian Federation.     Although Yeltsin managed to beat back most challenges to his reform program when the CPD met in April 1992, in December he suffered a significant loss of his special executive powers. The CPD ordered him to halt appointments of administrators in the localities and also the practice of naming additional local oversight emissaries . Yeltsin also lost the power to issue special decrees concerning the economy, while retaining his constitutional power to issue  |decrees|Decree_Of_The_President_Of_Russia|  in accordance with existing laws. When the CPD rejected Yeltsins attempt to secure the confirmation of Gaidar as prime minister , Yeltsin appointed  |Viktor_Chernomyrdin|Viktor_Chernomyrdin| , whom the parliament approved because he was viewed as more economically conservative than Gaidar. After contentious negotiations between the parliament and Yeltsin, the two sides agreed to hold a national referendum to allow the population to determine the basic division of powers between the two branches of government. In the meantime, proposals for extreme limitation of Yeltsins power were tabled.     However, early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over the referendum and over power-sharing. In mid-March 1993, an emergency session of the CPD rejected Yeltsins proposals on power-sharing and canceled the referendum, again opening the door to legislation that would shift the balance of power away from the president. Faced with these setbacks, Yeltsin addressed the nation directly to announce a special regime , under which he would assume extraordinary executive power pending the results of a referendum on the timing of new legislative elections, on a new constitution, and on public confidence in the president and vice president. After the  |Constitutional_Court|Constitutional_Court_Of_Russia|  declared his announcement unconstitutional, Yeltsin backed down.     Despite Yeltsins change of heart, a second extraordinary session of the CPD took up discussion of emergency measures to defend the constitution, including impeachment of the president. Although the impeachment vote failed, the CPD set new terms for a popular referendum. The legislatures version of the referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. Under the CPDs terms, Yeltsin would need the support of 50 percent of eligible voters, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election. In the  |vote_on_25_April|1993_Russian_Government_Referendum| , Russians failed to provide this level of approval, but a majority of voters approved Yeltsins policies and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results, which delivered a serious blow to the prestige of the parliament, a mandate for him to continue in power.     In June 1993 Yeltsin  |decreed|Decree_Of_The_President_Of_Russia|  the creation of a special constitutional convention to examine the draft constitution that he had presented in April. This convention was designed to circumvent the parliament, which was working on its own draft constitution. As expected, the two main drafts contained contrary views of legislative-executive relations. The convention, which included delegates from major political and social organizations and the 89 subnational jurisdictions, approved a compromise draft constitution in July 1993, incorporating some aspects of the parliaments draft. The parliament failed to approve the draft, however.     In late September 1993, Yeltsin responded to the impasse in legislative-executive relations by repeating his announcement of a constitutional referendum, but this time he followed the announcement by dissolving the parliament and announcing new legislative elections for December . The CPD again met in emergency session, confirmed Vice President  |Aleksandr_Rutskoy|Aleksandr_Rutskoy|  as president, and voted to impeach Yeltsin. On 27 September, military units surrounded the legislative building , but 180 delegates refused to leave the building. After a two-week standoff, Rutskoy urged supporters outside the legislative building to overcome Yeltsins military forces. Firefights and destruction of property resulted at several locations in Moscow.     The next day, on 3 October, Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the parliament building. Under the direction of Minister of Defense  |Pavel_Grachev|Pavel_Grachev| , tanks fired on the White House, and military forces occupied the building and the rest of the city. As Yeltsin was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came the closest to serious civil conflict since the revolution of 1917.     This open, violent confrontation remained a backdrop to Yeltsins relations with the legislative branch for the next three years.          During 1992-93 Yeltsin had argued that the existing, heavily amended  |1978_constitution_of_Russia|Russian_Constitution_Of_1978|  was obsolete and self-contradictory and that Russia required a new constitution granting the president greater power. This assertion led to the submission and advocacy of rival constitutional drafts drawn up by the legislative and executive branches. The parliaments failure to endorse a compromise was an important factor in Yeltsins  |dissolution|1993_Russian_Constitutional_Crisis|  of that body in September 1993. Yeltsin then used his presidential powers to form a sympathetic constitutional assembly, which quickly produced a draft constitution providing for a strong executive, and to shape the outcome of the December 1993 referendum on Russias new basic law. The turnout requirement for the referendum was changed from 50 percent of the electorate to simply 50 percent of participating voters. The referendum vote resulted in approval by 58.4 percent of Russias registered voters.     The 1993 constitution declares Russia a democratic, federative, law-based state with a republican form of government. State power is divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Diversity of ideologies and religions is sanctioned, and a state or compulsory ideology may not be adopted. Progressively, however, human rights violations in connection with religious groups labeled extremist by the government have been increasingly frequent. The right to a multiparty political system is upheld. The content of laws must be approved by the public before they take effect, and they must be formulated in accordance with international law and principles. Russian is proclaimed the state language, although the republics of the federation are allowed to establish their own state.         |President|President_Of_Russia| |_Vladimir_Putin|Vladimir_Putin| |_Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Russia| |_Dmitry_Medvedev|Dmitry_Medvedev| |_United_Russia|United_Russia|  in office 1958-69a power previously reserved to the parliamentcalled the cabinet or the council of ministers in other countriesRCBCPSUchief of staffin charge of investigating official corruptionCECwhich was later incorporated into the electoral law covering the State Dumaa highly probable result because of multiple candidaciesKPRFwho came on later as a PR specialistchairman of the GovernmentGlavkosmosGoskomstatthe lower housethe upper house |18_06_|18_06_| |rliamentary_procedu|Rliamentary_Procedu| |nan|Nan| |rliame|Rliame| Liberalno-demokraticheskaya partiya Rossii—LDPR |ss|Ss| in office 1964-82in office 1982-84 |ss|Ss| sing., okrug Yevreyskaya avtonomnaya oblast, also known as Birobidzhankraya ; sing., kray provincesIn the 1995 elections, Moscow Oblast received nearly 38 percent of the State Dumas seats based on the concentration of party-list candidates in the national capital.or bothcalled soviets until late 1993, then called dumas or assemblieswhich were advised to reform their political systemsIn July 1996, the State Duma advanced these elections to late 1996. with at least 5% of the vote to qualify for seats with at least 7% of the vote to qualify for seats |ss|Ss| |kut|Kut| |18_07_|18_07_|  Maritime Territory see  |2000_Russian_presidential_election|2000_Russian_Presidential_Election| then head of the  |Council_of_Europe|Council_Of_Europe|  human rights divisionwith some form of democratic government in place .
