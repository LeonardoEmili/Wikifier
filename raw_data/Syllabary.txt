A syllabary is a set of  |written_symbols|Grapheme|  that represent the  |syllables|Syllable|  or  |moras|Mora|  which make up  |words|Word| .   A symbol in a syllabary, called a  |syllabogram|Syllabograms| , typically represents an  |consonant|Consonant|  sound  followed by a  |vowel|Vowel|  sound —that is, a CV or V syllable—but other  |phonographic|Phonogram|  mappings such as CVC, CV- tone, and C are also found in syllabaries.            A  |writing_system|Writing_System|  using a syllabary is complete when it covers all syllables in the corresponding spoken language without requiring complex  |orthographic_graphemic|Orthography|  rules, like  |implicit_codas|Implicit_Coda| |silent_vowels|Silent_Vowel|   or  |echo_vowels|Echo_Vowel|  . This loosely corresponds to shallow orthographies in alphabetic writing systems.     True syllabograms are those that encompass all parts of a syllable, i.e. initial onset, medial nucleus and final coda, but since onset and coda are optional in at least some languages, there are middle , start , end and full true syllabograms. Most syllabaries only feature one or two kinds of syllabograms and form other syllables by graphemic rules.     Syllabograms, hence syllabaries, are pure, analytic or arbitrary if they do not share graphic similarities that correspond to phonic similarities, e.g. the symbol for ka does not resemble in any predictable way the symbol for ki, nor the symbol for a.   Otherwise they are synthetic, if they vary by onset, rime, nucleus or coda, or systematic, if they vary by all of them.   Some scholars, e.g. Daniels, Peter Daniels, 1996. The Study of Writing Systems , p. 4. In: Daniels & Bright, The Worlds Writing Systems. reserve the general term for analytic syllabaries and invent other terms  as necessary. Some system provides  |katakana|Katakana|  language conversion.             Languages that use syllabic writing include  |Japanese|Japanese_Language| ,  |Cherokee|Cherokee_Language| ,  |Vai|Vai_Language| , the  |Yi_languages|Yi_Peoplelanguage|  of eastern Asia, the English-based  |creole_language|Creole_Language| |_Ndyuka|Ndyuka_Language| ,  |Shaozhou_Tuhua|Shaozhou_Tuhua| , and the ancient language  |Mycenaean_Greek|Mycenaean_Greek|  . In addition, the undecoded Cretan  |Linear_A|Linear_A|  is also believed by some to be a syllabic script, though this is not proven.      |Chinese_characters|Chinese_Characters| , the  |cuneiform_script|Cuneiform_Script|  used for  |Sumerian|Sumerian_Language| ,  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Language|  and other languages, and the former  |Maya_script|Maya_Script|  are largely syllabic in nature, although based on  |logograms|Logogram| . They are therefore sometimes referred to as logosyllabic.     The contemporary Japanese language uses two syllabaries together called  |kana|Kana| , namely  |hiragana|Hiragana|  and  |katakana|Katakana| , which were developed around 700. Because Japanese uses mainly CV syllables, a syllabary is well suited to write the language. As in many syllabaries, vowel sequences and final consonants are written with separate glyphs, so that both atta and kaita are written with three kana: あった  and かいた . It is therefore sometimes called a  moraic  writing system.     Languages that use syllabaries today tend to have simple  |phonotactics|Phonotactics| , with a predominance of monomoraic syllables. For example, the modern  |Yi_script|Yi_Script|  is used to write languages that have no diphthongs or syllable codas; unusually among syllabaries, there is a separate glyph for every consonant-vowel-tone combination in the language .     Few syllabaries have glyphs for syllables that are not monomoraic, and those that once did have simplified over time to eliminate that complexity.   For example, the Vai syllabary originally had separate glyphs for syllables ending in a coda , a long vowel , or a diphthong , though not enough glyphs to distinguish all CV combinations . The modern script has been expanded to cover all moras, but at the same time reduced to exclude all other syllables. Bimoraic syllables are now written with two letters, as in Japanese: diphthongs are written with the help of V or hV glyphs, and the nasal coda is written with the glyph for ŋ, which can form a syllable of its own in Vai.     In  |Linear_B|Linear_B| , which was used to transcribe  |Mycenaean_Greek|Mycenaean_Greek| , a language with complex syllables, complex consonant onsets were either written with two glyphs or simplified to one, while codas were generally ignored, e.g. ko-no-so for   Knōsos , pe-ma for  sperma.     The Cherokee syllabary generally uses dummy vowels for coda consonants, but also has a segmental grapheme for /s/, which can be used both as a coda and in an initial /sC/ consonant cluster.       The languages of  |India|India|  and  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia| , as well as the  |Ethiopian_Semitic_languages|Ethiopian_Semitic_Languages| , have a type of  |alphabet|Alphabet|  called an  abugida  or alphasyllabary. In these scripts, unlike in pure syllabaries, syllables starting with the same consonant are generally expressed with  |graphemes|Graphemes|  based in a regular way on a common graphical element. Usually each character representing a syllable consists of several elements which designate the individual sounds of that syllable.     In the 19th century these systems were called syllabics, a term which has survived in the name of  |Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics|Canadian_Aboriginal_Syllabics|  .     In a true syllabary there may be graphic similarity between characters that share a common consonant or vowel sound, but it is not systematic or at all regular. For example, the characters for ke, ka, and ko in Japanese  |hiragana|Hiragana|  have no similarity to indicate their common k sound . Compare this with  |Devanagari|Devanagari| , an abugida, where the characters for ke, ka and ko are के, का and को respectively, with क indicating their common k sound.        |English|English_Language| , along with many other Indo-European languages like German and Russian, allows for complex syllable structures, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. A pure syllabary based on English would require a separate glyph for every possible syllable. Thus one would need separate symbols for bag , beg , big , bog , bug , bad , bed , bid , bod , bud , bead , bide , bode , etc. Since English has well over 10,000 different possibilities for individual syllables,  a syllabary would be poorly suited to represent the English language. However, such pure systems are rare. A work-around to this problem, common to several syllabaries around the world , is to write an echo vowel, as if the  |syllable_coda|Syllable_Coda|  were a second syllable: ba-gu for bag , etc. Another common approach is to simply ignore the coda, so that bag would be written ba. This obviously would not work well for English, but was done in Mycenaean Greek when the root word was two or three syllables long and the syllable coda was a weak consonant such as n or s .
