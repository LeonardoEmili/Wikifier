            Aluminium  is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   Al and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|   13. It is a silvery-white, soft,  |non-magnetic|Magnetism|  and  |ductile|Ductility| |metal|Metal|  in the  |boron_group|Boron_Group| . By mass, aluminium makes up about 8% of the  |Earths_crust|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust| ; it is the third most abundant element after  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |silicon|Silicon|  and the most abundant metal in the crust, though it is less common in the mantle below. The chief  |ore|Ore|  of aluminium is  |bauxite|Bauxite| . Aluminium metal is highly reactive, such that  |native_specimens|Native_Metal|  are rare and limited to extreme  |reducing|Redox|  environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different  |minerals|Mineral| .        Aluminium is remarkable for its low  |density|Density|  and its ability to resist  |corrosion|Corrosion|  through the phenomenon of  |passivation|Passivation| . Aluminium and its  |alloys|Aluminium_Alloy|  are vital to the  |aerospace|Aerospace|  industry  and important in  |transport|Transport| ation and building industries, such as building facades and window frames.  The  |oxides|Oxides|  and  |sulfates|Sulfates|  are the most useful compounds of aluminium.     Despite its prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium  |salts|Salt| |metabolically|Metabolically| , but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.  Because of these salts abundance, the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest, and studies continue.              Of aluminium isotopes, only  is stable. This is consistent with aluminium having an odd atomic number. It is the only aluminium  |isotope_that_has_existed_on_Earth_in_its_current_form_since_the_creation_of_the_planet|Primordial_Nuclide| . Very nearly all the element on Earth is present as this isotope, which makes aluminium a  |mononuclidic_element|Mononuclidic_Element|  and means that its  |standard_atomic_weight|Standard_Atomic_Weight|  practically equates to that of the isotope. The standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals, which has consequences for the elements properties . This makes aluminium very useful in  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance|  , as its single stable isotope has a high NMR sensitivity.     All other isotopes of aluminium are  |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| . The most stable of these is  |26_Al|Aluminium-26|   and therefore could not have survived since the formation of the planet. However, minute traces of 26 Al are produced from  |argon|Argon|  in the  |atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere|  by  |spallation|Spallation|  caused by  |cosmic_ray|Cosmic_Ray|  protons. The ratio of 26 Al to 10  |Be|Beryllium|  has been used for  |radiodating|Radiometric_Dating|  of geological processes over 10 5 to 10 6 year time scales, in particular transport, deposition,  |sediment|Sediment|  storage, burial times, and erosion.  Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26 Al was responsible for the melting and  |differentiation|Planetary_Differentiation|  of some  |asteroids|Asteroids|  after their formation 4.55  billion years ago.      The remaining isotopes of aluminium, with mass numbers ranging from 22 to 43, all have half-lives well under an hour. Three  |metastable|Metastable|  states are known, all with half-lives under a minute.          An aluminium atom has 13 electrons, arranged in an  |electron_configuration|Electron_Configuration|  of & 91; |Ne|Neon|  & 93;3s 2 3p 1 , with three electrons beyond a stable noble gas configuration. Accordingly, the combined first three  |ionization_energies|Ionization_Energy|  of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone. Such an electron configuration is shared with the other well-characterized members of its group,  |boron|Boron| ,  |gallium|Gallium| ,  |indium|Indium| , and  |thallium|Thallium| ; it is also expected for  |nihonium|Nihonium| . Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions .
