         Labour Day  is an  |annual|Year| |holiday|Public_Holiday|  to celebrate the  |achievements_of_workers|Labour_Rights| . Labour Day has its origins in the  |labour_union|Trade_Union|  movement, specifically the  |eight-hour_day|Eight-Hour_Day|  movement, which advocated eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest.     For most countries, Labour Day is synonymous with, or linked with,  |International_Workers_Day|International_Workers_Day| , which occurs on 1 May. For other countries, Labour Day is celebrated on a different date, often one with special significance for the labour movement in that country.

In  |Canada|Canada|  and the  |United_States|United_States| , the holiday is celebrated on the first Monday of September and considered the unofficial end of  |summer|Summer| , with  |summer_vacations|Summer_Vacation|  ending and students returning to school around then.            For most countries, Labour Day is synonymous with, or linked with, International Workers Day, which occurs on 1 May.

Labour Day is a national holiday in the  |Bahamas|Bahamas| , celebrated on the first Friday in June in order to create a long weekend for workers.  The traditional date of Labour Day in the Bahamas, however, is 7 June, in commemoration of a significant workers strike that began on that day in 1942. Labour Day is meant to honor and celebrate workers and the importance of their contributions to the nation and society. In the capital city, Nassau, thousands of people come to watch a parade through the streets, which begins at mid-morning. Bands in colorful uniforms, traditional African  |junkanoo|Junkanoo|  performers, and members of various labour unions and political parties are all part of the procession, which ends up at the Southern Recreation Grounds, where government officials make speeches for the occasion.

Labour Day  has been celebrated in Canada on the first Monday in September since the 1880s. The origins of Labour Day in Canada can be traced back to December 1872 when a parade was staged in support of the Toronto Typographical Unions strike for a 58-hour work-week,  almost a full decade before a  |similar_event_in_New_York_City|Labor_Dayhistory|  by the American  |Knights_of_Labor|Knights_Of_Labor| , a late 19th-century U.S.  |labor_federation|Labor_Federation| , launched the movement towards the American Labor Day holiday. Origin of Labor Day, Cincinnati Tribune, Sept. 1, 1895, Special Labor Day supplement, pg. 26. The Toronto Trades Assembly called its 27 unions to demonstrate in support of the Typographical Union who had been on strike since 25 March.  |George_Brown|George_Brown| , Canadian politician and editor of the  Toronto Globe  hit back at his striking employees, pressing police to charge the Typographical Union with conspiracy. Although the laws criminalising union activity were outdated and had already been abolished in Great Britain, they were still on the books in Canada and police arrested 24 leaders of the Typographical Union. Labour leaders decided to call another similar demonstration on 3 September to protest the arrests. Seven unions marched in  |Ottawa|Ottawa| , prompting a promise by Canadian  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister|  Sir  |John_A._Macdonald|John_A._Macdonald|  to repeal the barbarous anti-union laws. Parliament passed the  |Trade_Union_Act|Trade_Union_Act|  on 14 June the following year, and soon all unions were seeking a 54-hour work-week.     The Toronto Trades and Labour Council held similar celebrations every spring. American  |Peter_J._McGuire|Peter_J._Mcguire| , co-founder of the  |American_Federation_of_Labor|American_Federation_Of_Labor| , was asked to speak at a labour festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 22 July 1882. Returning to the United States, McGuire and the  |Knights_of_Labor|Knights_Of_Labor|  organised a similar  |parade|Parade|  based on the Canadian event on 5 September 1882 in New York City, USA. On 23 July 1894, Canadian Prime Minister  |John_Thompson|John_Sparrow_David_Thompson|  and his government made Labour Day, to be held in September, an official holiday. In the United States, the New York parade became an annual event that year, and in 1894 was adopted by American president  |Grover_Cleveland|Grover_Cleveland|  to compete with  |International_Workers_Day|International_Workers_Day|  .     While Labour Day parades and picnics are organised by unions, many Canadians regard Labour Day as the Monday of the last long weekend of summer. Non-union celebrations include picnics,  |fireworks_displays|Fireworks_Display| , water activities, and public art events. Since the new school year generally starts right after Labour Day, families with school-age children take it as the last chance to travel before the end of summer.     An old fashioned tradition in Canada and the United States frowns upon the wearing of white after Labour Day. Explanations for this tradition vary; the most common is that white is a summer colour and Labour Day unofficially marks the end of summer. The rule may have been intended as a status symbol for new members of the upper and middle classes in the late 19th and early 20th century.      A Labour Day tradition in  |Atlantic_Canada|Atlantic_Canada|  is the Wharf Rat Rally in  |Digby,_Nova_Scotia|Digby,_Nova_Scotia| , while the rest of Canada watches the  |Labour_Day_Classic|Labour_Day_Classic| , a  |Canadian_Football_League|Canadian_Football_League|  event where rivals like  |Calgary_Stampeders|Calgary_Stampeders|  and  |Edmonton_Eskimos|Edmonton_Eskimos| ,  |Hamilton_Tiger-Cats|Hamilton_Tiger-Cats|  and  |Toronto_Argonauts|Toronto_Argonauts|  , and  |Saskatchewan_Roughriders|Saskatchewan_Roughriders|  and  |Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers|Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers|  play on Labour Day weekend. Before the demise of the  |Ottawa_Renegades|Ottawa_Renegades|  after the 2005 season, that team played the nearby  |Montreal_Alouettes|Montreal_Alouettes|  on Labour Day weekend. Since the  |2014_CFL_season|2014_Cfl_Season| , when the  |Ottawa_Redblacks|Ottawa_Redblacks|  began play, the Montreal–Ottawa Labour Day tradition has once again been observed. Likewise,  |Ontario_University_Athletics|Ontario_University_Athletics|  has a long-established tradition to play  |university_football|College_Football|  on Labour Day.

Before 1961, 24 May was celebrated in  |Jamaica|Jamaica|  as Empire Day in honour of the birthday of  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria|  and her emancipation of slaves in Jamaica.  As its name suggests, the day was used to celebrate the British Empire, complete with flag-raising ceremonies and the singing of patriotic songs. In 1961,  |Jamaican_Chief_Minister|Jamaican_Chief_Minister| |Norman_Washington_Manley|Norman_Washington_Manley|  proposed the replacement of Empire Day with Labour Day, a celebration in commemoration of 23 May 1938, when  |Alexander_Bustamante|Alexander_Bustamante|  led a  |labour_rebellion|British_West_Indian_Labour_Unrest_Of_1934–1939|  leading to Jamaican independence.     In 1972,  |Jamaican_Prime_Minister|Jamaican_Prime_Minister| |Michael_Manley|Michael_Manley|  promoted Labour Day as a showcase for the importance of labour to the development of Jamaica, and a day of voluntary community participation to beneficial projects. Since then, Labour Day has been not only a public holiday but also a day of mass community involvement around the country.       Labor Day in  |Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan|  is celebrated on the last Sunday in September. The holiday was officially established in late 2013.

In  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| , Labour Day is a public holiday held on the fourth Monday in October. Its origins are traced back to the eight-hour working day movement that arose in the newly founded  |Wellington|Wellington|  colony in 1840, primarily because of carpenter  |Samuel_Parnells|Samuel_Parnell|  refusal to work more than eight hours a day. He encouraged other tradesmen also to work for only eight hours a day and in October 1840, a workers meeting passed a resolution supporting the idea. On 28 October 1890, the 50th anniversary of the eight-hour day was commemorated with a parade. The event was then celebrated annually in late October as either Labour Day or Eight-Hour Demonstration Day. In 1899 government legislated that the day be a public holiday from 1900. The day was celebrated on different days in different provinces. This led to ship owners complaining that seamen were taking excessive holidays by having one Labour Day in one port then another in their next port. In 1910 the government stipulated that the holiday would be observed on the same day throughout the nation.       In  |Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad_And_Tobago| , Labour Day is celebrated every 19 June.
