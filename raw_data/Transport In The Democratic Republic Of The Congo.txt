     Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo  has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the  |Congo_Basin|Congo_Basin|  present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. Furthermore, chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflict has led to serious under-investment over many years.     On the other hand, the  |DRC|Democratic_Republic_Of_Congo|  has thousands of kilometres of  |navigable|Navigable| |waterways|Waterway| , and traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country.       As an illustration of transport difficulties in the DRC, even before wars damaged the infrastructure, the so-called national route, used to get supplies to  |Bukavu|Bukavu|  from the seaport of  |Matadi|Matadi| , consisted of the following:   Matadi to  |Kinshasa|Kinshasa|  – rail   Kinshasa to  |Kisangani|Kisangani|  –  |river_boat|Riverboat| |Ubundu|Ubundu|  – rail   Ubundu to  |Kindu|Kindu|  – river boat   Kindu to  |Kalemie|Kalemie|  – rail   Kalemie to Kalundu  – boat on  |Lake_Tanganyika|Lake_Tanganyika| |United_Nations_Joint_Logistics_Centre|United_Nations_Joint_Logistics_Centre|  had an operation in Congo to support  |humanitarian_relief|Humanitarian_Relief|  agencies working there, and its bulletins and maps about the transport situation are archived on  |ReliefWeb|Reliefweb| .      The  |First|First_Congo_War|  and  |Second_Congo_Wars|Second_Congo_War|  saw great destruction of transport infrastructure from which the country has not yet recovered. Many vehicles were destroyed or commandeered by  |militias|Militia| , especially in the north and east of the country, and the fuel supply system was also badly affected. Consequently, outside of  |Kinshasa|Kinshasa| ,  |Matadi|Matadi|  and  |Lubumbashi|Lubumbashi| , private and commercial road transport is almost non-existent and traffic is scarce even where roads are in good condition. The few vehicles in use outside these cities are run by the  |United_Nations|Monuc| , aid agencies, the DRC government, and a few larger companies such as those in the mining and energy sectors. High-resolution satellite photos on the Internet show large cities such as  |Bukavu|Bukavu| ,  |Butembo|Butembo|  and  |Kikwit|Kikwit|  virtually devoid of traffic, compared to similar photos of towns in neighbouring countries.  retrieved 24 September 2007.     Air transport is the only effective means of moving between many places within the country. The Congolese government, the United Nations, aid organisations and large companies use air rather than ground transport to move personnel and freight. The UN operates a large fleet of aircraft and helicopters, and compared to other African countries the DRC has a large number of small domestic airlines and air charter companies. The transport of minerals with a high value for weight is also carried out by air, and in the east, some stretches of paved road isolated by destroyed bridges or impassable sections have been turned into airstrips.     For the ordinary citizen though, especially in rural areas, often the only options are to cycle, walk or go by dugout canoe.     Some parts of the DRC are more accessible from neighbouring countries than from  |Kinshasa|Kinshasa| . For example, Bukavu itself and  |Goma|Goma|  and other north-eastern towns are linked by paved road from the DRC border to the  |Kenya|Kenya| n port of  |Mombasa|Mombasa| , and most goods for these cities have been brought via this route in recent years. Similarly,  |Lubumbashi|Lubumbashi|  and the rest of  |Katanga_Province|Katanga_Province|  is linked to  |Zambia|Zambia| , through which the paved highway and rail networks of Southern Africa can be accessed. Such links through neighbouring countries are generally more important for the east and south-east of the country, and are more heavily used, than surface links to the capital.       In 2007  |China|China|  agreed to lend the DRC US$5bn for two major transport infrastructure projects to link mineral-rich Katanga, specifically Lubumbashi, by rail to an ocean port  and by road to the Kisangani river port, and to improve its links to the transport network of Southern Africa in Zambia. The two projects would also link the major parts of the country not served by water transport, and the main centres of the economy. Loan repayments will be from concessions for raw materials which China desperately needs: copper, cobalt, gold and nickel, as well as by toll revenues from the road and railway. In the face of reluctance by the international business community to invest in DRC, this represents a revitalisation of DRCs infrastructure much needed by its government.

The  |China_Railway_Seventh_Group_Co._Ltd|China_Railway_Seventh_Group_Co._Ltd|  will be in charge of the contract, under signed by the  |China_Railway_Engineering_Corporation|China_Railway_Engineering_Corporation| , with construction to be started from June 2008.                 The Democratic Republic of the Congo has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa — a total of 2250  km, of which only 1226  km is in good condition . To put this in perspective, the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500  km . The figure of 2250  km converts to 35  km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population. Comparative figures for Zambia and Botswana are 721  km and 3427  km respectively. The figures are obtained by dividing the population figures in the Wikipedia country articles by the paved roads figure in the Transport in articles.       The road network is theoretically divided into four categories , however, the  |United_Nations_Joint_Logistics_Centre|United_Nations_Joint_Logistics_Centre|  reports that this classification is of little practical use because some roads simply do not exist. For example, National Road 9 is not operational and cannot be detected by  |remote_sensing|Remote_Sensing|  methods.     The two principal highways are:    |National_Road_No._1|National_Road_No._1|  connecting the Atlantic seaports with Kinshasa and southeast Katanga, the most important economic area of the country due to its copper and other mines.    |National_Road_No._2|National_Road_No._2| ,  |Kisangani|Kisangani| - |Bukavu|Bukavu| – |Goma|Goma| , connecting the principal waterway systems of the country, namely Kinshasa-Kisangani on the Congo River and the Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika systems on the eastern edge of the country. This road was cut during the war and as of July 2007 was not in use south of Walikale. Note that the so-called  |Kinshasa_Highway|Kinshasa_Highway|  is not a physical road but a metaphor applied to the route by which  |AIDS|Aids|  is believed to have been spread east through Uganda and Kenya and neighbouring countries by truck drivers from the Congo. In the DR Congo the only highway which physically matches the route is National Road No. 2, and most passengers and freight moving between Kinshasa and that road go by boat along the Congo River.          The total road network in 2005, according to the UNJLC, consisted of:     paved: 2,250  km   unpaved: 15,000  km   tracks 43,000  km   country roads 21,000  km   local roads or footpaths 90,000  km   total: 171,250  km      The UNJLC also points out that the pre- |Second_Congo_War|Second_Congo_War|  network no longer exists, and is dependent upon 20,000  |bridges|Bridge|  and 325  |ferries|Ferries| , most of which are in need of repair or replacement. In contrast, a Democratic Republic of the Congo government document shows that, also in 2005, the network of main highways in good condition was as follows:   paved: 1,226  km unpaved: 607  km      The 2000 Michelin Motoring and Tourist Map 955 of Southern and Central Africa, which categorizes roads as surfaced , improved , partially improved and earth roads and tracks shows that there were 2694  km of paved highway in 2000. These figures indicate that, compared to the more recent figures above, there has been a deterioration this decade, rather than improvement.       Three routes in the  |Trans-African_Highway_network|Trans-African_Highway_Network|  pass through DR Congo:    |Tripoli-Cape_Town_Highway|Tripoli-Cape_Town_Highway| |Matadi|Matadi| , a distance of 285  km on one of the only paved sections in fair condition.    |Lagos-Mombasa_Highway|Lagos-Mombasa_Highway| |Beira-Lobito_Highway|Beira-Lobito_Highway| |Katanga|Katanga_Province|  and requires re-construction over most of its length, being an earth track between the  |Angola|Angola| n border and  |Kolwezi|Kolwezi| , a paved road in very poor condition between Kolwezi and  |Lubumbashi|Lubumbashi| , and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the  |Zambia|Zambia| n border.

However, much of the infrastructure — vessels and port handling facilities — has, like the railways, suffered from poor maintenance and internal conflict.     The total length of waterways is estimated at 15,000  km including the  |Congo_River|Congo_River| , its tributaries, and unconnected  |lakes|Lake| .     The 1000-kilometre Kinshasa- |Kisangani|Kisangani|  route on the Congo River is the longest and best-known. It is operated by river tugs pushing several barges lashed together, and for the hundreds of passengers and traders these function like small floating towns. Rather than mooring at riverside communities along the route, traders come out by canoe and small boat alongside the river barges and transfer goods  |on_the_move|Lightering| .     Most waterway routes do not operate to regular schedules. It is common for an operator to moor a barge at a riverside town and collect freight and passengers over a period of weeks before hiring a river tug to tow or push the barge to its destination.     |Brazzaville|Brazzaville|   by regular boat and ferry services 3.5  km across the Congo River.
