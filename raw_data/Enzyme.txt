                    Enzymes  are both  |proteins|Protein|  and  |biological|Biological| |catalysts|Catalyst|  . Catalysts accelerate  |chemical_reactions|Chemical_Reactions| . The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called  |substrates|Substrate| , and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as  |products|Product| . Almost all  |metabolic_processes|Metabolism|  in the  |cell|Cell|  need  |enzyme_catalysis|Enzyme_Catalysis|  in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.    |Metabolic_pathways|Metabolic_Pathway|  depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called enzymology and a new field of  |pseudoenzyme_analysis|Pseudoenzyme|  has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  sequences and unusual pseudocatalytic properties.       Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types.  Other biocatalysts are  |catalytic_RNA_molecules|Ribozyme| , called ribozymes. Enzymes  |specificity|Chemical_Specificity|  comes from their unique  |three_dimensional_structures|Tertiary_Structure| .     Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the  |reaction_rate|Reaction_Rate|  by lowering its  |activation_energy|Activation_Energy| . Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is  |orotidine_5_phosphate_decarboxylase|Orotidine_5_Phosphate_Decarboxylase| , which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds.   Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the  |equilibrium|Chemical_Equilibrium|  of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules:  |inhibitors|Enzyme_Inhibitor|  are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and  |activators|Enzyme_Activator|  are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic  |drugs|Drug|  and  |poisons|Poison|  are enzyme inhibitors. An enzymes activity decreases markedly outside its optimal  |temperature|Temperature|  and  |pH|Ph| , and many enzymes are  |denatured|Denaturation|  when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties.     Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of  |antibiotics|Antibiotics| . Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological  |washing_powders|Washing_Powder|  break down protein, starch or  |fat|Fat|  stains on clothes, and enzymes in  |meat_tenderizer|Papain|  break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.          By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the digestion of  |meat|Meat|  by stomach secretions  and the conversion of  |starch|Starch|  to  |sugars|Sugar|  by plant extracts and  |saliva|Saliva|  were known but the mechanisms by which these occurred had not been identified.      French chemist  |Anselme_Payen|Anselme_Payen|  was the first to discover an enzyme,  |diastase|Diastase| , in 1833.  A few decades later, when studying the  |fermentation|Fermentation|  of sugar to  |alcohol|Ethanol|  by  |yeast|Yeast| ,  |Louis_Pasteur|Louis_Pasteur|  concluded that this fermentation was caused by a  |vital_force|Vitalism|  contained within the yeast cells called ferments , which were thought to function only within living organisms. He wrote that alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells.      In 1877, German physiologist  |Wilhelm_Kühne|Wilhelm_Kühne|  first used the term  enzyme , which comes from  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  ἔνζυμον, leavened or in yeast , to describe this process. Kühne coined the word enzyme in:  Relevant passage on page 190:  Um Missverständnissen vorzubeugen und lästige Umschreibungen zu vermeiden schlägt Vortragender vor, die ungeformten oder nicht organisirten Fermente, deren Wirkung ohne Anwesenheit von Organismen und ausserhalb derselben erfolgen kann, als Enzyme zu bezeichnen.  The word enzyme was used later to refer to nonliving substances such as  |pepsin|Pepsin| , and the word ferment was used to refer to chemical activity produced by living organisms.       |Eduard_Buchner|Eduard_Buchner|  submitted his first paper on the study of yeast extracts in 1897. In a series of experiments at the  |University_of_Berlin|Humboldt_University_Of_Berlin| , he found that sugar was fermented by yeast extracts even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture.  He named the enzyme that brought about the fermentation of sucrose  |zymase|Zymase|  .  In 1907, he received the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  for his discovery of cell-free fermentation . Following Buchners example, enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out: the suffix  -ase  is combined with the name of the  |substrate|Substrate|   or to the type of reaction . The naming of enzymes by adding the suffix -ase to the substrate on which the enzyme acts, has been traced to French scientist  |Émile_Duclaux|Émile_Duclaux|  , who intended to honor the discoverers of  |diastase|Diastase|  – the first enzyme to be isolated – by introducing this practice in his book  See Chapter 1, especially page 9.     The biochemical identity of enzymes was still unknown in the early 1900s. Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others  argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis.  quoted in  In 1926,  |James_B_Sumner|James_B_Sumner|  showed that the enzyme  |urease|Urease|  was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme  |catalase|Catalase|  in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by  |John_Howard_Northrop|John_Howard_Northrop|  and  |Wendell_Meredith_Stanley|Wendell_Meredith_Stanley| , who worked on the digestive enzymes  |pepsin|Pepsin|  ,  |trypsin|Trypsin|  and  |chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin| . These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.      The discovery that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures to be solved by  |x_ray_crystallography|X_Ray_Crystallography| . This was first done for  |lysozyme|Lysozyme| , an enzyme found in tears, saliva and  |egg_whites|Egg_White|  that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by  |David_Chilton_Phillips|David_Chilton_Phillips|  and published in 1965.  This high-resolution structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of  |structural_biology|Structural_Biology|  and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.        An enzymes name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in -ase.  Examples are  |lactase|Lactase| ,  |alcohol_dehydrogenase|Alcohol_Dehydrogenase|  and  |DNA_polymerase|Dna_Polymerase| . Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called  |isozymes|Isozymes| .      The  |International_Union_of_Biochemistry_and_Molecular_Biology|International_Union_Of_Biochemistry_And_Molecular_Biology|  have developed a  |nomenclature|Nomenclature|  for enzymes, the  |EC_numbers|Enzyme_Commission_Number| ; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by EC , which stands for Enzyme Commission . The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism.      The top-level classification is:   EC 1,  |Oxidoreductases|Oxidoreductase| : catalyze  |oxidation|Oxidation| /reduction reactions   EC 2,  |Transferases|Transferase| : transfer a  |functional_group|Functional_Group|     EC 3,  |Hydrolases|Hydrolase| : catalyze the  |hydrolysis|Hydrolysis|  of various bonds   EC 4,  |Lyases|Lyase| : cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation   EC 5,  |Isomerases|Isomerase| : catalyze  |isomer|Isomer| ization changes within a single molecule   EC 6,  |Ligases|Ligase| : join two molecules with  |covalent_bonds|Covalent_Bond| .     These sections are subdivided by other features such as the substrate, products, and  |chemical_mechanism|Chemical_Mechanism| . An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example,  |hexokinase|Hexokinase|  is a transferase that adds a phosphate group to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group .                  Enzymes are generally  |globular_proteins|Globular_Protein| , acting alone or in larger  |complexes|Protein_Complex| . The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme.  Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone.  Enzyme structures unfold  when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity.  Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as  |hot_springs|Hot_Spring|  are prized by industrial users for their ability to function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.     Enzymes are usually much larger than their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid residues, for the  |monomer|Monomer|  of  |4_oxalocrotonate_tautomerase|4_Oxalocrotonate_Tautomerase| ,  to over 2,500 residues in the animal  |fatty_acid_synthase|Fatty_Acid_Synthase| .  Only a small portion of their structure is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site.  This catalytic site is located next to one or more  |binding_sites|Binding_Site|  where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzymes  |active_site|Active_Site| . The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.      In some enzymes, no amino acids are directly involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic  |cofactors|Cofactor| . Enzyme structures may also contain  |allosteric_sites|Allosteric_Site|  where the binding of a small molecule causes a  |conformational_change|Conformational_Change|  that increases or decreases activity.      A small number of  |RNA|Ribonucleic_Acid| -based biological catalysts called  |ribozymes|Ribozyme|  exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common of these is the  |ribosome|Ribosome|  which is a complex of protein and catalytic RNA components.               Enzymes must bind their substrates before they can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what  |substrates|Substrate|  they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed.  |Specificity|Chemical_Specificity|  is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and  |hydrophilic|Hydrophilic| / |hydrophobic|Hydrophobic|  characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be  |chemoselective|Chemoselectivity| ,  |regioselective|Regioselectivity|  and  |stereospecific|Stereospecificity| .      Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and  |expression|Gene_Expression|  of the  |genome|Genome| . Some of these enzymes have  |proof_reading|Proofreading|  mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such as  |DNA_polymerase|Dna_Polymerase|  catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step.  This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases.  Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in  |RNA_polymerase|Rna_Polymerase| ,   |aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetases|Aminoacyl_Trna_Synthetase|   and  |ribosomes|Ribosome| .      Conversely, some enzymes display  |enzyme_promiscuity|Enzyme_Promiscuity| , having broad specificity and acting on a range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously , which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.              To explain the observed specificity of enzymes, in 1894  |Emil_Fischer|Hermann_Emil_Fischer|  proposed that both the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another.  From page 2992:  Um ein Bild zu gebrauchen, will ich sagen, dass Enzym und Glucosid wie Schloss und Schlüssel zu einander passen müssen, um eine chemische Wirkung auf einander ausüben zu können.  This is often referred to as the lock and key model.  This early model explains enzyme specificity, but fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve.        In 1958,  |Daniel_Koshland|Daniel_E_Koshland_Jr_|  suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme.  As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid  |side_chains|Side_Chain|  that make up the active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as  |glycosidases|Glycosidases| , the substrate  |molecule|Molecule|  also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site.  The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.    Induced fit may enhance the fidelity of molecular recognition in the presence of competition and noise via the  |conformational_proofreading|Conformational_Proofreading|  mechanism.               Enzymes can accelerate reactions in several ways, all of which lower the  |activation_energy|Activation_Energy|      By stabilizing the transition state:   Creating an environment with a charge distribution complementary to that of the transition state to lower its energy    By providing an alternative reaction pathway:   Temporarily reacting with the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate to provide a lower energy transition state    By destabilising the substrate ground state:   Distorting bound substrate into their transition state form to reduce the energy required to reach the transition state    By orienting the substrates into a productive arrangement to reduce the reaction  |entropy|Entropy|  change     Enzymes may use several of these mechanisms simultaneously. For example,  |proteases|Protease|  such as  |trypsin|Trypsin|  perform covalent catalysis using a  |catalytic_triad|Catalytic_Triad| , stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an  |oxyanion_hole|Oxyanion_Hole| , complete  |hydrolysis|Hydrolysis|  using an oriented water substrate.               Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; instead they have complex internal dynamic motions – that is, movements of parts of the enzymes structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a  |protein_loop|Turn|  or unit of  |secondary_structure|Protein_Secondary_Structure| , or even an entire  |protein_domain|Protein_Domain| . These motions give rise to a  |conformational_ensemble|Conformational_Ensemble|  of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at  |equilibrium|Thermodynamic_Equilibrium| . Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzymes function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme  |dihydrofolate_reductase|Dihydrofolate_Reductase|  are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle,  consistent with  |catalytic_resonance_theory|Catalytic_Resonance_Theory| .        |Substrate_presentation|Substrate_Presentation|  is a process where the enzyme is sequestered away from its substrate. Enzymes can be sequestered to the plasma membrane away from a substrate in the nucleus or cytosol. Or within the membrane, an enzyme can be sequestered into lipid rafts away from its substrate in the disordered region. When the enzyme is releases it mixes with its substrate. Alternatively, the enzyme can be sequestered near its substrate to activate the enzyme. For example, the enzyme can be soluble and upon activation bind to a lipid in the plasma membrane and then act upon molecules in the plasma membrane.            Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme, distinct from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme.  In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzymes metabolic pathway cause  |feedback|Feedback|  regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the  |flux|Flux|  through the rest of the pathway.                    Some enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity.  Cofactors can be either  |inorganic|Inorganic|   or  |organic_compounds|Organic_Molecules|  . These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site.  Organic cofactors can be either  |coenzymes|Coenzyme| , which are released from the enzymes active site during the reaction, or  |prosthetic_groups|Prosthetic_Groups| , which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound .      An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase| , which uses a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site.  These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis.  For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in  |redox|Redox|  reactions.      Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme together with the cofactor required for activity is called a holoenzyme . The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the  |DNA_polymerases|Dna_Polymerase| ; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.          Coenzymes are small organic molecules that can be loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another.  Examples include  |NADH|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide| ,  |NADPH|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide_Phosphate|  and  |adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  . Some coenzymes, such as  |flavin_mononucleotide|Flavin_Mononucleotide|  ,  |flavin_adenine_dinucleotide|Flavin_Adenine_Dinucleotide|  ,  |thiamine_pyrophosphate|Thiamine_Pyrophosphate|  , and  |tetrahydrofolate|Tetrahydrofolate|  , are derived from  |vitamins|Vitamin| . These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body  de novo  and closely related compounds must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include:   the  |hydride|Hydride|  ion , carried by  |NAD_or_NADP_|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide| |_adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate| |_coenzyme_A|Coenzyme_A| |_folic_acid|Folic_Acid|  and   the methyl group, carried by  |S_adenosylmethionine|S_Adenosylmethionine|      Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.      Coenzymes are usually continuously regenerated and their concentrations maintained at a steady level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the  |pentose_phosphate_pathway|Pentose_Phosphate_Pathway|  and S-adenosylmethionine by  |methionine_adenosyltransferase|Methionine_Adenosyltransferase| . This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.                  As with all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. In the presence of an enzyme, the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly.  For example,  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase|  catalyzes its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration of its reactants:           The rate of a reaction is dependent on the  |activation_energy|Activation_Energy|  needed to form the  |transition_state|Transition_State|  which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex . Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction . Finally the enzyme-product complex dissociates to release the products.      Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to drive a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. For example, the hydrolysis of  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  is often used to drive other chemical reactions.                    Enzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products.  The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from  |enzyme_assays|Enzyme_Assay| . In 1913  |Leonor_Michaelis|Leonor_Michaelis|  and  |Maud_Leonora_Menten|Maud_Leonora_Menten|  proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as  |Michaelis–Menten_kinetics|Michaelis–Menten_Kinetics| . ;  The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by  |G_E_Briggs|George_Edward_Briggs|  and  |J_B_S_Haldane|J_B_S_Haldane| , who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.      Enzyme rates depend on  |solution|Solution|  conditions and substrate  |concentration|Concentration| . To find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This is shown in the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate  of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.      V max is only one of several important kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the  |Michaelis_Menten_constant|Michaelis_Menten_Constant|  , which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic K M for a given substrate. Another useful constant is k cat , also called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.      The efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of k cat /K m . This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the  |rate_constants|Rate_Constant|  for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 10 8 to 10 9 . At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called  catalytically perfect  or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are  |triose_phosphate_isomerase|Triosephosphateisomerase| ,  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase| ,  |acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase| ,  |catalase|Catalase| ,  |fumarase|Fumarase| ,  |β_lactamase|Β_Lactamase| , and  |superoxide_dismutase|Superoxide_Dismutase| .  The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.  But most enzymes are far from perfect: the average values of k/K and k are about 105 and 10 , respectively.      Michaelis–Menten kinetics relies on the  |law_of_mass_action|Law_Of_Mass_Action| , which is derived from the assumptions of free  |diffusion|Diffusion|  and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of  |macromolecular_crowding|Macromolecular_Crowding|  and constrained molecular movement.  More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.                    Enzyme reaction rates can be decreased by various types of  |enzyme_inhibitors|Enzyme_Inhibitor| .             A  |competitive_inhibitor|Competitive_Inhibitor|  and substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time.  Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug  |methotrexate|Methotrexate|  is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme  |dihydrofolate_reductase|Dihydrofolate_Reductase| , which catalyzes the reduction of  |dihydrofolate|Folic_Acid|  to tetrahydrofolate.  The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an  |allosteric_effect|Allosteric_Modulation|  to change the shape of the usual binding-site.        A  |non_competitive_inhibitor|Non_Competitive_Inhibition|  binds to a site other than where the substrate binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence K m remains the same. However the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that V max is reduced. In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.        An  |uncompetitive_inhibitor|Uncompetitive_Inhibitor|  cannot bind to the free enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration. In the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive.  This type of inhibition is rare.        A  |mixed_inhibitor|Mixed_Inhibition|  binds to an allosteric site and the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzymes function is reduced but not eliminated when bound to the inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.        An  |irreversible_inhibitor|Irreversible_Inhibitor|  permanently inactivates the enzyme, usually by forming a  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond|  to the protein.   |Penicillin|Penicillin|   and  |aspirin|Aspirin|   are common drugs that act in this manner.         In many organisms, inhibitors may act as part of a  |feedback|Feedback|  mechanism. If an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of  |negative_feedback|Negative_Feedback| . Major metabolic pathways such as the  |citric_acid_cycle|Citric_Acid_Cycle|  make use of this mechanism.      Since inhibitors modulate the function of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzymes native substrate, similar to  |methotrexate|Methotrexate|  above; other well-known examples include  |statins|Statin|  used to treat high  |cholesterol|Cholesterol| ,  and  |protease_inhibitors|Protease_Inhibitor|  used to treat  |retroviral|Retrovirus|  infections such as  |HIV|Hiv| .  A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that is used as a drug is  |aspirin|Aspirin| , which inhibits the  |COX_1|Cyclooxygenase|  and  |COX_2|Cyclooxygenase|  enzymes that produce the  |inflammation|Inflammation|  messenger  |prostaglandin|Prostaglandin| . Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison  |cyanide|Cyanide|  is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme  |cytochrome_c_oxidase|Cytochrome_C_Oxidase|  and blocks  |cellular_respiration|Cellular_Respiration| .        As enzymes are made up of proteins, their actions are sensitive to change in many physio chemical factors such as pH, temperature, substrate concentration, etc.     The following table shows pH optima for various enzymes.                 Enzymes serve a wide variety of  |functions|Function|  inside living organisms. They are indispensable for  |signal_transduction|Signal_Transduction|  and cell regulation, often via  |kinases|Kinase|  and  |phosphatases|Phosphatase| .  They also generate movement, with  |myosin|Myosin|  hydrolyzing ATP to generate  |muscle_contraction|Muscle_Contraction| , and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the  |cytoskeleton|Cytoskeleton| .  Other ATPases in the cell membrane are  |ion_pumps|Ion_Pump|  involved in  |active_transport|Active_Transport| . Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as  |luciferase|Luciferase|  generating light in  |fireflies|Firefly| .   |Virus|Virus| es can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the  |HIV_integrase|Hiv_Integrase|  and  |reverse_transcriptase|Reverse_Transcriptase| , or for viral release from cells, like the  |influenza|Influenza|  virus  |neuraminidase|Neuraminidase| .      An important function of enzymes is in the  |digestive_systems|Digestive_Systems|  of animals. Enzymes such as  |amylases|Amylase|  and  |proteases|Protease|  break down large molecules  into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as  |maltose|Maltose|  and eventually  |glucose|Glucose| , which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In  |ruminants|Ruminant| , which have  |herbivorous|Herbivore|  diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme,  |cellulase|Cellulase| , to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.               Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating  |metabolic_pathways|Metabolic_Pathway| .  In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.      Enzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps and could not be regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate| . Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are  |thermodynamically_unfavorable|Endothermic|  can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.          There are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell.        Enzymes can be either  |activated|Enzyme_Activator|  or  |inhibited|Enzyme_Inhibitor|  by other molecules. For example, the end product of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway , thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a  |negative_feedback_mechanism|Negative_Feedback| , because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration.  Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other  |homeostatic_devices|Homeostasis| , the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.        Examples of  |post_translational_modification|Post_Translational_Modification|  include  |phosphorylation|Phosphorylation| ,  |myristoylation|Myristoylation|  and  |glycosylation|Glycosylation| .   For example, in the response to  |insulin|Insulin| , the  |phosphorylation|Phosphorylation|  of multiple enzymes, including  |glycogen_synthase|Glycogen_Synthase| , helps control the synthesis or degradation of  |glycogen|Glycogen|  and allows the cell to respond to changes in  |blood_sugar|Blood_Sugar| .  Another example of post-translational modification is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain.  |Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin| , a digestive  |protease|Protease| , is produced in inactive form as  |chymotrypsinogen|Chymotrypsinogen|  in the  |pancreas|Pancreas|  and transported in this form to the  |stomach|Stomach|  where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme is known as a  |zymogen|Zymogen|   or proenzyme.       Enzyme production  can be enhanced or diminished by a cell in response to changes in the cells environment. This form of  |gene_regulation|Regulation_Of_Gene_Expression|  is called  |enzyme_induction|Enzyme_Induction| . For example, bacteria may become  |resistant_to_antibiotics|Antibiotic_Resistance|  such as  |penicillin|Penicillin|  because enzymes called  |beta_lactamases|Beta_Lactamase|  are induced that hydrolyse the crucial  |beta_lactam_ring|Beta_Lactam|  within the penicillin molecule.  Another example comes from enzymes in the  |liver|Liver|  called  |cytochrome_P450_oxidases|Cytochrome_P450_Oxidase| , which are important in  |drug_metabolism|Drug_Metabolism| . Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause  |drug_interactions|Drug_Interaction| .  Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme  |degradation|Catabolism| .  The opposite of enzyme induction is  |enzyme_repression|Enzyme_Repression| .       Enzymes can be compartmentalized, with different metabolic pathways occurring in different  |cellular_compartments|Cellular_Compartment| . For example,  |fatty_acids|Fatty_Acid|  are synthesized by one set of enzymes in the  |cytosol|Cytosol| ,  |endoplasmic_reticulum|Endoplasmic_Reticulum|  and  |Golgi|Golgi_Apparatus|  and used by a different set of enzymes as a source of energy in the  |mitochondrion|Mitochondrion| , through  |β_oxidation|Β_Oxidation| .  In addition,  |trafficking|Protein_Targeting|  of the enzyme to different compartments may change the degree of  |protonation|Protonation|   or oxidative state  which in turn affects enzyme activity.  In contrast to partitioning into membrane bound organelles, enzyme subcellular localisation may also be altered through polymerisation of enzymes into macromolecular cytoplasmic filaments.         In  |multicellular|Multicellular| |eukaryotes|Eukaryote| , cells in different  |organs|Organ|  and  |tissues|Tissue|  have different patterns of  |gene_expression|Gene_Expression|  and therefore have different sets of enzymes  available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example,  |hexokinase|Hexokinase| , the first enzyme in the  |glycolysis|Glycolysis|  pathway, has a specialized form called  |glucokinase|Glucokinase|  expressed in the  |liver|Liver|  and  |pancreas|Pancreas|  that has a lower  |affinity|Affinity|  for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration.  This enzyme is involved in sensing  |blood_sugar|Blood_Sugar|  and regulating  |insulin|Insulin|  production.                  Since the tight control of enzyme activity is essential for  |homeostasis|Homeostasis| , any malfunction of a single critical enzyme can lead to a  |genetic_disease|Genetic_Disease| . The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal  |genetic_disease|Genetic_Disease|  due to enzyme insufficiency is  |Tay–Sachs_disease|Tay–Sachs_Disease| , in which patients lack the enzyme  |hexosaminidase|Hexosaminidase| .       One example of enzyme deficiency is the most common type of  |phenylketonuria|Phenylketonuria| . Many different single amino acid mutations in the enzyme  |phenylalanine_hydroxylase|Phenylalanine_Hydroxylase| , which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of  |phenylalanine|Phenylalanine| , result in build-up of phenylalanine and related products. Some mutations are in the active site, directly disrupting binding and catalysis, but many are far from the active site and reduce activity by destabilising the protein structure, or affecting correct oligomerisation.   This can lead to  |intellectual_disability|Intellectual_Disability|  if the disease is untreated.  Another example is  |pseudocholinesterase_deficiency|Pseudocholinesterase_Deficiency| , in which the bodys ability to break down choline ester drugs is impaired.    Oral administration of enzymes can be used to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as  |pancreatic_insufficiency|Pancreatic_Insufficiency|   and  |lactose_intolerance|Lactose_Intolerance| .      Another way enzyme malfunctions can cause disease comes from  |germline_mutations|Germline_Mutation|  in genes coding for  |DNA_repair|Dna_Repair|  enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are less able to repair mutations in their  |genomes|Genome| . This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the  |development_of_cancers|Carcinogenesis| . An example of such a hereditary  |cancer_syndrome|Cancer_Syndrome|  is  |xeroderma_pigmentosum|Xeroderma_Pigmentosum| , which causes the development of  |skin_cancers|Skin_Cancer|  in response to even minimal exposure to  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet_Light| .         Enzymes are used in the  |chemical_industry|Chemical_Industry|  and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. Enzymes in general are limited in the number of reactions they have evolved to catalyze and also by their lack of stability in  |organic_solvents|Organic_Solvent|  and at high temperatures. As a consequence,  |protein_engineering|Protein_Engineering|  is an active area of research and involves attempts to create new enzymes with novel properties, either through rational design or in vitro evolution.   These efforts have begun to be successful, and a few enzymes have now been designed from scratch to catalyze reactions that do not occur in nature.
