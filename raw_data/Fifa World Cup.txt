                    The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international  |association_football|Association_Football|  competition contested by the senior  |mens_national_teams|List_Of_Mens_National_Association_Football_Teams|  of the members of the  , the sports global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the  |inaugural_tournament_in_1930|1930_Fifa_World_Cup| , except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the  |Second_World_War|World_War_Ii| . The current champion is  |France|France_National_Football_Team| , which won its second title at the  |2018_tournament|2018_Fifa_World_Cup|  in Russia.     The current format of the competition involves a  |qualification_phase|Fifa_World_Cup_Qualification| , which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation, compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about a month.     The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams.  |Brazil|Brazil_National_Football_Team|  have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are  |Germany|Germany_National_Football_Team|  and  |Italy|Italy_National_Football_Team| , with four titles each;  |Argentina|Argentina_National_Football_Team| ,  |France|France_National_Football_Team|  and inaugural winner  |Uruguay|Uruguay_National_Football_Team| , with two titles each; and  |England|England_National_Football_Team|  and  |Spain|Spain_National_Football_Team|  with one title each.     The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the  |Olympic_Games|Olympic_Games| ; the cumulative viewership of all matches of the  |2006_World_Cup|2006_Fifa_World_Cup|  was estimated to be 26.29  billion with an estimated 715.1  million people watching the  |final_match|2006_Fifa_World_Cup_Final| , a ninth of the entire population of the planet.  Tom Dunmore, , page 235, quote The World Cup is now the most-watched sporting event in the world on television, above even the Olympic Games. Stephen Dobson and John Goddard, , page 407, quote The World Cup is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world: the estimated cumulative television audience for the 2006 World Cup in Germany was 26.2  billion, an average of 409  million viewers per match. Glenn M. Wong, , page 144, quote The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event in the world. In 2006, more than 30  billion viewers in 214 countries watched the World Cup on television, and more than 3.3  million spectators attended the 64 matches of the tournament.     17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea , South Africa and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three finals.              The worlds first international football match was a challenge match played in  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  in 1872 between  |Scotland|Scotland_National_Football_Team|  and  |England|England_National_Football_Team| ,  which ended in a 0–0 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural  |British_Home_Championship|British_Home_Championship| , took place in 1884.  As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a  |demonstration_sport|Demonstration_Sport|  with no medals awarded at the  |1900|Football_At_The_1900_Summer_Olympics|  and  |1904_Summer_Olympics|Football_At_The_1904_Summer_Olympics|  , and at the  |1906_Intercalated_Games|Football_At_The_1906_Summer_Olympics| .      After  |FIFA|Fifa|  was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.      At the  |1908_Summer_Olympics|Football_At_The_1908_Summer_Olympics|  in  |London|London| , football became an official competition. Planned by  |The_Football_Association|The_Football_Association|  , Englands football governing body, the event was for  |amateur|Amateurism|  players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain  won the  |gold_medals|Gold_Medal| . They repeated the feat at the  |1912_Summer_Olympics|Football_At_The_1912_Summer_Olympics|  in  |Stockholm|Stockholm| .     With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams,  |Sir_Thomas_Lipton|Thomas_Lipton|  organised the  |Sir_Thomas_Lipton_Trophy|Sir_Thomas_Lipton_Trophy|  tournament in  |Turin|Turin|  in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,  and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited  |West_Auckland|West_Auckland_Town_F_C_| , an amateur side from  |County_Durham|County_Durham| , to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.     In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the  |Olympic_tournament|Football_At_The_Summer_Olympics|  as a world football championship for amateurs , and took responsibility for managing the event.  This paved the way for the worlds first intercontinental football competition, at the  |1920_Summer_Olympics|Football_At_The_1920_Summer_Olympics| , contested by  |Egypt|Egypt_National_Football_Team|  and 13 European teams, and won by  |Belgium|Belgium_National_Football_Team| .   |Uruguay|Uruguay_National_Football_Team|  won the next two Olympic football tournaments in  |1924|Football_At_The_1924_Summer_Olympics|  and  |1928|Football_At_The_1928_Summer_Olympics| . Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFAs professional era.          Due to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with  |President|List_Of_Presidents_Of_Fifa| |_Jules_Rimet|Jules_Rimet|  as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  decided to stage a world championship itself.  With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their  |centenary|Centenary|  of  |independence|Treaty_Of_Montevideo|  in 1930, FIFA named  |Uruguay|Uruguay|  as the host country of the  |inaugural_World_Cup_tournament|1930_Fifa_World_Cup| .     The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from  |Belgium|Belgium_National_Football_Team| ,  |France|France_National_Football_Team| ,  |Romania|Romania_National_Football_Team| , and  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia_National_Football_Team|  to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.        The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by  |France|France_National_Football_Team|  and the  |US|United_States_Mens_National_Soccer_Team| , who defeated  |Mexico|Mexico_National_Football_Team|  4–1 and  |Belgium|Belgium_National_Football_Team|  3–0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by  |Lucien_Laurent|Lucien_Laurent|  of France.  In the  |final|1930_Fifa_World_Cup_Final| ,  |Uruguay|Uruguay_National_Football_Team|  defeated  |Argentina|Argentina_National_Football_Team|  4–2 in front of 93,000 people in  |Montevideo|Montevideo| , and became the first nation to win the World Cup.  After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the  |IOC|International_Olympic_Committee|  disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the  |1932_Summer_Olympics|1932_Summer_Olympics| .  Olympic football returned at the  |1936_Summer_Olympics|Football_At_The_1936_Summer_Olympics| , but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.     The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the  |1934_World_Cup|1934_Fifa_World_Cup|  and all North and South American nations except  |Brazil|Brazil_National_Football_Team|  and  |Cuba|Cuba_National_Football_Team|  boycotted the  |1938|1938_Fifa_World_Cup|  tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which  |Germany|Germany|  and  |Brazil|Brazil|  sought to host,  were cancelled due to  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  and its aftermath.          The  |1950_World_Cup|1950_Fifa_World_Cup| , held in  |Brazil|Brazil| , was the first to include British participants.  |British_teams|Home_Nations|  withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football,  but rejoined in 1946 following FIFAs invitation.  |Glanville|Glanville|  The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions  |Uruguay|Uruguay_National_Football_Team| , who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called  |Maracanazo|Uruguay_V_Brazil|  .     In the tournaments between 1934 and  |1978|1978_Fifa_World_Cup| , 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when  |Austria|Austria_National_Football_Team|  was  |absorbed|Anschluss|  into  |Germany|Nazi_Germany|  after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when  |India|India_National_Football_Team| ,  |Scotland|Scotland_National_Football_Team| , and  |Turkey|Turkey_National_Football_Team|  withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.  |Glanville|Glanville| , p45 Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were:  |USA|United_States_Mens_National_Soccer_Team| , semi-finalists in 1930;  |Cuba|Cuba_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in 1938;  |North_Korea|North_Korea_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in  |1966|1966_Fifa_World_Cup| ; and  |Mexico|Mexico_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in  |1970|1970_Fifa_World_Cup| .          The tournament was expanded to 24 teams in  |1982|1982_Fifa_World_Cup| ,  |Glanville|Glanville| , p238 and then to 32 in  |1998|1998_Fifa_World_Cup| ,  |Glanville|Glanville| , p359 also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals:  |Mexico|Mexico_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in  |1986|1986_Fifa_World_Cup| ;  |Cameroon|Cameroon_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in  |1990|1990_Fifa_World_Cup| ;  |South_Korea|South_Korea_National_Football_Team| , finishing in fourth place in  |2002|2002_Fifa_World_Cup| ;  |Senegal|Senegal_National_Football_Team| , along with  |USA|United_States_Mens_National_Soccer_Team| , both quarter-finalists in 2002;  |Ghana|Ghana_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in 2010; and  |Costa_Rica|Costa_Rica_National_Football_Team| , quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.     Two hundred teams entered the  |2002_FIFA_World_Cup|2002_Fifa_World_Cup|  qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the  |2006_FIFA_World_Cup|2006_Fifa_World_Cup| , while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the  |2010_FIFA_World_Cup|2010_Fifa_World_Cup| .        In October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the  |Caribbean_Football_Unions|Caribbean_Football_Union|  region a position in the World Cup.  In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the FIFA Weekly Blatter wrote that: From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.  Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.      Following the magazines publication, Blatters would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency,  |UEFA|Uefa|  President  |Michel_Platini|Michel_Platini| , responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to  |UEFA|Uefa| , two each to the  |Asian_Football_Confederation|Asian_Football_Confederation|  and the  |Confederation_of_African_Football|Confederation_Of_African_Football| , two shared between  |CONCACAF|Concacaf|  and  |CONMEBOL|Conmebol| , and a guaranteed place for the  |Oceania_Football_Confederation|Oceania_Football_Confederation| .  Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: not based on the quality of the teams because you dont have the best 32 at the World Cup  ... but its a good compromise.  ... Its a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you dont give the possibility to participate, they dont improve.     In October 2016, FIFA president  |Gianni_Infantino|Gianni_Infantino|  stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026.  - The Guardian, 3 October 2016 On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.             By May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights for FIFA games,  with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150  million over 24 years. In late May, the US Department of Justice announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December.  By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.      On 4 June 2015  |Chuck_Blazer|Chuck_Blazer|  while co-operating with the  |FBI|Fbi|  and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFAs then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups.

Then-secretary general  |Jérôme_Valcke|Jérôme_Valcke|  stated, Due to the situation, I think its nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.  On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.      On 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May.

Retrieved 8 September 2017             From 1930 to 1970, the  Jules Rimet Trophy  was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president  |Jules_Rimet|Jules_Rimet|  who set up the first tournament. In  |1970|1970_Fifa_World_Cup| ,  |Brazils|Brazil_National_Football_Team|  third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.         After 1970, a new trophy, known as the  |FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy|Fifa_World_Cup_Trophyfifa_World_Cup_Trophy| , was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer  |Silvio_Gazzaniga|Silvio_Gazzaniga| . The new trophy is  high, made of solid 18  |carat|Carat|  gold and weighs .  The base contains two layers of semi-precious  |malachite|Malachite|  while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since  |1974|1974_Fifa_World_Cup| . The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.      This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.      Currently, all members of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the  |World_Cup_Trophy|Fifa_World_Cup_Trophyfifa_World_Cup_Trophy| ; winners , runners-up , and third-place . In the  |2002_edition|2002_Fifa_World_Cup| , fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts  |South_Korea|South_Korea_National_Football_Team| . Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners medals.                 Since the second World Cup in  |1934|1934_Fifa_World_Cup| , qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.  They are held within the six FIFA continental zones , overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations teams.     The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental  |play_offs|Play_Off| . For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the  |2010_World_Cup|2010_Fifa_World_Cup| .  From the  |1938_World_Cup|1938_Fifa_World_Cup|  onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the  |2006_FIFA_World_Cup|2006_Fifa_World_Cup|  onward, requiring the champions to qualify.  |Brazil|Brazil_National_Football_Team| , winners in  |2002|2002_Fifa_World_Cup| , were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.           The current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nation. There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.      In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the  |FIFA_World_Rankings|Fifa_World_Rankings|  and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.  The other teams are assigned to different pots , usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since  |1998|1998_Fifa_World_Cup| , constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation. Previously, due to there being fewer finals places and a bigger ratio of European finalists, there had been several occasions where three European teams were in a single group, for example, 1986 , 1990 , and 1994 .      Each group plays a  |round_robin_tournament|Round_Robin_Tournament| , in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams. This practice has been installed since the  |1986_FIFA_World_Cup|1986_Fifa_World_Cup| . In some cases during previous tournaments, for example, Argentina 6–0 Peru in  |Argentina_1978|1978_Fifa_World_Cup|  and  |West_Germany_1–0_Austria|West_Germany_1–0_Austria|  in  |Spain_1982|1982_Fifa_World_Cup| , teams that played the latter match were perceived to gain an unfair advantage by knowing the score of the earlier match, and subsequently  |obtaining_a_result_that_ensured_advancement_to_the_next_stage|Match_Fixingmatch_Fixing_To_A_Draw_Or_A_Fixed_Score| .  The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since  |1994|1994_Fifa_World_Cup| ,  |three_points_have_been_awarded_for_a_win|Three_Points_For_A_Win| , one for a draw and none for a loss .     If one considers all possible outcomes for all six matches in a group, there are 729 outcome combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined as follows:    Greatest combined goal difference in all group matches   Greatest combined number of goals scored in all group matches   If more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined as follows:   Greatest number of points in head-to-head matches among those teams   Greatest goal difference in head-to-head matches among those teams   Greatest number of goals scored in head-to-head matches among those teams   Fair play points, defined by the number of yellow and red cards received in the group stage:   Yellow card: minus 1 point   Indirect red card : minus 3 points   Direct red card: minus 4 points   Yellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points   If any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots     The knockout stage is a  |single_elimination_tournament|Single_Elimination_Tournament|  in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with  |extra_time|Extra_Time|  and  |penalty_shootouts|Penalty_Shootout|  used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the  |third_place_match|Third_Place_Playoff|  , and the final.     On 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup , which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.                      Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFAs congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the  |first_World_Cup|1930_Fifa_World_Cup|  in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.  The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the  |1938_FIFA_World_Cup|1938_Fifa_World_Cup| .      Since the  |1958_FIFA_World_Cup|1958_Fifa_World_Cup| , to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the  |1998_FIFA_World_Cup|1998_Fifa_World_Cup| . The  |2002_FIFA_World_Cup|2002_Fifa_World_Cup| , hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts.  South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in  |2010|2010_Fifa_World_Cup| . The  |2014_FIFA_World_Cup|2014_Fifa_World_Cup|  was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since  |Argentina_1978|1978_Fifa_World_Cup| ,  and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.      The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFAs Council. This is done under an  |exhaustive_ballot|Exhaustive_Ballot|  system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a Hosting Agreement from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the  |2018_and_2022_World_Cups|2018_And_2022_Fifa_World_Cup_Bids| , which were awarded to  |Russia|Russia|  and  |Qatar|Qatar| , with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.       For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the  |controversy|Fifa_World_Cup_Hosts2006_Fifa_World_Cup|  surrounding Germanys victory over South Africa in the vote to host the  |2006_tournament|2006_Fifa_World_Cup| . However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from  |2018|2018_Fifa_World_Cup| .  This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder. Collett, Mike , . Reuters.
