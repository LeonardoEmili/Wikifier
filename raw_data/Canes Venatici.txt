Canes Venatici  is one of the 88 official modern  |constellations|Constellation| . It is a small northern constellation that was created by  |Johannes_Hevelius|Johannes_Hevelius|  in the 17th century. Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for  |hunting_dogs|Hunting_Dog|  , and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of  |Boötes|Boötes|  the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.  |Cor_Caroli|Cor_Caroli|  is the constellations brightest star, with an apparent magnitude of 2.9.  |La_Superba|La_Superba|  is one of the reddest stars in the sky and one of the brightest carbon stars. The  |Whirlpool_Galaxy|Whirlpool_Galaxy|  is a  |spiral_galaxy|Spiral_Galaxy|  tilted face-on to observers on Earth, and was the first galaxy whose spiral nature was discerned.             The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were listed by  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  as unfigured stars below the constellation  |Ursa_Major|Ursa_Major|  in his  |star_catalogue|Star_Catalogue| .     In  |medieval_times|Middle_Ages| , the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation. Some of Boötess stars were traditionally described as representing the  |club|Club|   of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemys  Almagest  was translated from Greek to  |Arabic|Arabic| , the translator  |Hunayn_ibn_Ishaq|Hunayn_Ibn_Ishaq|  did not know the Greek word and rendered it as a similar-sounding Arabic word for a weapon, writing al-aşā dhāt al-kullāb , which means the spearshaft having a hook . When the Arabic text was later translated into  |Latin|Latin| , the translator  |Gerard_of_Cremona|Gerard_Of_Cremona|  mistook kullāb, meaning hook , for kilāb , meaning dogs , writing hastile habens canes .       In 1533, the German astronomer  |Peter_Apian|Peter_Apian|  depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.       These spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until  |Hevelius|Johannes_Hevelius|  decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation in 1687.   Hevelius chose the name Asterion  for the northern dog and Chara for the southern dog, as Canes Venatici, the Hunting Dogs, in his  |star_atlas|Star_Atlas| .    In his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer  |Bečvář|Antonín_Bečvář|  assigned the names Asterion to β CVn and Chara to α CVn.        Canes Venatici is bordered by  |Ursa_Major|Ursa_Major|  to the north and west,  |Coma_Berenices|Coma_Berenices|  to the south, and  |Boötes|Boötes|  to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is CVn.  The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between +27.84° and +52.36°.  Covering 465 square degrees, it ranks 38th of the 88 constellations in size.                   Canes Venatici contains no bright stars,  |Alpha|Alpha_Canum_Venaticorum|  and  |Beta_Canum_Venaticorum|Beta_Canum_Venaticorum|  being only of 3rd and 4th  |magnitude|Magnitude|  respectively. Flamsteed catalogued 25 stars in the constellation, labelling them 1 to 25 Canum Venaticorum, however 1 turned out to be in Ursa Major, 13 was in Coma Berenices, and 22 did not exist.  |star|Star| , named by Sir  |Charles_Scarborough|Charles_Scarborough|  in memory of  |King_Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England| , the deposed king of Britain. According to R. H. Allen , the star was named by Halley for Charles II at the suggestion of the court physician Sir Charles Scarborough, who said it had shone with special brilliance on the eve of the kings return to London, May 29, 1660 . According to Deborah J. Warner , it was originally named Cor Caroli Regis Martyris for Charles I. According to Robert Burnham, Jr. , the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by  |Johann_Bode|Johann_Elert_Bode|  at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification . Legend has it that α CVn was brighter than usual during the  |Restoration|Restoration| , as  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide  |double_star|Double_Star| , with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field.    |Beta_Canum_Venaticorum|Beta_Canum_Venaticorum| , or Chara, is a yellow-hued  |main_sequence_star|Main_Sequence_Star|  of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for joy .    |Y_Canum_Venaticorum|Y_Canum_Venaticorum|   is a  |semiregular_variable_star|Semiregular_Variable_Star|  that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days. It is a  |carbon_star|Carbon_Star|  and is deep red in color.    |AM_Canum_Venaticorum|Am_Canum_Venaticorum| , a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of  |cataclysmic_variable_stars|Cataclysmic_Variable_Star| , in which the companion star is a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf| , rather than a  |main_sequence_star|Main_Sequence_Star| .    |RS_Canum_Venaticorum|Rs_Canum_Venaticorum|  is the prototype of a  |special_class_of_binary_stars|Rs_Canum_Venaticorum_Variable|   of  |chromospherically|Chromosphere|  active and optically  |variable|Variable_Star|  components.    |R_Canum_Venaticorum|R_Canum_Venaticorum|  is a Mira variable that ranges between magnitudes 6.5 and 12.9 over a period of approximately 329 days.         The  |Giant_Void|Giant_Void| , an extremely large  |void|Void|  is within the vicinity of this constellation. It may be possibly the  |largest_void|List_Of_Largest_Cosmic_Structureslist_Of_Largest_Known_Voids|  ever discovered, slightly larger than the  |Eridanus_Supervoid|Cmb_Cold_Spot|  and 1,200 times the volume of expected typical voids. It was discovered in 1988 in a deep-sky survey.         Canes Venatici contains five  |Messier_objects|Messier_Object| , including four  |galaxies|Galaxy| . One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the  |Whirlpool_Galaxy|Whirlpool_Galaxy|  and  |NGC_5195|Ngc_5195| , a small barred  |spiral_galaxy|Spiral_Galaxy|  that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by  |Lord_Rosse|William_Parsons,_3Rd_Earl_Of_Rosse|  in 1845. It is a face-on spiral galaxy 37 million light-years from Earth. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful galaxies visible, M51 has many  |star-forming_regions|Star_Formation|  and  |nebulae|Nebula|  in its arms, coloring them pink and blue in contrast to the older yellow core. M51 has a smaller companion, NGC 5195, that has very few star-forming regions and thus appears yellow. It is passing behind M51 and may be the cause of the larger galaxys prodigious star formation.

NGC 4707 - HST - Potw1651a.tif Spiral galaxy  |NGC_4707|Ngc_4707|  lies roughly 22 million light-years from Earth.        Other notable spiral galaxies in Canes Venatici are the  |Sunflower_Galaxy|Sunflower_Galaxy|  ,  |M94|Messier_94|  , and  |M106|Messier_106|  . M63, the Sunflower Galaxy, was named for its appearance in large amateur telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 9.0. M94 is a small face-on spiral galaxy with an approximate magnitude of 8.0, about 15 million light-years from Earth.  |NGC_4631|Ngc_4631|  is a barred spiral galaxy, which is one of the largest and brightest edge-on galaxies in the sky. OMeara, Stephen James: The Caldwell Objects, Sky Publishing Corporation  page 126      |M3|Messier_3|  is a  |globular_cluster|Globular_Cluster|  32,000 light-years from Earth. It is 18 in diameter, and at magnitude 6.3 is bright enough to be seen with  |binoculars|Binoculars| . It can even be seen with the naked eye under particularly dark skies.     M94, also classified as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms and a bright core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  because of a ring of  |new_stars|Star_Formation|  surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a  |bar|Barred_Spiral_Galaxy| .
