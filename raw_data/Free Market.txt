      In  |economics|Economics| , a free market is a  |system|Economic_System|  in which the  |prices|Price|  for  |goods_and_services|Goods_And_Services|  are self-regulated by the  |open_market|Open_Market|  and by  |consumers|Consumer| . In a free market, the laws and forces of  |supply_and_demand|Supply_And_Demand|  are free from any intervention by a  |government|Forms_Of_Government|  or other authority and from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities. Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a  |regulated_market|Regulated_Market|  in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as  |tariffs|Tariff|  used to restrict trade and to protect the local economy. In an idealized  |free-market_economy|Free-Market_Economy| , prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of  |equilibrium|Economic_Equilibrium|  without intervention by government policy.     Scholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a  |coordinated_market|Coordinated_Market_Economy|  in fields of study such as  |political_economy|Political_Economy| ,  |new_institutional_economics|New_Institutional_Economics| ,  |economic_sociology|Economic_Sociology|  and  |political_science|Political_Science| . All of these fields emphasize the importance in currently existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution. Although free markets are commonly associated with  |capitalism|Capitalism|  within a  |market_economy|Market_Economy|  in contemporary usage and  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture| , free markets have also been advocated by  |anarchists|Free-Market_Anarchism| ,  |socialists|Market_Socialism|  and some proponents of  |cooperatives|Cooperative|  and advocates of  |profit_sharing|Profit_Sharing| .  Criticism of the theoretical concept may regard systems with significant  |market_power|Market_Power| ,  |inequality_of_bargaining_power|Inequality_Of_Bargaining_Power| , or  |information_asymmetry|Information_Asymmetry|  as less than free, with regulation being necessary to control those imbalances in order to allow markets to function more efficiently as well as produce more desirable social outcomes.       Laissez-faire economics       The laissez-faire principle expresses a preference for an absence of non-market pressures on prices and wages such as those from discriminatory government  |tax|Tax| es,  |subsidies|Subsidy| ,  |tariffs|Tariff| ,  |regulations|Regulation|  of purely private behavior, or  |government-granted|Government-Granted_Monopoly|  or  |coercive_monopolies|Coercive_Monopoly| . In The Pure Theory of Capital,  |Friedrich_Hayek|Friedrich_Hayek|  argued that the goal is the preservation of the unique information contained in the price itself. Hayek, Friedrich . The Pure Theory of Capital.     The definition of free market has been disputed and made complex by collectivist political philosophers and socialist economic ideas.  This contention arose from the divergence from  |classical_economists|Classical_Economics|  such as  |Richard_Cantillon|Richard_Cantillon| ,  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| ,  |David_Ricardo|David_Ricardo|  and  |Thomas_Robert_Malthus|Thomas_Robert_Malthus|  and from the continental  |economic_science|Economics|  developed primarily by the Spanish scholastic and French classical economists, including  |Anne-Robert-Jacques_Turgot,_Baron_de_Laune|Anne-Robert-Jacques_Turgot,_Baron_De_Laune| ,  |Jean-Baptiste_Say|Jean-Baptiste_Say|  and  |Frédéric_Bastiat|Frédéric_Bastiat| .

Critics of laissez-faire as commonly understood argue that a truly laissez-faire system would be  |anti-capitalist|Anti-Capitalist|  and  |socialist|Libertarian_Socialism| . Nick Manley, . Nick Manley, .             Various forms of  |socialism|Socialism|  based on free markets have existed since the 19th century. Early notable socialist proponents of free markets include  |Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon|Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon| ,  |Benjamin_Tucker|Benjamin_Tucker|  and the  |Ricardian_socialists|Ricardian_Socialist| . These economists believed that genuinely free markets and  |voluntary_exchange|Voluntary_Exchange|  could not exist within the  |exploitative|Exploitation|  conditions of  |capitalism|Capitalist_Mode_Of_Production| . These proposals ranged from various forms of  |worker_cooperatives|Worker_Cooperative|  operating in a free-market economy such as the  |mutualist|Mutualism|  system proposed by Proudhon, to state-owned enterprises operating in unregulated and open markets. These models of socialism are not to be confused with other forms of market socialism  where publicly owned enterprises are coordinated by various degrees of  |economic_planning|Economic_Planning| , or where capital good prices are determined through marginal cost pricing.     Advocates of free-market socialism such as  |Jaroslav_Vanek|Jaroslav_Vanek|  argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property. Instead, he contends that the class differences and inequalities in income and power that result from private ownership enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the market to their favor, either in the form of monopoly and market power, or by utilizing their wealth and resources to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests. . Interview by Albert Perkins. Retrieved March 17, 2011. Additionally, Vanek states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximize productivity because they would receive a share of the profits in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary.     Socialists also assert that free-market capitalism leads to an excessively skewed distribution of income which in turn leads to social instability. As a result, corrective measures in the form of  |social_welfare|Social_Welfare| , re-distributive taxation and administrative costs are required, but they end up being paid into workers hands who spend and help the economy to run. They claim corporate monopolies run rampant in free markets, with endless agency over the consumer. Thus, free-market socialism desires government regulation of markets to prevent social instability, although at the cost of taxpayer dollars. The Political Economy of Socialism, by Horvat, Branko , pp. 197–98.          For classical economists such as  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| , the term free market does not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities. This implies that  |economic_rents|Economic_Rent| , i.e. profits generated from a lack of  |perfect_competition|Perfect_Competition| , must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.     Economic theory suggests the returns to  |land|Land|  and other  |natural_resources|Natural_Resource|  are economic rents that cannot be reduced in such a way because of their perfect inelastic supply.  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| ,  The Wealth of Nations   |Book_V,_Chapter_2|S:The_Wealth_Of_Nations/Book_V/Chapter_2| , Part 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses. Some economic thinkers emphasize the need to share those rents as an essential requirement for a well functioning market. It is suggested this would both eliminate the need for regular taxes that have a negative effect on trade  as well as release land and resources that are speculated upon or monopolised. Two features that improve the competition and free market mechanisms.  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  supported this view by the following statement: Land is the mother of all monopoly . House Of Commons May 4th; Kings Theatre, Edinburgh, July 17 The American economist and social philosopher  |Henry_George|Henry_George| , the most famous proponent of this thesis, wanted to accomplish this through a high  |land_value_tax|Land_Value_Tax|  that replaces all other taxes. Backhaus, Henry Georges Ingenious Tax, pp. 453–58. Followers of his ideas are often called  |Georgists|Georgism|  or geoists and  |geolibertarians|Geolibertarianism| .      |Léon_Walras|Léon_Walras| , one of the founders of the  |neoclassical_economics|Neoclassical_Economics|  who helped formulate the  |general_equilibrium_theory|General_Equilibrium_Theory| , had a very similar view. He argued that free competition could only be realized under conditions of state ownership of natural resources and land. Additionally, income taxes could be eliminated because the state would receive income to finance public services through owning such resources and enterprises.      laissez-faire capitalist systems  |employee-owned_companies|Employee_Stock_Ownership_Plan|  were the norm as envisioned by various thinkers including  |Louis_O._Kelso|Louis_O._Kelso|  and  |James_S._Albus|James_S._Albus| .         Conditions that must exist for unregulated markets to behave as free markets are summarized at  |perfect_competition|Perfect_Competition| . An absence of any of these perfect competition ideal conditions is a  |market_failure|Market_Failure| . Most schools of economics allow that regulatory intervention may provide a substitute force to counter a market failure. Under this thinking, this form of market regulation may be better than an unregulated market at providing a free market.          Demand for an item refers to the economic market pressure from people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves meet is the equilibrium price of the good and quantity demanded. Sellers willing to offer their goods at a lower price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as  |producer_surplus|Producer_Surplus| . Buyers willing to pay for goods at a higher price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as  |consumer_surplus|Consumer_Surplus| .      The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The consumers are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. As more people offer their labor in that market, the equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium level of employment increases as the supply curve shifts to the right. The opposite happens if fewer people offer their wages in the market as the supply curve shifts to the left.     In a free market, individuals and firms taking part in these transactions have the liberty to enter, leave and participate in the market as they so choose. Prices and quantities are allowed to adjust according to economic conditions in order to reach equilibrium and properly allocate resources. However, in many countries around the world governments seek to intervene in the free market in order to achieve certain social or political agendas.  Governments may attempt to create  |social_equality|Social_Equality|  or  |equality_of_outcome|Equality_Of_Outcome|  by intervening in the market through actions such as imposing a  |minimum_wage|Minimum_Wage|  or erecting  |price_controls|Price_Controls|  . Other lesser-known goals are also pursued, such as in the United States, where the federal government subsidizes owners of fertile land to not grow crops in order to prevent the supply curve from further shifting to the right and decreasing the equilibrium price. This is done under the justification of maintaining farmers profits; due to the relative  |inelasticity|Elasticity|  of demand for crops, increased supply would lower the price but not significantly increase quantity demanded, thus placing pressure on farmers to exit the market.  Those interventions are often done in the name of maintaining basic assumptions of free markets such as the idea that the costs of production must be included in the price of goods. Pollution and depletion costs are sometimes not included in the cost of production , therefore governments may opt to impose regulations in an attempt to try to internalize all of the cost of production and ultimately include them in the price of the goods.     Advocates of the free market contend that government intervention hampers economic growth by disrupting the natural allocation of resources according to supply and demand while critics of the free market contend that government intervention is sometimes necessary to protect a countrys economy from better-developed and more influential economies, while providing the stability necessary for wise long-term investment.  |Milton_Friedman|Milton_Friedman|  pointed to failures of  |central_planning|Central_Planning| ,  |price_controls|Price_Controls|  and  |state-owned_corporations|Government-Owned_Corporation| , particularly in the  |Soviet_Union|Economy_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  and  |China|Economy_Of_China|   while  |Ha-Joon_Chang|Ha-Joon_Chang|  cites the examples of post-war Japan and the growth of South Koreas steel industry.  |Bad_Samaritans:_The_Myth_of_Free_Trade_and_the_Secret_History_of_Capitalism|Bad_Samaritans:_The_Myth_Of_Free_Trade_And_The_Secret_History_Of_Capitalism|  , Ha-Joon Chang, Bloomsbury Press,              With varying degrees of mathematical rigor over time, the  |general_equilibrium_theory|General_Equilibrium_Theory|  has demonstrated that under certain conditions of  |competition|Perfect_Competition|  the law of  |supply_and_demand|Supply_And_Demand|  predominates in this ideal free and competitive market, influencing prices toward an  |equilibrium|Economic_Equilibrium|  that balances the demands for the products against the supplies. Theory of Value by  |Gérard_Debreu|Gérard_Debreu| . At these equilibrium prices, the market distributes the products to the purchasers according to each purchasers preference or  |utility|Utility|  for each product and within the relative limits of each buyers  |purchasing_power|Purchasing_Power| . This result is described as market efficiency, or more specifically a  |Pareto_optimum|Pareto_Optimum| .     This equilibrating behavior of free markets requires certain assumptions about their agents—collectively known as  |perfect_competition|Perfect_Competition| —which therefore cannot be results of the market that they create. Among these assumptions are several which are impossible to fully achieve in a real market, such as complete information, interchangeable goods and services and lack of market power. The question then is what approximations of these conditions guarantee approximations of market efficiency and which failures in competition generate overall market failures. Several  |Nobel_Prizes_in_Economics|Nobel_Memorial_Prize_In_Economic_Sciences|  have been awarded for analyses of market failures due to  |asymmetric_information|Asymmetric_Information| .          A free market does not require the existence of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants. Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, for example, paid licensing certification for certain services and businesses, competition between businesses flourishes all through the demands of consumers, or buyers. It often suggests the presence of the  |profit_motive|Profit_Motive| , although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a free market. All modern free markets are understood to include  |entrepreneurs|Entrepreneur| , both individuals and  |business|Business| es. Typically, a modern free-market economy would include other features such as a  |stock_exchange|Stock_Exchange|  and a  |financial_services|Financial_Services|  sector, but they do not define it.              |Friedrich_Hayek|Friedrich_Hayek|  popularized the view that market economies promote  |spontaneous_order|Spontaneous_Order|  which results in a better allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve . Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christina. Hayeks Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment. Routledge. 2001. p. 2. According to this view, market economies are characterized by the formation of complex transactional networks which produce and distribute goods and services throughout the economy. These networks are not designed, but they nevertheless emerge as a result of decentralized individual economic decisions. The idea of spontaneous order is an elaboration on the  |invisible_hand|Invisible_Hand|  proposed by  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith|  in  The Wealth of Nations . About the individual, Smith wrote:   By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. Smith, Adam . The Wealth of Naton. Book IV. . Worstall, Tim. . Forbes. April 25, 2014. Retrieved March 20, 2019.     Smith pointed out that one does not get ones dinner by appealing to the brother-love of the butcher, the farmer or the baker. Rather, one appeals to their self-interest and pays them for their labor, arguing:   It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.      Supporters of this view claim that spontaneous order is superior to any order that does not allow individuals to make their own choices of what to produce, what to buy, what to sell and at what prices due to the number and complexity of the factors involved. They further believe that any attempt to implement central planning will result in more disorder, or a less efficient production and distribution of goods and services.     Critics such as political economist  |Karl_Polanyi|Karl_Polanyi|  question whether a spontaneously ordered market can exist, completely free of distortions of political policy, claiming that even the ostensibly freest markets require a state to exercise coercive power in some areas, namely to enforce  |contracts|Contract| , govern the formation of  |labor_unions|Labor_Union| , spell out the rights and obligations of  |corporations|Corporation| , shape who has standing to bring legal actions and define what constitutes an unacceptable  |conflict_of_interest|Conflict_Of_Interest| .  |Hacker,_Jacob_S.|Jacob_S._Hacker| ;  |Pierson,_Paul|Paul_Pierson|  .

In 1986, they introduced the  |Index_of_Economic_Freedom|Index_Of_Economic_Freedom|  which is based on some fifty variables. While this and other similar indices do not necessarily define a free market, The Heritage Foundation measures the degree to which a modern economy is free. The variables are divided into the following major groups:   Trade policy    |Fiscal_burden_of_government|Fiscal_Burden_Of_Government|   International free trade improved the country and in order for Americans to prosper from a strong economy they had no choice but to embrace it.  Each group is assigned a numerical value between 1 and 5 as the index is the arithmetical mean of the values, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Initially, countries which were traditionally considered capitalistic received high ratings, but the method improved over time.

The Free Market Monument Foundation defines the principles of a free market as such:  . Free Market Monument Foundation.   Individual rights: We are each created with equal individual rights to control and to defend our life, liberty and property and to voluntary contractual exchange.   Limited government: Governments are instituted only to secure individual rights, deriving their just powers from the  |consent_of_the_governed|Consent_Of_The_Governed| .   Equal justice under law: Government must treat everyone equally; neither rewarding failure nor punishing success.   Subsidiarity: Government authority must reside at the lowest feasible level.   Spontaneous order: When individual rights are respected, unregulated competition will maximize economic benefit for society by providing the most goods and services possible at the lowest cost.   Property rights: Private ownership is the most efficient way to sustainably utilize resources.   Golden rule: Deal with others honestly and require honesty in return.          Critics of the free market have argued that in real world situations it has proven to be susceptible to the development of  |price_fixing|Price_Fixing|  monopolies.  Such reasoning has led to government intervention, e.g. the  |United_States_antitrust_law|United_States_Antitrust_Law| .     Two prominent Canadian authors argue that government at times has to intervene to ensure competition in large and important industries.  |Naomi_Klein|Naomi_Klein|  illustrates this roughly in her work  The Shock Doctrine  and  |John_Ralston_Saul|John_Ralston_Saul|  more humorously illustrates this through various examples in The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World. Saul, John The End of Globalism. While its supporters argue that only a free market can create healthy competition and therefore more business and reasonable prices, opponents say that a free market in its purest form may result in the opposite. According to Klein and Ralston, the merging of companies into giant corporations or the privatization of government-run industry and national assets often result in monopolies or oligopolies requiring government intervention to  |force_competition|Competition_Law|  and reasonable prices. Another form of market failure is  |speculation|Speculation| , where transactions are made to profit from short term fluctuation, rather from the  |intrinsic_value|Intrinsic_Value|  of the companies or products.
