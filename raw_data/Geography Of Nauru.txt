|Nauru|Nauru|  is a tiny phosphate rock island nation located in the South  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean|  south of the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  in  |Oceania|Oceania| . It is only  south of the  |Equator|Equator|  at  |coordinates|Geographic_Coordinate_System|  . Nauru is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean—the others are  |Banaba|Banaba_Island|  in  |Kiribati|Kiribati|  and  |Makatea|Makatea|  in  |French_Polynesia|French_Polynesia| .     Its land area is , and it has a . Maritime claims are an  |Exclusive_Economic_Zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|  of  with 200-nautical-miles , and a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea.     The  |climate|Climate|  is  |tropical|Tropical|  with a  |monsoon|Monsoon|  rainy season from November to February.     A sandy beach rises to the fertile ring around raised  |coral_reefs|Coral_Reef| .  The raised phosphate plateau takes up the central portion of the island. The highest point is 213  ft above sea level, along the plateau rim.     Naurus only economically significant natural resources are  |phosphates|Phosphate| , formed from  |guano|Guano|  deposits by seabirds over thousands of years,  and fisheries,  Working Paper 17 of the 4th Scientific Committee of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. WCPFC 2008. particularly for  |tuna|Tuna| .     Due to being surrounded by  |corals|Coral|  and sandy beaches, the island houses no natural  |harbours|Harbour| , nor any  |rivers|River|  or substantial  |lakes|Lake| .     Nauru has its  |unique_navigational_system|Nauruan_Navigational_System| , which is only capable of being used on the island.             Nauru is a  |raised_coral_atoll|Raised_Coral_Atoll|  positioned in the Nauru Basin of the Pacific Ocean, on a part of the  |Pacific_Plate|Pacific_Plate|  that formed at a  |mid-oceanic_ridge|Mid_Oceanic_Ridge|  at 132  |Ma|Mega-Annum| . From mid- |Eocene|Eocene|  to  |Oligocene|Oligocene|  times, a submarine  |volcano|Volcano|  built up over a  |hotspot|Hotspot|  and formed a  |seamount|Seamount|  composed of  |basalt|Basalt| . The seamount is over 4300 metres high. This hotspot was simultaneous with a major Pacific Plate reorganisation. The volcano was eroded to sea level and a  |coral|Coral| |atoll|Atoll|  grew on top to a thickness of about 500 metres. Coral near the surface has been dated from 5 Mya to 0.3 Mya. The original limestone has been  |dolomitised|Dolomitised|  by  |magnesium|Magnesium|  from  |seawater|Sea_Water| . The coral was raised above sea level about 30 metres and is now a dolomite limestone outcrop which was eroded in classic  |karst|Karst|  style into  |pinnacles|Pinnacle|  up to 20 metres high. To at least a depth of 55 metres below sea level, the limestone has been dissolved forming cavities, sinkholes, and caves. Holes on the topside of the island were filled up by a  |phosphate|Phosphate|  layer up to several metres thick.      |Anibare_Bay|Anibare_Bay|  was formed by the underwater collapse of the east side of the volcano.    |Buada_Lagoon|Buada_Lagoon|  was formed by solution of the limestone when the sea level was lower, followed by collapse.     Nauru is moving at 104  mm per year to the northwest along with the Pacific Plate.     Streams and rivers dont exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems. Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate.      Freshwater can be found in Buada lagoon, and also in some brackish ponds at the escarpment base in  |Ijuw|Ijuw_District|  and  |Anabar|Anabar_District|  in the northeast. There is an underground lake in Moqua Cave in the southeast of the island.       Periodic  |droughts|Drought| , limited natural freshwater resources    Extreme soil conditions are caused by high alkalinity, high phosphate levels, and low  |potassium|Potassium| .  |Iron|Iron| ,  |manganese|Manganese| ,  |copper|Copper| ,  |molybdenum|Molybdenum| , and  |zinc|Zinc|  are rendered unavailable to plants. Combined with thin or damaged soils this causes low fertility.   Intensive  |phosphate_mining|Phosphate_Mining_In_Nauru|  during the past 90 years has left the central 80% of Nauru a wasteland and threatens limited remaining land resources.     Nauru is a party to the international environmental agreements on  |biodiversity|Convention_On_Biological_Diversity| ,  |climate_change|United_Nations_Framework_Convention_On_Climate_Change| ,  |desertification|United_Nations_Convention_To_Combat_Desertification| ,the  |law_of_the_sea|United_Nations_Convention_On_The_Law_Of_The_Sea|  and  |marine_dumping|Convention_On_The_Prevention_Of_Marine_Pollution_By_Dumping_Wastes_And_Other_Matter| .
