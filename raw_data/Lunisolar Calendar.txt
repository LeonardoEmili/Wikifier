A lunisolar calendar is a  |calendar|Calendar|  in many  |cultures|Culture|  whose date indicates both the  |Moon_phase|Moon_Phase|  and the time of the solar  |year|Year| . If the solar year is defined as a  |tropical_year|Tropical_Year| , then a lunisolar calendar will give an indication of the  |season|Season| ;if it is taken as a  |sidereal_year|Sidereal_Year| , then the calendar will predict the  |constellation|Constellation|  near which the  |full_moon|Full_Moon|  may occur.As with all calendars which divide the year into months there is an additional requirement that the year have a whole number of months. In this case ordinary years consist of twelve months but every second or third year is an  |embolismic_year|Embolismic_Month| , which adds a thirteenth  |intercalary|Intercalation| , embolismic, or leap month.       The  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Calendar| ,  |Jain|Jain_Calendar| ,  |Buddhist|Buddhist_Calendar| ,  |Hindu|Hindu_Calendar|  and  |Kurdish|Kurdish_Calendar|  as well as the traditional  |Burmese|Burmese_Calendar| ,  |Chinese|Chinese_Calendar| ,  |Japanese|Japanese_Calendar| ,  |Tibetan|Tibetan_Calendar| ,  |Vietnamese|Vietnamese_Calendar| ,  |Mongolian|Mongolian_Calendar|  and  |Korean|Korean_Calendar|  calendars , plus the ancient  |Hellenic|Hellenic_Calendars| ,  |Coligny|Coligny_Calendar| , and  |Babylonian_calendars|Babylonian_Calendar|  are all lunisolar. Also, some of the ancient  |pre-Islamic|Islamic_Calendarpre-Islamic_Calendar|  calendars in  |south_Arabia|South_Arabia|  followed a lunisolar system. F.C. De Blois, TAʾRĪKH : I.1.iv. Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula , The Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edition, X |Germanic_peoples_also_used_a_lunisolar_calendar|Germanic_Calendar|  before their conversion to Christianity.     The  |Islamic_calendar|Islamic_Calendar|  is  |lunar|Lunar_Calendar| , but not a lunisolar calendar because its date is not related to the Sun. The civil versions of the  |Julian|Julian_Calendar|  and  |Gregorian_calendars|Gregorian_Calendar|  are  |solar|Solar_Calendar| , because their dates do not indicate the Moon phase   however, both the Gregorian and Julian calendars include undated lunar calendars that allow them to  |calculate|Computus|  the Christian celebration of  |Easter|Easter| , so both are lunisolar calendars in that respect.          A rough idea of the frequency of the intercalary or leap month in all lunisolar calendars can be obtained by the following calculation, using approximate lengths of months and years in days:   Year: 365.25, Month: 29.53   365.25/ 1.0307   1/0.0307 32.57 common months between leap months   32.57/12 2.7 common years between leap years     Intercalation of leap months is frequently controlled by the epact , which is the difference between the lunar and solar years . The Metonic cycle, used in the Hebrew calendar and the Julian and Gregorian ecclesiastical calendars, adds seven months during every nineteen-year period. The classic  |Metonic|Metonic_Cycle|  cycle can be reproduced by assigning an initial epact value of 1 to the last year of the cycle and incrementing by 11 each year. Between the last year of one cycle and the first year of the next the increment is 12. This adjustment, the saltus lunae, causes the epacts to repeat every 19 years. When the epact goes above 29 an intercalary month is added and 30 is subtracted. The intercalary years are numbers 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19. Both the Hebrew calendar and the Julian calendar use this sequence.     The Buddhist and Hebrew calendars restrict the leap month to a single month of the year; the number of common months between leap months is, therefore, usually 36, but occasionally only 24 months. Because the Chinese and Hindu lunisolar calendars allow the leap month to occur after or before any month but use the true motion of the  |Sun|Sun| , their leap months do not usually occur within a couple of months of  |perihelion|Perihelion| , when the apparent speed of the Sun along the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic|  is fastest . This increases the usual number of common months between leap months to roughly 34 months when a doublet of common years occurs, while reducing the number to about 29 months when only a common singleton occurs.       An alternative way of dealing with the fact that a solar year does not contain an integer number of months is by including uncounted time in the year that does not belong to any month. Some  |Coast_Salish_peoples|Coast_Salish_Peoples|  used a calendar of this kind. For instance, the  |Chehalis|Stsailes|  began their count of lunar months from the arrival of spawning  |chinook_salmon|Chinook_Salmon|  , and counted 10 months, leaving an uncounted period until the next chinook  |salmon_run|Salmon_Run| .

The rules are in the  |Computus|Computus| .
