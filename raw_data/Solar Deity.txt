                       A solar deity  is a  |sky_deity|Sky_Deity|  who represents the  |Sun|Sun| , or an aspect of it, usually by its perceived power and strength. Solar deities and Sun worship can be found throughout most of  |recorded_history|Recorded_History|  in various forms. The Sun is sometimes referred to by its  |Latin|Latin|  name Sol or by its  |Greek|Greek_Language|  name  Helios . The  |English|English_Language|  word sun stems from  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic|  sunnǭ. In most romance languages the word for sun is masculine .   In most Germanic languages it is feminine . In  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European| , its gender was inanimate.       The  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  concept of a solar barge  is found in the later myths of  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| , with  |Ra|Ra|  and  |Horus|Horus| . Predynasty Egyptian beliefs attribute  |Atum|Atum|  as the sun-god and Horus as a god of the sky and Sun. As the  |Old_Kingdom|Old_Kingdom| |theocracy|Theocracy|  gained power, early beliefs were incorporated with the expanding popularity of Ra and the Osiris-Horus mythology. Atum became Ra-Atum, the rays of the setting Sun.  |Osiris|Osiris|  became the divine heir to Atums power on Earth and passes his divine authority to his son Horus.  Early Egyptian myths imply the Sun is within the lioness,  |Sekhmet|Sekhmet| , at night and is reflected in her eyes; or that it is within the cow,  |Hathor|Hathor| , during the night, being reborn each morning as her son .     Mesopotamian  |Shamash|Shamash|  plays an important role during the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| , and my Sun is eventually used as an address to royalty. Similarly, South American cultures have a tradition of Sun worship, as with the Incan  |Inti|Inti| .      |Proto-Indo-European_religion|Proto-Indo-European_Religion|  has a solar chariot, the Sun as traversing the sky in a  |chariot|Chariot| .  In Germanic mythology this is  Sol , in Vedic  |Surya|Surya| , and in Greek  |Helios|Helios|   and as  |Apollo|Apollo| . In Proto-indo-European mythology the sun appears to be a multilayered figure, manifested as a goddess but also perceived as the eye of the sky father  |Dyeus|Dyeus| . Dexter, Miriam Robbins . Proto-Indo-European Sun Maidens and Gods of the Moon . Mankind Quarterly. 25 : 137–144. Sick, David H. , Mitra and the Myths of the Sun , Numen, 51 : 432–467,      During the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , a  |festival|Roman_Festival|  of the birth of the  Unconquered Sun   was celebrated on the  |winter_solstice|Winter_Solstice| —the rebirth of the Sun—which occurred on December 25 of the  |Julian_calendar|Julian_Calendar| . In  |late_antiquity|Late_Antiquity| , the theological centrality of the Sun in some Imperial religious systems suggest a form of a solar  |monotheism|Monotheism|  . The religious commemorations on December 25 were replaced under Christian domination of the Empire with the birthday of Christ. Sun worship.  |Encyclopædia_Britannica|Encyclopædia_Britannica| . Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2009            The  |Tiv_people|Tiv_People|  consider the Sun to be the son of the  |supreme_being|God| |Awondo|Awondo|  and the Moon Awondos daughter. The  |Barotse_tribe|Lozi_People|  believes that the Sun is inhabited by the sky god  |Nyambi|Nyambi|  and the Moon is his wife.   Some  |Sara_people|Sara_People|  also worship the Sun.   Even where the sun god is equated with the supreme being, in some African mythologies he or she does not have any special functions or privileges as compared to other deities. The ancient Egyptian god of creation,  |Amun|Amun|  is also believed to reside inside the sun. So is the  |Akan|Akan_People|  creator deity,  |Nyame|Nyame|  and the  |Dogon|Dogon_People|  deity of creation, Nommo. Also in Egypt, there was a religion that worshipped the Sun directly, and was among the first monotheistic religions:  |Atenism|Atenism| .     Sun worship was prevalent in  |ancient_Egyptian_religion|Ancient_Egyptian_Religion| . The earliest deities associated with the Sun are all goddesses:  |Wadjet|Wadjet| ,  |Sekhmet|Sekhmet| ,  |Hathor|Hathor| ,  |Nut|Nut| ,  |Bast|Bast| ,  |Bat|Bat| , and  |Menhit|Menhit| . First Hathor, and then Isis, give birth to and nurse  |Horus|Horus|  and  |Ra|Ra| . Hathor the horned-cow is one of the 12 daughters of Ra, gifted with joy and is a wet-nurse to Horus.     From at least the  |4th_Dynasty|Fourth_Dynasty_Of_Egypt|  of  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| , the Sun was worshipped as the  |deity|Ancient_Egyptian_Deities| |Re|Ra|  , and portrayed as a falcon headed god surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. Re supposedly gave warmth to the living body, symbolised as an  |ankh|Ankh| |amulet|Amulet|  with a looped upper half. The ankh, it was believed, was surrendered with death, but could be preserved in the corpse with appropriate mummification and  |funerary_rites|Funerary_Cult| . The supremacy of Re in the Egyptian  |pantheon|Pantheon|  was at its highest with the  |5th_Dynasty|Fifth_Dynasty_Of_Egypt| , when open air solar temples became common. In the  |Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt|Middle_Kingdom_Of_Egypt| , Ra lost some of his preeminence to  |Osiris|Osiris| , lord of the West, and judge of the dead. In the  |New_Empire|New_Kingdom_Of_Egypt|  period, the Sun became identified with the  |dung_beetle|Dung_Beetle| , whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun. In the form of the sun disc  |Aten|Aten| , the Sun had a brief resurgence during the  |Amarna_Period|Amarna_Period|  when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the  |Pharaoh|Pharaoh| |Akhenaton|Akhenaton| .       The Suns movement across the sky represents a struggle between the Pharaohs soul and an avatar of Osiris. Ra travels across the sky in his solar-boat; at dawn he drives away the demon king  |Apep|Apep| . The solarisation of several local gods reaches its peak in the period of the  |fifth_dynasty|Fifth_Dynasty_Of_Egypt| .        Rituals to the god Amun who became identified with the sun god Ra were often carried out on the top of temple  |pylons|Pylon| . A Pylon mirrored the hieroglyph for horizon or  akhet , which was a depiction of two hills between which the sun rose and set , Wilkinson, op. cit., p.195 associated with recreation and rebirth. On the first Pylon of the temple of Isis at  |Philae|Philae| , the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies in the presence of Isis, Horus and Hathor.   In the  |eighteenth_dynasty|Eighteenth_Dynasty_Of_Egypt| , the earliest-known monotheistic head of state,  |Akhenaten|Akhenaten|  changed the polytheistic religion of Egypt to a monotheistic one, Atenism of the solar-disk and is the first recorded state monotheism. All other deities were replaced by the Aten, including  |Amun-Ra|Amun-Ra| , the reigning sun god of Akhenatens own region. Unlike other deities, the Aten did not have multiple forms. His only image was a disk—a symbol of the Sun.     Soon after Akhenatens death, worship of the traditional deities was reestablished by the religious leaders who had adopted the Aten during the reign of Akhenaten.       In  |Armenian_mythology|Armenian_Mythology|  and in the vicinity of  |Carahunge|Carahunge| , the ancient site of interest in the field of  |archaeoastronomy|Archaeoastronomy| , people worshiped a powerful deity or intelligence called Ara, embodied as the sun . The ancient Armenians called themselves children of the sun .         In  |Aztec_mythology|Aztec_Mythology| ,  Tonatiuh   was the sun god. The  |Aztec|Aztec|  people considered him the leader of  Tollan  . He was also known as the fifth sun, because the Aztecs believed that he was the sun that took over when the fourth sun was expelled from the sky. According to their  |cosmology|Cosmology| , each sun was a god with its own cosmic era. According to the Aztecs, they were still in Tonatiuhs era. According to the Aztec  |creation_myth|Creation_Myth| , the god demanded  |human_sacrifice|Human_Sacrifice|  as tribute and without it would refuse to move through the sky. The Aztecs were fascinated by the Sun and carefully observed it, and had a  |solar_calendar|Solar_Calendar|  similar to that of the  |Maya|Maya_Civilization| . Many of todays remaining Aztec monuments have structures aligned with the Sun.      In the  |Aztec_calendar|Aztec_Calendar| , Tonatiuh is the lord of the thirteen days from 1 Death to 13 Flint. The preceding thirteen days are ruled over by  |Chalchiuhtlicue|Chalchiuhtlicue| , and the following thirteen by  |Tlaloc|Tlaloc| .         The concept of the sun in  |Pre-Islamic_Arabia|Pre-Islamic_Arabia| , was abolished only under  |Muhammad|Muhammad| . The Sun and the Moon are from among the evidences of God. They do not eclipse because of someones death or life.  |Muhammad_Husayn_Haykal|Muhammad_Husayn_Haykal| , Translated by Ismail Razi A. al-Faruqi, The Life of Muhammad, American Trush Publications, 1976,   The Arabian solar deity appears to have been a goddess,  |Shams|Shams| / |Shamsun|Shamsun| , most likely related to the  |Canaan|Canaan| ite  |Shapash|Shapash|  and broader middle-eastern  |Shamash|Shamash| . She was the patron goddess of  |Himyar|Himyar| , and possibly exalted by the  |Sabaeans|Sabaeans|  and early  |Bedouin|Bedouin| . Yoel Natan, Moon-o-theism, Volume I of II, 2006 Julian Baldick . Black God. Syracuse University Press. p. 20. . Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Websters Encyclopedia of World Religions, 1999 – 1181 páginas          In  |Buddhist_cosmology|Buddhist_Cosmology| , the  |bodhisattva|Bodhisattva|  of the Sun is known as  Sūryaprabha  ; in Chinese he is called Rigong Riguang Pusa , Rigong Riguang Tianzi , or Rigong Riguang Zuntian Pusa , one of the 20 or 24 guardian  devas .     Sūryaprabha is often depicted with  Candraprabha  , called in Chinese Yuegong Yueguang Pusa , Yuegong Yueguang Tianzi , or Yuegong Yueguang Zuntian Pusa . Together with  |Bhaiṣajyaguru_Buddha|Medicine_Buddha|   these two bodhisattvas constitute the Dongfang San Sheng .     The  |devas|Deva| |Surya|Surya|  and  |Candra|Chandra|  are also recognized as deities that embody the Sun and Moon, respectively.             In  |Chinese_mythology|Chinese_Mythology|  , there were originally ten suns in the sky, who were all brothers. They were supposed to emerge one at a time as commanded by the Jade Emperor. They were all very young and loved to fool around. Once they decided to all go into the sky to play, all at once. This made the world too hot for anything to grow. A hero named  |Hou_Yi|Hou_Yi| , honored to this day, shot down nine of them with a bow and arrow to save the people of the Earth.     In another myth, the  |solar_eclipse|Solar_Eclipse|  was caused by the magical dog of heaven biting off a piece of the Sun. The referenced event is said to have occurred around 2,160BCE. There was a tradition in China to make lots of loud celebratory sounds during a solar eclipse to scare the sacred dog away.     The Deity of the Sun in Chinese mythology is Ri Gong Tai Yang Xing Jun or Star Lord of the Solar Palace, Lord of the Sun. In some mythologies, Tai Yang Xing Jun is believed to be Hou Yi.   Tai Yang Xing Jun is usually depicted with the Star Lord of the Lunar Palace, Lord of the Moon, Yue Gong Tai Yin Xing Jun . Worship of the  |moon_goddess|Moon_Goddess| |Change|Change|  and her festivals are very popular among followers of  |Chinese_folk_religion|Chinese_Folk_Religion|  and  |Taoism|Taoism| . Similar to  |Santa_Claus|Santa_Claus|  and  |Christmas|Christmas|  in the West, the goddess and her holy days are ingrained in  |Chinese_popular_culture|Chinese_Popular_Culture| .       Those who practice  |Dievturība|Dievturība| , beliefs of traditional  |Latvian_culture|Latvian_Culture| , celebrate the Sun  |goddess|Goddess| ,  |Saule|Saulė| , known in traditional  |Lithuanian|Lithuanian_Mythology|  beliefs as Saulė. Saule/Saulė is among the most important  |deities|Deities|  in  |Baltic_mythology|Baltic_Mythology|  and traditions.       The sun in  |Insular_Celtic_culture|Insular_Celts|  is assumed to have been feminine,  |Patricia_Monaghan|Patricia_Monaghan| , The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore, page 433. Koch, John T., Celtic Culture: Aberdeen breviary-celticism, page 1636.  and several goddesses have been proposed as possibly solar in character. In  |Continental_Celtic_culture|Continental_Celts| , the sun gods, like  |Belenos|Belenos| ,  |Grannos|Grannus| , and  |Lug|Lugh| , were masculine.        In  |Irish|Irish_Language| , the name of the Sun,  Grian , is feminine. The figure known as  |Áine|Áine|  is generally assumed to have been either synonymous with her, or her sister, assuming the role of Summer Sun while Grian was the Winter Sun. MacKillop pp. 10, 70, 92. Similarly,  |Étaín|Étaín|  has at times been considered to be another theonym associated with the Sun; if this is the case, then the pan-Celtic  |Epona|Epona|  might also have been originally solar in nature, though Roman syncretism pushed her towards a  |lunar|Lunar_Deity|  role.     The British  |Sulis|Sulis|  has a name cognate with that of other Indo-European solar deities such as the Greek  |Helios|Helios|  and Indic  |Surya|Surya| , Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, Errance, 2003, p. 287 Zair, Nicholas, Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals in Celtic, Brill, 2012, p. 120 and bears some solar traits like the association with the eye as well as epithets associated with light. The theonym  |Sulevia|Sulevia| , which is more widespread and probably unrelated to Sulis, Nicole Jufer & Thierry Luginbühl . Les dieux gaulois : répertoire des noms de divinités celtiques connus par lépigraphie, les textes antiques et la toponymie. Editions Errance, Paris. pp. 15, 64. is sometimes taken to have suggested a pan-Celtic role as a solar goddess. She indeed might have been the de facto solar deity of the Celts.     The  |Welsh|Welsh_Mythology| |Olwen|Olwen|  has at times been considered a vestige of the local sun goddess, in part due to the possible etymological association Simon Andrew Stirling, The Grail: Relic of an Ancient Religion, 2015 with the wheel and the colours gold, white and red.      |Brighid|Brighid|  has at times been argued as having had a solar nature, fitting her role as a goddess of fire and light.          The  |Ādityas|Ādityas|  are one of the principal deities of the  |Vedic|Vedic|  classical Hinduism belonging to Solar class. In the  |Vedas|Vedas| , numerous hymns are dedicated to  |Mitra|Mitra| ,  |Varuna|Varuna| ,  |Savitr|Savitr|  etc.     Hymn 7.99 of  |Rigveda|Rigveda| , Indra-Vishnu produces the sun, his discus is a vestige of his solar creation, equivalent to the sun, the Vishnu purana identifies the Discus chakra with the following: thoughts, like the chakra, flow faster than even the mightiest wind..     Even the  |Gayatri_mantra|Gayatri_Mantra| , which is regarded as one of the most sacred of the Vedic hymns is dedicated to  |Savitr|Savitr| , one of the principal Ādityas. The Adityas are a group of solar deities, from the  |Brahmana|Brahmana|  period numbering twelve. The ritual of  Surya Namaskaar , performed by  |Hindus|Hindu| , is an elaborate set of hand gestures and body movements, designed to greet and revere the Sun.     The sun god in  |Hinduism|Hinduism|  is an ancient and revered deity. In later Hindu usage, all the Vedic Ādityas lost identity and metamorphosed into one composite deity,  |Surya|Surya| , the Sun. The attributes of all other Ādityas merged into that of Surya and the names of all other  |Ādityas|Ādityas|  became synonymous with, or epithets of, Surya.     The  Ramayana  has  |Rama|Rama|  as a direct descendant of the  |Surya|Surya| , thus belonging to the  |Suryavansha|Suryavansha|  or the clan of the Sun. The  Mahabharata  describes one of its warrior heroes,  |Karna|Karna| , as being the son of the Pandava mother  |Kunti|Kunti|  and  |Surya|Surya| .     The sun god is said to be married to the goddess Ranaadeh, also known as Sanjnya. She is depicted in dual form, being both sunlight and shadow, personified. The goddess is revered in Gujarat and Rajasthan.     The charioteer of Surya is  |Aruna|Aruṇa| , who is also personified as the redness that accompanies the sunlight in dawn and dusk. The sun god is driven by a seven-horsed Chariot depicting the seven days of the week and the seven colours of rainbow which are seen due to the dispersion by  |Suryas|Surya|  rays.     In India, at  |Konark|Konark| , in the state of  |Odisha|Odisha| , a temple is dedicated to Surya. The  |Konark_Sun_Temple|Konark_Sun_Temple|  has been declared a  |UNESCO|Unesco| |World_Heritage_Site|World_Heritage_Site| . Surya is the most prominent of the  navagrahas  or nine celestial objects of the Hindus. Navagrahas can be found in almost all Hindu temples. There are further temples dedicated to Surya, one in Arasavilli, Srikakulam District in AndhraPradesh, one in Gujarat at  |Modhera|Modhera|  and another in Rajasthan. The temple at Arasavilli was constructed in such a way that on the day of Radhasaptami, the Suns rays directly fall on the feet of the Sri Suryanarayana Swami, the deity at the temple.      |Chhath|Chhath|   is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity, unique to  |Bihar|Bihar| ,  |Jharkhand|Jharkhand|  and the  |Terai|Terai| . This major festival is also celebrated in the northeast region of  |India|India| ,  |Madhya_Pradesh|Madhya_Pradesh| ,  |Uttar_Pradesh|Uttar_Pradesh| , and parts of  |Chhattisgarh|Chhattisgarh| . Hymns to the Sun can be found in the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Practiced in different parts of India, the worship of the Sun has been described in the Rigveda. There is another festival called Sambha-Dasami, which is celebrated in the state of Odisha for the surya.     The  |Gurjars|Gurjar|  , were Sun-worshipers and are described as devoted to the feet of the sun god Surya. Their copper-plate grants bear an emblem of the Sun and on their seals too, this symbol is depicted.        The sun is prayed to by South Indians during the harvest festival.      In  |Tamil_Nadu|Tamil_Nadu| , the  |tamil_people|Tamil_People|  worship the sun god during the  |Tamil|Tamil_Culture|  month of  |Thai|Tamil_Calendar| , after a year of  |crop|Crop|  farming. The month is known as the harvesting month and people pay respects to the sun on the first day of the  |Thai|Tamil_Calendar|  month known as  |Thai_pongal|Thai_Pongal| ,or Pongal, which ia a four day celebration.  .It is one of the few indigenous worship by the  |Tamil_people|Tamil_People|  irrespective of religion.      In other parts of India, the festival is celebrated as  |Makar_Sankranti|Makar_Sankranti|  and is mostly worshipped by the  |hindu_diaspora|Hindu_Diaspora|  of India.                   According to  |one_hypothesis_about_Christmas|Christmassolstice_Date| , it was set to 25 December because it was the date of the festival of  |Sol_Invictus|Sol_Invictus| . This idea became popular especially in the 18th Sir  |Edward_Burnett_Tylor|Edward_Burnett_Tylor| , Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom, Volume 2, p. 270; John Murray, London, 1871; revised edition 1889. Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Volume 3, 1885, T and T Clark, Edinburgh, page 396; see also Volume 4 in the 3rd edition, 1910 . and 19th centuries.        Another speculation connects the biblical elements of Christs life to those of a sun god.  The  |Christian_gospels|Christian_Gospels|  report that Jesus had 12 followers,  which is claimed to be akin to the twelve  |zodiac_constellations|Zodiac_Constellation| . When the Sun was in the house of  |Scorpio|Scorpius| ,  |Judas|Judas|  plotted with the chief  |priests|Priests|  and elders to arrest Jesus  |by_kissing_him|Kiss_Of_Judas| . As the Sun exited  |Libra|Libra| , it enters into the waiting arms of Scorpio to be kissed by Scorpios bite.  Nicholas Campion, The Book of World Horoscopes, The Wessex Astrologer, 1999, p. 489 clearly refers to both conventions adopted by many astrologers basing the Ages on either the zodiacal constellations or the sidereal signs.     Many of the worlds sacrificed  |godmen|God-Man|  have their traditional birthday on December 25. During this time, people believed that the sun god had died for three days and was born again on December 25.  After December 25, the Sun supposedly moves 1 degree north, foreshadowing longer days.  Note: This is a reprint; Kuhn died in 1963. The three days following December 21 remain the darkest days of the year where Jesus dies and remains unseen for three days.       At the beginning of the first century, the Sun on the vernal equinox passed from  |Aries|Aries|  to  |Pisces|Pisces|  . That harmonizes with the mentioned lamb and  |fish|Fish|  in the gospels.   The man carrying a  |pitcher|Pitcher|  of water is  |Aquarius|Aquarius| , the water bearer, who is always seen as a man pouring out a pitcher of water. He represents the age after Pisces, and when the Sun leaves the Age of Pisces , it will go into the House of Aquarius. Albert Amao, Aquarian Age & The Andean Prophecy, AuthorHouse, 2007, p. 56     By the sun of righteousness in  the  |fathers|Church_Fathers| , from  |Justin|Justin_Martyr|  downward, and nearly all the earlier commentators understand Christ, who is supposed to be described as the rising sun . Carl Friedrich Keil, Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament , vol. 25, p. 468; The  |New_Testament|New_Testament|  itself contains a hymn fragment: Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.   |Clement_of_Alexandria|Clement_Of_Alexandria|  wrote of the Sun of the Resurrection, he who was born before the dawn, whose beams give light . Clement of Alexandria, Protreptius 9:84, quoted in David R. Cartlidge, James Keith Elliott, The Art of Christian Legend , p. 64            The  |Philocalian_calendar|Chronography_Of_354|  of AD 354 gives a festival of Natalis Invicti on 25 December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid-4th century. Wallraff 2001: 174–177. Hoey writes: An inscription of unique interest from the reign of Licinius embodies the official prescription for the annual celebration by his army of a festival of Sol Invictus on December 19 . The inscription  actually prescribes an annual offering to Sol on November 18 . Text at  Parts 6 and 12 respectively. The charioteer in the mosaic of Mausoleum M has been interpreted by some as Christ.  |Clement_of_Alexandria|Clement_Of_Alexandria|  had spoken of Christ driving his chariot across the sky.  This interpretation is doubted by others: Only the cross-shaped nimbus makes the Christian significance apparent . , emphasis added and the figure is seen by some simply as a representation of the sun with no explicit religious reference whatever, pagan or Christian.     The idea that Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Jesus on 25 December because this was the date of an already existing festival of the Sol Invictus was expressed in an annotation to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop  |Jacob_Bar-Salibi|Jacob_Bar-Salibi| . The scribe who added it wrote: It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25 December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.  Michael Alan Anderson, Symbols of Saints , p. 45  Natalis Invicti     In the judgement of the Church of England Liturgical Commission, this view has been seriously challenged Although this view is still very common, it has been seriously challenged – Church of England Liturgical Commission, The Promise of His Glory: Services and Prayers for the Season from All Saints to Candlemas quoted in by a view based on an old tradition, according to which the date of Christmas was fixed at nine months after 25 March, the date of the vernal equinox, on which the Annunciation was celebrated. Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church , article Christmas The Jewish calendar date of 14 Nisan was believed to be that of creation , See discussion in the Talmud , and Aryeh Kaplan s The Shofar of Mercy , on the apparent contradiction between that tradition and the Jewish celebration of creation on 1 Tishrei. as well as of the Exodus and so of Passover , and Christians held that the new creation, both the death of Jesus and the beginning of his human life , occurred on the same date, which some put at 25 March in the Julian calendar. Alexander V. G. Allen, Christian Institutions , p. 474 , p.72 Frank C. Senn, Introduction to Christian Liturgy , p. 114     It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men lived a whole number of years, without fractions, so that Jesus was considered to have been conceived on 25 March, as he died on 25 March, which was calculated to have coincided with 14 Nisan. William J. Colinge, Historical Dictionary of Catholicism , p. 99 Sextus Julius Africanus gave 25 March as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus. Joseph F. Kelly, The Origins of Christmas , p. 60 The tractate De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae falsely attributed to John Chrysostom also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March. A passage of the Commentary on the prophet Daniel by Hippolytus of Rome , written in about 204, has also been appealed to.     Among those who have put forward this view are Louis Duchesne, Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution , pp 261–265New York: Pueblo, 1986Oxford University Press 2011 Washington, D.C.: Pastoral Press, 1993St Vladimirs Seminary Press 1997 editorsOxford University Press 2000 Kempen 1995 emphasis addedOxford University Press 2000 2009C.E. 274ProQuest 2008 20092009Sheed & Ward 1961Taylor & Francisthe Great |Helios|Helios|  or Sol InvictusSussex Academic Press 2001  |ehmi|Ehmi| A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolutionit has been speculatedor  |Apollo|Apollo| see also  |Phaëton|Phaethon| |PIE|Pie|  of Pharaoh Son of Radaughter of Radaughter of RaAtenexcept Ra, King of the Gods who gave birth to himself |Saulė|Saulė| Saule |Päivätär|Päivätär| ,  |Beiwe|Beiwe| |Bila|Bila| ,  |Walo|Walo| |Bisal-Mariamna|Bisal-Mariamna| ,  |Bomong|Bomong| ,  |Kn_Sgni|Kn_Sgni| |Wurusemu|Wurusemu| |Sekhmet|Sekhmet| |Chaxiraxi|Chaxiraxi| |Magek|Magek| |Unelanuhi|Unelanuhi| |Wal_Sil|Wal_Sil| |Malina|Malina| |Hekoolas|Hekoolas| |Amaterasu|Amaterasu|.
