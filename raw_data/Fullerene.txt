               A fullerene is an  |allotrope_of_carbon|Allotropes_Of_Carbon|  whose molecule consists of  |carbon|Carbon|  atoms connected by single and double bonds so as to form a closed or partially closed mesh, with fused rings of five to seven atoms. The molecule may be a hollow  |sphere|Sphere| ,  |ellipsoid|Ellipsoid| ,  |tube|Cylinder| , or many other shapes and sizes.  |Graphene|Graphene|  , which is a flat mesh of regular  |hexagon|Hexagon| al rings, can be seen as an extreme member of the family.     Fullerenes with a closed mesh topology are informally denoted by their  |empirical_formula|Empirical_Formula|  C n , often written Cn, where n is the number of carbon atoms. However, for some values of n there maybe more than one  |isomer|Isomer| .     The family is named after  |buckminsterfullerene|Buckminsterfullerene|  , the most famous member, which in turn is named after  |Buckminster_Fuller|Buckminster_Fuller| . The closed fullerenes, especially C 60 , are also informally called buckyballs for their resemblance to the standard  |ball|Ball|  of  |association_football|Association_Football| . Nested closed fullerenes have been named bucky onions. Cylindrical fullerenes are also called  |carbon_nanotubes|Carbon_Nanotubes|  or buckytubes. The bulk solid form of pure or mixed fullerenes is called fullerite.     Fullerenes had been predicted for some time, but only after their accidental synthesis in 1985 were they detected in nature and outer space. The discovery of fullerenes greatly expanded the number of known allotropes of carbon, which had previously been limited to graphite,  |diamond|Diamond| , and  |amorphous|Amorphous_Solid|  carbon such as  |soot|Soot|  and  |charcoal|Charcoal| . They have been the subject of intense research, both for their chemistry and for their technological applications, especially in  |materials_science|Materials_Science| ,  |electronics|Electronics| , and  |nanotechnology|Nanotechnology| .              The icosahedral  cage was mentioned in 1965 as a possible topological structure.  |Eiji_Osawa|Eiji_Osawa|  currently of  |Toyohashi_University_of_Technology|Toyohashi_University_Of_Technology|  predicted the existence of  in 1970. He noticed that the structure of a  |corannulene|Corannulene|  molecule was a subset of the shape of a soccer ball, and hypothesised that a full ball shape could also exist. Japanese scientific journals reported his idea, but neither it nor any translations of it reached Europe or the Americas.     Also in 1970,  |R._W._Henson|R._W._Henson|   proposed the  structure and made a model of it. Unfortunately, the evidence for that new form of carbon was very weak at the time, so the proposal was met with skepticism, and was never published. It was acknowledged only in 1999.     In 1973, independently from Henson, a group of scientists from the USSR made a quantum-chemical analysis of the stability of  and calculated its electronic structure. The paper was published in 1973, but the scientific community did not give much importance to this theoretical prediction.     Around 1980,  |Sumio_Iijima|Sumio_Iijima|  identified the molecule of  from an electron microscope image of  |carbon_black|Carbon_Black| , where it formed the core of a particle with the structure of a bucky onion .      |Harold_Kroto|Harold_Kroto|  of the  |University_of_Sussex|University_Of_Sussex| , working with  |James_R._Heath|James_R._Heath| ,  |Sean_OBrien|Sean_Obrien| ,  |Robert_Curl|Robert_Curl|  and  |Richard_Smalley|Richard_Smalley|  from  |Rice_University|Rice_University| , discovered fullerenes in the sooty residue created by vaporising carbon in a  |helium|Helium|  atmosphere. In the  |mass_spectrum|Mass_Spectrometry|  of the product, discrete peaks appeared corresponding to molecules with the exact mass of sixty or seventy or more carbon atoms, namely  and . The team identified their structure as the now familiar buckyballs .     The name buckminsterfullerene was eventually chosen for  by the discoverers as an homage to  |American|American_People| |architect|Architect| |Buckminster_Fuller|Buckminster_Fuller|  for the vague similarity of the structure to the  |geodesic_domes|Geodesic_Dome|  which he popularized; which, if they were extended to a full sphere, would also have the icosahedral symmetry group. The ene ending was chosen to indicate that the carbons are  |unsaturated|Saturated_Hydrocarbon| , being connected to only three other atoms instead of the normal four. The shortened named fullerene eventually came to be applied to the whole family.     Kroto, Curl, and Smalley were awarded the 1996  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  for their roles in the discovery of this class of molecules.       Kroto and the Rice team already discovered other fullerenes besides C 60 , and the list was much expanded in the following years. Carbon nanotubes  |were_first_discovered_and_synthesized|Carbon_Nanotubesdiscovery|  in 1991.     After their discovery, minute quantities of fullerenes were found to be produced in  |sooty_flames|Soot| , and by  |lightning|Lightning|  discharges in the atmosphere. In 1992, fullerenes were found in a family of minerals known as  |shungites|Shungite|  in  |Karelia|Karelia| , Russia. .     The production techniques were improved by many scientists, including  |Donald_Huffman|Donald_Huffman| ,  |Wolfgang_Krätschmer|Wolfgang_Krätschmer| ,  |Lowell_D._Lamb|Lowell_D._Lamb| , and  |Konstantinos_Fostiropoulos|Konstantinos_Fostiropoulos| . Thanks to their efforts, by 1990 it was relatively easy to produce gram-sized samples of fullerene powder.  |Fullerene_purification|Fullerene_Purification|  remains a challenge to chemists and to a large extent determines fullerene prices.     In 2010, the  |spectral_signatures|Spectrum|  of C 60 and C 70 were observed by NASAs  |Spitzer|Spitzer_Space_Telescope|  infrared telescope in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a star 6500 light years away. Kroto commented: This most exciting breakthrough provides convincing evidence that the buckyball has, as I long suspected, existed since time immemorial in the dark recesses of our galaxy. According to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, It’s possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth. In 2019, ionized C 60 molecules were detected with the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope|  in the space between those stars.         There are two major families of fullerenes, with fairly distinct properties and applications: the closed buckyballs and the open-ended cylindrical carbon nanotubes. However, hybrid structures exist between those two classes, such as  |carbon_nanobuds|Carbon_Nanobuds|  — nanotubes capped by  |hemispherical|Wikt:Hemisphere|  meshes or larger buckybuds .                    Buckminsterfullerene is the smallest fullerene molecule containing pentagonal and hexagonal rings in which no two pentagons share an edge . It is also most common in terms of natural occurrence, as it can often be found in  |soot|Soot| .     The empirical formula of buckminsterfullerene is  and its structure is a  |truncated_icosahedron|Truncated_Icosahedron| , which resembles an  |association_football_ball|Association_Football|  of the type made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at the vertices of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.     The  |van_der_Waals_diameter|Van_Der_Waals_Diameter|  of a buckminsterfullerene molecule is about 1.1  |nanometers|Nanometer|  . The nucleus to nucleus diameter of a buckminsterfullerene molecule is about 0.71  nm.     The buckminsterfullerene molecule has two bond lengths. The 6:6 ring bonds can be considered  |double_bonds|Double_Bond|  and are shorter than the 6:5 bonds . Its average bond length is 1.4 angstroms.       Another fairly common fullerene has empirical formula , but fullerenes with 72, 76, 84 and even up to 100 carbon atoms are commonly obtained.     The smallest possible fullerene is the  |dodecahedral|Dodecahedron|  . There are no fullerenes with 22 vertices. The number of different fullerenes C 2n grows with increasing n    12,  13,  14,  ..., roughly in proportion to n 9 . For instance, there are 1812 non-isomorphic fullerenes . Note that only one form of , buckminsterfullerene, has no pair of adjacent pentagons . To further illustrate the growth, there are 214,127,713 non-isomorphic fullerenes , 15,655,672 of which have no adjacent pentagons. Optimized structures of many fullerene isomers are published and listed on the web.      |Heterofullerenes|Heterofullerene|  have heteroatoms substituting carbons in cage or tube-shaped structures. They were discovered in 1993 and greatly expand the overall fullerene class of compounds. Notable examples include boron, nitrogen , oxygen, and phosphorus derivatives.      |Trimetasphere|Trimetasphere|  carbon nanomaterials were discovered by researchers at  |Virginia_Tech|Virginia_Tech|  and licensed exclusively to  |Luna_Innovations|Luna_Innovations| . This class of novel molecules comprises 80 carbon atoms  forming a sphere which encloses a complex of three metal atoms and one nitrogen atom. These fullerenes encapsulate metals which puts them in the subset referred to as  |metallofullerenes|Metallofullerenes| . Trimetaspheres have the potential for use in diagnostics , therapeutics and in organic solar cells.           |Carbon_nanotubes|Carbon_Nanotubes|  are cylindrical fullerenes. These tubes of carbon are usually only a few nanometres wide, but they can range from less than a micrometer to several millimeters in length. They often have closed ends, but can be open-ended as well. There are also cases in which the tube reduces in diameter before closing off. Their unique molecular structure results in extraordinary macroscopic properties, including high  |tensile_strength|Ultimate_Tensile_Strength| , high  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity| , high  |ductility|Ductility| , high  |heat_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity| , and relative  |chemical_inactivity|Chemically_Inert|  . One proposed use of carbon nanotubes is in  |paper_batteries|Paper_Battery| , developed in 2007 by researchers at  |Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute|Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute| . Another highly speculative proposed use in the field of space technologies is to produce high-tensile carbon cables required by a  |space_elevator|Space_Elevator| .       Buckyballs and carbon nanotubes have been used as building blocks for a great variety of derivatives and larger structures, such as   Nested buckyballs proposed for lubricants;   Nested carbon nanotubes   Linked ball-and-chain dimers   Rings of buckyballs linked together.       After the discovery of C60, many fullerenes have been synthesized  in which some or all the carbon atoms are replaced by other elements.  |Inorganic_nanotubes|Inorganic_Nanotubes| , in particular, have attracted much attention.       Silicon buckyballs have been created around metal ions.     A type of buckyball which uses  |boron|Boron|  atoms, instead of the usual carbon, was predicted and described in 2007. The  structure, with each atom forming 5 or 6 bonds, is predicted to be more stable than the  buckyball. One reason for this given by the researchers is that  is actually more like the original geodesic dome structure popularized by Buckminster Fuller, which uses triangles rather than hexagons. However, this work has been subject to much criticism by quantum chemists as it was concluded that the predicted I h symmetric structure was vibrationally unstable and the resulting cage undergoes a spontaneous symmetry break, yielding a puckered cage with rare T h symmetry . The number of six-member rings in this molecule is 20 and number of five-member rings is 12. There is an additional atom in the center of each six-member ring, bonded to each atom surrounding it. By employing a systematic global search algorithm, later it was found that the previously proposed B80 fullerene is not global minimum for 80 atom boron clusters and hence can not be found in nature. In the same paper by Sandip De et al., it was concluded that borons energy landscape is significantly different from other fullerenes already found in nature hence pure boron fullerenes are unlikely to exist in nature.       Inorganic fullerene-type structures have been built with the di |sulfides|Sulfide|  of  |molybdenum|Molybdenum_Sulfide| , long used as a graphite-like lubricant,  |tungsten|Tungsten_Sulfide| ,  |titanium|Titanium_Sulfide|  and  |niobium|Niobium_Sulfide| . These materials were found to be stable up to at least 350 tons/cm 2 .            Below is a table of main closed carbon fullerenes synthesized and characterized so far, with their  |CAS|Chemical_Abstract_Service|  number when known. Fullerenes with fewer than 60  |carbon|Carbon|  atoms have been called lower fullerenes , and those with more than 70 atoms higher fullerenes .        In the table, Num.Isom. is the number of possible  |isomers|Isomer|  within the isolated pentagon rule , which states that two pentagons in a fullerene should not share edges. Mol.Symm. is the symmetry of the molecule, , whereas Cryst.Symm. is that of the crystalline framework in the solid state. Both are specified for the most experimentally abundant form. The asterisk marks symmetries with more than one chiral form.     When  or  crystals are grown from toluene solution they have a monoclinic symmetry. The crystal structure contains toluene molecules packed between the spheres of the fullerene. However, evaporation of the solvent from  transforms it into a face-centered cubic form. Both monoclinic and  |face-centered_cubic|Face-Centered_Cubic|  phases are known for better-characterized  and fullerenes.            |Schlegel_diagrams|Schlegel_Diagram|  are often used to clarify the 3D structure of closed-shell fullerenes, as 2D projections are often not ideal in this sense.     In mathematical terms, the  |combinatorial_topology|Combinatorial_Topology|  of a closed-shell fullerene with a simple sphere-like mean surface can be represented as a convex  |polyhedron|Polyhedron| ; more precisely, its  |one-dimensional|Dimension|  skeleton, consisting of its vertices and edges. The Schlegel diagram is a projection of that skeleton onto one of the faces of the polyhedron, through a point just outside that face; so that all other vertices project inside that face.
