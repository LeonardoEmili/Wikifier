The first book covers the etymology and definition of love and is written in the manner of an academic lecture. The second book consists of sample dialogues between members of different social classes; it outlines how the romantic process between the classes should work. This second work is largely considered to be a bit not good. Book three is made of stories from actual courts of love presided over by noble women.     ": null
