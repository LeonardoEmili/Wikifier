     The Geography of Pakistan  is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the  |Arabian_Sea|Arabian_Sea|  in the south to the mountains of the  |Karakoram|Karakoram|  range in the north.  |Pakistan|Pakistan|  geologically overlaps both with the  |Indian|Indian_Plate|  and the  |Eurasian|Eurasian_Plate| |tectonic_plates|Plate_Tectonics|  where its  |Sindh|Sindh|  and  |Punjab|Punjab,_Pakistan|  provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while  |Balochistan|Balochistan,_Pakistan|  and most of the  |Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa|  lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the  |Iranian_Plateau|Iranian_Plateau| .  |Gilgit-Baltistan|Gilgit-Baltistan|  and  |Azad_Kashmir|Azad_Kashmir|  lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent  |earthquakes|Earthquake|  where the two tectonic plates collide.     Pakistan is bordered by  |India|India|  to the east,  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  to the northwest and  |Iran|Iran|  to the west while  |China|China|  borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of  |Kashmir|Kashmir|  with India and the  |Durand_Line|Durand_Line|  with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the  |Khyber_Pass|Khyber_Pass|  and  |Bolan_Pass|Bolan_Pass|  that have served as traditional migration routes between Central  |Eurasia|Eurasia|  and  |South_Asia|South_Asia| .     At , Pakistan is the 36th largest country by area, more than twice the size of the US state of  |Montana|Montana| , and slightly larger than the Canadian province of  |Alberta|Alberta| .              Pakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries –  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| ,  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| ,  |India|India| , and  |Iran|Iran|  while  |Tajikistan|Tajikistan|  is separated by thin  |Wakhan_Corridor|Wakhan_Corridor| – adding up to about  in length .     Pakistan borders Afghanistan at the  |Durand_Line|Durand_Line| , , which runs from the  |Hindu_Kush|Hindu_Kush|  and the  |Pamir_Mountains|Pamir_Mountains| . A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the  |Wakhan_Corridor|Wakhan_Corridor|  extends between Pakistan and  |Tajikistan|Tajikistan| . From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  and Pakistan spanning about . It carries on south-eastward and ends near the  |Karakoram_Pass|Karakoram_Pass| . This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of  |Islamabad|Islamabad|  and  |Beijing|Beijing| , formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.      The boundary with  |Iran|Iran| , , was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British Indias  |Baluchistan|Baluchistan|  province. Modern Iran has a province named  |Sistan_va_Baluchistan|Sistan_Va_Baluchistan|  that borders Pakistan and has  |Baluchis|Baloch_People|  in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in  |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi|  according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries havent had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.      The  |Northern_Areas|Northern_Areas|  has five of the worlds seventeen highest  |peaks|Mountain|  along with highest range of mountains the  |Karakoram|Karakoram|  and  |Himalayas|Himalayas| . It also has such extensive  |glaciers|Glacier|  that it has sometimes been called the  |Third_Pole|Siachen_Glacier|  . The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the  |Siachen_Glacier|Siachen_Glacier|  in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.     The Pakistan-India  |ceasefire|Ceasefire| |line|Border|  runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–48. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the  |Shimla_Agreement|Shimla_Agreement|  of July 2, 1972 between  |Indira_Gandhi|Indira_Gandhi|  and  |Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto|Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto| . Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the .     The  |India–Pakistan_border|India–Pakistan_Border|  continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the  |Radcliffe_line|Radcliffe_Line| , named for Sir  |Cyril_Radcliffe|Cyril_Radcliffe,_1St_Viscount_Radcliffe| , the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the  |Punjab|Punjab_Province|  and  |Bengal|Bengal|  provinces of  |British_India|British_India|  on 13 August 1947.     The southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan . The Thar Desert in the province of  |Sindh|Sindh|  is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923–24. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilsons era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunals award, the final stretch of Pakistans border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the  |Arabian_Sea|Arabian_Sea| .       ;Contiguous zone   :   ;Continental shelf   :, or to the edge of the  |continental_margin|Continental_Margin|    ; |Exclusive_economic_zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|    :   ;Territorial sea   :          Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the  |Indus_River|Indus_River|  plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of  |Punjab|Punjab|  and  |Sindh|Sindh| ; and the Balochistan  |Plateau|Plateau| . Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the  |Sutlej_River|Sutlej_River| , the  |Thar_Desert|Thar_Desert|  may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the  |Khyber_Pass|Khyber_Pass|  and another drawn southwest from  |Islamabad|Islamabad|  down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.       The northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the  |Karakoram|Karakoram|  Range, and the  |Himalayas|Himalayas| . This area includes such famous peaks as  |K2|K2|   – Britannica.com . More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate, the northern highlands and the  |Himalayas|Himalayas|  to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.        South of the northern highlands and west of the  |Indus_River|Indus_River|  plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.     Several large passes cut the ranges along the border with  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| . Among them are the  |Khojak_Pass|Khojak_Pass| , about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of  |Peshawar|Peshawar|  and leading to  |Kabul|Kabul| ; and the  |Broghol|Broghol|  Pass in the far north, providing access to the  |Wakhan_Corridor|Wakhan_Corridor| .     Less than one-fifth of Pakistans land area has the potential for intensive  |agricultural|Agriculture|  use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western  |plateaus|Plateau| , but the  |Indus_River|Indus_River|  basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has  |fertile|Fertility|  soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.          The name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word sindhu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern  |Tibet|Tibet|  only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the  |Sutlej_River|Sutlej_River| , which first flows through  |Punjab,_India|Punjab,_India|  and joins the  |Indus|Indus|  in  |Pakistani_Punjab|Pakistani_Punjab| , and the  |Brahmaputra|Brahmaputra| , which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through  |India|India|  and,  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| . The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistans major rivers—the Kabul, Jhelum and, Chenab—flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.             Balochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190  km² or of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as  |Makran|Makran| . The central region is known as  |Kalat|Kalat| .     The  |Sulaiman_Mountains|Sulaiman_Mountains|  dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the  |Quetta|Quetta|  region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the  |Kharan_Desert|Kharan_Desert|  which occupies the most of  |Kharan_District|Kharan_District| .     This area is subject to frequent  |seismic|Seismology|  disturbances because the  |tectonic_plate|Plate_Tectonics|  under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to  |earthquakes|Earthquake| . A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of  |Quetta|Quetta|  was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of  |Quetta|Quetta| ; the most recent major  |earthquake|October_2005_Kashmir_Earthquake|  in which nearly 10,0000 people died and  |earthquake|2008_Balochistan_Earthquake|  Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquakes and Tectonics , 2005. Locating the Kashmir Fault, . uk/newskashmir.html occurred in October 2008 in which 30,000 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the  |Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa| , but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwas Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.                Pakistan lies in the  |temperate|Temperate|  zone, immediately above the  |tropic_of_cancer|Tropic_Of_Cancer| . The climate varies from  |tropical|Tropical|  to temperate.  |Arid|Arid|  conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a  |monsoon|Monsoon|  season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of  |Punjab|Punjab| , and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10  inches a year to over 150  inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the  |Karakoram|Karakoram|  Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.     Pakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.     The climate in the capital city of  |Islamabad|Islamabad|  varies from an average daily low of  in January to an average daily high of  in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about  in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about  per month.  |Hail|Hail| storms are common in early spring.     Pakistans largest city,  |Karachi|Karachi| , which is also the countrys  |industrial|Industry|  center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than  of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of  during winter evenings to an average daily high of  on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.             Hydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build two dams, one tarbela and second Mangla, five barrages, eight link canals, and one gated siphon. For this, India was told to participate 60%, whereas Pakistan, 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity. Solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.     Pakistan largest river is known as the Indus River which flows from Tibet/China and enters through Pakistan by Gilgit Baltistan. The Indus River system is divided into two plains. The Upper Indus Plain starts from northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. The Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. The Indus eastern tributaries are the Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab and meet at Panjnad where they are known as Panjnad river. The Indus western tributaries are the Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob rivers. These rivers join the Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with the River Indus. After this the Indus flows alone through the Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where the Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.          Pakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas|  reserves,  |petroleum|Petroleum|  oil reserves,  |coal|Coal|  fields and large  |hydropower|Hydropower|  potential.          About 26% of Pakistans total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are  |tobacco|Tobacco| ,  |cotton|Cotton| ,  |wheat|Wheat| ,  |rice|Rice| ,  |sugarcane|Sugarcane| ,  |maize|Maize| ,  |sorghum|Sorghum| ,  |millets|Millets| ,  |pulses|Pulse| ,  |oil_seeds|Vegetable_Oil| ,  |barley|Barley| ,  |fruits|Fruit|  and  |vegetables|Vegetable| , which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.

Major crop output line 13           |Fishery|Fishery|  and  |fishing_industry|Fishing_Industry|  plays an important role in the national economy of  |Pakistan|Pakistan| . With a coastline of about 1046  km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.          About only 4% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food,  |lumber|Lumber| ,  |paper|Paper| ,  |fuel_wood|Fuel_Wood| ,  |latex|Latex| ,  |medicine|Medicinal_Plant|  as well as used for purposes of  |wildlife|Wildlife|  conservation and  |Eco_tourism|Eco_Tourism| .          The Salt Range in the  |Potwar_Plateau|Potwar_Plateau|  has large deposits of  |rock_salt|Rock_Salt| . Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of  |gypsum|Gypsum| ,  |limestone|Limestone| ,  |chromites|Chromite| ,  |iron_ore|Iron_Ore| ,  |rock_salt|Halite| ,  |silver|Silver| ,  |gold|Gold| , precious stones,  |gems|Gemstone| ,  |marbles|Marble| ,  |tiles|Tile| ,  |copper|Copper| ,  |sulfur|Sulfur| ,  |fire_clay|Fire_Clay|  and silica sand.          The environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of  |fossil_fuels|Fossil_Fuel| , the Ministry of Environment of  |Government_of_Pakistan|Government_Of_Pakistan|  takes responsibility to conserve and  |protect_the_environment|Environmentalism| .     Current issues |deforestation|Deforestation| ;  |soil_erosion|Soil_Erosion| ;  |desertification|Desertification| .          Pakistan is subject to frequent  |earthquakes|Earthquake|  which are often severe and severe  |flood|Flood| ing along the Indus after heavy rains .  |Landslides|Landslide|  are common in the northern mountains.          There are 15  |national_parks|National_Parks| , 72  |wildlife_sanctuaries|Wildlife_Sanctuary| , 66  |game_reserves|Game_Reserve| , 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected  |wetlands|Ramsar_Convention|  and a number of other protected  |grasslands|Grassland| ,  |shrublands|Shrubland| ,  |woodlands|Woodland|  and  |natural_monuments|Natural_Monument| .       Pakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:            Parts of region and settlement names:      |-abad|-Abad|   means settled place. Example:  |Islamabad|Islamabad| ,  |Faisalabad|Faisalabad| .   -dera  means meeting place. Example:  |Dera_Ismail_Khan|Dera_Ismail_Khan| . |Dera_Ghazi_khan|Dera_Ghazi_Khan|   .
