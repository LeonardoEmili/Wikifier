In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , especially  |functional_analysis|Functional_Analysis| , a Banach algebra, named after  |Stefan_Banach|Stefan_Banach| , is an  |associative_algebra|Associative_Algebra|  A over the  |real|Real_Number|  or  |complex|Complex_Number|  numbers  that at the same time is also a  |Banach_space|Banach_Space| , i.e. a  |normed_space|Normed_Space|  and  |complete|Complete_Metric_Space|  in the  |metric|Metric|  induced by the norm. The norm is required to satisfy     :   x, y   A :     y              y      This ensures that the multiplication operation is  |continuous|Continuous_Function| .     A Banach algebra is called unital if it has an  |identity_element|Identity_Element|  for the multiplication whose norm is 1, and commutative if its multiplication is  |commutative|Commutative| .   Any Banach algebra A  can be embedded isometrically into a unital Banach algebra Ae so as to form a closed ideal of Ae . Often one assumes a priori that the algebra under consideration is unital: for one can develop much of the theory by considering Ae and then applying the outcome in the original algebra. However, this is not the case all the time. For example, one cannot define all the trigonometric functions in a Banach algebra without identity.     The theory of real Banach algebras can be very different from the theory of complex Banach algebras. For example, the  |spectrum|Spectrum|  of an element of a nontrivial complex Banach algebra can never be empty, whereas in a real Banach algebra it could be empty for some elements.     Banach algebras can also be defined over fields of  |p-adic_numbers|P-Adic_Number| . This is part of  |p-adic_analysis|P-Adic_Analysis| .       The prototypical example of a Banach algebra is C0 , the space of continuous functions on a locally compact space that vanish at infinity. C0 is unital if and only if X is compact. The complex conjugation being an involution, C0 is in fact a  |C-algebra|C-Algebra| . More generally, every C-algebra is a Banach algebra.     The set of real numbers is a Banach algebra with norm given by the  |absolute_value|Absolute_Value| .   The set of all real or complex n-by-n  |matrices|Matrix|  becomes a  |unital|Unital_Algebra|  Banach algebra if we equip it with a sub-multiplicative  |matrix_norm|Matrix_Norm| .   Take the Banach space R n  with norm   x x i  .   The  |quaternions|Quaternion|  form a 4-dimensional real Banach algebra, with the norm being given by the absolute value of quaternions.   The algebra of all bounded real- or complex-valued functions defined on some set  is a unital Banach algebra.   The algebra of all bounded  |continuous|Continuous_Function|  real- or complex-valued functions on some  |locally_compact_space|Locally_Compact_Space|  is a Banach algebra.   The algebra of all  |continuous|Continuous_Function| |linear|Linear_Transformation|  operators on a Banach space E  is a unital Banach algebra. The set of all  |compact_operators|Compact_Operator|  on E is a Banach algebra and closed ideal. It is without identity if .    If G is a  |locally_compact|Locally_Compact| |Hausdorff|Hausdorff_Space| |topological_group|Topological_Group|  and μ is its  |Haar_measure|Haar_Measure| , then the Banach space L 1  of all μ-integrable functions on G becomes a Banach algebra under the  |convolution|Convolution|  xy ∫ x y dμ for x, y in L 1 .     |Uniform_algebra|Uniform_Algebra| X .    |Natural_Banach_function_algebra|Uniform_Algebra| X.    |C-algebra|C-Algebra| |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space| .    |Measure_algebra|Measure_Algebra| |Radon_measures|Radon_Measure|  on some  |locally_compact_group|Locally_Compact_Group| , where the product of two measures is given by  |convolution_of_measures|Convolutionmeasures| .        The algebra of the  |quaternions|Quaternion|    is not a complex Banach algebra , for if   A is a complex Banach algebra that is also a  |division_algebra|Division_Algebra| , then   A     , since if       is a point in the non-empty   |spectrum|Spectrum|        of a     A , a -   1 is not invertible, hence a -   1 0 since   A is a division algebra, whence a   1  .       Several  |elementary_functions|List_Of_Functions|  that are defined via  |power_series|Power_Series|  may be defined in any unital Banach algebra; examples include the  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function|  and the  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Functions| , and more generally any  |entire_function|Entire_Function| .  The formula for the  |geometric_series|Geometric_Series|  remains valid in general unital Banach algebras. The  |binomial_theorem|Binomial_Theorem|  also holds for two commuting elements of a Banach algebra.     The set of  |invertible_elements|Invertible_Element|  in any unital Banach algebra is an  |open_set|Open_Set| , and the inversion operation on this set is continuous, so that it forms a  |topological_group|Topological_Group|  under multiplication.      If a Banach algebra has unit 1, then 1 cannot be a  |commutator|Commutator| ; i.e., xy - yx     & thinsp; for any x, y  ∈  A. This is because xy and yx have the same  |spectrum|Spectrum|  except possibly 0.     The various algebras of functions given in the examples above have very different properties from standard examples of algebras such as the reals. For example:     Every real Banach algebra that is a  |division_algebra|Division_Algebra|  is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions. Hence, the only complex Banach algebra that is a division algebra is the complexes.    Every unital real Banach algebra with no  |zero_divisors|Zero_Divisor| , and in which every  |principal_ideal|Principal_Ideal|  is  |closed|Closed_Set| , is isomorphic to the reals, the complexes, or the quaternions.   Every commutative real unital  |Noetherian|Noetherian_Ring|  Banach algebra with no zero divisors is isomorphic to the real or complex numbers.   Every commutative real unital Noetherian Banach algebra is finite-dimensional.   Permanently singular elements in Banach algebras are  |topological_divisors_of_zero|Topological_Divisor_Of_Zero| , i.e., considering extensions B of Banach algebras A some elements that are singular in the given algebra A have a multiplicative inverse element in a Banach algebra extension B. Topological divisors of zero in A are permanently singular in any Banach extension B of  A.            Unital Banach algebras over the complex field provide a general setting to develop spectral theory. The spectrum of an element x  ∈  A, denoted by   , consists of all those complex  |scalars|Scalar|  λ such that x   & minus;  λ1 is not invertible in A. The spectrum of any element x is a closed subset of the closed disc in C with radius   x  |compact|Compact_Space| . Moreover, the spectrum   of an element x is  |non-empty|Non-Empty|  and satisfies the  |spectral_radius|Spectral_Radius|  formula:     :             Given x   & isin;  A, the  |holomorphic_functional_calculus|Holomorphic_Functional_Calculus|  allows to define ƒ  ∈ A for any function ƒ  |holomorphic|Holomorphic_Function|  in a neighborhood of   Furthermore, the spectral mapping theorem holds:     :   f.      When the Banach algebra A is the algebra L of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space X & thinsp; , the notion of the spectrum in A coincides with the usual one in  |operator_theory|Operator_Theory| . For ƒ   & isin; C , one sees that:     :         The norm of a normal element x of a C-algebra coincides with its spectral radius. This generalizes an analogous fact for normal operators.     Let A & thinsp; be a complex unital Banach algebra in which every non-zero element x is invertible . For every a   & isin; A, there is λ   & isin; C such that   a   & minus;  λ1 is not invertible  hence a    λ1  : this algebra A is naturally isomorphic to C .       Let A & thinsp; be a unital commutative Banach algebra over C. Since A is then a commutative ring with unit, every non-invertible element of A belongs to some  |maximal_ideal|Maximal_Ideal|  of A. Since a maximal ideal   m in A is closed, A /   m is a Banach algebra that is a field, and it follows from the Gelfand–Mazur theorem that there is a bijection between the set of all maximal ideals of A and the set Δ of all nonzero homomorphisms from A & thinsp; to C. The set Δ is called the  |structure_space|Structure_Space|  or character space of A, and its members characters.     A character χ is a linear functional on A that is at the same time multiplicative, χ χ χ, and satisfies χ 1. Every character is automatically continuous from A & thinsp; to C, since the kernel of a character is a maximal ideal, which is closed. Moreover, the norm  of a character is one. Equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence on A , the character space, Δ, is a Hausdorff compact space.     For any x ∈ A,     :         where   x is the  |Gelfand_representation|Gelfand_Representation|  of x defined as follows:   x is the continuous function from Δ to C given by   x   & thinsp; The spectrum of   x, in the formula above, is the spectrum as element of the algebra C of complex continuous functions on the compact space Δ. Explicitly,     :     .     As an algebra, a unital commutative Banach algebra is  |semisimple|Semisimple_Algebra|   if and only if its Gelfand representation has trivial kernel. An important example of such an algebra is a commutative C-algebra. In fact, when A is a commutative unital C-algebra, the Gelfand representation is then an isometric -isomorphism between A and C . Proof: Since every element of a commutative C-algebra is normal, the Gelfand representation is isometric; in particular, it is injective and its image is closed. But the image of the Gelfand representation is dense by the  |Stone–Weierstrass_theorem|Stone–Weierstrass_Theorem| .
