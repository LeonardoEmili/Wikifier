           Electricity generation is the process of generating  |electric_power|Electric_Power|  from sources of  |primary_energy|Primary_Energy| . For  |utilities|Electric_Utility|  in the  |electric_power_industry|Electric_Power_Industry| , it is the stage prior to its  |delivery|Delivery_Of_Electricity|  to end users  or its  |storage|Energy_Storage|  .     A characteristic of electricity is that it is not freely available in nature in large amounts, so it must be produced. Production is carried out in  |power_stations|Power_Station|  . Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by  |electromechanical|Electromechanical| |generators|Electric_Generator| , primarily driven by  |heat_engines|Heat_Engine|  fueled by  |combustion|Combustion|  or  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  but also by other means such as the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar  |photovoltaics|Photovoltaics|  and  |geothermal_power|Geothermal_Power| .            The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday| . His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or  |disc_of_copper|Faraday_Disc|  between the poles of a  |magnet|Magnet| . Central power stations became economically practical with the development of  |alternating_current|Alternating_Current|  power transmission, using power  |transformers|Transformer|  to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.     In 1870, commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. In 1870, the mechanical production of electric power began the  |Second_Industrial_Revolution|Second_Industrial_Revolution|  and created inventions using the energy, whose major contributors were  |Thomas_Alva_Edison|Thomas_Alva_Edison|  and  |Nikola_Tesla|Nikola_Tesla| . Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the  |telegraph|Telegraph| .     Electricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a  |steam_engine|Steam_Engine|  driving a dynamo at  |Pearl_Street_Station|Pearl_Street_Station|  produced a  |DC_current|Dc_Current|  that powered public lighting on  |Pearl_Street|Pearl_Street| ,  |New_York|New_York_City| . The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adapted their gas-fueled street lights to electric power, and soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains.     The first power plants used water power or coal;  and today a variety of energy sources are used, such as  |coal|Coal| ,  |nuclear|Nuclear_Power| ,  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas| ,  |hydroelectric|Hydroelectricity| ,  |wind|Wind_Power| , and  |oil|Petroleum| , as well as  |solar_energy|Solar_Energy| ,  |tidal_power|Tidal_Power| , and  |geothermal|Geothermal_Power|  sources. The use of power-lines and power-poles has been significantly important in the distribution of electricity.                    Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. The  |triboelectric_effect|Triboelectric_Effect| ,  |piezoelectric_effect|Piezoelectric_Effect| , and even direct capture of the energy of nuclear decay  |Betavoltaics|Betavoltaics|  are used in niche applications, as is a direct conversion of heat to electric power in the  |thermoelectric_effect|Thermoelectric_Effect| . Utility-scale generation is done by rotating electric generators, or by photovoltaic systems. A very small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries.        |Electric_generators|Electric_Generator|  transform  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on  |Faradays_law|Faradays_Law_Of_Induction| . It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of conducting material . Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which  |mechanical_energy|Mechanical_Energy|  forces a generator to rotate:             |Electrochemistry|Electrochemistry|  is the direct transformation of  |chemical_energy|Chemical_Energy|  into electricity, as in a  |battery|Battery| . Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries.  , U.S. Department of Energy.  13,670 nickel-cadmium battery cells to generate up to 40 megawatts of power for about 7 minutes, or 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes.   |Primary_cells|Primary_Cell| , such as the common  |zinc–carbon_batteries|Zinc–Carbon_Battery| , act as power sources directly, but  |secondary_cells|Secondary_Cell|  are used for  |storage|Electricity_Storage|  systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as  |fuel_cells|Fuel_Cell| , can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels.  |Osmotic_power|Osmotic_Power|  is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merge.       The  |photovoltaic_effect|Photovoltaic_Effect|  is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in  |solar_cells|Solar_Cell| .  |Photovoltaic_panels|Photovoltaics|  convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant,  |solar_power|Solar_Power|  electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems.   , U.S. Department of Energy. Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, United States, China, and India.               The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in  |widespread_residential_selling_prices|Electricity_Pricingglobal_Comparison|  , e.g. the price in Iceland is 5.54 cents per kWh while in some island nations it is 40 cents per kWh.  |Hydroelectric_plants|Hydroelectric_Plant| ,  |nuclear_power_plants|Nuclear_Power_Plant| ,  |thermal_power_plants|Thermal_Power_Plant|  and  |renewable_sources|Renewable_Source|  have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load, often supplied by plants which run continuously. Nuclear, coal, oil, gas and some hydro plants can supply base load. If well construction costs for natural gas are below $10 per MWh, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.       |Thermal_energy|Thermal_Energy|  may be economical in areas of high industrial density, as the high demand cannot be met by local renewable sources. The effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas. These plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units.   Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However,  |disasters_in_Japan|Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Disaster|  have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high.   Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It may not be an economically viable single source of production where the ability to store the flow of water is limited and the load varies too much during the annual production cycle.     Due to advancements in technology, and with mass production, renewable sources other than hydroelectricity experienced decreases in cost of production, and the energy is now in many cases cost-comparative with fossil fuels. Many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production, and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible. However, their use is frequently limited by their  |intermittent_nature|Intermittent_Energy_Source| ; sometimes less than demand, sometimes more than transmission constraints allow, in which case their production may be curtailed.              Electric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of the  |magnetic_induction|Electromagnetic_Induction|  of electric current in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity.  The only commercial scale electricity production that does not employ a generator is solar PV.       Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a  |turbine|Turbine| , driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including  |heat_engines|Heat_Engine| , hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by  |heat_engines|Heat_Engine| . The combustion of  |fossil_fuels|Fossil_Fuel|  supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  and some from  |renewable_sources|Renewable_Source| . The modern  |steam_turbine|Steam_Turbine|   currently generates about 80% of the  |electric_power|Electric_Power|  in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include:   Steam   |coal|Coal|  burned in a  |thermal_power_plant|Fossil-Fuel_Power_Station| , about 41% of all electricity is generated this way.     |Nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  heat created in a  |nuclear_reactor|Nuclear_Reactor|  creates steam. Less than 15% of electricity is generated this way.   Renewables. The steam is generated by  |Biomass|Biomass| ,  |Solar_thermal_energy|Solar_Thermal_Energy|  where  |solar_parabolic_troughs|Solar_Parabolic_Trough|  and  |solar_power_towers|Solar_Power_Tower|  concentrate sunlight to heat a heat transfer fluid, which is then used to produce steam, or  |Geothermal_power|Geothermal_Power| .   Natural gas: turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion.  |Combined_cycle|Combined_Cycle|  are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a  |gas_turbine|Gas_Turbine|  and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20% of the worlds electricity is generated by natural gas.   Water Energy is captured by a  |water_turbine|Water_Turbine|  from the movement of water - from falling water, the rise and fall of tides or  |ocean_thermal_currents|Ocean_Thermal_Energy_Conversion| . Currently, hydroelectric plants provide approximately 16% of the worlds electricity.   The  |windmill|Windmill|  was a very early  |wind_turbine|Wind_Turbine| . In a  |solar_updraft_tower|Solar_Updraft_Tower|  wind is artificially produced. Before 2010 less than 2% of the worlds electricity was produced from wind.   Although turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by  |gasoline|Gasoline|  or  |diesel_engines|Diesel_Engine| . These may used for backup generation or as a prime source of power within isolated villages.            Total worldwide gross production of electricity in 2016 was 25,082TWh. Sources of electricity were coal and peat 38.3%, natural gas 23.1%, hydroelectric 16.6%, nuclear power 10.4%, oil 3.7%, solar/wind/geothermal/tidal/other 5.6%, biomass and waste 2.3%. International Energy Agency,  , Retrieved 8 December 2018.        :       Total energy consumed at all power plants for the generation of electricity was 4,398,768 ktoe  which was 36% of the total for primary energy sources of 2008.   Electricity output was 1,735,579 ktoe , efficiency was 39%, and the balance of 61% was generated heat. A small part of the heat was utilized at co-generation heat and power plants. The in-house consumption of electricity and power transmission losses were 289,681 ktoe.   The amount supplied to the final consumer was 1,445,285 ktoe which was 33% of the total energy consumed at power plants and heat and power  |co-generation|Co-Generation|  plants. International Energy Agency,  , 2011.       Note that the vertical axes of these two charts are not to the same scale.                       The United States has long been the largest producer and consumer of electricity, with a global share in 2005 of at least 25%, followed by  |China|Electric_Power_Industry_In_China| , Japan, Russia, and India. As of Jan-2010, total electricity generation for the two largest generators was as follows: USA: 3,992 billion kWh ; China: 3,715 billion kWh .       Data source of values is IEA/OECD. IEA  retrieved 2011-5-8   Listed countries are top 20 by population or top 20 by GDP and Saudi Arabia based on CIA World Factbook 2009. CIA  retrieved 2011-5-8      Solar PV is  |Photovoltaics|Photovoltaics|    Bio other 198TWh + 69TWh + 4TWh             Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70% and China is at 80%. The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Most scientists agree that emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions; in the United States, electricity generation accounts for nearly 40% of emissions, the largest of any source. Transportation emissions are close behind, contributing about one-third of U.S. production of  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| .    In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65% of all emissions of  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide| , the main component of acid rain.  Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of  |NOx|Nox| ,  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide| , and  |particulate_matter|Atmospheric_Particulate_Matter|  in the US.    In July 2011, the UK parliament tabled a motion that levels of emissions from nuclear power were approximately three times lower per  |kilowatt_hour|Kilowatt_Hour|  than those of solar, four times lower than clean coal and 36 times lower than conventional coal .
