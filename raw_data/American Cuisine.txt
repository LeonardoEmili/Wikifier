                       American cuisine reflects the  |history_of_the_United_States|History_Of_The_United_States| , blending the culinary contributions of various groups of people from around the world, including  |indigenous_American_Indians|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States| ,  |African_Americans|African_American| ,  |Asians|Asian_People| ,  |Europeans|Ethnic_Groups_In_Europe| ,  |Pacific_Islanders|Pacific_Islander| , and  |Latin_Americans|Latin_Americans| . Though much of American cuisine is  |fusion_cuisine|Fusion_Cuisine|  reflecting  |global_cuisine|Global_Cuisine| , many  |regional_cuisines|Regional_Cuisines|  have deeply rooted  |ethnic|Ethnic_Cuisine|  heritages, including  |Cajun|Cajun_Cuisine| ,  |Louisiana_Creole|Louisiana_Creole_Cuisine| ,  |Native_American|Native_American_Cuisine| ,  |New_Mexican|New_Mexican_Cuisine| ,  |Pennsylvania_Dutch|Cuisine_Of_The_Pennsylvania_Dutch| ,  |Soul_food|Soul_Food| , and  |Tlingit|Tlingit_Cuisine| . Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of what is now American cuisine. The  |European_settlement_of_the_Americas|European_Colonization_Of_The_Americas|  introduced a number of ingredients, spices, herbs, and cooking styles to the continent. The various styles of cuisine continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of  |immigrants|Immigrants|  from many different nations; this influx nurtured a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.     When the  |colonists|American_Colonist|  came to  |the_colonies|Thirteen_Colonies| , they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion to what they had done in Europe. They had cuisine similar to their previous  |Dutch|Dutch_Cuisine| ,  |Swedish|Swedish_Cuisine| ,  |French|French_Cuisine|  and  |British_cuisines|British_Cuisine| . The American colonial diet varied depending on the region settled. Commonly hunted  |game|Game|  included deer, bear,  |bison|American_Bison| , and  |wild_turkey|Wild_Turkey| . A number of  |fats|Animal_Fat|  and  |oils|Cooking_Oil|  made from animals served to cook much of the colonial foods. Prior to  |the_Revolution|American_Revolution| , New Englanders consumed large quantities of  |rum|Rum|  and  |beer|Beer| , as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items: rum was the  |distilled_spirit|Liquor|  of choice, as the main ingredient,  |molasses|Molasses| , was readily available from trade with the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| . In comparison to the northern colonies, the southern colonies were quite diverse in their agricultural diet; the growing season was longer.     During the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans developed many new foods. During the  |Progressive_Era|Progressive_Era|  of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, circa 1890s–1920s, food production and presentation became more  |industrialized|Industrialized_Food| .     One characteristic of American cooking is the  |fusion_of_multiple_ethnic_or_regional_approaches|Fusion_Cuisine|  into completely new cooking styles. A wave of  |celebrity_chefs|Celebrity_Chef|  began with  |Julia_Child|Julia_Child|  and  |Graham_Kerr|Graham_Kerr|  in the 1970s, with many more following after the rise of  |cable_channels|Cable_Channel|  such as the  |Food_Network|Food_Network|  and  |Cooking_Channel|Cooking_Channel|  in the late 20th century.                     Seafood in the United States originated with the American Indians in the United States, who often ate  |cod|Cod| ,  |lemon_sole|Lemon_Sole| ,  |flounder|Flounder| ,  |herring|Herring| ,  |halibut|Halibut| ,  |sturgeon|Sturgeon| ,  |smelt|Smelt| ,  |drum|Drum|  on the East Coast, and  |olachen|Oily_Fish|  and  |salmon|Salmon|  on the West Coast. Whale was hunted by American Indians off the Northwest coast, especially by the  |Makah|Makah_People| , and used for their meat and oil.  Seal and walrus were also eaten, in addition to eel from New Yorks  |Finger_Lakes|Finger_Lakes|  region.  |Catfish|Catfish|  was also popular among native people, including the  |Modocs|Modoc_People| . Crustaceans included  |shrimp|Shrimp| ,  |lobster|Lobster| ,  |crayfish|Crayfish| , and  |dungeness_crabs|Dungeness_Crab|  in the Northwest and  |blue_crabs|Callinectes_Sapidus|  in the East. Other shellfish include  |abalone|Abalone|  and  |geoduck|Geoduck|  on the West Coast, while on the East Coast the  |surf_clam|Atlantic_Surf_Clam| ,  |quahog|Quahog| , and the  |soft_shell_clam|Soft_Shell_Clam| .  |Oysters|Oyster|  were eaten on both shores, as were  |mussels|Mussel|  and  |periwinkles|Common_Periwinkle| .        Early American Indians used a number of cooking methods in early American Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American Cuisine.  |Grilling|Grilling|  meats was common.  |Spit_roast|Spit_Roast| ing over a pit fire was common as well. Vegetables, especially  |root_vegetables|Root_Vegetable|  were often cooked directly in the ashes of the fire. As early Native Americans lacked pottery that could be used directly over a fire, they developed a technique which has caused many  |anthropologists|Anthropologist|  to call them  |Stone_Boilers|Stone_Boilers|  . They would heat rocks directly in a fire and then add the rocks to a pot filled with water until it came to a boil so that it would cook the meat or vegetables in the boiling water. In what is now the Southwestern United States, they also created  |adobe|Adobe|  ovens, dubbed  horno s by the  |Spanish|Conquistadors| , to bake products such as  |cornmeal|Cornmeal|  bread. Other parts of America dug pit ovens; these pits were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers and then seaweed or corn husks placed on top to steam fish and shellfish as well as vegetables; potatoes would be added while still in skin and corn while in-husk, this would later be referred to as a  |clambake|New_England_Clam_Bake|  by the colonists.                When the colonists came to  |Virginia|History_Of_Virginia| ,  |Pennsylvania|History_Of_Pennsylvania| ,  |Massachusetts|History_Of_Massachusetts| , or any of the other English colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America, their initial attempts at survival included planting crops familiar to them from back home in England. In the same way, they farmed animals for clothing and meat in a similar fashion. Through hardships and eventual establishment of trade with Britain, the  |West_Indies|West_Indies|  and other regions, the colonists were able to establish themselves in the American colonies with a cuisine similar to their previous  |British_cuisine|British_Cuisine| . There were some exceptions to the diet, such as local vegetation and animals, but the colonists attempted to use these items in the same fashion as they had their equivalents or ignore them entirely if they could. The manner of cooking for the American colonists followed along the line of British cookery up until the Revolution. The British sentiment followed in the cookbooks brought to the New World as well. .     In 1796, the first American cookbook was published, and others followed.  There was a general disdain for  |French_cookery|French_Cuisine| , even with the French  |Huguenots|Huguenot|  in  |South_Carolina|South_Carolina|  and French-Canadians. One of the cookbooks that proliferated in the colonies was  The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy  by  |Hannah_Glasse|Hannah_Glasse| , who referred to the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook! Of the French recipes given in the text, she speaks out flagrantly against the dishes as she … think it an odd jumble of trash. . Reinforcing the anti-French sentiment was the  |French_and_Indian_War|French_And_Indian_War|  from 1754 to 1764. This created a large anxiety against the French, which influenced the English to force many of the French to move, as in the  |expulsion_of_the_Acadians|Expulsion_Of_The_Acadians|  from Nova Scotia to Louisiana. The Acadians left a French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana, and among the Acadian Francophones who settled eastern Maine and parts of what is now northern Vermont at the same time they colonized New Brunswick. .     Some of the Jews who fled from the Inquisition with other  |Sephardic_Jews|Sephardic_Jews|  in the 15th century had previously settled in  |Recife_Brazil|Recife_Brazil|  and the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| , where their cuisine was influenced by new local ingredients like  |molasses|Molasses| ,  |rum|Rum| ,  |sugar|Sugar| ,  |vanilla|Vanilla| ,  |chocolate|Chocolate| ,  |peppers|Capsicum| ,  |corn|Maize| ,  |tomato|Tomato| es,  |kidney_beans|Kidney_Beans| ,  |string_beans|String_Beans|  and  |turkey|Turkey| . In 1654, twenty three Sephardic Jews arrived in New Amsterdam and they brought this cuisine with them to the early colonial United States. Early American Jewish cuisine was heavily influenced by this branch of Sephardic cuisine. Many of the recipes were bound up in observance of traditional holidays and remained true to their origins. These included dishes such as stew and fish fried in  |olive_oil|Olive_Oil| , beef and bean stews,  |almond_puddings|Almond_Pudding| , and  |egg_custards|Egg_Custard| . The first  |kosher|Kosher_Food|  cookbook in America was the Jewish Cookery Book by  |Esther_Levy|Esther_Levy|  which was published in 1871 in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  and includes many of the traditional recipes.           The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which someone lived. Local cuisine patterns had established by the mid-18th century. The  |New_England|New_England|  colonies were extremely similar in their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from England. A striking difference for the colonists in New England compared to other regions was seasonality. . While in the southern colonies, they could farm almost year-round, in the northern colonies, the growing seasons were very restricted. In addition, colonists close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their diet, especially in the northern colonies.      |Wheat|Wheat| , however, the grain used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow, and imports of wheat were far from cost productive. .  Substitutes in cases such as this included cornmeal. The  |Johnnycake|Johnnycake|  was a poor substitute to some for wheaten bread, but acceptance by both the northern and southern colonies seems evident. .     As many of the New Englanders were originally from England, game hunting was useful when they immigrated to the  |New_World|New_World| . Many of the northern colonists depended upon their ability to hunt, or upon others from whom they could purchase game. Hunting was the preferred method of protein consumption. This was opposed to animal husbandry, which required much more work to defend the kept animals against raids.      |buffalo|American_Bison| , and wild turkey. The larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant sauce, while the other smaller portions went into  |soups|Soup| ,  |stews|Stew| ,  |sausages|Sausage| ,  |pies|Pie| , and pastries. . In addition to game, colonists protein intake was supplemented by  |mutton|Mutton| . The  |Spanish|Spanish_People|  in  |Florida|Florida|  originally introduced  |sheep|Sheep|  to the New World, but this development never quite reached the North, and there they were introduced by the  |Dutch|Dutch_People|  and English. The keeping of sheep was a result of the English non-practice of  |animal_husbandry|Animal_Husbandry| . . The animals provided wool when young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer desirable.  The forage-based diet for sheep that prevailed in the Colonies produced a characteristically strong, gamy flavor and a tougher consistency, which required aging and slow cooking to tenderize.         A number of  |fats|Fat|  and  |oils|Oil|  made from animals served to cook much of the colonial foods. Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear oil for cooking, while solidified bear fat resembled  |shortening|Shortening| . Rendered  |pork|Pork|  fat made the most popular cooking medium, especially from the cooking of  |bacon|Bacon| . Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the South. The colonists enjoyed  |butter|Butter|  in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| , as  |cattle|Cattle|  were not yet plentiful. .      |Revolution|American_Revolution| , New Englanders consumed large quantities of  |rum|Rum|  and  |beer|Beer| , as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice, as the main ingredient,  |molasses|Molasses| , was readily available from trade with the West Indies. Further into the interior, however, one would often find colonists consuming  |whiskey|Whiskey| , as they did not have similar access to  |sugar_cane|Sugar_Cane| . They did have ready access to corn and rye, which they used to produce their whiskey. . However, until the Revolution, many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for human consumption, as many believed that it caused the poor to become raucous and unkempt drunkards. . In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, imports were seen on merchant shelves, including  |wine|Wine|  and  |brandy|Brandy| . .      |Southern_Colonies|Southern_Colonies|  were quite diverse in their agricultural diet. The uplands of the  |Piedmont|Piedmont|  and the  |coastal_lowlands|Atlantic_Coastal_Plain|  made up the two main parts of the southern colonies. The diet of the uplands often included wild game,  |cabbage|Cabbage| ,  |string_beans|Green_Bean| ,  |corn|Maize| ,  |squashes|Cucurbita|  and white  |potato|Potato| es. People had biscuits as part of their  |breakfast|Breakfast| , along with healthy portions of pork. . The lowlands of Louisiana included a varied diet heavily influenced by the French, Spanish, Acadians, Germans, Native Americans, Africans and Caribbeans. Rice played a large part of the diet in Louisiana. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal seafood. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does to this day. . .       During the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans developed many new foods. Some, such as  |Rocky_Mountain_oysters|Rocky_Mountain_Oyster| , stayed regional; some spread throughout the nation but with little international appeal, such as  |peanut_butter|Peanut_Butter|  ; and some spread throughout the world, such as  |popcorn|Popcorn| ,  |cola|Cola| ,  |fried_chicken|Fried_Chicken| ,  |cornbread|Cornbread| , unleavened  |muffins|Muffin|  such as the  |poppyseed_muffin|Poppyseed_Muffin| , and  |brownies|Chocolate_Brownie| .       During the 1920s,  |American_farms|Agriculture_In_The_United_States|  were mostly self-sufficient; but, certain staples like  |salt|Salt| ,  |coffee|Coffee| ,  |sugar|Sugar|  and  |baking_soda|Baking_Soda|  would be purchased at the town general store. If the family didnt grow  |wheat|Wheat| , then  |flour|Flour|  would also be purchased. Another luxury was canned  |salmon|Salmon| , which was sometimes eaten for Sunday dinner. Items purchased at the general store would be paid for with eggs,  |butter|Butter|  or some other food from the farm. Women were responsible for much of the processing of food like straining fresh milk, churning butter, making  |molasses|Molasses|  from  |sorghum|Sorghum| , grinding  |corn|Maize|  into cornmeal or cleaning whole  |chickens|Chicken| .     Fresh picked  |apples|Apple|  were pressed into  |cider|Cider| , which could be  |ferment|Ferment| ed to make  |apple_cider_vinegar|Apple_Cider_Vinegar| .  |Fruits|Fruit|  and  |vegetables|Vegetable|  were  |preserved|Food_Preservation|  by various means like canning, drying or  |pickling|Pickling| . One contemporary writer from  |Michigan|Michigan|  described October as cider season, when  |apple_butter|Apple_Butter|  would be made. Her writings mention  |johnnycakes|Johnnycake| ; and, as winter fare,  |buckwheat|Buckwheat|  cakes.      Typical farmhouse fare included fried chicken, simmered  |green_beans|Green_Beans| , boiled corn,  |chicken_and_dumplings|Chicken_And_Dumplings| , fried  |ham|Ham| , boiled  |beans|Beans|  and  |beets|Beets| ,  |stewed_tomatoes|Stewed_Tomatoes| , potatoes, and  |coleslaw|Coleslaw|  made of shredded  |cabbage|Cabbage| . Pon haus, similar to the  |scrapple|Scrapple|  of the  |Pennsylvania_Dutch|Pennsylvania_Dutch| , was a typical breakfast dish among the Germans who had settled  |Indiana|Indiana|  in the 19th century. Pork scraps and  |corn_meal|Corn_Meal|  were cooked into a thick  |porridge|Porridge|  and molded in loaf pans. Once solidified, the mixture would be cut and fried. During the fall months pork might be replaced with fried apples or potatoes. It was served with buttered  |biscuits|Biscuits| , jam, jelly, milk gravy or sorghum syrup. Fruit butter might be made from apples. plums or peaches to accompany the meal.           |Pork|Pork|  was a staple of the rural diet through the Southern and Midwestern United States.  |Lard|Lard|  was used for baking, frying and even as a seasoning. The cookware of the period was made of  |cast_iron|Cast_Iron|  and these were thoroughly seasoned with pork fat. Fried salt pork with gravy was an indulgent fat-laden dish often served with a side of boiled potatoes. In the  |Appalachian_region|Appalachian_Region|  a dish called killed lettuce was made with  |pokeweed|Pokeweed| ,  |dandelion|Dandelion|  and assorted wild greens that were drizzled with hot bacon grease until wilted or killed .      |Pie|Pie|  could be served up to three times a day and many varieties were prepared depending on the season. During the spring months, pies would be made of  |rhubarb|Rhubarb|  and  |strawberry|Strawberry| ; in summer  |peach|Peach| ,  |cherry|Cherry| ,  |blackberry|Blackberry| ,  |blueberry|Blueberry| ,  |elderberry|Elderberry|  and  |grape|Grape| ; and in fall  |apple|Apple| .     The staples of the urban diet were bread,  |dairy|Dairy|  and canned goods. Dinner might be tomato bisque from a can topped with  |cream|Cream|  or a salad made of canned string beans and  |mayonnaise|Mayonnaise| . Many preferred to purchase food at  |delicatessens|Delicatessen| , rather than attempt to prepare meals in the cramped kitchenettes. German delicatessens in cities like New York and  |Milwaukee|Milwaukee|  sold imported cold cuts,  |potato_salads|Potato_Salad| ,  schmierkase ,  wienerwurst , North Sea  |herring|Herring| , assorted pickles and other prepared foods.  |Jewish_immigrants|History_Of_The_Jews_In_The_United_States|  from Germany soon followed suit, replacing pork dishes with  |corned_beef|Corned_Beef|  and  |pastrami|Pastrami| .  |Ice_cream_soda|Ice_Cream_Soda|  was served at soda fountains, along with various other early soda water recipes like the Garden Sass Sundae or the Oh-Oh-Cindy Sundae .       In the 20th century highly  |industrialized|Industrialized_Food| |processed_foods|Processed_Food|  became a dominant feature of American diets. Fusion of the food traditions of various  |immigrant_groups|Immigration_To_The_United_States|  to the US contributed to development of distinct ethnic-American dishes. Dainty fare became the norm at fashionable luncheons and teas in areas like  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  including dishes like grapefruit with cherries, fruit served in cantaloupe, strawberry tarts or egg  |soufflé|Soufflé| , other types of tea sandwiches, small decorated cakes or gelatin based desserts. This style of dainty fare was highly decorated and ladylike and it was intended to be consumed only by women. The decorative and ornate foods were a symbol of distinction between men and women, as the former were associated with less refined foods. Sherrie A. Inness, Dinner Roles: American Women and Culinary Culture, p. 69 Tea parties were fashionable for well-to-do women and dainty fare remained a symbol of upper middle class luxury. Dozens of articles published in womens magazines promoted the dainty quality of tea parties. From one 1911 issue of Good Housekeeping |Progressive_Era|Progressive_Era|  food production and presentation became more industrialized.     From 1888 thru 1908 the machine double-crimped, compound-sealed, open-top, so-called sanitary can was perfected . Also during that time, the can manufacturing industry consolidated.  These improvements in  |canning|Canning|  made fruits and vegetables increasingly available to chefs outside of the regular harvest season.     During that same time frame, grain-feeding of cattle during low pasture months made milk increasingly available year-round. The invention of  |milking_machines|Automatic_Milking|  lowered production costs.  |Pasteurization|Pasteurization| ,  |homogenization|Homogenization| ,  |evaporation|Evaporated_Milk| ,  |condensation|Condensed_Milk| , and  |refrigeration|Refrigeration|  along with glass milk bottles, wax paper cartons, and then plastic bottles made milk increasingly available and safe for urban consumers.  Milk became a staple food item and an increasingly important ingredient in American cuisine. Examples include the  |Root_beer_float|Root_Beer_Float|  and the  |Milkshake|Milkshake| .     Major railroads featured upscale cuisine in their dining cars. James D. Porterfield, Dining by Rail: The History and Recipes of Americas Golden Age of Railroad Cuisine Restaurant chains emerged with standardized decor and menus, including the  |Fred_Harvey|Fred_Harvey_Company|  restaurants along the route of the Sante Fe Railroad in the Southwest. Stephen Fried, Appetite for America: How Visionary Businessman Fred Harvey Built a Railroad Hospitality Empire That Civilized the Wild West  |Fast_food|Fast_Food|  restaurants with standardized product and franchised service models began to appear and spread with the development of the  |highway_system|Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_Of_1921| .  |White_Castle|White_Castle|  was one of the first examples. Franchising was introduced in 1921 by  |A_W_Root_Beer|A_W_Root_Beer| . The  |McDonalds|Mcdonalds|  brothers created their Speedee Service System in 1948.     At the universities, nutritionists and home economists taught a new scientific approach to food. In the early 1900s  |muckraking|Muckraker|  journalists raised public concern about the wholesomeness of industrialized food products that contained various preservatives and adulterants of unknown safety. From 1902 to 1912  |Harvey_Washington_Wiley|Harvey_Washington_Wiley| , a chemist at the  |U_S_Department_of_Agriculture|U_S_Department_Of_Agriculture| , supervised hygienic table trials to test the safety of food additives and preservatives. His work contributed to the enactment of the  |Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act|Pure_Food_And_Drug_Act|  of 1906. He became the first commissioner of the  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  and later led the  |laboratories_of_Good_Housekeeping_Magazine|Good_Housekeeping_Seal| .     During World War I the  |Progressives|Progressives|  moral advice about food conservation was emphasized in large-scale state and federal programs designed to educate housewives. Large-scale foreign aid during and after the war brought American standards to Europe. Helen Zoe Veit, Modern Food, Moral Food: Self-Control, Science, and the Rise of Modern American Eating in the Early Twentieth Century     From 1912 thru the end of the 1930s researchers discovered & popularized the essential role of various  |vitamins_and_minerals|Vitamin|  in human health. Starting with iodized salt in 1924, commercially distributed food began to be  |fortified|Food_Fortification|  with vitamins and minerals. In 1932, milk began to be fortified with  |viosterol|Ergosterol| , a purified vitamin D2 product. Synthetic  |thiamin_|Thiamine|  first became available after 1936 and bakers began voluntarily enriching bread with high-vitamin yeast or synthetic vitamins in the late 1930s. The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Science established the first set of  |Recommended_Dietary_Allowances|Dietary_Reference_Intake|  in 1941. In 1943, the US War Foods Administration issued the War Food Order No. 1, which made enriched bread the temporary law of the land.  In 1945 George Stigler published an article on The cost of subsistence which described the so-called  |Stigler_diet|Stigler_Diet|  - his solution to the problem of providing a diet that met the RDA at a minimum cost.     The logistical requirements of the US military during  |WW2|World_War_Ii|  and the  |Korean_War|Korean_War|  spurred the development and growth of the processed foods industry in the US.  These wars encouraged production of shelf-stable ingredients processed on a vast industrial scale. Examples include  |powdered_milk|Powdered_Milk| ,  |powdered_eggs|Powdered_Eggs| ,  |potato_flakes|Instant_Mashed_Potatoes| , and  |frozen_concentrated_orange_juice|Frozen_Oj| .     After the war, low cost, highly processed foods became one of the foundational elements of an era of mass prosperity.  Many companies in the American  |food_industry|Food_Industry|  developed new products requiring minimal preparation, such as frozen entrees.  One such example is the  |TV_dinner|Tv_Dinner|  in which a multi-course meal was assembled in aluminum packaging in a food factory and flash frozen, then reheated at home in a thermal oven to be served while watching TV.   |Convenience_foods|Convenience_Food|  of the era were designed to simplify home preparation. One example is  |macaroni_cheese|Kraft_Dinner|  created using a powdered artificial cheese product that is reconstituted at home with fresh milk. Newspapers and magazines ran recipe columns, aided by research from corporate kitchens, which were major food manufacturers like  |General_Mills|General_Mills| ,  |Campbells|Campbells| , and  |Kraft_Foods|Kraft_Foods| . For example, the General Mills Betty Crockers Cookbook, first published in 1950, was a popular book in American homes. .      Highly processed foods of the mid-twentieth century included novelty elements like multi-colored  |Jell_O|Jell_O|  using various chemical  |food_colorings|Food_Coloring| , prepared breakfast cereals marketed to children with large amounts of sugar and artificial colors .  Fruit flavored punches made with artificial fruit flavorings . Mid-twentieth century foods also added novelty packaging elements like  |spray_cheese_in_an_aerosol_can|Easy_Cheese| ,  |pimento|Pimiento|  stuffed olives, and  |drink_pouches|Capri_Sun| .     The development of the  |microwave_oven|Microwave_Oven|  resulted in the creation of industrial food products and packaging that is intended take advantage of the unique opportunities and overcome the unique challenges of that technology.   |Microwave_popcorn|Microwave_Popcorn|  is an example of such a product.     Throughout the second half of the 20th century the US commercial food system has become increasingly dependent on  |subsidized|Agricultural_Subsidyunited_States| |_maize|Maize|  production to provide feed for livestock and ingredients for human foods such as  |high_fructose_corn_syrup|High_Fructose_Corn_Syrup| .  It is estimated that the typical American gets 70 percent of his/her  |carbon|Carbon|  intake from  |maize|Maize|  sources.      The last half of the 20th century saw the development of controversial technological innovations intended to lower the cost of, improve the quality of, or increase the safety of commercial food including:  |food_irradiation|Food_Irradiation| , K.F. Maurer, Zur Keimfreimachung von Gewürzen, Ernährungswirtschaft 5 nr.1, 45-47  |genetically_modified_organisms|Genetically_Modified_Organism| , livestock treated with  |antibiotics|Antibiotic_Use_In_Livestock| / |hormones|Beef_Hormone_Controversy| , and  |concentrated_animal_feeding_operations|Concentrated_Animal_Feeding_Operation| . Activists have raised concerns about the wholesomeness, safety, or humaneness of these innovations and recommend alternatives such as  |organic_produce|Organic_Food| ,  |veganism|Veganism| / |vegetarianism|Vegetarianism| , and  |locavore|Local_Food|  diets.          One signature characteristic of American cooking is the  |fusion|Fusion_Cuisine|  of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles. For example, spaghetti is Italian, while hot dogs are German; a popular meal, especially among young children, is spaghetti containing slices of hot dogs.   Since the 1960s Asian cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion cuisine.           Some dishes that are typically considered American have their origins in other countries. American cooks and chefs have substantially altered these dishes over the years, to the degree that the dishes now enjoyed around the world are considered to be American.  |Hot_dogs|Hot_Dog|  and  |hamburgers|Hamburger|  are both based on traditional  |German|German_Cuisine|  dishes, but in their modern popular form they can be reasonably considered American dishes.       |Pizza|Pizza|  is based on the traditional  |Italian|Italian_Cuisine|  dish, brought by Italian immigrants to the United States, but varies highly in style based on the region of development since its arrival. For example, Chicago style has focus on a thicker, taller crust, whereas a  |New_York_Slice|New_York–Style_Pizza|  is known to have a much thinner crust which can be folded. These different types of pizza can be advertised throughout the country and are generally recognizable and well-known, with some restaurants going so far as to import New York City tap water from a thousand or more miles away to recreate the signature style in other regions.      Some dishes that Americans think of as being of foreign in origin and/or associated with a particular immigrant group were in fact invented in America and customized to American tastes. For example  |General_Tsos_chicken|General_Tsos_Chicken|  was invented by Chinese or Taiwanese chefs working in New York City in the early 1970s.  The dish is unknown in China. The  |fortune_cookie|Fortune_Cookie|  was likewise invented in California in the early 1900s and is known in Asia only as an American style food.           A wave of  |celebrity_chefs|Celebrity_Chef|  began with  |Julia_Child|Julia_Child|  and  |Graham_Kerr|Graham_Kerr|  in the 1970s, with many more following after the rise of cable channels like  |Food_Network|Food_Network| . By the beginning of the 21st century regional variations in consumption of meat began to reduce, as more meat was consumed overall. Saying they eat too much protein, the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans asked men and teenage boys to increase their consumption of underconsumed foods such as vegetables. Some individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups. in           During the 1980s, upscale restaurants introduced a mixing of cuisines that contain Americanized styles of cooking with foreign elements commonly referred as  |New_American_cuisine|New_American_Cuisine| .  New American cuisine refers to a type of  |fusion_cuisine|Fusion_Cuisine|  which assimilates flavors from the  |melting_pot|Melting_Pot|  of traditional American cooking techniques mixed with flavors from other cultures and sometimes  |molecular_gastronomy|Molecular_Gastronomy|  components.            Generally speaking, in the present day 21st century, the modern cuisine of the United States is very much regional in nature. Excluding  |Alaska|Alaska|  and  |Hawaii|Hawaii| , the terrain spans  from east to west and more than  from north to south.                 New England is a Northeastern region of the United States bordering the Maritime Provinces of Canada and portions of Quebec in the north. It includes the six states of  |Connecticut|Connecticut| ,  |Maine|Maine| ,  |Massachusetts|Massachusetts| ,  |New_Hampshire|New_Hampshire| ,  |Rhode_Island|Rhode_Island| , and  |Vermont|Vermont| , with its largest city and cultural capital  |Boston|Boston| , founded in 1630. The Native American cuisine became part of the cookery style that the early colonists brought with them. Tribes like the  |Nipmuck|Nipmuck| ,  |Wampanoag|Wampanoag| ,  |Passamaquoddy|Passamaquoddy|  and other Algonquian cultures were noted for slashing and burning areas to create meadows and bogs that would attract animals like  |moose|Eastern_Moose|  and  |deer|White_Tailed_Deer| , but also encourage the growth of plants like  |black_raspberries|Black_Raspberries| ,  |blueberries|Lowbush_Blueberry| , and  |cranberries|Cranberry| .  In the forest they would have collected nuts of species like the  |shagbark_hickory|Shagbark_Hickory| ,  |American_hazel|Corylus_Americana| , and  |American_chestnuts|Castanea_Dentata|  and fruits like wild  |grapes|Vitis_Labrusca|  and  |black_cherries|Prunus_Serotina| .  All of these eventually showed up in the kitchens of colonial New England women  and many were sent back to England and other portions of Europe to be catalogued by scientists, collectors, and horticulturalists.     The style of New England cookery originated from its colonial roots, that is to say practical, frugal, and willing to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots. . Most of the initial colonists came from  |East_Anglia|East_Anglia|  in England, with other groups following them over the ages like francophone regions of  |Canada|Canada|  , from Ireland, from Southern Italy, and most recently from Haiti, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Portugal. The oldest forms of the cuisine date to the early 17th century and in the case of Massachusetts, out of the entire country only the state of Virginia can claim recipes that are older. East Anglian cookery would have included recipes for dishes like suet puddings, wheaten breads, and a few shellfish delicacies, like winkles, and would have been at the time of settlement simple Puritan fare quite in contrast to the fineries and excesses expected in London cavalier circles. Most of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such dishes as  |succotash|Succotash| ,  |chowder|Chowder| ,  |baked_beans|Baked_Beans| , and others.  Starches are fairly simple, and typically encompass just a handful of classics like  |potato|Potato| es and  |cornmeal|Cornmeal| , and a few native breads like  |Anadama_bread|Anadama_Bread| ,  |johnnycakes|Johnnycake| ,  |bulkie_rolls|Bulkie_Roll| ,  |Parker_house_rolls|Parker_House_Roll| ,  |popovers|Popover| , and  |New_England_brown_bread|New_England_Brown_Bread| . This region is fairly conservative with its spices, but typical spices include  |nutmeg|Nutmeg| ,  |ginger|Ginger| ,  |cinnamon|Cinnamon| ,  |cloves|Clove| , and  |allspice|Allspice| , especially in desserts, and for savory foods,  |thyme|Thyme| ,  |black_pepper|Black_Pepper| ,  |sea_salt|Sea_Salt| , and  |sage|Salvia_Officinalis| . Typical condiments include  |maple_syrup|Maple_Syrup| , grown from the native  |sugar_maple|Sugar_Maple| ,  |molasses|Molasses| , and  |cranberry_sauce|Cranberry_Sauce| .     New England is noted for having a heavy emphasis on seafood, a legacy inherited from coastal tribes like the  |Wampanoag|Wampanoag|  and  |Narragansett|Narragansett_Indian_Tribe_Of_Rhode_Island| , who equally used the rich fishing banks offshore for sustenance. Favorite fish include  |cod|Atlantic_Cod| ,  |salmon|Atlantic_Salmon| ,  |winter_flounder|Winter_Flounder| ,  |haddock|Haddock| ,  |striped_bass|Striped_Bass| ,  |pollock|Pollock| ,  |hake|Hake| ,  |bluefish|Bluefish| , and, in southern New England,  |tautog|Tautog| . All of these are prepared numerous ways, such as frying cod for fish fingers, grilling bluefish over hot coals for summertime, smoking salmon or serving a whole poached one chilled for feasts with a dill sauce, or, on cold winter nights, serving haddock baked in casserole dish with a creamy sauce and crumbled breadcrumbs as a top so it forms a crust.   |Clam_cakes|Clam_Cakes| , a savory fritter based on chopped clams, are a specialty of Rhode Island. Farther inland,  |brook_trout|Brook_Trout| ,  |largemouth_bass|Largemouth_Bass| , and  |herring|Herring|  are sought after, especially in the rivers and icy finger lakes in upper New England where New Englanders will  |fly_fish|Fly_Fishing|  for them in summertime.     Meat is present though not as prominent, and typically is either stewed in dishes like  |Yankee_pot_roast|Pot_Roast|  and  |New_England_boiled_dinner|New_England_Boiled_Dinner|  or braised, as in a  |picnic_ham|Picnic_Ham| ; these dishes suit the weather better as summers are humid and hot but winters are raw and cold, getting below 0  °C for most of the winter and only just above it by March.  The roasting of whole turkeys began here as a centerpiece for large American banquets, and like all other East Coast tribes, the Native American tribes of New England prized wild turkeys as a source of sustenance and later Anglophone settlers were enamored of cooking them using methods they knew from Europe: often that meant trussing the bird and spinning it on a string or spit roasting. Today turkey meat is a key ingredient in soups, and also a favorite in several sandwiches like the  |Pilgrim|Pilgrim| . For lunch, hot roast beef is sometimes chopped finely into small pieces and put on a roll with salami and American or provolone cheese to make a  |steak_bomb|Steak_Bomb| .  Bacon is often maple cured, and often bacon or salt pork drippings are an ingredient in  |corn_chowder|Corn_Chowder| , a cousin of the clam chowder.   |Veal|Veal|  consumption was prevalent in the North Atlantic States prior to  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .  A variety of linguiça is favored as a breakfast food, brought with Portuguese fisherman and Brazilian immigrants.  In contrast with some parts of the United States,  |lamb|Lamb_And_Mutton|  is a popular roasted or grilled meat across diverse groups in New England. Dairy farming and its resultant products figure strongly on the ingredient list, and homemade ice cream is a summertime staple of the region: it was a small seasonal roadside stand in Vermont that eventually became the internationally famous  |Ben_and_Jerrys|Ben_And_Jerrys|  ice cream. Vermont is known for producing farmhouse style cheeses, especially a type of cheddar.  The recipe goes all the way back to colonial times when English settlers brought the recipe with them from England and found the rocky landscape eminently suitable to making the cheese.  Today Vermont has more artisanal cheese makers per capita than any other state, and diversity is such that interest in goats milk cheeses has become prominent.      Crustaceans and mollusks are also an essential ingredient in the regional cookery. Maine and Massachusetts, in more recent years, have taken to harvesting  |peekytoe_crab|Peekytoe_Crab|  and  |Jonah_crab|Jonah_Crab|  and making crab bisques, based on cream with 35% milkfat, and crabcakes out of them: often these were overlooked as bycatch of lobster pots by fisherman of the region, but in the past 30 years their popularity has firmly established them as a staple They even appear on the menu as far south as to be out of region in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , where they are sold to four star restaurants in the form of cocktail claws. Squid are heavily fished for and eaten as  |fried_calamari|Fried_Calamari| , and often are an ingredient in  |Italian_American|Italian_American|  cooking in this region. Whelks are eaten in salad, and  |lobster|Lobster| , which is indigenous to the coastal waters of the region and are a feature of many dishes, baked, boiled, roasted, and steamed, or simply eaten as a  |sandwich|Lobster_Roll| , chilled with mayonnaise and chopped celery in Maine and Massachusetts, or slathered with melted butter on Long Island and in Connecticut.     Shellfish of all sorts are part of the diet, and  |shellfish|Shellfish|  of the coastal regions include  |little_neck_clams|Cherrystone_Clamalternative_Names| ,  |sea_scallops|Scallop| ,  |blue_mussels|Blue_Mussel| ,  |oysters|Oyster| ,  |soft_shell_clams|Soft_Shell_Clam| , and  |razor_shell_clams|Atlantic_Jackknife_Clam| . Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the  |clambake|New_England_Clam_Bake| . The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition.  In summer, oysters and clams are dipped in batter and fried, often served in a basket with french fries, or commonly on a wheaten bun as a clam roll. Oysters are otherwise eaten chilled on a bed of crushed ice on the half shell with mignonette sauce, and are often branded on where they were harvested. Large quahogs are stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning and baked in their shells, and smaller ones often find their way into  |clam_chowder|Clam_Chowder| . Other preparations include  |clams_casino|Clams_Casino| , clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like  |oregano|Oregano|  and streaky bacon.     The fruits of the region include the  Vitis labrusca  grapes used in  |grape_juice|Grape_Juice|  made by companies such as  |Welchs|Welchs| , along with  |jelly|Fruit_Preserves| ,  |Kosher_wine|Kosher_Wine|  by companies like  |Mogen_David|Mogen_David|  and  |Manischewitz|Manischewitz|  along with other wineries that make higher quality wines     Though not anywhere near as productive a region as the top three apple producing regions, Apples have been a staple of New England foodways since at least the 1640s and it is here that a very high amount of heirloom varieties are found, many of them gaining renewed interest as part of locavore movements and the re-emergence of cider as a beverage of choice.  |Apples|Apple|  from New England would include varieties imported from their earliest in Europe and a few natives, like  |Baldwin|Baldwin| , Lady, Mother, Pomme Grise, Porter,  |Roxbury_Russet|Roxbury_Russet| ,  |Rhode_Island_Greening|Rhode_Island_Greening| ,  |Sops_of_Wine|Sops_Of_Wine| , Hightop Sweet, Pecks Pleasant, Titus Pippin,  |Westfield_Seek_No_Further|Westfield_Seek_No_Further| , and  |Duchess_of_Oldenburg|Duchess_Of_Oldenburg| . Historically New England and the other original 13 colonies were major producers of hard cider and the only reason why this changed were that immigrants from Western and Central Europe preferred beer, especially lagers, to apple based alcohol. In more recent years cider has made a roaring comeback nationwide, with New England being the first to break out of the box and with many pomologists scouring the woods for abandoned apple trees and heirloom varieties to add to the cider press.  |Angry_Orchard|Angry_Orchard|  is a local commercial brand that began in New Hampshire but has since skyrocketed in sales, with other large marques following suit around the land.       |Beach_plums|Beach_Plum|  a small native species with fruits the size of a pinball, are sought after in summer to make into a jam.  |Cranberries|Cranberry|  are another fruit indigenous to the region, often collected in autumn in huge flooded bogs. Thereafter they are juiced so they can be drunk fresh for breakfast, or dried and incorporated into salads and quickbreads.  Winter squashes like pumpkin and butternut squashes have been a staple for generations owing to their ability to keep for long periods over icy New England winters and being an excellent source of beta carotene; in summer, they are replaced with pattypan and zucchini, the latter brought to the region by immigrants from Southern Italy a century ago. Blueberries are a very common summertime treat owing to them being an important crop, and find their way into  |muffins|Muffin| ,  |pies|Pie|  and  |pancakes|Pancake| . Typical favorite desserts are quite diverse, and encompass  |hasty_pudding|Hasty_Pudding| ,  |blueberry_pie|Blueberry_Pie| ,  |whoopie_pies|Whoopie_Pie| ,  |Boston_cream_pie|Boston_Cream_Pie| ,  |pumpkin_pie|Pumpkin_Pie| ,  |Joe_Frogger|Joe_Frogger|  cookies, hand crafted  |ice_cream|Ice_Cream| ,  |Hermit|Hermit|  cookies, and the  |chocolate_chip_cookie|Chocolate_Chip_Cookie| , invented in  |Massachusetts|Massachusetts|  in the 1930s.     Southern New England, particularly along the coast, shares many specialties with the Mid-Atlantic, including especially dishes from Jewish and Italian-American cuisine. Coastal Connecticut is known for distinctive kinds of  |pizza|Pizza| , locally called apizza , differing in texture and toppings from pizza further south in the so-called pizza belt, which stretches from  |New_Haven_Connecticut|New_Haven_Connecticut|  southward through  |New_York|New_York_City| ,  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| , and into  |Maryland|Maryland| .             The mid-Atlantic states comprise the states of  |New_York|New_York| ,  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| ,  |Delaware|Delaware| ,  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania| , and Northern  |Maryland|Maryland| . The oldest major settlement in this area of the country is found in the most populous city in the nation,  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , founded in 1625 by the Dutch. Today, it is a major cultural capital of the United States.  The influences on cuisine in this region are extremely eclectic owing to the fact that it has been and continues to be a gateway for international culture as well as a gateway for new immigrants.  Going back to colonial times, each new group has left their mark on homegrown cuisine and in turn the cities in this region disperse trends to the wider United States. In addition, cities like New York and Philadelphia have had the past influence of Dutch,  Italian, German,  Irish,   British,  and Jewish cuisines,  and that continues to this day. Baltimore has become the crossroads between North and South, a distinction it has held since the end of the Civil War.     A  |global_power_city|Global_City| ,  New York City is well known for its diverse and cosmopolitan dining scene.  Its restaurants compete fiercely for good reviews in the Food and Dining section of  The New York Times , online guides, and  |Zagats|Zagats| , the last of which is widely considered the premier American dining guide, published yearly and headquartered in New York City.        Many of the more complicated dishes with rich ingredients like  |Lobster_Newberg|Lobster_Newberg| ,  |waldorf_salad|Waldorf_Salad| ,  |vichyssoise|Vichyssoise| ,  |eggs_benedict|Eggs_Benedict| , and the  |New_York_strip_steak|New_York_Strip_Steak|  were born out of a need to entertain and impress the well to do in expensive bygone restaurants like  |Delmonicos|Delmonicos|  and still standing establishments like the  |Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel|Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel| .   Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from  |Chester_New_York|Chester_Orange_County_New_York| , while looking for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese  |Neufchâtel|Neufchâtel| , accidentally came up with a way of making an unripened cheese that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.      Since the first reference to an alcoholic mixed drink called a cocktail comes from  |New_York_State|New_York_State|  in 1803, it is thus not a surprise that there have been many cocktails invented in New York and the surrounding environs. Even today New York City bars are noted for being highly influential in making national trends.  |Cosmopolitans|Cosmopolitan| ,  |Long_Island_iced_teas|Long_Island_Iced_Tea| ,  |Manhattans|Manhattan| ,  |Rob_Roys|Rob_Roy| ,  |Tom_Collins|Tom_Collins| ,  |Aviations|Aviation| , and  |Greyhounds|Greyhound|  were all invented in New York bars, and the  |gin_martini|Martini|  was popularized in New York in speakeasies during the 1920s, as evidenced by its appearance in the works of New Yorker and American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Like its neighbor  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| , many rare and unusual liquors and liqueurs often find their way into a mixologists cupboard or restaurant wine list. New York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes, just behind  |California|California|  and  |Washington|Washington| . It has  |AVAs|American_Viticultural_Area|  near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island,  and in the  |Hudson_Valley|Hudson_Valley|  has the second most productive area in the country for growing apples, making it a center for hard cider production, just like  |New_England|New_England| .   Pennsylvania has been growing rye since Germans began to emigrate to the area at the end of the 17th century and required a grain they knew from Germany.  Therefore, overall it is not unusual to find New York grown  |Gewürtztraminer|Gewürtztraminer|  and  |Riesling|Riesling| , Pennsylvania rye whiskey, or marques of locally produced ciders like Original Sin on the same menu.        Since their formative years,  |New_York_City|New_York_City| ,  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| , and  |Baltimore|Baltimore|  have welcomed immigrants of every kind to their shores, and all three have been an important gateway through which new citizens to the general United States arrive.  Traditionally natives have eaten cheek to jowl with newcomers for centuries as the newcomers would open new restaurants and small businesses and all the different groups would interact. Even in colonial days this region was a very diverse mosaic of peoples, as settlers from Switzerland, Wales, England, Ulster, Wallonia, Holland, Gelderland, the British Channel Islands, and Sweden sought their fortune in this region.   This is very evident in many signature dishes and local foods, all of which have evolved to become American dishes in their own right. The original Dutch settlers of New York brought recipes they knew and understood from the Netherlands and their mark on local cuisine is still apparent today: in many quarters of New York their version of apple pie with a streusel top is still baked, while originating in the colony of New Amsterdam their predilection for waffles in time evolved into the American national recipe and forms part of a New York City brunch, and they also made  |coleslaw|Coleslaw| , originally a Dutch salad, but today accented with the later 18th-century introduction of  |mayonnaise|Mayonnaise| .   The  |doughnut|Doughnut|  began its life originally as a New York pastry that arrived in the 18th century as the Dutch olykoek, with later additions from other nations of Europe like the Italian zeppole, the Jewish/Polish pączki, and the German Berliner arriving in the 19th century to complete the variety found in modern doughnuts today. See entries for  oliebol  and oliekoek in          |Crab_cakes|Crab_Cake|  were once a kind of English croquette, but over time as spices have been added they and the  |Maryland_crab_feast|Crab_Boilmaryland|  became two of Baltimores signature dishes; fishing for the  |blue_crab|Callinectes_Sapidus|  is a favorite summer pastime in the waters off  |Maryland|Maryland| ,  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| , and  |Delaware|Delaware|  where they may grace the table at summer picnics . Other mainstays of the region have been present since the early years of American history, like oysters from Cape May, the Chesapeake Bay, and Long Island, and lobster and tuna from the coastal waters found in New York and New Jersey.    |Philadelphia_Pepper_Pot|Philadelphia_Pepper_Pot| , a tripe stew, was originally a British dish but today is a classic of home cooking in Pennsylvania alongside bookbinder soup, a type of  |turtle_soup|Turtle_Soup| .     In the winter, New York City pushcarts sell roasted chestnuts, a delicacy dating back to English Christmas traditions,  and it was in New York and Pennsylvania that the earliest Christmas cookies were introduced: Germans introduced crunchy molasses based gingerbread and sugar cookies in Pennsylvania, and the Dutch introduced cinnamon based cookies, all of which have become part of the traditional Christmas meal.    |Scrapple|Scrapple|  was originally a type of savory pudding that early Pennsylvania Germans made to preserve the  |offal|Offal|  of a pig slaughter.  The Philadelphia soft pretzel was originally brought to Eastern Pennsylvania in the early 18th century, and later, 19th-century immigrants sold them to the masses from pushcarts to make them the citys best-known bread product, having evolved into its own unique recipe.         After the 1820s, new groups began to arrive and the character of the region began to change. There had been some Irish from Ulster prior to 1820, however largely they had been Protestants with somewhat different culture and a different  |language|Irish_Language|  than the explosion of emigrants that came to  |Castle_Garden|Castle_Garden|  and Locust Point in Baltimore in their masses starting in the 1840s.     The Irish arrived in America in a rather woeful state, as Ireland at the time was often plagued by some of the worst poverty in Europe and often heavy disenfranchisement among the masses: many of them arrived barely alive having ridden  |coffin_ships|Coffin_Ship|  to the New World, very sick with typhus and gaunt from prolonged starvation. In addition, they were the first to face challenges other groups did not have: they were the first large wave of Catholics. They faced prejudice for their faith and the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore were not always set up for their needs. For example, Catholic bishops in the U.S. mandated until the 1960s that all Catholics were forbidden from eating red meat on Fridays and during Lent,  and attending Mass sometimes conflicted with work as produce and meat markets would be open on high holy days; this was difficult for Irishmen supporting families since many worked as laborers. Unsurprisingly, many Irishmen also found their fortunes working as longshoremen, which would have given their families access to fish and shellfish whenever a fisherman made berth, which was frequent on the busy docks of Baltimore and New York.   Though there had been some activity in Baltimore in founding a  |see|Holy_See|  earlier by the  |Carrolls|John_Carroll| , the Irish were the first major wave of Catholic worship in this region, and that meant bishops and cardinals sending away to Europe for wine. Part of the Catholic mass includes every parishioner taking a sip of wine from the chalice as part of the Eucharist. Taverns had existed prior to their emigration to America in the region, though the Irish brought their particular brand of pub culture and founded some of the first saloons and bars that served Dublin style  |stout|Stout|  and  |red_ale|Irish_Red_Ale| ; they brought with them the knowledge of single malt style whiskey and sold it. The Irish were the first immigrant group to arrive in this region in massive millions, and these immigrants also founded some of the earliest saloons and bars in this region, of which  |McSorleys|Mcsorleys_Old_Ale_House|  is a still operating example.        It was also in this region that the Irish introduced something that today is a very important festival in American culture that involves a large amount of food, drink, and merry making:  |Halloween|Halloween| . In England and Wales, where prior immigrants had come from, the feast of All Hallows Eve had died out in the  |Reformation|English_Reformation| , dismissed as superstition and excess having nothing to do with the Bible and often replaced with the festival of  |Guy_Fawkes_Night|Guy_Fawkes_Night| . Other immigrant groups like the Germans preferred to celebrate October 31 as  |Reformation_Day|Reformation_Day| , and after the American Revolution all of the above were less and less eager to celebrate the legacy of an English festival when they had fought a very bloody war to leave the British Empire. The Catholicism of the Irish demanded attendance at church on November 1 and charity and deeds, not just faith, as a cornerstone of dogma, and many of their older traditions survived the Reformation and traveled with them. Naturally, they went door-to-door to collect victuals for masked parties as well as gave them out, like nuts to roast on the fire, whiskey, beer, or cider, and  |barmbracks|Barmbrack| ; they also  |bobbed_for_apples|Apple_Bobbing|  and made dumb cakes. Later in the century they were joined by Scots going  |guising|Trick_Or_Treating| , children going door-to-door to ask for sweets and treats in costume. From the Mid Atlantic this trend spread to be nationwide and evolved into American children  |trick_or_treating|Trick_Or_Treating|  on October 31 wearing costumes and their older counterparts having wild costume parties with lots of food and drink like  |caramel_apples|Caramel_Apple| ,  |candy_apples|Candy_Apple| ,  |dirt_cakes|Dirt_Cake| ,  |punch|Punch| ,  |cocktails|Cocktail| ,  |cider|Cider| |_pumpkin_pie|Pumpkin_Pie| ,  |candy_corn|Candy_Corn| ,  |chocolate_turtles|Turtles| ,  |peanut_brittle|Peanut_Brittle| ,  |taffy|Taffy| ,  |tipsy_cake|Tipsy_Cake| , and copious buckets full of candy; children carving  |jack_o_lanterns|Jack_O_Lantern|  and eating squash derived foods derive from Halloweens heritage as a harvest festival and from Irish and Scottish traditions of carving turnips and eating root vegetables at this time of year. Their bobbing for apples has survived to the present day as a Halloween party classic game, as has a variation on the parlor game of trying to grab an apple hanging from the ceiling blindfolded:  it has evolved into trying to catch a donut in ones teeth.      Immigrants from Southern Europe, namely  |Sicily|Sicily| ,  |Campania|Campania| ,  |Lazio|Lazio| , and  |Calabria|Calabria| , appeared between 1880 and 1960 in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Eastern Maryland hoping to escape the extreme poverty and corruption endemic to Italy; typically none of them spoke English, but rather dialects of Italian and had a culture that was more closely tied to the village they were born in than the high culture only accessible to those who could afford it at this time; many could not read or write in any language. They were employed in manual labor or factory work but it is because of them that dishes like  |spaghetti_with_meatballs|Spaghetti_With_Meatballs| ,  |New_York–style_pizza|New_York–Style_Pizza| ,  |calzones|Calzones| , and  |baked_ziti|Baked_Ziti|  exist, and Americans of today are very familiar with semolina based pasta noodles. Their native cuisine had less of an emphasis on meat, as evidenced by dishes they introduced like  |pasta_e_fagioli|Pasta_E_Fagioli|  and  |minestrone|Minestrone| , but the dishes they created in America often piled it on as a sign of wealth and newfound prosperity since for the first time even cheap cuts of it were affordable: the American recipe for  |lasagna|Lasagne|  is proof of this, as mostly it is derived from the Neapolitan version of the dish with large amounts of meat and cheese.        New York–style  |hot_dogs|Hot_Dog|  came about with German speaking emigrants from Austria and Germany, particularly with the  |frankfurter_sausage|Frankfurter_Würstchen|  and the smaller  |wiener_sausage|Vienna_Sausage| ; Jews would also contribute here by introducing the kosher version of these sausages, made of beef rather than pork.  Today, the New York–style hot dog with  |sauerkraut|Sauerkraut| , mustard, and the optional cucumber pickle relish is such a part of the local fabric, that it is one of the favorite comestibles of New York City and both the pork and the beef versions are beloved. Hot dogs are a typical street food sold year round in all by the most inclement weather from thousands of pushcarts. As with all other stadiums in Major League Baseball they are an essential for  |New_York_Yankees|New_York_Yankees|  and the  |New_York_Mets|New_York_Mets|  games though it is the local style of preparation that predominates without exception. Hot dogs are also the focus of a televised eating contest on the Fourth of July in Coney Island,  at  |Nathans_Famous|Nathans_Famous| , one of the earliest hot dog stands opened in the United States in 1916 by  |Nathan_Handwerker|Nathan_Handwerker| , a Jewish man who emigrated from what is now Ukraine in 1912 and whose influence is felt today around the world: hot dogs are a staple of amusement parks 100 years later.      A summertime treat,  |Italian_ice|Italian_Ice| , began its life as a sweeter adaptation of the Sicilain  |granita|Granita|  that was strictly lemon flavored and brought to New York and Philadelphia. Its Hispanic counterpart,  |piragua|Piragua| , is a common and evolving shaved ice treat brought to New York City by Puerto Ricans in the 1930s. Unlike the original dish which included flavors like tamarind, mango, coconut, piragua is evolving to include flavors like grape and cherry, fruits which are impossible to grow in the tropical Puerto Rican climate and get exported back to the island from New York.   |Taylor_Ham|Taylor_Ham| , a meat delicacy of  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| , first appeared around the time of the Civil War and today is often served for breakfast with eggs and cheese on a kaiser roll, the bread upon which this is served was brought to the area by Austrians in the second half of the nineteenth century and is a very common roll for sandwiches at lunchtime, usually tipped with poppyseeds. This breakfast meat is generally known as pork roll in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, and Taylor Ham in northern New Jersey.        Other dishes came about during the early 20th century and have much to do with delicatessen fare, set up largelyby Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who came to America incredibly poor, often illiterate in any other language but Hebrew, and often banished from mainstream society in their place of origin for centuries. Most often they were completely unable to partake in the outdoor food markets that the general population utilized as most of the food for sale was not kosher. The influence of European Jewry before their destruction in the  |Holocaust|The_Holocaust|  on modern mid Atlantic cooking remains extremely strong and reinforced by their many descendants in the region.  These currently form the largest concentration of Jews outside Tel Aviv and are very much integrated into the local mainstream of New York City in particular. American-style  |pickles|Dill_Pickle| , now a common addition to hamburgers and sandwiches, were brought by Polish Jews,  and Austro-Hungarian Jews brought a recipe for almond horns that now is a common regional cookie, diverting from the original recipe in dipping the ends in dark chocolate.   New York–style cheesecake has copious amounts of cream and eggs because animal  |rennet|Rennet|  is not  |kosher|Kashrut|  and thus could not be sold to a large number of the delis clientele. New York inherited its bagels and bialys from Jews, as well as Challah bread.  |Pastrami|Pastrami|  first entered the country via Romanian Jews, and is a feature of many sandwiches, often eaten on marble rye, a bread that was born in the mid-Atlantic.  |Whitefish_salad|Whitefish_Salad| ,  |lox|Smoked_Salmon| , and  |matzoh_ball_soup|Matzoh_Ball_Soup|  are now standard fare made to order at local diners and delicatessens, but started their life as foods that made up a strict dietary code.  |Rugelach|Rugelach|  cookies and  |hamentashen|Hamentashen|  are sweet staples still sold to the general public, but came to New York over a century ago with Ashkenazi Jews along with  |Jewish_rye|Jewish_Rye| .          Like other groups before them, many of their dishes passed into the mainstream enough so that they became part of diner fare by the end of the 20th century, a type of restaurant that is now more numerous in this region than any other and formerly the subject matter of artist  |Edward_Hopper|Edward_Hopper| . In the past this sort of establishment was the haven of the short order cook grilling or frying simple foods for the working man. Today typical service would include staples from this large region like  |beef_on_weck|Beef_On_Weck| ,  |Manhattan_clam_chowder|Manhattan_Clam_Chowder| , the  |club_sandwich|Club_Sandwich| ,  |Buffalo_wings|Buffalo_Wings| ,  |Philadelphia_cheesesteak|Cheesesteak| , the  |black_and_white_cookie|Black_And_White_Cookie| ,  |shoofly_pie|Shoofly_Pie| ,  |snapper_soup|Turtle_Soup| ,  |Smith_Island_cake|Smith_Island_Cake| ,  |blackout_cake|Blackout_Cake| ,  |grape_pie|Grape_Pie| ,  |milkshakes|Milkshake| , and the  |egg_cream|Egg_Cream| , a vanilla or chocolate fountain drink with a frothy top and fizzy taste. As in Hoppers painting from 1942, many of these businesses are open 24 hours a day.          Midwestern cuisine today is a very eclectic and odd mix and match of foodways. It covers everything from  |Kansas_City_style|Kansas_City_Style_Barbecue| |_barbecue|Barbecue|  to the  |Chicago_style_hot_dog|Chicago_Style_Hot_Dog| , though many of its classics are very simple, hearty fare. Mostly this region was completely untouched by European and American settlers until after the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War| , and excepting  |Missouri|Missouri|  and the heavily forested states near the Great Lakes, was mainly populated by nomadic tribes like the  |Sioux|Sioux_People| ,  |Osage|Osage_People| ,  |Arapaho|Arapaho_People| , and  |Cheyenne|Cheyenne| . As with most other American Indians tribes, these tribes consumed the  |Three_Sisters|Three_Sisters|  of beans, maize, and squash, but also for thousands of years followed the herds of  |bison|American_Bison|  and hunted them first on foot and then, after the spread of mustangs from the Southwest due to the explorations of conquistadors, on horseback, typically using bow and arrow. There are  |buffalo_jumps|Buffalo_Jump|  dating back nearly ten thousand years and several photographs and written accounts of trappers and homesteaders attesting to their dependence on the buffalo and to a lesser degree  |elk|Elk| . After nearly wiping out the elk and bison to nothingness, this region has taken to raising bison alongside cattle for their meat and at an enormous profit, making them into burgers and steaks.     This region today comprises the states near the Great Lakes and also the Great Plains; much of it is prairie with a very flat terrain where the blue sky meets a neverending horizon. Winters are bitterly cold, windy, and wet. Often that means very harsh blizzards especially near the Great Lakes where Arctic winds blow off of Canada and where the ice on rivers and lakes freezes reliably thick enough for  |ice_hockey|Ice_Hockey|  to be a favorite pastime in the region and for ice fishing for  |pike|Northern_Pike| ,  |walleye|Walleye|  and  |panfish|Panfish|  to be ubiquitous in  |Minnesota|Minnesota| ,  |Wisconsin|Wisconsin| , and  |Michigan|Michigan| , where they often there after become part of the local tradition of the  |fish_fry|Fish_Fry| . Population density is extremely low away from the Great Lakes and very small towns dominated by enormous farms are the rule with larger cities being the exception.  |Detroit|Detroit| ,  |Cleveland|Cleveland| ,  |St_Louis|St_Louis| ,  |Cincinnati|Cincinnati| ,  |Indianapolis|Indianapolis| ,  |Milwaukee|Milwaukee| ,  |Minneapolis|Minneapolis|  and her twin sister city across the river  |St_Paul|St_Paul_Minnesota|  dominate the landscape in wealth and size, owing to their ties with manufacturing, finance, transportation, and meatpacking. Smaller places like  |Omaha|Omaha_Nebraska| ,  |Tulsa|Tulsa_Oklahoma| , and  |Kansas_City|Kansas_City_Missouri|  make up local capitals, but the king of them all is  |Chicago|Chicago| , third largest city in the country, on the shores of Lake Michigan.        The Upper Midwest includes the states of  |Illinois|Illinois| ,  |Minnesota|Minnesota| ,  |Wisconsin|Wisconsin| ,  |Ohio|Ohio| ,  |Indiana|Indiana| , and  |Michigan|Michigan| . Non-American Indian settlement began here earlier than anywhere else in the region, and thus the food available here ranges from the sublime to the bizarre. As with all of the Midwest, the primary meats here are beef and poultry, since the Midwest has been raising  |turkeys|Turkey| ,  |chickens|Chicken| , and  |geese|Goose|  for over a hundred and fifty years; chickens have been so common for so long that the Midwest has several native breeds that are prized for both backyard farming and for farmers markets, such as the  |Buckeye|Buckeye_Chicken|  and  |Wyandotte|Wyandotte_Chicken| ; one, Billina, appears as a character in the second book of the Oz series by  |L_Frank_Baum|L_Frank_Baum| . Favorite fruits of the region include a few native plants inherited from Native American tribes like the  |pawpaw|Asimina_Triloba|  and the  |American_persimmons|Diospyros_Virginiana|  are also highly favored. As with the American South, pawpaws are the regions largest native fruit, about the size of a mango, and are often found growing wild in the region come September, whereafter they are made into preserves and cakes and command quite a price at farmers markets in Chicago.  The  |American_persimmon|American_Persimmon|  is often smaller than it is Japanese cousin, about the size of a small plum, but in the Midwest and portions of the East it is the main ingredient in a steamed pudding called  |persimmon_pudding|Persimmon_Pudding| , topped with crème anglaise. Other crops inherited from the Native Americans include  |wild_rice|Wild_Rice| , which grows on the banks of lakes and is a local favorite for fancy meals and today often used in stuffing for Thanksgiving.     Typical fruits of the region are cold weather crops. Once it was believed that the region had winters that were far too harsh for apple growing, but then a breeder in  |Minnesota|Minnesota|  came forth with the  |Wealthy_apple|Wealthy|  and thence came forth the third most productive region for apple growing in the land, with local varieties comprising  |Wolf_River|Wolf_River| , Enterprise,  |Melrose|Melrose| ,  |Paula_Red|Paula_Red| ,  |Rome_Beauty|Rome_Beauty| ,  |Honeycrisp|Honeycrisp| , and the  |Red_Delicious|Red_Delicious| . Cherries are important to  |Michigan|Michigan|  and  |Wisconsin|Wisconsin|  grows many  |cranberries|Cranberry| , a legacy of early-19th-century emigration of New England farmers.  |Crabapple|Crabapple|  jelly is a favorite condiment of the region.     The influence of German, Scandinavian, and Slavic peoples on the northern portion of the region is very strong; many of these emigrated to Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois in the 19th century to take advantage of jobs in the meatpacking business as well as being homesteaders and tradesmen. Bratwurst is a very common sausage eaten at  |tailgate_parties|Tailgate_Party|  for the  |Green_Bay_Packers|Green_Bay_Packers| ,  |Chicago_Bears|Chicago_Bears| , or  |Detroit_Lions|Detroit_Lions|  football teams and is often served boiled in lager beer with sauerkraut, different than many of the recipes currently found in Germany. Polish sausage, in particular a locally invented type of  |kielbasa|Kielbasa| , is an essential for sporting events in Chicago: Chicago today has approximately 200,000 speakers of Polish and has had a population of that description for over a hundred years.  When Poles came to Chicago and surrounding cities from Europe, they brought with them long ropes of kielbasa, cabbage rolls, and pierogis. Poles that left Poland after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the descendants of earlier immigrants still make all of the above and such comestibles are common in local diners and delis as result.  Today alongside the pierogi, the sausage is served on a long roll with mustard like a hot dog or as a  |Maxwell_Street_Polish|Maxwell_Street_Polish| , a sandwich that has caramelized onions as an essential ingredient. In Cleveland, the same sausage is served in the form of the  |Polish_boy|Polish_Boy| |Cincinnati_Reds|Cincinnati_Reds|  play, the predilection for sausage has a competitor in  |Cincinnati_chili|Cincinnati_Chili| , invented by Macedonian immigrants: this bizarre but tasty dish includes spaghetti as its base, chili with a Mediterranean-inspired spice mix, and cheddar cheese; the chili itself is often a topping for local hot dogs at games.     In the Midwest and especially Minnesota,  the tradition of the church potluck has become a gathering in which local foods reign, and so it has been since the era of the frontier: pioneers would often need to pool resources together to have a celebration in the 19th century and that simply never changed.  Nowhere is this more clear than with the  |hotdish|Hotdish|  Next to the hotdish at the potlucks usually is where the  |glorified_rice|Glorified_Rice|  is found: this is a dish made of a kind of rice pudding mixed with crushed pineapple and maraschino cherries. Next to that is the  |booyah|Booyah| , a thick soup made of a number or combinations of meat, vegetables, and seasonings that is meant to simmer on the stove for up to two days.  |Lefse|Lefse| , traditionally a Scandinavian flatbread, has been handed down to descendants for over a hundred years and is common on the table. Behind that is the venison, a popular meat around the Great Lakes and often eaten in steaks, sandwiches, and crown roasts for special events.   If in North or South Dakota,  |tiger_meat|Tiger_Meat| , a dish similar to steak tartare, is present. Last on the table are the  |dessert_bars|Dessert_Bar|  and most especially the  |brownies|Chocolate_Brownie|         Further South, barbecue has its own style in places in Kansas and St. Louis that are different to the South and the American West. Kansas City and St. Louis were and remain important hubs for the railroad that connected the plains with the Great Lakes and cities farther east, like Philadelphia.  At the turn of the 19th century, the St. Louis area, Omaha, and Kansas City had huge stockyards, waystations for cattle and pigs on their way East to the cities of the coast and North to the Great Lakes.   They all had large growing immigrant and migrant populations from Europe and the South respectively, so this region has developed unique styles of barbecue.  |St_Louis_style_barbecue|St_Louis_Style_Barbecue|  favors a heavy emphasis on a sticky sweet barbecue sauce. Its standbys include the  |pork_steak|Pork_Steak| , a cut taken from the shoulder of the pig, grilled, and then slowly stewed in a pan over charcoal, crispy snoots, a cut from the cheek and nose of the pig that is fried up like cracklin and eaten dipped in sauce, pork  |spare_ribs|Spare_Ribs| , and a mix of either beer boiled bratwurst or grilled Italian derived sausage, flavored with fennel. Dessert is usually something like  |gooey_butter_cake|Gooey_Butter_Cake| , invented in the city in the 1930s.  |Kansas_City_style_barbecue|Kansas_City_Style_Barbecue|  uses several different kinds of meat, more than most styles of American barbecue- turkey, mutton, pork, and beef just to name a few- but is distinct from St. Louis in that the barbecue sauce adds molasses in with the typical tomato based recipe and typically has a more tart taste. Traditionally, Kansas City uses a low-and-slow method of smoking the meat in addition to just stewing it in the sauce. It also favors using hickory wood for smoking and continual watering or layering of the sauce while cooking to form a glaze; with  |burnt_ends|Burnt_Ends|  this step is necessary to create the bark or charred outer layer of the brisket.          When referring to the American South as a region, typically it should indicate Southern Maryland and the states that were once part of the  |Old_Confederacy|Confederate_States_Of_America| , with the dividing line between the East and West jackknifing about 100 miles west of Dallas, Texas, and mostly south of the old  |Mason–Dixon_line|Mason–Dixon_Line| . Cities found in this area include  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans| ,  |Miami|Miami| ,  |Atlanta|Atlanta| ,  |Washington_D_C_|Washington_D_C_| ,  |Memphis|Memphis_Tennessee| ,  |Charleston|Charleston_South_Carolina| , and  |Charlotte|Charlotte_North_Carolina|  with  |Houston_Texas|Houston|  being the largest. These states are much more closely tied to each other and have been part of US territory for much longer than states much farther west than East Texas, and in the case of food, the influences and cooking styles are strictly separated as the terrain begins to change to prairie and desert from bayou and hardwood forest.     This section of the country has some of the oldest known foodways in the land, with some recipes almost 400 years old. Native American influences are still quite visible in the use of  |cornmeal|Cornmeal|  as an essential staple  and found in the Southern predilection for hunting wild game, in particular  |wild_turkey|Wild_Turkey| ,  |deer|White_Tailed_Deer| ,  |woodcock|American_Woodcock| , and various kinds of  |waterfowl|Waterfowl| ; for example, coastal North Carolina is a place where hunters will seek  |tundra_swan|Tundra_Swan|  as a part of Christmas dinner; the original English and Scottish settlers would have rejoiced at this revelation owing to the fact that such was banned amongst the commoner class in what is now the United Kingdom, and naturally, their descendants have not forgotten.   Native Americans also consumed  |turtles|Turtle|  and catfish, specifically the  |snapping_turtle|Snapping_Turtle|  and  |blue_catfish|Blue_Catfish| . Catfish are often  |caught_with_ones_bare_hands|Noodling| , gutted, breaded, and fried to make a Southern variation on English  |fish_and_chips|Fish_And_Chips|  and turtles are turned into stews and soups.   Native American tribes of the region such as the Cherokee or Choctaw often cultivated or gathered local plants like  |pawpaw|Asimina_Triloba| ,  |maypop|Passiflora_Incarnata|  and several sorts of  |squashes|Squash|  and  |corn|Maize|  as food  and  |spicebush|Spicebush| ,   |sassafras|Sassafras|  as spices,  and the aforementioned fruits are still cultivated as food in the South.  Maize is to this day found in dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the form of  |grits|Grits| ,  |hoecakes|Hoecakes| , baked  |cornbread|Cornbread| , and  |spoonbread|Spoonbread| , and nuts like the  |hickory|Hickory| ,  |black_walnut|Black_Walnut|  and  |pecan|Pecan|  are commonly included in desserts and pastries as varied as  |mince_pies|Mince_Pie| ,  |pecan_pie|Pecan_Pie| , pecan rolls and  |honey_buns|Honey_Bun|  , and  |quick_breads|Quick_Bread| , which were themselves invented in the South during the American Civil War. Peaches have been grown in this region since the 17th century and are a staple crop as well as a favorite fruit, with  |peach_cobbler|Cobbler|  being a signature dessert.       European influence began soon after the settlement of Jamestown in 1607 and the earliest recipes emerged by the end of the 17th century. Specific influences from Europe were quite varied, and remain traditional and essential to the modern cookery overall. German speakers often settled in the  |Piedmont|Piedmont|  on small farms from the coast, and invented an American delicacy that is now nationally beloved,  |apple_butter|Apple_Butter| , based on their recipe for apfelkraut, and later introduced  |red_cabbage|Red_Cabbage|  and  |rye|Rye| . From the British Isles, an enormous amount of influence was bestowed upon the South, specifically foodways found in 17th- and 18th-century  |Ulster|Ulster| , the borderlands between England and Scotland, the  |Scottish_Highlands|Scottish_Highlands| , portions of  |Wales|Wales| , the  |West_Midlands|West_Midlands|  and  |Black_Country|Black_Country| . Settlers bound for America fled the tumult of the  |Civil_War|English_Civil_War| ,  |Ulster|Ulster_Plantation|  and the  |Highland_Clearances|Highland_Clearances| . Often ships manifests show their belongings nearly always included cookpots or  |bakestones|Bakestone|  and seed stock for plants like  |peach|Peach| es,  |plums|Plum| , and  |apples|Apple|  to grow orchards which they planted in their hundreds. Each group brought foods and ideas from their respective regions.     Settlers from Ireland and Scotland were well known for creating  |peatreak|Peatreek|  and  |poitín|Poitín| , strong hard liquor based on fermenting potatoes or barley. In time they came up with a method for distilling a corn mash with  |added_sugar|Added_Sugar|  and aging in charred barrels made of select hardwoods, which created a whiskey with a high proof. This gave birth to  |American_whiskey|American_Whiskey|  and  |Kentucky_bourbon|Kentucky_Bourbon| , and its cousins  |moonshine|Moonshine|  and  |Everclear|Everclear| .     Closer to the coast, 18th-century recipes for English  |trifle|Trifle|  turned into  |tipsy_cakes|Tipsy_Cake| , replacing the sherry with whiskey and their recipe for  |pound_cake|Pound_Cake| , brought to the South around the same time, still works with American baking units: 1 pound sugar, one pound eggs, one pound butter, one pound flour.       Pork is the popular choice in 80% of Southern style barbecue and features in other preparations like sausages and sandwiches. For most Southerners in the  |antebellum_period|History_Of_The_Southern_United_Statesantebellum_Era| , corn and pork were staples of the diet.  |Country_sausage|Country_Sausage|  is an ingredient in the Southern breakfast dish of  |biscuits_and_gravy|Biscuits_And_Gravy| .  |Country_ham|Country_Ham|  is often served for breakfast and cured with salt or sugar and hickory-smoked.  Accompanying many meals is the southern style fluffy  |biscuit|Biscuit| , where the leavening agent is  |baking_soda|Sodium_Bicarbonate|  and often includes  |buttermilk|Buttermilk| , and for breakfast they often accompany country ham, grits, and scrambled eggs.       Desserts in the South tend to be quite rich and very much a legacy of entertaining to impress guests, since a Southern housewife was expected to show her hospitality by laying out as impressive a banquet as she is able to manage.  Desserts are vast and encompass  |Lane_cake|Lane_Cake| ,  |sweet_potato_pie|Sweet_Potato_Pie| ,  |peach_cobbler|Peach_Cobbler| ,  |pecan_pie|Pecan_Pie| ,  |hummingbird_cake|Hummingbird_Cake| ,  |Jefferson_Davis_pie|Jefferson_Davis_Pie| ,  |peanut_brittle|Peanut_Brittle| ,  |coconut_cake|Coconut_Cake| ,  |apple_fritters|Fritter| , peanut cookies,  |Moravian_spice_cookies|Moravian_Spice_Cookies| ,  |chess_pie|Chess_Pie| ,  |doberge_cake|Doberge_Cake| ,  |Lady_Baltimore_cake|Lady_Baltimore_Cake| ,  |bourbon_balls|Bourbon_Ball| , and  |caramel_cake|Caramel_Cake| . American style sponge cakes tend to be the rule rather than the exception as is American style buttercream, a place where Southern baking intersects with the rest of the United States. Nuts like pecan and hickory tend to be revered as garnishes for these desserts, and make their way into local bakeries as fillings for chocolates.          In Louisiana, cooking methods have more in common with rustic French cuisines of the 17th and 18th century than anything ever found at the French court in Versailles or the bistros of 19th- and 20th-century Paris; this is especially true of  |Cajun_cuisine|Cajun_Cuisine| .      |Cajun_French|Cajun_French|  is more closely related to dialects spoken in Northern  |Maine|Maine| ,  |New_Brunswick|New_Brunswick| , and to a lesser degree  |Haiti|Haiti|  than anything spoken in modern France, and likewise their terminology, methodology, and culture concerning food is much more closely related to the styles of these former French colonies even today. Unlike other areas of the South, Cajuns were and still are largely Catholics and thus much of what they eat is seasonal; for example pork is an important component of the Cajun boucherie but it is never consumed in the five weeks of Lent, when such would be forbidden. Cajun cuisine tends to focus on what is locally available, historically because Cajuns were often poor, illiterate, independent farmers and not plantation owners but today it is because such is deeply imbedded in local culture.  |Boudin|Boudin|  is a type of sausage found only in this area of the country, and it is often by far more spicy than anything found in France or Belgium.  |Chaudin|Chaudin|  is unique to the area, and the method of cooking is comparable to the Scottish dish haggis: the stuffing includes onions, rice, bell peppers, spices, and pork sewn up in the stomach of a pig, and served in slices piping hot.  |Crayfish|Procambarus_Clarkii|  are a staple of the Cajun grandmothers cookpot, as they are abundant in the bayous of Southern Louisiana and a main source of livelihood, as are  |blue_crabs|Blue_Crab| ,  |shrimp|Shrimp| , corn on the cob, and red potatoes, since these are the basic ingredients of the Louisiana crawfish boil.        New Orleans has been the capital of Creole culture since before Louisiana was a state; this culture is that of the colonial French and Spanish that evolved in the city of New Orleans, which was and still is quite distinct from the rural culture of Cajuns and dovetails with what would have been eaten in antebellum Louisiana plantation culture long ago. Cooking to impress and show ones wealth was a staple of Creole culture, which often mixed French, Spanish, Italian, German, African, Caribbean and Native American cooking methods, producing rich dishes like  |oysters_bienville|Oysters_Bienville| ,  |pompano_en_papillote|Pompano_En_Papillote| , and even the  |muffaletta|Muffaletta|  sandwich. However,  |Louisiana_Creole_cuisine|Louisiana_Creole_Cuisine|  tends to diverge from the original ideas brought to the region in ingredients:  |profiteroles|Profiterole| , for example, use a near identical  |choux_pastry|Choux_Pastry|  to that which is found in modern Paris but often use vanilla or chocolate ice cream rather than custard as the filling,  |pralines|Praline|  nearly always use  |pecan|Pecan|  and not almonds, and  |bananas_foster|Bananas_Foster|  came about when New Orleans was a key port for the import of bananas from the Caribbean Sea.  Gumbos tend to be thickened with  |okra|Okra| , or the leaves of the  |sassafrass_tree|Sassafras_Albidum| . Andouille is often used, but not the andouille currently known in France, since French andouille uses tripe whereas Louisiana andouille is made from a  |Boston_butt|Boston_Butt| , usually inflected with pepper flakes, and smoked for hours over pecan wood. Other ingredients that are native to Louisiana and not found in the cuisine of modern France would include rice, which has been a staple of both Creole and Cajun cooking for generations, and sugarcane, which has been grown in Louisiana since the early 1800s.         Ground cayenne pepper is a key spice of the region, as is the meat of the  |American_alligator|American_Alligator| , something settlers learned from the Choctaws and Houma. The maypop plant has been a favorite of Southerners for 350 years; it gives its name to the Ocoee River in Tennessee, a legacy of the Cherokees, and in Southern Louisiana it is known as liane de grenade, indicating its consumption by Cajuns. It is a close relative of the commercial  |passionfruit|Passiflora_Edulis| , similar in size, and is a common plant growing in gardens all over the South as a source of fresh summertime fruit.       African American influences came with slaves from  |Ghana|Ghana| ,  |Benin|Benin| ,  |Mali|Mali| ,  |Congo|Democratic_Republic_Of_The_Congo| ,  |Angola|Angola| ,  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone| ,  |Nigeria|Nigeria| , and other portions of West Africa, and the mark African Americans and their descendants have made on Southern food is extremely strong today and an essential addition to the Southern table. Crops like  |okra|Okra| ,  |sorghum|Sorghum| ,  |sesame_seeds|Sesame_Seeds| ,  |eggplant|Eggplant| , and many different kinds of  |melons|Melon|  were brought with them from West Africa along with the incredibly important introduction of rice to the  |Carolinas|Carolinas|  and later to  |Texas|Texas|  and  |Louisiana|Louisiana| , whence it became a staple grain of the region and still remains a staple today, found in dishes like  |Hoppin_John|Hoppin_John| , purloo, and  |Charleston_red_rice|Charleston_Red_Rice| . Like the poorer indentured servants that came to the South, slaves often got the leftovers of what was slaughtered for the consumption of the master of the plantation and so many recipes had to be adapted for offal, like  |pigs_ears|Pigs_Ear|  and  |fatbacks|Fatback|   though other methods encouraged low and slow methods of cooking to tenderize the tougher cuts of meat, like braising, smoking, and pit roasting, the last of which was a method known to West Africans in the preparation of roasting goat.        Certain portions of the South often have their own distinct subtypes of cuisine owing to local history and landscape, i.e.  |Cajun_cuisine|Cajun_Cuisine| , Floridian cuisine, for example, has a distinct way of cooking that includes ingredients her other Southern sisters do not use, especially points south of Tampa and Orlando. The Spanish Crown had control of the state until the early 19th century and used the southern tip as an outpost to guard the  |Spanish_Main|Spanish_Main|  beginning in the 1500s, but Florida kept and still maintains ties with the  |Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean_Sea| , including the  |Bahamas|Bahamas| |_Haiti|Haiti| ,  |Cuba|Cuba| ,  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico| , the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic| , and  |Jamaica|Jamaica| . South of Tampa, there are and have been for a long time many speakers of  |Caribbean_Spanish|Caribbean_Spanish| ,  |Haitian_French|Haitian_French| ,  |Jamaican_Patois|Jamaican_Patois| , and  |Haitian_Creole|Haitian_Creole|  and each Caribbean culture has a strong hold on cooking methods and spices in Florida. In turn, each mixes and matches with the  |foodways|Foodways|  of the Seminole tribe and Anglophone settlers. Thus, for almost 200 years, Floridian cooking has had a more tropical flavor than any other Southern state.  |Allspice|Allspice| , a spice originally from  |Jamaica|Jamaica| , is an ingredient found in spice mixes in summer barbecues along with  |ginger|Ginger| ,  |garlic|Garlic| ,  |scotch_bonnet_peppers|Scotch_Bonnet| , sea salt, and nutmeg; in Floridian cooking this is often a variant of Jamaican jerk spice. Coconuts are grown in the areas surrounding Miami and are shipped in daily through its port for consumption of the milk, meat, and water of the coconut. Bananas are not just the yellow Cavendish variety found in supermarkets across America: in Florida they are available as bananitos, colorados, plátanos, and maduros. The first of these is a tiny miniature banana only about 4-5 inches in length and it is sweet. The second has a red peel and an apple like after taste, and the third and fourth are used as a starch on nearly every Caribbean island as a side dish, baked or fried: all of the above are a staple of Florida outdoor markets when in season and all have been grown in the Caribbean for almost 400 years. Mangoes are grown as a backyard plant in Southern Florida and otherwise are a favorite treat coming in many different shapes in sizes from  Nam Doc Mai , brought to Florida after the Vietnam War, to  Madame Francis , a mango from Haiti.  |Sweetsop|Sweetsop|  and  |soursop|Soursop|  are popular around Miami, but nearly unheard of in other areas of the South.     Citrus is a major crop of Florida, and features at every breakfast table and every market with the height of the season near the first week of January. Hamlin oranges are the main cultivar planted, and from this crop the rest of the United States and to a lesser extent Europe gets orange juice. Other plantings would include  |grapefruits|Grapefruits| ,  |tangerines|Tangerine| ,  |clementine_oranges|Clementine| ,  |limes|Lime| , and even a few more rare ones, like  |cara_cara_navels|Cara_Cara_Navel| ,  |tangelos|Tangelo| , and the Jamaican  |Ugli_fruit|Ugli_Fruit| .  |Tomato|Tomato| es,  |bell_peppers|Bell_Pepper| ,  |habanero_peppers|Habanero| , and figs, especially taken from the  |Florida_strangler_fig|Ficus_Aurea| , complete the produce menu.  |Blue_crab|Blue_Crab| ,  |conch|Queen_Conch| ,  |Florida_stone_crab|Florida_Stone_Crab| ,  |red_drum|Red_Drum| ,  |dorado|Common_Dolphinfish| , and  |marlins|Marlin|  tend to be local favorite ingredients. Dairy is available in this region, but it is less emphasized due to the year round warmth. Traditional  |key_lime_pie|Key_Lime_Pie| , a dessert from the islands off the coast of Miami, is made with  |condensed_milk|Condensed_Milk|  to form the custard with the eye wateringly tart limes native to the  |Florida_Keys|Florida_Keys|  in part because milk would spoil in an age before refrigeration. Pork in this region tends to be roasted in methods similar to those found in Puerto Rico and Cuba, owing to mass emigration from those countries in the 20th century, especially in the counties surrounding Miami.  Orange blossom honey is a specialty of the state, and is widely available in farmers markets.   |Caribbean_lobster|Panulirus_Argus|  is a favorite special meal eagerly sought after by Floridians as it is found as far north as Fort Meyers: spear diving and collecting them from reefs in the Florida Keys and near rocky shoals is a common practice of local scuba divers.         |Ptarmigan|Ptarmigan| ,  |grouse|Grouse| ,  |crow|Crow|  blackbirds, dove, ducks and other game fowl are consumed in the United States. In the American state of  |Arkansas|Arkansas| ,  |beaver|American_Beaver|  tail stew is consumed in Cotton town.   |Squirrel|Tree_Squirrelin_The_Us| ,  |raccoon|Cooning| ,  |possum|Virginia_Opossum| ,  |bear|Bear| ,  |muskrat|Muskrat| ,  |chipmunk|Chipmunk| ,  |skunk|Skunk| ,  |groundhog|Groundhog| ,  |pheasant|Pheasant| ,  |armadillo|Armadillo|  and  |rabbit|Rabbit|  are also consumed in the United States.          Cooking in the American West gets its influence from Native American and Hispanophone cultures, as well as later settlers that came in the 19th century: Texas, for example, has some influence from Germany in its choice of barbecue by using sausages. Another instance can be found in the Northwestern region, which encompasses  |Oregon|Oregon| ,  |Washington|Washington| , and Northern California. All of the aforementioned rely on local seafood and a few classics of their own. In  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico| ,  |Colorado|Colorado| ,  |Nevada|Nevada| ,  |Arizona|Arizona| ,  |Utah|Utah| ,  |West_Texas|West_Texas| , and  |Southern_California|Southern_California| , Mexican flavors and influences are extremely common, especially from the Mexican states of  |Chihuahua|Chihuahua| ,  |Baja_California|Baja_California| , and  |Sonora|Sonora_Mexico| .       The Pacific Northwest as a region generally includes  |Alaska|Alaska|  and the state of Washington near the Canada–US border and terminates near  |Sacramento_California|Sacramento_California| . Here, the terrain is mostly temperate rainforest on the Coast mixed with pine forest as one approaches the Canada–US border inland. One of the core favorite foodstuffs is  |Pacific_salmon|Oncorhynchus| , native to many of the larger rivers of the area and often smoked or grilled on cedar planks. In  |Alaska|Alaska| , wild game like  |ptarmigan|Lagopus|  and  |moose|Moose|  meat feature extensively since much of the state is wilderness. Fresh fish like  |steelhead_trout|Rainbow_Trout| ,  |Pacific_cod|Pacific_Cod| ,  |Pacific_halibut|Pacific_Halibut| , and  |pollock|Pollock|  are fished for extensively and feature on the menu of many restaurants, as do a plethora of fresh berries and vegetables, like Cameo apples from  |Washington|Washington|  state, the headquarters of the U.S.  |apple|Apple|  industry,  |cherries|Cherry|  from  |Oregon|Oregon| ,  |blackberries|Blackberry| , and  |marionberries|Marionberry| , a feature of many pies.  |Hazelnuts|Hazelnut|  are grown extensively in this region and are a feature of baking, such as in chocolate hazelnut pie, an Oregon favorite,  and  |Almond_Roca|Almond_Roca|  is a local candy.     This region is also heavily dominated by some notable wineries producing a high quality product.     Like its counterpart on the opposite coast to the East, there is a grand variety of shellfish in this region.  |Geoducks|Geoduck|  are a native species of giant clam that have incredibly long necks, and they are eaten by the bucket full as well as shipped to Asia for millions of dollars as they are believed to be an  |aphrodisiac|Aphrodisiac| .  |Gaper_clams|Tresus|  are a favorite food, often grilled or steamed in a sauce, as is the native California  |abalone|Abalone| , which although protected as a food source is a traditional foodway predating settlement by whites and today features heavily in the cooking of fine restaurants as well as in home cooking, in mirin-flavored soups noodle dishes and on the barbecue.  |Olympia_oysters|Ostrea_Lurida|  are served on the half shell as well as the  |Kumamoto_oyster|Pacific_Oyster| , introduced by Japanese immigrants and a staple at dinner as an appetizer.  |California_mussels|California_Mussel|  are a delicacy of the region, and have been a feature of the cooking for generations: there is evidence that Native American tribes consumed them up and down the California coast for centuries in their masses.     Crabs are a delicacy, and included in this are  |Alaskan_king_crab|Alaskan_King_Crab| ,  |red_crab|Cancer_Productus| ,  |yellow_crab|Metacarcinus_Anthonyi| , and  |Dungeness_crab|Dungeness_Crab| . Californian and Oregonian sportsmen pursue the last three extensively using hoop nets, and prepare them in a multitude of ways. Alaska king crab, able to get up to 10  kg, is often served steamed for a whole table with lemon butter sauce or put in chunks of salad with avocado, and native crabs are the base of dishes like the  |California_roll|California_Roll| ,  |cioppino|Cioppino| , a tomato based fishermans stew, and  |Crab_Louie|Crab_Louie| , another kind of salad native to San Francisco. Favorite grains are mainly wheat, and the region is known for  |sourdough_bread|Sourdough| . Cheeses of the region include  |Humboldt_Fog|Humboldt_Fog| ,  |Cougar_Gold|Cougar_Gold_Cheese|  and  |Teleme|Teleme_Cheese| .             The states of the Four Corners  plus  |Nevada|Nevada| ,  |Southern_California|Southern_California| , and  |West_Texas|West_Texas|  make up a large chunk of the United States and there is a distinct Hispanic accent to the cookery here, with each having cultural capitals in  |Albuquerque|Albuquerque| ,  |Denver|Denver| ,  |Las_Vegas|Las_Vegas| ,  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| ,  |Phoenix|Phoenix_Arizona| ,  |Salt_Lake_City|Salt_Lake_City| ,  |Santa_Fe|Santa_Fe_New_Mexico| ,  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco_California| , and  |Tucson|Tucson_Arizona| . For centuries, prior to Californias statehood in the 1830s, it was part of the  |Spanish_Empire|Spanish_Empire| , namely  |Alta_California|Alta_California|  ,  |Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_México|Santa_Fe_De_Nuevo_México|  , and  |Tejas|Spanish_Texas|  . Today it is home of a large population of  |Native_Americans|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States| ,  |Hispanos|Hispanos| , descendants of the  |American_frontier|American_Frontier| ,  |Asian_Americans|Asian_Americans| , and immigrants from  |Mexico|Mexico|  and  |Latin_America|Latin_America| ; California, New Mexico, and Texas continue to hold their unique identities which is reflected in their distinct regional cuisines, the multiple  |cuisines_of_California|Cuisine_Of_California| ,  |New_Mexican_cuisine|New_Mexican_Cuisine| ,  |Texan_cuisine|Texan_Cuisine| , and  |Tex_Mex|Tex_Mex| .  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  is a commonly spoken secondary language here; the state of  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico|  has its own distinct  |dialect|New_Mexican_Spanish| .     With the exception of Southern California, the signature meat is  |beef|Beef| , since this is one of the two regions in which cowboys lived and modern cattle ranchers still eke out their living today.   High quality beefstock is a feature that has been present in the region for more than 200 years and the many cuts of beef are unique to the United States. These cuts of meat are different from the related Mexican cuisine over the border in that certain kind of offal, like lengua cabeza and tripas are considered less desirable and are thus less emphasized. Typical cuts would include the ribs, brisket, sirloin, flank steak, skirt steak, and t-bone.        Historically, Spanish settlers that came to the region found it completely unsuitable to the mining operations that much older settlements in  |Mexico|Mexico|  had to offer as the technology of the age was not yet advanced enough to get at the silver that would later be found in the region. They had no knowledge of the gold to be discovered in California, something nobody would find until 1848, and knew even less about the silver in Nevada, something nobody would find until after the  |Civil_War|American_Civil_War| . Instead, in order to make the pueblos prosper, they adapted the old rancho system of places like  |Andalusia|Andalusia|  in  |Spain|Spain|  and brought the earliest beefstock, among these were breeds that would go feral and become the  |Texas_longhorn|Texas_Longhorn| , and  |Navajo_Churro_sheep|Navajo_Churro_Sheep| , still used as breeding stock because they are easy to keep and well adapted to the extremely arid and hot climate, where temperatures easily exceed 38  °C.  Later, cowboys learned from their management practices, many of which still stand today, like the practical management of stock on horseback using the  |Western_saddle|Western_Saddle| .         Likewise, settlers learned the cooking methods of those who came before and local tribes as well: for example, portions of  |Arizona|Arizona|  and  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico|  still use the aforementioned beehive shaped clay contraption called an  horno , an outdoor wood fired oven both Native American tribes like the  |Navajo|Navajo_People|  and Spaniards used for roasting meat, maize, and baking bread. Green, Rayna . The British Museum Encyclopedia of Native North America. London: British Museum Press. p. 4. . Other meats that see frequent use in this region are  |elk|Cervus_Canadensis|  meat, a favorite in crown roasts and burgers, and nearer the Mexican border  |rattlesnake|Rattlesnake| , often skinned and stewed.   The taste for alcohol in this region tends toward light and clean flavors found in  |tequila|Tequila| , a staple of this region since the days of the Wild West and a staple in the bartenders arsenal for cocktails, especially in Las Vegas. In Utah, a state heavily populated by  |Mormons|Mormons| , alcohol is frowned upon by the  |Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints|Church_Of_Jesus_Christ_Of_Latter_Day_Saints|  but still available in area bars in Salt Lake City, mainly consumed by the populations of Catholics and other Protestant denominations living there.     Introduction of agriculture was limited prior to the 20th century and the development of better irrigation techniques, but included the addition of  |peach|Peach| es, a crop still celebrated by Native American tribes like the  |Havasupai|Havasupai| ,  and oranges; today in  |Arizona|Arizona| ,  |Texas|Texas| , and  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico|  the favored orange today is the Moro  |blood_orange|Blood_Orange| , which often finds its way into the local cuisine, like cakes and marmalade.    |Pine_nuts|Pine_Nut|  are a particular regional specialty and feature often in fine dining and cookies; indeed in Nevada the Native American tribes that live there are by treaty given rights to exclusive harvest.  From Native Americans, Westerners learned the practice of eating cactus fruit from the myriad species of  |opuntia|Opuntia|  that occupy the  |Chihuahuan|Chihuahuan_Desert| ,  |Sonoran|Sonoran_Desert| , and  |Mojave_desert|Mojave_Desert|  lands. In California, Spanish missionaries brought with them the  |mission_fig|Mission_Fig|    Cuisine in this region tends to have certain key ingredients:  |tomato|Tomato| es,  |onions|Onion| ,  |black_beans|Black_Turtle_Bean| ,  |pinto_beans|Pinto_Bean| ,  |rice|Rice| ,  |bell_peppers|Bell_Pepper| ,  |chile_peppers|Chile_Pepper| , and  |cheese|Cheese| , in particular  |Monterey_Jack|Monterey_Jack| , invented in Southern California in the 19th century and itself often further altered into pepper Jack where spicy  |jalapeño|Jalapeño|  peppers are incorporated into the cheese to create a smoky taste. Chili peppers play an important role in the cuisine, with a few native to the region ; these still grown by  |Hispanos_of_New_Mexico|Hispanos_Of_New_Mexico|  and  |Pueblo|Pueblo| . In New Mexico, chile is eaten on a variety of foods, such as the green chile cheeseburger, made popular by fast food chains such as  |Blakes_Lotaburger|Blakes_Lotaburger| . Indeed, even national fast food chains operating in the state, such as  |McDonalds|Mcdonalds| , offer locally grown chile on many of their menu items. In the 20th century a few more recent additions have arrived like the  |poblano_pepper|Poblano_Pepper| ,  |rocoto_pepper|Capsicum_Pubescens| ,  |ghost_pepper|Ghost_Pepper| ,  |thai_chili_pepper|Thai_Chili_Pepper| , and Korean pepper, the last three especially when discussing Southern California and its large population from East and South Asia.    |Cornbread|Cornbread|  is consumed in this area, however the recipe differs from ones in the East in that the batter is cooked in a cast iron skillet. Outdoor cooking is popular and still utilizes an old method settlers brought from the East with them, in which a cast iron  |dutch_oven|Dutch_Oven|  is covered with the coals of the fire and stacked or hung from a tripod: this is different from the earthenware pots of Mexico. Tortillas are still made the traditional way in this area and form an important component of the spicy  |breakfast_burrito|Breakfast_Burrito| , which contains ham, eggs, and salsa or  |pico_de_gallo|Pico_De_Gallo| . They also comprise the regular  |burrito|Burrito| , which contains any combination of marinated meats, vegetables, and piquant chilis; The smothered burrito, often both containing and topped with New Mexico chile sauces; the  |quesadilla|Quesadilla| , a much loved grilled dish where cheese and other ingredients are stuffed between two tortillas and served by the slice, and the steak  |fajita|Fajita| , where sliced skirt steak sizzles in a skillet with caramelized onions.        Unlike Mexico, tortillas of this region also may incorporate vegetable matter like spinach into the flatbread dough to make  |wraps|Wrap| , which were invented in Southern California. Food here tends to use pungent spices and condiments, typically chili verde sauce, various kinds of  |hot_sauce|Hot_Sauce| ,  |sriracha_sauce|Sriracha_Sauce| ,  |chili_powder|Chili_Powder| ,  |cayenne_pepper|Cayenne_Pepper| ,  |white_pepper|White_Pepper| ,  |cumin|Cumin| ,  |paprika|Paprika| ,  |onion_powder|Onion_Powder| ,  |thyme|Thyme|  and  |black_pepper|Black_Pepper| . Nowhere is this fiery mix of spice more evident than in the dishes  |chili_con_carne|Chili_Con_Carne| , a meaty stew, and  |cowboy_beans|Cowboy_Beans| , both of which are a feature of regional cookoffs. Southern California has several additions like  |five_spice_powder|Five_Spice_Powder| ,  |rosemary|Rosemary| ,  |curry_powder|Curry_Powder| ,  |kimchi|Kimchi| , and  |lemongrass|Lemongrass| , with many of these brought by recent immigration to the region and often a feature of Southern Californias fusion cuisine, popular in fine dining.     In Texas, the local barbecue is often entirely made up of beef  |brisket|Brisket|  or large rib racks, where the meat is seasoned with a  |spice_rub|Spice_Rub|  and cooked over coals of  |mesquite|Mesquite| , and in other portions of the state they smoke their meat and peppery sausages over high heat using  |pecan|Pecan| ,  |apple|Apple| , and  |oak|Oak|  and served it with a side of pickled vegetables, a legacy of German and Czech settlers of the late 1800s. California is home to  |Santa_Maria_style_barbecue|Santa_Maria_Style_Barbecue| , where the spices involved generally are  |black_pepper|Black_Pepper| ,  |paprika|Paprika| , and  |garlic_salt|Garlic_Salt| , and grilled over the coals of  |coast_live_oak|Coast_Live_Oak| .        Native American additions may include  |Navajo_frybread|Frybread|  and  |corn_on_the_cob|Corn_On_The_Cob| , often roasted on the grill in its husk. A typical accompaniment or appetizer of all these states is the tortilla chip, which sometimes includes cornmeal from cultivars of corn that are blue or red in addition to the standard yellow of sweetcorn, and is served with  |salsa|Salsa|  of varying hotness. Tortilla chips also are an ingredient in the Tex Mex dish  |nachos|Nacho| , where these chips are loaded with any combination of ground beef, melted Monterey Jack, cheddar, or Colby cheese,  |guacamole|Guacamole| ,  |sour_cream|Sour_Cream| , and salsa, and Texas usually prefers a version of  |potato_salad|Potato_Salad|  as a side dish. For alcohol, a key ingredient is  |tequila|Tequila|  and in modern cuisine it is a must have in a bartenders arsenal as well as an addition to dishes for sauteeing.      Southern California is located more towards the coast and has had more contact with immigration from the  |West_Pacific|West_Pacific|  and  |Baja_California|Baja_California| , in addition to having the international city of  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles|  as its capital. Here, the prime mode of transportation is by car. Drive through fast food was invented in this area, but so was the concept of the gourmet burger movement, giving birth to chains like  |In_and_Out_Burger|In_And_Out_Burger| , with many variations of burgers including chili, multiple patties, avocado, special sauces, and angus or wagyu beef; common accompaniments include thick milkshakes in various flavors like mint, chocolate, peanut butter, vanilla, strawberry, and mango. Smoothies are a common breakfast item made with fresh fruit juice, yogurt, and crushed ice. Agua fresca, a drink originated by Mexican immigrants, is a common hot weather beverage sold in many supermarkets and at mom and pop stands, available in citrus, watermelon, and strawberry flavors; the California version usually served chilled without grain in it.        The weather in Southern California is such that the temperature rarely drops below 12  °C in winter, thus, sun loving crops like  |pistachios|Pistachio| ,  |kiwifruit|Kiwifruit| ,  |avocado|Avocado| es,  |strawberries|Strawberry| , and  |tomato|Tomato| es are staple crops of the region, the last often dried in the sun and a feature of salads and sandwiches.  |Olive_oil|Olive_Oil|  is a staple cooking oil of the region and has been since the days of  |Junípero_Serra|Junípero_Serra| ; today the  |mission_olive|Mission_Olive|  is a common tree growing in a Southern Californians back garden; as a crop olives are increasingly a signature of the region along with  |Valencia_oranges|Valencia_Orange|  and  |Meyer_lemons|Meyer_Lemon| .  |Soybeans|Soybean| ,  |bok_choy|Bok_Choy| ,  |Japanese_persimmon|Diospyros_Kaki| ,  |thai_basil|Thai_Basil| ,  |Napa_cabbage|Napa_Cabbage| ,  |nori|Nori| ,  |mandarin_oranges|Mandarin_Orange| ,  |water_chestnuts|Water_Chestnut| , and  |mung_beans|Mung_Bean|  are other crops brought to the region from East Asia and are common additions to salads as the emphasis on fresh produce in both Southern and Northern California is strong. Other vegetables and herbs have a distinct Mediterranean flavor which would include  |oregano|Oregano| ,  |basil|Basil| ,  |summer_squash|Summer_Squash| ,  |eggplant|Eggplant| , and  |broccoli|Broccoli| , with all of the above extensively available at farmers markets all around Southern California. Naturally, salads native to Southern California tend to be hearty affairs, like  |Cobb_salad|Cobb_Salad|  and  |Chinese_chicken_salad|Chinese_Chicken_Salad| , and dressings like  |green_goddess|Green_Goddess_Dressing|  and  |ranch|Ranch_Dressing|  are a staple.  |California_style_pizza|California_Style_Pizza|  tends to have disparate ingredients with an emphasis on vegetables, with any combination of chili oil, prawns, eggs, chicken, shiitake mushrooms, olives, bell pepper, goat cheese, and feta cheese. Peanut noodles tend to include a sweet dressing with lo mein noodles and chopped peanuts.     Fresh fish and shellfish in Southern California tends to be expensive in restaurants, but every year since the end of WWII, the Pismo clam festival has taken place where the local population takes a  |large_species_of_clam|Pismo_Clam|  and bakes, stuffs, and roasts it as it is a regional delicacy.   Fishing for pacific species of octopus and the  |Humboldt_squid|Humboldt_Squid|  are common, and both are a feature of East Asian and other L.A. fish markets.     |Lingcod|Lingcod|  is a coveted regional fish that is often caught in the autumn off the coast of  |San_Diego|San_Diego|  and in the  |Channel_Islands|Channel_Islands_California|  and often served baked.  |California_sheephead|California_Sheephead|  are often grilled and are much sought after by spear fishermen and the immigrant Chinese population, in which case it is basket steamed. Most revered of all in recent years is the  |California_spiny_lobster|California_Spiny_Lobster| , a beast that can grow to be 20  kg, and is a delicacy that now rivals the fishery for Dungeness crab in its importance.              Hawaii is often considered to be one of the most culturally diverse U.S. states, as well as being the only state with an Asian majority population and being one of the few places where United States territory extends into the tropics. As a result,  |Hawaiian_cuisine|Hawaii_Regional_Cuisine|  borrows elements of a variety of cuisines, particularly those of Asian and Pacific-rim cultures, as well as traditional native Hawaiian and a few additions from the American mainland. American influence of the last 150 years has brought cattle, goats, and sheep to the islands, introducing cheese, butter, and yogurt products, as well as crops like  |red_cabbage|Red_Cabbage| . Just to name a few, major Asian and Polynesian influences on modern Hawaiian cuisine are from  |Japan|Japan| ,  |Korea|Korea| ,  |Vietnam|Vietnam| ,  |China|China| |_Samoa|Samoa| , and the  |Philippines|Philippines| . From Japan, the concept of serving raw fish as a meal with rice was introduced, as was soft tofu, setting the stage for the popular dish called  |poke_|Poke|  From Korea, immigrants to Hawaii brought a love of spicy garlic marinades for meat and  |kimchi|Kimchi| . From China, their version of  |char_siu_baau|Char_Siu_Baau|  became modern  |manapua|Manapua| , a type of steamed pork bun with a spicy filling.  Filipinos brought vinegar,  |bagoong|Bagoong| , and  |lumpia|Lumpia| , and during the 20th century immigrants from  |American_Samoa|American_Samoa|  brought the open pit fire  |umu|Earth_Oven|   and the Vietnamese introduced  |lemongrass|Lemongrass|  and  |fish_sauce|Fish_Sauce| . Each East Asian culture brought several different kinds of noodles, including  |udon|Udon| ,  |ramen|Ramen| ,  |mei_fun|Mei_Fun| , and  |pho|Pho| , and today these are common lunchtime meals.      Much of this cuisine mixes and melts into traditions like the  |luau|Luau| , whose traditional elaborate fare was once the prerogative of kings and queens but today is the subject of parties for both tourists and also private parties for the ‘ohana Traditionally, women and men ate separately under the Hawaiian  kapu  system, a system of religious beliefs that honored the Hawaiian gods similar to the  |Maori|Māori_People|  tapu system, though in this case had some specific prohibitions towards females eating things like coconut, pork, turtle meat, and bananas as these were considered parts of the male gods. Punishment for violation could be severe, as a woman might endanger a mans mana, or soul, by eating with him or otherwise by eating the forbidden food because doing so dishonored all the male gods. As the system broke down after 1810, introductions of foods from laborers on plantations began to be included at feasts and much cross pollination occurred, where Asian foodstuffs mixed with Polynesian foodstuffs like  |breadfruit|Breadfruit| ,  |kukui_nuts|Aleurites_Moluccanus| , and purple  |sweet_potato|Sweet_Potato| es.     Some notable Hawaiian fare includes seared ahi tuna, opakapaka with passionfruit, Hawaiian island-raised lamb, beef and meat products, Hawaiian  |plate_lunch|Plate_Lunch| , and Molokai shrimp. Seafood traditionally is caught fresh in Hawaiian waters, and particular delicacies are  |ula_poni|Panulirus_Marginatus| ,  |papaikualoa|Kona_Crab| ,  |‘opihi|Cellana| , and  |‘opihi_malihini|Haliotis_Discus| , better known as Hawaiian spiny lobster, Kona crab, Hawaiian limpet, and abalone, the last brought over with Japanese immigrants.  Some cuisine also incorporates a broad variety of produce and locally grown agricultural products, including  |tomato|Tomato| es, sweet Maui onions, taro, and macadamia nuts. Tropical fruits equally play an important role in the cuisine as a flavoring in cocktails and in desserts, including local cultivars of  |bananas|Banana| ,  |sweetsop|Sweetsop| ,  |mango|Mango| es,  |lychee|Lychee| ,  |coconuts|Coconut| ,  |papayas|Papaya| , and lilikoi .  |Pineapples|Pineapple|  have been an island staple since the 19th century and figure into many marinades and drinks.         |barbecue|Barbecue| |_smoker|Smoking| |_New_York–style_pizza|New_York–Style_Pizza| |_Chicago_style_deep_dish_pizza|Chicago_Style_Pizza|  from the original  |Giordanos|Giordanos|  location                 The influence of ethnicity-specific cuisines like  |Italian_cuisine|Italian_Cuisine|  and  |Mexican_cuisine|Mexican_Cuisine|  was present in the United States by  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . There are recipes for Chilean meat pies, chicken  |chop_suey|Chop_Suey| ,  |chow_mein|Chow_Mein| , Mexican pork pastries and Italian meatballs going back to at least the 1930s, but many of the recipes were Anglicized and they appeared relatively infrequently compared to Northern European recipes. Sherrie A. Inness, Dinner roles: American women and culinary culture. p. 89 19th century cookbooks bear evidence of diverse influences with some including recipes like Indian pickle, Italian pork and various curries. 19th century literature shows knowledge of  |Jewish|Jewish_Cuisine| ,  |Russian|Russian_Cuisine| ,  |Italian|Italian_Cuisine| ,  |Chinese|Chinese_Cuisine|  and  |Turkish_cuisines|Turkish_Cuisine| , and foreign cookbooks continued to grow more detailed through World War I including recipes like Peruvian chicken, Mexican  |enchiladas|Enchilada| , Chilean  |corn_pudding|Corn_Pudding|  and Hindustan chicken curry. Sherrie A. Inness, Dinner roles: American women and culinary culture. p. 92     Louise Rice, author of Dainty Dishes from Foreign Lands describes the recipes in her book as not wholly vegetarian though noting at the time of publication in 1911 that most of the recipes would likely be new to average American cooks and likely contain higher proportions of vegetables to meat. She includes Italian pasta recipes like  |macaroni_in_milk|Macaroni_In_Milk| , soups and  |polentas|Polenta|  and German recipes like liver  |dumplings|Dumpling|  called  Leberknödel  and a variation of  |Sauerbraten|Sauerbraten| . Louise Rice, https://archive.org/details/daintydishesfrom00rice/page/n6 Dainty Dishes From Foreign Lands, p.7-34     The demand for ethnic foods in the United States reflects the nations changing diversity as well as its development over time. According to the  |National_Restaurant_Association|National_Restaurant_Association| ,   Restaurant industry sales are expected to reach a record high of $476 billion in 2005, an increase of 4.9 percent over 2004... Driven by consumer demand, the ethnic food market reached record sales in 2002, and has emerged as the fastest growing category in the food and beverage product sector, according to USBX Advisory Services. Minorities in the U.S. spend a combined $142 billion on food and by 2010, Americas ethnic population is expected to grow by 40 percent.  .       A movement began during the 1980s among popular leading chefs to reclaim Americas ethnic foods within its regional traditions, where these trends originated. One of the earliest was  |Paul_Prudhomme|Paul_Prudhomme| , who in 1984 began the introduction of his influential cookbook, Paul Prodhommes Louisiana Kitchen, by describing the over 200-year history of  |Creole|Louisiana_Creole_Cuisine|  and Cajun cooking; he aims to preserve and expand the Louisiana tradition.  n.p. Prodhommes success quickly inspired other chefs. Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his Feast of Sunlight cookbook in 1988. California became swept up in the movement, then seemingly started to lead the trend itself, in, for example, the popular restaurant  |Chez_Panisse|Chez_Panisse|  in Berkeley. Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon, chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine, were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and  |Wolfgang_Puck|Wolfgang_Puck| , both former colleagues at the restaurant. Puck went on to describe his belief in contemporary, new style American cuisine in the introduction to The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook n.p.       Pucks former colleague, Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with  |California_Cuisine|California_Cuisine|  and the overall American  |culinary_revolution|Culinary_Revolution| . Meanwhile, the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a distinguished establishment, popularizing its so called mantra in its book by  |Paul_Bertolli|Paul_Bertolli|  and owner  |Alice_Waters|Alice_Waters| , Chez Panisse Cooking, in 1988. Published well after the restaurants founding in 1971, this new cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy that had developed over the years. The book embraced Americas natural bounty, specifically that of California, while containing recipes that reflected Bertoli and Waters appreciation of both northern Italian and French style foods.          While the earliest cuisine of the United States was influenced by  |Native_Americans|Native_American_Cuisine| , the  |thirteen_colonies|Cuisine_Of_The_Thirteen_Colonies| , or the  |antebellum_South|Cuisine_Of_Antebellum_America| ; the overall culture of the nation, its  |gastronomy|Gastronomy|  and the growing  |culinary_arts|Culinary_Arts|  became ever more influenced by its changing  |ethnic|Ethnic|  mix and  |immigrant|Immigrant|  patterns from the 18th and 19th centuries unto the present.

These three cuisines have become so ingrained in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate. According to the study, more than nine out of 10 consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods, and about half report eating them frequently. The research also indicates that Italian, Mexican and Chinese have become so adapted to such an extent that authenticity is no longer a concern to customers.

Contributions from these ethnic foods have become as common as traditional American fares such as hot dogs, hamburgers, beef  |steak|Steak| , which are derived from  |German_cuisine|German_Cuisine| , , cherry pie,  |Coca_Cola|Coca_Cola| ,  |milkshakes|Milkshake| , fried chicken  and so on.

American cooking has been exported around the world, both through the global expansion of restaurant chains such as  |T_G_I_Fridays|T_G_I_Fridays|  and  |McDonalds|Mcdonalds|  and the efforts of individual restaurateurs such as Bob Payton, credited with bringing American-style pizza to the UK.      The first generation of television chefs such as  |Robert_Carrier|Robert_Carrier|  and  |Julia_Child|Julia_Child|  tended to concentrate on cooking based primarily on European, especially French and Italian, cuisines. Only during the 1970s and 1980s did television chefs such as  |James_Beard|James_Beard|  and  |Jeff_Smith|Jeff_Smith|  shift the focus towards home-grown cooking styles, particularly those of the different ethnic groups within the nation.
