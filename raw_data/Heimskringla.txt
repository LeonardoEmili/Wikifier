      Heimskringla  is the best known of the Old Norse  |kings_sagas|Kings_Sagas| . It was written in  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse|  in  |Iceland|Iceland|  by the poet and historian  |Snorri_Sturluson|Snorri_Sturluson|   1230. The name Heimskringla was first used in the 17th century, derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts .     Heimskringla is a collection of  |sagas|Saga|  about Swedish and Norwegian  |kings|King| , beginning with the saga of the legendary Swedish dynasty of the  |Ynglings|Yngling| , followed by accounts of historical Norwegian rulers from  |Harald_Fairhair|Harald_Fairhair|  of the 9th century up to the death of the pretender  |Eystein_Meyla|Eystein_Meyla|  in 1177. The exact sources of his work are disputed, but included earlier kings sagas, such as  |Morkinskinna|Morkinskinna| ,  |Fagrskinna|Fagrskinna|  and the twelfth century Norwegian synoptic histories and oral traditions, notably many  |skald|Skald| ic poems. Snorri had himself visited Norway and Sweden. For events of the mid-12th century, Snorri explicitly names the now-lost work  Hryggjarstykki  as his source. The composition of the sagas is Snorris.       The name Heimskringla comes from the fact that the first words of the first saga in the compilation  are Kringla heimsins, the orb of the Earth . Geir T. Zoëga, A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic , s.vv. http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h249.php kringla, disk, circle, orb and heimr.       The earliest parchment copy of the work is referred to as Kringla, now catalogued as Reykjavík, National Library, Lbs fragm 82. This is now a single vellum leaf from c. 1260; the rest of the manuscript was lost to fire in 1728. .          Heimskringla consists of several sagas, often thought of as falling into three groups, giving the overall work the character of a  |triptych|Triptych| . Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols ,  . The saga narrates the contests of the kings, the establishment of the kingdom of Norway,  |Viking|Vikings|  expeditions to various European countries, ranging as far afield as  |Palestine|Palestine|  in the saga of  |Sigurd_the_Crusader|Sigurd_The_Crusader| . The stories are told with a life and freshness, giving a picture of human life in all its reality. The saga is a prose epic, relevant to the history not only of Scandinavia but the regions included in the wider medieval  |Scandinavian_diaspora|Viking_Expansion| . The first part of the Heimskringla is rooted in  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| ; as the collection proceeds, fable and fact intermingle, but the accounts become increasingly historically reliable.     The first section tells of the mythological prehistory of the Norwegian royal dynasty, tracing  |Odin|Odin| , described here as a mortal man, and his followers from the East, from Asaland and  |Asgard|Asgard| , its chief city, to their settlement in  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia|  . The subsequent sagas are devoted to individual rulers, starting with  |Halfdan_the_Black|Halfdan_The_Black| .     A version of  Óláfs saga helga , about the saint  |Olaf_II_of_Norway|Olaf_Ii_Of_Norway| , is the main and central part of the collection: Olafs 15-year-long reign takes up about one third of the entire work.     Thereafter, the saga of  |Harald_Hardrada|Harald_Hardrada|  narrates Haralds expedition to the East, his brilliant exploits in  |Constantinople|Constantinople| ,  |Syria|Syria| , and  |Sicily|Sicily| , his skaldic accomplishments, and his battles in England against  |Harold_Godwinson|Harold_Godwinson| , the son of  |Godwin,_Earl_of_Wessex|Godwin,_Earl_Of_Wessex| , where he fell at the battle  |Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge|Battle_Of_Stamford_Bridge|  in 1066 only a few days before Harold fell at the  |Battle_of_Hastings|Battle_Of_Hastings| . After presenting a series of other kinds, the saga ends with  |Magnus_V_of_Norway|Magnus_V_Of_Norway| .        Heimskringla contains the following sagas  Ynglinga saga    Saga of  |Halfdanr_svarti|Halfdan_The_Black|    Saga of  |Haraldr_hárfagi|Harald_I_Of_Norway|    Saga of  |Hákon_góði|Haakon_I_Of_Norway|    Saga of King  |Haraldr_gráfeldr|Harald_Ii_Of_Norway| |Saga_of_King_Óláfr_Tryggvason|Óláfs_Saga_Tryggvasonar| |Saga_of_King_Óláfr_Haraldsson|Óláfs_Saga_Helga|  , excerpt from conversion of Dale-Gudbrand    Saga of  |Magnús_góði|Magnus_The_Good|    Saga of  |Haraldr_harðráði|Harald_Iii_Of_Norway|    Saga of  |Óláfr_Haraldsson_kyrri|Olaf_Iii_Of_Norway|    Saga of  |Magnús_berfœttr|Magnus_Barefoot|    Saga of  |Sigurðr_Jórsalafari|Sigurd_Jorsalfar|  and his brothers   Saga of  |Magnús_blindi|Magnus_Iv_Of_Norway|  and of  |Haraldr_Gilli|Harald_Gilli|    Saga of  |Sigurðr|Sigurd_Haraldson|  ,  |Eysteinn|Eystein_Haraldson|  and  |Ingi|Inge_Haraldson|  , the sons of Haraldr   Saga of  |Hákon_herðibreiðs|Hakon_Ii_Of_Norway|    Saga of  |Magnús_Erlingsson|Magnus_V_Of_Norway|          Snorri explicitly mentions a few prose sources, now mostly lost in the form that he knew them:  Hryggjarstykki  by Eiríkr Oddsson ,  Skjǫldunga saga , an unidentified saga about Knútr inn gamli, and a text called Jarlasǫgurnar . Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols ,  .     Snorri may have had access to a wide range of the early Scandinavian historical texts known today as the synoptic histories, but made most use of: Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols ,  .    Ágrip af Nóregs konunga sǫgum  .    Morkinskinna  .   Possibly  Fagrskinna , itself based on Morkinskinna, but the much shorter.   His own  Separate saga of St Óláfr , which he incorporated bodily into Heimskringla. This text was apparently based primarily on a saga of Olaf from about 1220 by Styrmir Kárason, now mostly lost.    |Oddr_Snorrasons|Oddr_Snorrason|  Life of Óláfr Tryggvason, and possibly a Latin life of the same figure by  |Gunnlaugr_Leifsson|Gunnlaugr_Leifsson| .     Snorri also made extensive use of  |skaldic_verse|Skaldic_Verse|  which he believed to have been composed at the time of the events portrayed and transmitted orally from that time onwards, and clearly made use of other oral accounts, though it is uncertain to what extent. Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols ,  .         Up until the mid-19th century, historians put great trust in the factual truth of Snorris narrative, as well as other old Norse sagas. In the early 20th century, this trust was largely abandoned with the advent of saga criticism, pioneered by  |Lauritz|Lauritz_Weibull|  and  |Curt_Weibull|Curt_Weibull| . These historians pointed out that Snorris work had been written several centuries after most of the events it describes. In Norway, the historian  |Edvard_Bull|Edvard_Bull,_Sr.|  famously proclaimed that we have to give up all illusions that Snorris mighty epic bears any deeper resemblance to what actually happened in the time it describes. Edvard Bull, Det norske folks liv og historie gjennom tidene bd. 2 A school of historians has come to believe that the motives Snorri and the other saga writers give to their characters owe more to conditions in the 13th century than in earlier times.     Heimskringla has, however, continued to be used as a historical source, though with more caution. It is not common to believe in the detailed accuracy of the historical narrative and historians tend to see little to no historical truth behind the first few sagas, however, they are still seen by many as a valuable source of knowledge about the society and politics of medieval Norway. e.g. Sverre Bagge, Society and Politics in Snorri Sturlusons Heimskringla . The factual content of the work tends to be deemed more credible where it discusses more recent times, as the distance in time between the events described and the composition of the saga was shorter, allowing traditions to be retained in a largely accurate form, and because in the twelfth century the first contemporary written sources begin to emerge in Norway.       Whereas prior to Heimskringla there seems to have been a diversity of efforts to write histories of kings, Snorris Heimskringla seems thereafter to have been the basis for Icelandic writing about Scandinavian kings, and was expanded by scribes rather than entirely revised.  Flateyjarbók , from the end of the fourteenth century, is the most extreme example of expansion, interweaving Snorris text with many þættir and other whole sagas, prominently Orkneyinga saga, Færeyinga saga, and Fóstbrœðra saga. Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols ,  .     The text is also referenced in  Journey to the Center of the Earth  by  |Jules_Verne|Jules_Verne| ; the work is the one Professor Liedenbrock finds Arne Saknussems note in.         By the mid-16th century, the Old Norse language was unintelligible to Norwegian, Swedish or Danish readers. At that time several translations of extracts were made in Norway into the Danish language, which was the literary language of Norway at the time. The first complete translation was made around 1600 by Peder Claussøn Friis, and printed in 1633. This was based on a manuscript known as Jofraskinna.     Subsequently, the Stockholm manuscript was translated into Swedish and Latin by  |Johan_Peringskiöld|Johan_Peringskiöld|   and published in 1697 at Stockholm under the title Heimskringla, which is the first known use of the name. This edition also included the first printing of the text in Old Norse. A new Danish translation with the text in Old Norse and a Latin translation came out in 1777–83 . An English translation by  |Samuel_Laing|Samuel_Laing|  was finally published in 1844, with a second edition in 1889. Other English translations followed.     In the 19th century, as Norway was achieving independence after centuries of union with Denmark and Sweden, the stories of the independent Norwegian medieval kingdom won great popularity in Norway. Heimskringla, although written by an Icelander, became an important national symbol for Norway during the period of  |romantic_nationalism|Romantic_Nationalism| .  In 1900, the Norwegian parliament, the  |Storting|Stortinget| , subsidized the publication of new translations of Heimskringla into both Norwegian written forms,  |landsmål|Nynorsk|  and  |riksmål|Bokmål| , in order that the work may achieve wide distribution at a low price .  forat verket ved en lav pris kan faa almindelig udbredelse .
