            Fritz Reuter Leiber Jr. was an American writer of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. He was also a poet, actor in theater and films, playwright and  |chess_expert|Chess_Expert| . With writers such as  |Robert_E._Howard|Robert_E._Howard|  and  |Michael_Moorcock|Michael_Moorcock| , Leiber can be regarded as one of the fathers of  |sword_and_sorcery|Sword_And_Sorcery|  fantasy, having coined the term.         Fritz Leiber was born December 24, 1910, in  |Chicago,_Illinois|Chicago,_Illinois| , to the actors  |Fritz_Leiber|Fritz_Leiber|  and Virginia Bronson Leiber. For a time, he seemed inclined to follow in his parents footsteps; the theater and actors are prominently featured in his fiction. He spent 1928 touring with his parents  |Shakespeare|Shakespeare|  company before entering the  |University_of_Chicago|University_Of_Chicago| , where he was elected to  |Phi_Beta_Kappa|Phi_Beta_Kappa|  and received an undergraduate  |Ph.B.|Ph.B.|  degree in  |psychology|Psychology|  and  |physiology|Physiology|   or  |biology|Biology|   with honors in 1932. From 1932 to 1933, he worked as a  |lay_reader|Lay_Reader|  and studied as a candidate for the ministry at the  |General_Theological_Seminary|General_Theological_Seminary|  in  |Chelsea,_Manhattan|Chelsea,_Manhattan| , an affiliate of the  |Episcopal_Church|Episcopal_Church| , without taking a degree.     After pursuing graduate studies in  |philosophy|Philosophy|  at the University of Chicago from 1933 to 1934 and failing once more to take a degree, he remained based in Chicago while touring intermittently with his parents company and pursuing a concurrent literary career; six short stories in the 2010 collection Strange Wonders: A Collection of Rare Fritz Leiber Works carry 1934 and 1935 dates. He also appeared alongside his father in uncredited parts in several films, including  |George_Cukors|George_Cukor|   Camille  ,  |James_Whales|James_Whale|   The Great Garrick  and  |William_Dieterles|William_Dieterle|   The Hunchback of Notre Dame  .     In 1936, he initiated a brief yet intense correspondence with  |H.P._Lovecraft|H.P._Lovecraft| , who encouraged and influenced literary development before succumbing to  |small_intestine_cancer|Small_Intestine_Cancer|  and  |malnutrition|Malnutrition|  in March 1937.  Leiber introduced  |Fafhrd_and_the_Gray_Mouser|Fafhrd_And_The_Gray_Mouser|  in Two Sought Adventure , his first professionally published short story in the August 1939 edition of  Unknown , edited by  |John_W._Campbell|John_W._Campbell| . Anderson, Poul , The Wizard of Nehwon , The Best of Fritz Leiber, NY: Doubleday, pp. vii–xv.     Leiber married Jonquil Stephens on January 16, 1936; their only child, the philosopher and science fiction writer  |Justin_Leiber|Justin_Leiber| , was born in 1938. From 1937 to 1941, he was employed by Consolidated Book Publishing as a staff writer for the Standard American Encyclopedia. In 1941, the family moved to California, where Leiber served as a speech and drama instructor at  |Occidental_College|Occidental_College|  during the 1941–1942 academic year.     Unable to conceal his disdain for academic politics as the United States entered  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , he decided that the struggle against  |fascism|Fascism|  was more important than his long-held  |pacifist|Pacifist|  convictions. He accepted a position with  |Douglas_Aircraft|Douglas_Aircraft|  in quality inspection, primarily working on the  |C-47_Skytrain|C-47_Skytrain| ; throughout the war, he continued to regularly publish fiction in a variety of periodicals.     Thereafter, the family returned to Chicago, where Leiber served as associate editor of  Science Digest  from 1945 to 1956. During this decade , his output  was characterized by  |Poul_Anderson|Poul_Anderson|  as a lot of the best science fiction and fantasy in the business. In 1958, the Leibers returned to Los Angeles. By this juncture, he was able to relinquish his journalistic career and support his family as a full-time fiction writer.     Jonquils death in 1969 precipitated Leibers permanent relocation to  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco|  and exacerbated his longstanding  |alcoholism|Alcoholism|  after twelve years of fellowship in  |Alcoholics_Anonymous|Alcoholics_Anonymous| ; however, he would gradually regain relative sobriety  over the next two decades.  In 1977, he returned to his original form with a fantasy novel set in modern-day San Francisco,  Our Lady of Darkness , which is about a writer of weird tales who must deal with the death of his wife and his recovery from alcoholism.     Perhaps as a result of his substance abuse, Leiber seems to have suffered periods of penury in the 1970s;  |Harlan_Ellison|Harlan_Ellison|  wrote of his anger at finding that the much-awarded Leiber had to write his novels on a manual typewriter that was propped up over the sink in his apartment, and  |Marc_Laidlaw|Marc_Laidlaw|  wrote that, when visiting Leiber as a fan in 1976, he was shocked to find him occupying one small room of a seedy San Francisco residence hotel, its squalor relieved mainly by walls of books . Laidlaw, Marc, On Our Lady of Darkness, in the anthology Horror: Another 100 Best Books, edited by Stephen Jones and Kim Newman, Carroll & Graf, 2005. Other reports suggest that Leiber preferred to live simply in the city, spending his money on dining, movies and travel. In the last years of his life, royalty checks from  |TSR,_Inc.|Tsr,_Inc.|   were enough in themselves to ensure that he lived comfortably.      In 1992, the last year of his life, Leiber married his second wife, Margo Skinner, a journalist and poet with whom he had been friends for many years.     Leibers death occurred a few weeks after a physical collapse while traveling from a science fiction convention in  |London,_Ontario|London,_Ontario| , with Skinner. The cause of his death was stated by his wife to be stroke.      He wrote a 100-page-plus memoir, Not Much Disorder and Not So Early Sex, which can be found in The Ghost Light .      Leibers own literary criticism, including several essays on Lovecraft, was collected in the volume Fafhrd and Me .             As the child of two  |Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare| an actors— |Fritz_Sr.|Fritz_Leiber_Sr.|  and Virginia —Leiber was fascinated with the stage, describing itinerant Shakespearean companies in stories like No Great Magic and Four Ghosts in Hamlet, and creating an actor/producer protagonist for his novel  A Specter is Haunting Texas .     Although his Change War novel,  The Big Time , is about a war between two factions, the Snakes and the Spiders , changing and rechanging history throughout the universe, all the action takes place in a small bubble of isolated  |space-time|Space-Time|  about the size of a theatrical stage, with only a handful of characters.  |Judith_Merril|Judith_Merril|   remarks on Leibers acting skills when the writer won a science fiction convention costume ball. Leibers costume consisted of a cardboard military collar over turned-up jacket lapels, cardboard insignia, an armband, and a spider pencilled large in black on his forehead, thus turning him into an officer of the Spiders, one of the combatants in his Change War stories. The only other component, Merril writes, was the Leiber instinct for theatre.         Due to the similarity of the names of the father and the son, some filmographies incorrectly attribute to Fritz Jr. roles which were in fact played by his father, Fritz Leiber Sr., who was the evil Inquisitor in the Errol Flynn adventure film  The Sea Hawk  and had played in many other movies from 1917 onwards until the late 1950s. It is the elder Leiber, not the younger, who appears in the Vincent Price vehicle  The Web  and in Charlie Chaplins  Monsieur Verdoux  .     In the cult horror film  Equinox  directed by  |Dennis_Muren|Dennis_Muren|  and Jack Woods, Leiber has a cameo appearance as Dr. Watermann, a geologist. In the edited second version of the movie Leiber has no spoken dialogue in the film but features in a few scenes. The original version of the movie has a longer appearance by Leiber recounting the ancient book and a brief speaking role, all of which was cut from the re-release of the film.     He also appears in the 1979 Schick Sunn Classics documentary The Bermuda Triangle, based on the book by  |Charles_Berlitz|Charles_Berlitz| , as Chavez.                                             Leiber was heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft and  |Robert_Graves|Robert_Graves|  in the first two decades of his career. Beginning in the late 1950s, he was increasingly influenced by the works of  |Carl_Jung|Carl_Jung| , particularly by the concepts of the  |anima|Anima|  and the  |shadow|Shadow| . From the mid-1960s onwards, he began incorporating elements of Joseph Campbells  The Hero with a Thousand Faces . These concepts are often openly mentioned in his stories, especially the anima, which becomes a method of exploring his fascination with, but estrangement from, the female.     Leiber liked cats, which feature prominently in many of his stories. Tigerishka, for example, is a  |cat-like_alien|Cat-Like_Aliens|  who is sexually attractive to the human protagonist yet repelled by human customs in the novel The Wanderer. Leibers Gummitch stories feature a kitten with an I.Q. of 160, just waiting for his ritual cup of coffee so that he can become human, too.     His first stories in the 1930s and 40s were inspired by Lovecrafts  |Cthulhu_Mythos|Cthulhu_Mythos| . The leading critic and historian of the wider Mythos, S. T. Joshi, has singled out Leibers The Sunken Land  as perhaps the most accomplished of the early stories based on Lovecrafts Mythos. S. T. Joshi, Cthulhus Empire: H. P. Lovecrafts Influence on His Contemporaries and Successors , Critical Insights: Pulp Fiction of the 1920s and 1930s, Salem Press, 2013. Leiber also later wrote several essays on Lovecraft the man, such as A Literary Copernicus , the publication of which formed a key moment in the emergence of a serious critical appreciation of Lovecrafts life and work.     Leibers first professional sale was Two Sought Adventure ,  which introduced his most famous characters, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. In 1943, his first two novels were serialized in Unknown  and  Astounding Science Fiction  .     1947 marked the publication of his first book,  Nights Black Agents , a short story collection containing seven stories grouped as Modern Horrors, one as a Transition, and two grouped as Ancient Adventures: The Sunken Land and Adepts Gambit , which are both stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.     Book publication of the science fiction novel Gather, Darkness followed in 1950. It deals with a futuristic world that follows the Second Atomic Age which is ruled by scientists, until in the throes of a new Dark Age, the witches revolt.     In 1951, Leiber was Guest of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention in New Orleans. Further novels followed during the 1950s, and in 1958  The Big Time  won the  |Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Novel| .     Leiber published further books in the 1960s. His novel  The Wanderer  also received the Hugo for Best Novel. In the novel, an artificial planet, quickly nicknamed the Wanderer, materializes from hyperspace within earths orbit. The Wanderers gravitational field captures the moon and shatters it into something like one of Saturns rings. On Earth, the Wanderers gravity well triggers massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and tidal phenomena. The multi-threaded plot follows the exploits of a large ensemble cast as they struggle to survive the global disaster.     Leiber received the  |Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novella|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Novella|  in 1970 and 1971 for Ship of Shadows and  |Ill_Met_in_Lankhmar|Ill_Met_In_Lankhmar|  .  |Gonna_Roll_the_Bones|Gonna_Roll_The_Bones|  , his contribution to Harlan Ellisons  Dangerous Visions  anthology, received the  |Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novelette|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Novelette|  and the  |Nebula_Award_for_Best_Novelette|Nebula_Award_For_Best_Novelette|  in 1968.     Our Lady of Darkness —originally serialized in short form in  The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction  under the title The Pale Brown Thing —featured cities as the breeding grounds for new types of  |elementals|Elemental|  called paramentals, summonable by the dark art of  |megapolisomancy|Megapolisomancy| , with such activities centering on the  |Transamerica_Pyramid|Transamerica_Pyramid| . Its main characters include Franz Westen, Jaime Donaldus Byers, and the magician Thibault de Castries. Our Lady of Darkness won the  |World_Fantasy_Award—Novel|World_Fantasy_Award—Novel| .     Leiber also did the 1966 novelization of the  |Clair_Huffaker|Clair_Huffaker|  screenplay of  Tarzan and the Valley of Gold .      Many of Leibers most-acclaimed works are short stories, especially in the horror genre. Owing to such stories as The Smoke Ghost , The Girl With the Hungry Eyes and Youre All Alone , he is widely regarded as one of the forerunners of the modern urban horror story. Leiber also challenged the conventions of science fiction through reflexive narratives such as A Bad Day For Sales , in which the protagonist, Robie, America’s only genuine mobile salesrobot, Leiber, Fritz. A Bad Day For Sales . Sense of Wonder: A Century of Science Fiction. Ed. 1. Leigh Ronald Grossman. Wildside Press, 2011. 422. Print. references the title character of Isaac Asimov’s idealistic robot story, Robbie . Grossman, Leigh R. Ed. Sense of Wonder: A Century of Science Fiction. 1. Wildside Press, 2011. 421. Print. Questioning Isaac Asimov’s  |Three_Laws_of_Robotics|Three_Laws_Of_Robotics| , Leiber imagines the futility of automatons in a post-apocalyptic New York City. In his later years, Leiber returned to short story horror in such works as Horrible Imaginings , Black Has Its Charms and the award-winning The Button Moulder .       The short  |parallel_worlds|Parallel_Universe|  story  |Catch_That_Zeppelin!|Catch_That_Zeppelin!|  received the  |Hugo_Award_for_Best_Short_Story|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Short_Story|  and the  |Nebula_Award_for_Best_Short_Story|Nebula_Award_For_Best_Short_Story|  in 1976. This story shows a plausible alternate reality that is much better than our own, whereas the typical parallel universe story depicts a world that is much worse than our own. Belsen Express won the  |World_Fantasy_Award—Short_Fiction|World_Fantasy_Award—Short_Fiction| . Both stories reflect Leibers uneasy fascination with  |Nazism|Nazism| , an uneasiness compounded by his mixed feelings about his German ancestry and his philosophical pacifism during World War II.     Leiber was named the second  |Gandalf_Grand_Master|Gandalf_Award|  of Fantasy by participants in the 1975  |World_Science_Fiction_Convention|World_Science_Fiction_Convention|  , after the posthumous inaugural award to  |J._R._R._Tolkien|J._R._R._Tolkien| . Next year he won the  |World_Fantasy_Award_for_Life_Achievement|World_Fantasy_Award_For_Life_Achievement| . He was Guest of Honor at the 1979 Worldcon in Brighton, England . The  |Science_Fiction_Writers_of_America|Science_Fiction_Writers_Of_America|  made him its fifth  |SFWA_Grand_Master|Sfwa_Grand_Master|  in 1981; the  |Horror_Writers_Association|Horror_Writers_Association|  made him an inaugural winner of the  |Bram_Stoker_Award_for_Lifetime_Achievement|Bram_Stoker_Award_For_Lifetime_Achievement|  in 1988 ; and the  |Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Hall_of_Fame|Emp_Museumscience_Fiction_Hall_Of_Fame|  inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers.     Leiber was a founding member of the  |Swordsmen_and_Sorcerers_Guild_of_America|Swordsmen_And_Sorcerers_Guild_Of_America|  , a loose-knit group of  |Heroic_fantasy|Heroic_Fantasy|  authors founded in the 1960s, led by  |Lin_Carter|Lin_Carter| , with entry by fantasy credentials alone. Some works by SAGA members were published in  |Lin_Carters|Lin_Carter|   Flashing Swords!  anthologies. Leiber himself is credited with inventing the term  |sword_and_sorcery|Sword_And_Sorcery|  for the particular subgenre of epic fantasy exemplified by his Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories.     In an appreciation in the July 1969 Special Fritz Leiber Issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction,  |Judith_Merril|Judith_Merril|  writes of Leibers connection with his readers: That this kind of personal response...is shared by thousands of other readers, has been made clear on several occasions. The November 1959 issue of  Fantastic , for instance: Leiber had just come out of one of his recurrent dry spells, and editor  |Cele_Lalli|Cele_Goldsmith_Lalli|  bought up all his new material until there was enough to fill an issue; the magazine came out with a big black headline across its cover — Leiber Is Back!            His legacy appears to have been consolidated by the most famous of his creations, the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, written over a span of 50 years. The first of them, Two Sought Adventure , appeared in  Unknown , August 1939. They are concerned with an unlikely pair of heroes found in and around the city of  |Lankhmar|Lankhmar| . Fafhrd was based on Leiber himself and the Mouser on his friend  |Harry_Otto_Fischer|Harry_Otto_Fischer| , and the two characters were created in a series of letters exchanged by the two in the mid-1930s. These stories were among the progenitors of many of the  |tropes|Trope|  of the  |sword_and_sorcery|Sword_And_Sorcery|  genre. They are also notable among sword and sorcery stories in that, over the course of the stories, his two heroes mature, take on more responsibilities, and eventually settle down into marriage.     Some Fafhrd and Mouser stories were recognized by annual genre awards: Scyllas Daughter was Short Story Hugo finalist and Ill Met in Lankhmar won the Best Novella Hugo and Nebula Awards. Leibers last major work, The Knight and Knave of Swords , brought the series to a close while leaving room for possible sequels. In the last year of his life, Leiber was considering allowing the series to be continued by other writers, but his sudden death made this more difficult. One new Fafhrd and the Mouser novel,  Swords Against the Shadowland , by  |Robin_Wayne_Bailey|Robin_Wayne_Bailey| , did appear in 1998.     The stories were influential in shaping the genre and were influential on other works.  |Joanna_Russ|Joanna_Russ|  stories about thief-assassin Alyx  were in part inspired by Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Alyx in fact made guest appearances in two of Leibers stories. Numerous writers have paid homage to the stories. For instance,  |Terry_Pratchetts|Terry_Pratchett|  city of  |Ankh-Morpork|Ankh-Morpork|  bears something more than a passing resemblance to Lankhmar . More recently, playing off the visit of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser to our world in Adepts Gambit ,  |Steven_Saylors|Steven_Saylor|  short story Ill Seen in Tyre takes his  |Roma_Sub_Rosa|Roma_Sub_Rosa|  series hero Gordianus to the city of Tyre a hundred years later, where the two visitors from Nehwon are remembered as local legends.
