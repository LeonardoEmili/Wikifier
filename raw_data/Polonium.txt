   Polonium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Po and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  84. A rare and highly  |radioactive|Radioactive| |metal|Metal|  with no stable  |isotopes|Isotopes_Of_Polonium| , polonium is chemically similar to  |selenium|Selenium|  and  |tellurium|Tellurium| , though its metallic character resembles that of its  |horizontal_neighbors|Period_6_Element|  in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| |thallium|Thallium| ,  |lead|Lead| , and  |bismuth|Bismuth| . Due to the short  |half-life|Half-Life|  of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting  |polonium-210|Polonium-210|  in  |uranium|Uranium| |ores|Ore| , as it is the  |penultimate_daughter|Decay_Chain|  of natural  |uranium-238|Uranium-238Radium_Series| . Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the  |neutron_irradiation|Neutron_Irradiation|  of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the  |radiolysis|Radiolysis|  of  |chemical_bonds|Chemical_Bond|  and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.     Polonium was discovered in 1898 by  |Marie|Marie_Curie|  and  |Pierre_Curie|Pierre_Curie| , when it was extracted from the uranium ore  |pitchblende|Pitchblende|  and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: it was the first element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curies homeland of  |Poland|Poland| . Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in  |space_probes|Space_Probe| ,  |antistatic_devices|Antistatic_Device| , sources of  |neutrons|Neutron|  and  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle| , and  |poison|Poison| . It is a radioactive element and extremely dangerous to humans.         210 Po is an  |alpha_emitter|Alpha_Decay|  that has a half-life of 138.4  days; it decays directly to its stable  |daughter_isotope|Decay_Product| ,  |206_Pb|Lead| . A milligram  of 210 Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5  grams of  |226_Ra|Radium| . A few  |curies|Curie|   of 210 Po emit a blue glow which is caused by  |ionisation|Ionized-Air_Glow|  of the surrounding air.     About one in 100,000  alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a gamma ray with a maximum energy of 803  keV.  |Greenwood|Greenwood| , p. 250           Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two  |metal|Metal| lic  |allotropes|Allotrope| . The alpha form is the only known example of a  |simple_cubic|Cubic|  crystal structure in a single atom basis at  |STP|Standard_Conditions_For_Temperature_And_Pressure| , with an edge length of 335.2  |picometers|Picometer| ; the beta form is  |rhombohedral|Rhombohedral| .  |Greenwood|Greenwood| , p. 753   The structure of polonium has been characterized by  |X-ray|X-Ray| |diffraction|Diffraction|    and  |electron_diffraction|Electron_Diffraction| .      210 Po  has the ability  |to_become_airborne_with_ease|Volatility| , 50% of it is vaporized in 45 hours to form  |diatomic|Diatomic_Molecule|  Po 2 molecules, even though the melting point of polonium is  and its boiling point is .     More than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this; one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are  |spalled_off|Spallation|  by the alpha decay.       The chemistry of polonium is similar to that of  |tellurium|Tellurium| , although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor  |bismuth|Bismuth|  due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute  |acids|Acid|  but is only slightly  |soluble|Solubility|  in  |alkalis|Alkali| . Polonium  |solutions|Solution|  are first colored in pink by the Po 2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po 2+ into Po 4+ . This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by  |glassware|Laboratory_Glassware|  due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed.  |Bagnall|Bagnall| , p. 206 At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as  |oxalic_acid|Oxalic_Acid| ,  |citric_acid|Citric_Acid| , and  |tartaric_acid|Tartaric_Acid| .        Polonium has no common compounds, and almost all of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known.  |Bagnall|Bagnall| , p. 199 The most stable class of polonium compounds are  |polonides|Polonide| , which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements.  |Na_2_Po|Sodium_Polonide|  has the  |antifluorite|Antifluorite|  structure, the polonides of  |Ca|Calcium_Polonide| ,  |Ba|Barium_Polonide| ,  |Hg|Mercury_Polonide| , Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice,  |BePo|Beryllium_Polonide|  and  |CdPo|Cadmium_Polonide|  have the  |wurtzite|Wurtzite|  and  |MgPo|Magnesium_Polonide|  the  |nickel_arsenide|Nickel_Arsenide|  structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600  °C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300  °C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000  °C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250  °C and TmPo at 2200  °C.  |Greenwood|Greenwood| , p. 766  |PbPo|Lead_Polonide|  is one of the very few naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium  |alpha_decays|Alpha_Decay|  to form  |lead|Lead| .       |Polonium_hydride|Polonium_Hydride|   is a volatile liquid at room temperature prone to dissociation; it is thermally unstable.  |Water|Properties_Of_Water|  is the only other known  |hydrogen_chalcogenide|Hydrogen_Chalcogenide|  which is a liquid at room temperature; however, this is due to hydrogen bonding. The two oxides  |PoO_2|Polonium_Dioxide|  and  |PoO_3|Polonium_Trioxide|  are the products of oxidation of polonium.       |Halides|Halide|  of the structure PoX 2 , PoX 4 and PoF 6 are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides, i.e., PoCl X in HCl, PoBr X in HBr and PoI 4 in HI. Polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl 4 with SO 2 and with PoBr 4 with H 2 S at room temperature. Tetrahalides can be obtained by reacting polonium dioxide with HCl, HBr or HI.  |Greenwood|Greenwood| , pp. 765, 771, 775     Other polonium compounds include  |potassium_polonite|Potassium_Polonite|  as a  |polonite|Polonite| ,  |polonate|Polonate| ,  |acetate|Acetate| ,  |bromate|Bromate| ,  |carbonate|Carbonate| ,  |citrate|Citrate| ,  |chromate|Chromate_Ion| , cyanide,  |formate|Formate| ,  and  hydroxides,  |nitrate|Polonium_Tetranitrate| ,  |selenate|Polonium_Selenate| ,  |selenite|Polonium_Selenite| , monosulfide,  |sulfate|Sulfate| ,  |disulfate|Polonium_Disulfate|  and  |sulfite|Polonium_Sulfite| .

They have  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass| es that range from 186 to 227  |u|Atomic_Mass_Unit| .  |210_Po|Polonium-210|  is the most widely available and is made via neutron capture by natural  |bismuth|Bismuth| . The longer-lived 209 Po  and 208 Po can be made through the alpha, proton, or deuteron bombardment of  |lead|Lead|  or bismuth in a  |cyclotron|Cyclotron| .        Tentatively called  |radium_F|Radiumhistory|  , polonium was discovered by  |Marie|Marie_Curie|  and Pierre Curie in 1898,    and was named after Marie Curies native land of  |Poland|Poland|  .   Poland at the time was under  |Russian|Russian_Empire| ,  |German|German_Empire| , and  |Austro-Hungarian|Austro-Hungarian_Empire| |partition|Partitions_Of_Poland| , and did not exist as an independent country. It was Curies hope that naming the element after her native land would publicize its lack of independence. Polonium may be the first element named to highlight a political controversy.      This element was the first one discovered by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of  |pitchblende|Uraninite| |radioactivity|Radioactivity| . Pitchblende, after removal of the radioactive elements  |uranium|Uranium|  and  |thorium|Thorium| , was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined. This spurred the Curies to search for additional radioactive elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated  |radium|Radium| .   German scientist  |Willy_Marckwald|Willy_Marckwald|  successfully isolated 3 milligrams of polonium in 1902, though at the time he believed it was a new element, which he dubbed radio-tellurium , and it was not until 1905 that it was demonstrated to be the same as polonium.       In the United States, polonium was produced as part of the  |Manhattan_Projects|Manhattan_Project| |Dayton_Project|Dayton_Project|  during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Polonium and  |beryllium|Beryllium|  were the key ingredients of the  |Urchin|Modulated_Neutron_Initiatorurchin|  initiator at the center of the bombs spherical  |pit|Pit| . . Nuclearweaponarchive.org. Retrieved on 2013-04-28. Urchin initiated the  |nuclear_chain_reaction|Nuclear_Fission|  at the moment of  |prompt-critical|Prompt-Critical| ity to ensure that the weapon did not  |fizzle|Fizzle| . Urchin was used in early U.S. weapons; subsequent U.S. weapons utilized a pulse neutron generator for the same purpose.     Much of the basic physics of polonium was  |classified|Classified_Information|  until after the war. The fact that it was used as an initiator was classified until the 1960s. , January 1, 2001, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Declassification, via fas.org     The  |Atomic_Energy_Commission|United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission|  and the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project|  funded  |human_experiments|Human_Experimentation_In_The_United_States|  using polonium on five people at the University of Rochester between 1943 and 1947.

Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short  |half-life|Half-Life|  of all its isotopes. 210 Po, 214 Po, and 218 Po appear in the  |decay_chain|Decay_Chain|  of  |238_U|Uranium-238| ; thus polonium can be found in  |uranium|Uranium|  ores at about 0.1  mg per  |metric_ton|Metric_Ton|  ,  |Greenwood|Greenwood| , p. 746  |Bagnall|Bagnall| , p. 198 which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earths crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in  |tobacco_smoke|Tobacco_Smoke|  from tobacco leaves grown with  |phosphate|Phosphate|  fertilizers.        Because it is present in small concentrations, isolation of polonium from natural sources is a tedious process. The largest batch of the element ever extracted, performed in the first half of the 20th century, contained only  of  |polonium-210|Polonium-210|  and was obtained by processing 37 tonnes of residues from radium production. , reprinted in  Polonium is now usually obtained by irradiating bismuth with high-energy neutrons or protons.  |Greenwood|Greenwood| , p. 249     In 1934, an experiment showed that when natural  |209_Bi|Bismuth-209|  is bombarded with  |neutrons|Neutron| , 210 Bi is created, which then decays to 210 Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques.  Polonium may now be made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| . Only about 100  grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.       This process can cause problems in  |lead-bismuth|Lead-Bismuth_Eutectic|  based  |liquid_metal_cooled_nuclear_reactors|Liquid_Metal_Cooled_Reactor|  such as those used in the  |Soviet_Navys|Soviet_Navy| |K-27|Soviet_Submarine_K-27| . Measures must be taken in these reactors to deal with the unwanted possibility of 210 Po being released from the coolant.       The longer-lived isotopes of polonium, 208 Po and 209 Po, can be formed by  |proton|Proton|  or  |deuteron|Deuteron|  bombardment of bismuth using a  |cyclotron|Cyclotron| . Other more neutron-deficient and more unstable isotopes can be formed by the irradiation of platinum with  |carbon|Carbon|  nuclei.        Polonium-based sources of alpha particles were produced in the former Soviet Union. Such sources were applied for measuring the thickness of industrial coatings via attenuation of alpha radiation.  |Bagnall|Bagnall| , p. 225     Because of intense alpha radiation, a one-gram sample of 210 Po will spontaneously heat up to above  generating about 140 watts of power. Therefore, 210 Po is used as an atomic heat source to power  |radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators|Radioisotope_Thermoelectric_Generator|  via  |thermoelectric|Thermoelectric|  materials.   |Greenwood|Greenwood| , p. 251  For example, 210 Po heat sources were used in the  |Lunokhod|Lunokhod|  1 and Lunokhod 2  |Moon|Moon|  rovers to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights, as well as the  |Kosmos_84|List_Of_Kosmos_Satellites|  and 90 satellites .  . npc.sarov.ru      The alpha particles emitted by polonium can be converted to neutrons using beryllium oxide, at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles. Thus Po-BeO mixtures or  |alloys|Alloy|  are used as a  |neutron_source|Neutron_Source| , for example, in a  |neutron_trigger_or_initiator|Urchin|  for  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapon|    and for inspections of oil wells. About 1500 sources of this type, with an individual activity of , have been used annually in the Soviet Union.  . stringer.ru .     Polonium was also part of brushes or more complex tools that eliminate static charges in photographic plates,  |textile|Textile|  mills, paper rolls, sheet plastics, and on substrates prior to the application of coatings.  Alpha particles emitted by polonium ionize air molecules that neutralize charges on the nearby surfaces.   Some anti-static brushes contain up to  of 210 Po as a source of charged particles for neutralizing static electricity.  In the US, devices with no more than  of 210 Po per unit can be bought in any amount under a general license ,  which means that a buyer need not be registered by any authorities. Polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half-life; it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous  |beta_particle|Beta_Decay|  sources.     Tiny amounts of 210 Po are sometimes used in the laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically of the order of , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210 Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as needle sources for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the  |alpha_radiation|Alpha_Radiation|  to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to  |United_Nuclear|United_Nuclear| , they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.         Polonium  |spark_plugs|Spark_Plug|  were marketed by  |Firestone|Firestone_Tire_And_Rubber_Company|  from 1940 to 1953. While the amount of radiation from the plugs was minuscule and not a threat to the consumer, the benefits of such plugs quickly diminished after approximately a month because of poloniums short half-life and because buildup on the conductors would block the radiation that improved engine performance.              Polonium is highly dangerous and has no biological role. By mass, polonium-210 is around 250,000 times more toxic than  |hydrogen_cyanide|Hydrogen_Cyanide|  . The main hazard is its intense radioactivity , which makes it difficult to handle safely. Even in  |microgram|Microgram|  amounts, handling 210 Po is extremely dangerous, requiring specialized equipment , adequate monitoring, and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination. Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed, although they do not penetrate the  |epidermis|Epidermis|  and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body. Wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous  |diffusion|Diffusion|  of polonium directly through the  |skin|Skin| . Polonium delivered in concentrated  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves  or the acid may damage the gloves.  |Bagnall|Bagnall| , pp. 202–6     Polonium does not have toxic chemical properties.      It has been reported that some  |microbes|Microbe|  can  |methylate|Methylation|  polonium by the action of  |methylcobalamin|Methylcobalamin| .     This is similar to the way in which  |mercury|Mercury| ,  |selenium|Selenium| , and  |tellurium|Tellurium|  are methylated in living things to create  |organometallic|Organometallic|  compounds. Studies investigating the metabolism of polonium-210 in rats have shown that only 0.002 to 0.009% of polonium-210 ingested is excreted as volatile polonium-210.        The  |median_lethal_dose|Median_Lethal_Dose|  for acute radiation exposure is about 4.5   |Sv|Sievert| .  The  |committed_effective_dose_equivalent|Committed_Effective_Dose_Equivalent|  210 Po is 0.51  µSv/ |Bq|Becquerel|  if ingested, and 2.5  µSv/Bq if inhaled.  So a fatal 4.5  Sv dose can be caused by ingesting , about 50  |nanograms|Nanogram|  , or inhaling , about 10  ng. One gram of 210 Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210 Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks  is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a  |median_lethal_dose|Median_Lethal_Dose|  of 210 Po is , or 0.089 micrograms , still an extremely small amount.   For comparison, one grain of  |table_salt|Salt|  is about 0.06  mg 60 μg.        In addition to the acute effects, radiation exposure carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a  |radon|Radon|  daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214 Po and 218 Po are thought to cause the majority  of the estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon.   |Tobacco_smoking|Tobacco_Smokinghealth_Risks_Of_Smoking|  causes additional exposure to polonium.        The maximum allowable body burden for ingested 210 Po is only , which is equivalent to a particle massing only 6.8 picograms. The maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne 210 Po is about 10  Bq/m 3 .  The target organs for polonium in humans are the  |spleen|Spleen|  and  |liver|Liver| .  As the spleen and the liver are much smaller than the rest of the body, if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs, it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body, in the same way as  |caesium|Caesium|  or  |tritium|Tritium|  .     210 Po is widely used in industry, and readily available with little regulation or restriction.  In the US, a tracking system run by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was implemented in 2007 to register purchases of more than  of polonium-210 . The IAEA is said to be considering tighter regulations  ... There is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of 10, to .  As of 2013, this is still the only alpha emitting byproduct material available, as a NRC Exempt Quantity, which may be held without a radioactive material license.     Polonium and its compounds must be handled in a  |glove_box|Glove_Box| , which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural  |rubber|Rubber|  do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary.  |Neoprene|Neoprene|  gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.  |Bagnall|Bagnall| , p. 204           Polonium was administered to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project|  and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons who had not been exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients ages ranged from early thirties to early forties . The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. The DoE factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.      It has also been suggested that  |Irène_Joliot-Curie|Irène_Joliot-Curie|  was the first person to die from the radiation effects of polonium. She was accidentally exposed to polonium in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench. In 1956, she died from  |leukemia|Leukemia| .      According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several deaths in Israel during 1957–1969 were caused by 210 Po.  A leak was discovered at a  |Weizmann_Institute|Weizmann_Institute|  laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210 Po were found on the hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from  |cancer|Cancer| . One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.           The cause of death in the  |2006_homicide|Poisoning_Of_Alexander_Litvinenko|  of  |Alexander_Litvinenko|Alexander_Litvinenko| , a Russian  |KGB|Kgb|  agent who had defected to the British  |MI6|Mi6|  intelligence agency, was determined to be 210 Po poisoning.   According to Prof. Nick Priest of  |Middlesex_University|Middlesex_University| , an  |environmental_toxicologist|Environmental_Toxicology|  and radiation expert, speaking on  |Sky_News|Sky_News|  on December 3, 2006, Litvinenko was probably the first person to die of the  |acute|Acute|  α-radiation effects of 210 Po.      Abnormally high concentrations of 210 Po were detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the Palestinian leader  |Yasser_Arafat|Yasser_Arafat| , a heavy smoker, who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes. The spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the clinical symptoms described in Arafats medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not , and that the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafats body to test it for polonium-210. Bart, Katharina . . Reuters. On 27 November 2012 Arafats body was exhumed, and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia.  On 12 October 2013, The Lancet published the groups finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafats blood, urine, and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush.  The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from natural environmental origin . Isachenkov, Vadim . Associated Press. Following later Russian tests, Vladimir Uiba, the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated in December 2013 that Arafat died of natural causes, and they had no plans to conduct further tests.       It has been suggested that  |chelation_agents|Chelation_Therapy| , such as British Anti-Lewisite , can be used to decontaminate humans.  In one experiment, rats were given a fatal dose of 1.45  MBq/kg of 210 Po;   all untreated rats were dead after 44 days, but 90% of the rats treated with the chelation agent   HOEtTTC remained alive for 5 months.        Polonium-210 may be quantified in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally in a range of 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide. Baselt, R. , 10th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA.       Polonium-210 is widespread in the  |biosphere|Biosphere| , including in human tissues, because of its position in the  |uranium-238_decay_chain|Uranium_Series| . Natural  |uranium-238|Uranium-238|  in the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust|  decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including  |radium-226|Radium-226|  to the radioactive noble gas  |radon-222|Radon-222| , some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earths surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable  |lead-206|Lead-206| .        As early as the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using polonium provided by his colleague  |Marie_Curie|Marie_Curie| , showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in  |liver|Liver| ,  |kidney|Kidney| , and  |testes|Testes| . Lacassagne, A. & Lattes, J. Bulletin dHistologie Appliquée à la Physiologie et à la Pathologie, 1, 279. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules  and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues.  Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.         |Polonium-210|Polonium-210|  in tobacco contributes to many of the cases of  |lung_cancer|Lung_Cancer|  worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from  |lead-210|Lead-210|  deposited on tobacco leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 is a product of  |radon-222|Radon-222|  gas, much of which appears to originate from the decay of  |radium-226|Radium-226|  from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils.    Birnbauer, William . The Age, Melbourne, Australia     The presence of polonium in tobacco smoke has been known since the early 1960s.   Some of the worlds biggest tobacco firms researched ways to remove the substance—to no avail—over a 40-year period. The results were never published.       Polonium is found in the food chain, especially in seafood.
