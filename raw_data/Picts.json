Bede, I, c. 1  The kings of the Picts when Bede was writing were Bridei and Nechtan, sons of Der Ilei, who indeed claimed the throne through their mother Der Ilei, daughter of an earlier Pictish king.      In Ireland, kings were expected to come from among those who had a great-grandfather who had been king. , also pp. 108, 287, stating that derbfhine was practised by the cruithni in Ireland. Kingly fathers were not frequently succeeded by their sons, not because the Picts practised matrilineal succession, but because they were usually followed by their own brothers or cousins, more likely to be experienced men with the authority and the support necessary to be king. , Elder for kin, worth for rulership, wisdom for the church.

While earlier kings had to be successful war leaders to maintain their authority, kingship became rather less personalised and more institutionalised during this time. Bureaucratic kingship was still far in the future when Pictland became Alba, but the support of the church, and the apparent ability of a small number of families to control the kingship for much of the period from the later 7th century onwards, provided a considerable degree of continuity. In much the same period, the Picts neighbours in Dál Riata and Northumbria faced considerable difficulties, as the stability of succession and rule that previously benefited them ended. , ; for Dál Riata, , for a more positive view Sharpe, The thriving of Dalriada ; for Northumbria, Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, pp. 144–149.
