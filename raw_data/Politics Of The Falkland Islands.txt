   The politics of the Falkland Islands  takes place in a framework of a  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy|  and  |parliamentary|Parliamentary_System| |_representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |_dependency|Dependent_Territory|  as set out by the  |constitution|Constitution_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| , whereby the  |Governor|Governor_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  exercises the duties of  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  in the absence of the  |monarch|Monarchy_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and the  |Chief_Executive|Chief_Executive_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  acts as the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , with an elected  |Legislative_Assembly|Legislative_Assembly_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  to propose new laws and hold the executive to account.     The  |islands|Falkland_Islands| , an archipelago in the southern  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| , are a self-governing  |British_overseas_territory|British_Overseas_Territory| . Executive power is exercised on behalf of  |the_Queen|Monarchy_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  by an appointed Governor, who primarily acts on the advice of the  |Executive_Council|Executive_Council_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| . Legislative power is vested in both the government and the  |Legislative_Assembly|Legislative_Assembly_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| . The  |judiciary_is_independent|Independence_Of_The_Judiciary|  of the executive and the legislature. The  |military_defence|Military_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  and  |foreign_policy|Foreign_Policy|  of the islands is the responsibility of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| . Politics in the  |Falkland_Islands|Falkland_Islands|  is minimal as no political parties exist on the islands, and the governmental and legal proceedings very closely resemble British standards.     Following the  |Falklands_War|Falklands_War|  in 1982,  |Lord_Shackleton|Edward_Shackleton_Baron_Shackleton|  published a report on the  |economy_of_the_Falkland_Islands|Economy_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  which recommended many modernisations. On 1 January 1983 the  |Falkland_Islanders|Falkland_Islanders|  gained  |British_citizenship|British_Citizenship|  under the  |British_Nationality_Act_1983|British_Nationality_Act_1983| , and on 3 October 1985 the  |Constitution_of_the_Falkland_Islands|Constitution_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  was established. A new constitution came into force on 1 January 2009 which modernised the Chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, embedding  |self_determination|Self_Determination|  in the main body of the constitution. The new constitution also replaced the Legislative Council with the Legislative Assembly, and better explained the role of the  |Governor|Governor_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  and the  |Chief_Executive|Chief_Executive_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| .           The  |Argentine_Republic|Argentina|  claims the Falkland Islands  to be part of its territory. This claim is disputed by the  |Falkland_Islanders|Falkland_Islanders|  and the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| . In 1982 the islands were  |invaded|1982_Invasion_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  and  |occupied|Occupation_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  by the  |Argentine_military_junta|Argentine_Military_Junta| , starting the  |Falklands_War|Falklands_War| . The islands were subsequently  |liberated_by_British_forces|Argentine_Surrender_In_The_Falklands_War|  just 74 days after the start of the war, which led to the collapse of the military dictatorship in Argentina.     The sovereignty of the Falklands remains in dispute, with Argentina claiming the islands are an  |integral_and_indivisible_part_of_its_territory|Territorial_Integrity| , illegally occupied by an occupying power.  The United Kingdom and the  |Government_of_the_Falkland_Islands|Government_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  maintains that the  |Islanders|Falkland_Islanders|  have the  |right_to_determine_the_sovereignty|Self_Determination|  of their birthplace.  In a  |referendum_in_2013|2013_Falkland_Islands_Sovereignty_Referendum|  the people of the Falkland Islands soundly rejected Argentinas claim to the islands, with 99.8% of voters supporting the Falklands remaining an  |Overseas_Territory|British_Overseas_Territory|  of the United Kingdom.               |Executive_authority|Executive|  on the Falkland Islands is vested in  |Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii| , who has been the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  since her accession to the British throne on 6 February 1952. As the Queen is absent from the islands for most of the time, executive authority is exercised in Her Majestys name and on Her Majestys behalf by the  |Governor_of_the_Falkland_Islands|Governor_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| .  |Nigel_Phillips|Nigel_Phillips|  has been Governor since 12 September 2017.      The Governor normally acts only on the advice of the  |Executive_Council_of_the_Falkland_Islands|Executive_Council_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| , which is composed of three Members of the  |Legislative_Assembly|Legislative_Assembly_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  elected by the Assembly to serve on the Council every year, the  |Chief_Executive|Chief_Executive_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| , the  |Director_of_Finance|Director_Of_Finance_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  and the Governor, who acts as  |presiding_officer|Chairman| . The constitution does permit the Governor to act without the consulting the Executive Council and even go against its instructions, but in both cases the Governor must immediately inform the  |Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs|Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_And_Commonwealth_Affairs|  in the United Kingdom, who can overrule the Governors actions.     Government policy and the execution thereof is primarily decided by the  |Chief_Executive_of_the_Falkland_Islands|Chief_Executive_Of_The_Falkland_Islands|  who is the head of the public service, responsible for the efficient and effective management of the executive, acting as the islands  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| . The Chief Executive is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council.  |Barry_Rowland|Barry_Rowland|  has been Chief Executive since October 2016.           The  |legislative|Legislature|  branch consists of a  |unicameral|Unicameralism| |_Legislative_Assembly|Legislative_Assembly_Of_The_Falkland_Islands| .  |General_elections|General_Election|  must take place at least once every four years, in which the islanders elect eight members to the Legislative Assembly  through  |universal_suffrage|Universal_Suffrage|  using  |block_voting|Plurality_At_Large_Voting| . There are also two  |ex_officio_members|Ex_Officio_Member|  of the Assembly  who take part in proceedings but are not permitted to vote in the Assembly.     The following major conventions apply to the Falkland Islands and should be taken into account during the drafting of legislation:  .
