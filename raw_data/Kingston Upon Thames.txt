        Kingston upon Thames , frequently known as Kingston, is a town in  |Greater_London|Greater_London| ,  |England|England| ,  southwest of  |Charing_Cross|Charing_Cross| . Located by the  |River_Thames|River_Thames| , it is the administrative centre of the  |Royal_Borough_of_Kingston_upon_Thames|Royal_Borough_Of_Kingston_Upon_Thames| , and identified as a major metropolitan centre in the  |London_Plan|London_Plan| .     Kingston is about  above sea level. It is notable as the ancient  |market_town|Market_Town|  in which  |Saxon|History_Of_Anglo_Saxon_England|  kings were crowned. Kingston was part of a  |large_ancient_parish|Kingston_Upon_Thames|  in the county of Surrey and the town was an  |ancient_borough_reformed_in_1835|Municipal_Borough_Of_Kingston_Upon_Thames| . Since 1965 Kingston has been a part of  |Greater_London|Greater_London| . It has been the location of  |Surrey_County_Hall|Surrey_County_Hall|  from 1893, extraterritorially in terms of local government administration. Most of the town centre is part of the  |KT1_postcode|Kt_Postcode_Area|  area, but some areas north of  |Kingston_railway_station|Kingston_Railway_Station|  have the postcode KT2 instead. The  |2011_Census|United_Kingdom_Census_2011|  recorded the population of the town itself, comprising the four wards of Canbury, Grove, Norbiton and Tudor, as 43,013.             Kingston was called Cyninges tun in AD 838, Chingestune in 1086, Kingeston in 1164, Kyngeston super Tamisiam in 1321 and Kingestowne upon Thames in 1589. The name means the kings manor or estate from the Old English words cyning and tun. It belonged to the king in Saxon times and was the earliest royal borough.      The first surviving record of Kingston is from AD 838 as the site of a meeting between King  |Egbert_of_Wessex|Egbert_Of_Wessex|  and  |Ceolnoth|Ceolnoth| ,  |Archbishop_of_Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury| .  Kingston lay on the boundary between the ancient kingdoms of  |Wessex|Wessex|  and  |Mercia|Mercia| , until in the early tenth century when King Athelstan united both to create the kingdom of England. According to the  |Anglo_Saxon_Chronicle|Anglo_Saxon_Chronicle| , two tenth-century kings were consecrated in Kingston:  |Æthelstan|Æthelstan|  , and  |Æthelred_the_Unready|Æthelred_The_Unready|  . There are certain other kings who are said to have been crowned there, but for whom the evidence  is less substantial:  |Edward_the_Elder|Edward_The_Elder|  ,  |Edmund_I|Edmund_I|  ,  |Eadred|Eadred|  ,  |Eadwig|Eadwig|  ,  |Edgar_the_Peaceful|Edgar_The_Peaceful|  and  |Edward_the_Martyr|Edward_The_Martyr|  . It was later thought that the coronations were conducted in the chapel of St Mary, which collapsed in 1730. Tradition dating to the 18th century holds that a  |large_stone|Coronation_Stone_Kingston_Upon_Thames|  recovered from the ruins played a part in the coronations. It was initially used as a mounting block, but in 1850 it was moved to a more dignified place in the market before finally being moved to its current location in the grounds of the  |Guildhall|Kingston_Upon_Thames_Guildhall| .           For much of the 20th century, Kingston was a major military aircraft manufacturing centre specialising in fighter aircraft – first with  |Sopwith_Aviation|Sopwith_Aviation| , H G Hawker Engineering, later  |Hawker_Aircraft|Hawker_Aircraft| ,  |Hawker_Siddeley|Hawker_Siddeley|  and eventually  |British_Aerospace|British_Aerospace| . The renowned  |Sopwith_Camel|Sopwith_Camel| ,  |Hawker_Fury|Hawker_Fury| ,  |Hurricane|Hawker_Hurricane| ,  |Hunter|Hawker_Hunter|  and  |Harrier|Harrier_Jump_Jet|  were all designed and built in the town and examples of all of these aircraft can be seen today at the nearby  |Brooklands_Museum|Brooklands_Museum|  in Weybridge. Well known aviation personalities  |Sydney_Camm|Sydney_Camm| ,  |Harry_Hawker|Harry_Hawker|  and  |Tommy_Sopwith|Tommy_Sopwith|  were responsible for much of Kingstons achievements in aviation. British Aerospace finally closed its Lower Ham Road factory in 1992;  part of the site was subsequently redeveloped for housing but the riverside part houses a community centre and sports complex. The growth and development of Kingston Polytechnic and its transformation into  |Kingston_University|Kingston_University|  has made Kingston a university town.             Kingston upon Thames formed an ancient parish in the  |Kingston|Kingston| |_hundred|Hundred|  of Surrey. The  |parish_of_Kingston_upon_Thames|Kingston_Upon_Thames|  covered a large area including  |Hook|Hook_London| ,  |Kew|Kew| ,  |New_Malden|New_Malden| ,  |Petersham|Petersham_London| ,  |Richmond|Richmond_London| ,  |Surbiton|Surbiton| ,  |Thames_Ditton|Thames_Ditton|  and  |East_Molesey|East_Molesey| .      The town of Kingston was granted a  |charter|Charter|  by  |King_John|John_Of_England|  in 1200, but the oldest one to survive is from 1208 and this document is housed in the towns archives. Other charters were issued by later kings, including  |Edward_IVs|Edward_Iv_Of_England|  charter that gave the town the status of a  |borough|Ancient_Borough|  in 1481.     The borough covered a much smaller area than the ancient parish, although as new parishes were split off the borough and parish eventually became identical in 1894. The borough was reformed by the  |Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835|Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835| , becoming the  |Municipal_Borough_of_Kingston_upon_Thames|Municipal_Borough_Of_Kingston_Upon_Thames|  . It had been known as a Royal borough through custom and the right to the title was confirmed by George V in 1927.  Kingston upon Thames has been the seat of  |Surrey_County_Council|Surrey_County_Council|  since it moved from  |Newington|Newington_London|  in 1893, and remains the seat of the county council to this day, despite not being governed by it.     In 1965 the local government of  |Greater_London|Greater_London|  was reorganised and the municipal borough was abolished. Its former area was merged with that of the  |Municipal_Borough_of_Surbiton|Municipal_Borough_Of_Surbiton|  and the  |Municipal_Borough_of_Malden_and_Coombe|Municipal_Borough_Of_Malden_And_Coombe| , to form the  |London_Borough_of_Kingston_upon_Thames|London_Borough_Of_Kingston_Upon_Thames| . At the request of  |Kingston_upon_Thames_London_Borough_Council|Kingston_Upon_Thames_London_Borough_Council|  another Royal Charter was granted by  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Queen_Elizabeth_Ii|  entitling it to continue using the title Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames for the new borough.          Kingston was built at the first crossing point of the  |Thames|River_Thames|  upstream from  |London_Bridge|London_Bridge|  and a  |bridge|Kingston_Bridge_Kingston|  still exists at the same site. It was this great bridge that gave it its early importance in the 13th century. Kingston was occupied by the  |Romans|Roman_Empire| , and later it was either a royal residence or a royal  |demesne|Demesne| . There is a record of a council held there in 838, at which  |Egbert_of_Wessex|Egbert_Of_Wessex| , King of Wessex, and his son  |Ethelwulf_of_Wessex|Ethelwulf_Of_Wessex|  were present. In the Domesday Book it was held by  |William_the_Conqueror|William_The_Conqueror| . Its domesday assets were: a church, five  |mills|Mill| , four  |fisheries|Fishery|  worth 10s, 27  |ploughs|Plough| ,  of  |meadow|Meadow| ,  |woodland|Woodland|  worth six  |hogs|Hog| . It rendered  |£|Gbp| 31 10s .      In 1730 the chapel containing the royal effigies collapsed, burying the  |sexton|Sexton| , who was digging a grave, the sextons daughter and another person. The daughter survived this accident and was her fathers successor as sexton. Kingston sent members to early  |Parliaments|Parliament_Of_England| , until a petition by the inhabitants prayed to be relieved from the burden. Another chapel, the collegiate chapel of St Mary Magdalene, The Lovekyn Chapel, still exists. It was founded in 1309 by a former mayor of London,  |Edward_Lovekyn|Edward_Lovekyn| . It is the only private chantry chapel to survive the  |Reformation|English_Reformation| .     With the coming of the railway in the 1830s, there was much building development to the south of the town. Much of this became the new town of  |Surbiton|Surbiton| , but the  |Surbiton_Park|Surbiton_Park|  estate, built in the grounds of Surbiton Place in the 1850s, remained part of Kingston during the period of the  |Municipal_Borough_of_Kingston_upon_Thames|Municipal_Borough_Of_Kingston_Upon_Thames| .     A permanent military presence was established in the borough with the completion of  |The_Barracks|The_Barracks_Kingston_Upon_Thames|  in 1875.        Kingston straddles two Parliamentary constituencies: the area north of the railway line is part of  |Richmond_Park|Richmond_Park| , which is represented by  |Zac_Goldsmith|Zac_Goldsmith|  of the  |Conservative_Party|Conservative_Party| , and the area south of the railway line is part of  |Kingston_and_Surbiton|Kingston_And_Surbiton|  which is represented by  |Ed_Davey|Ed_Davey|  of the  |Liberal_Democrats|Liberal_Democrats| .

The town led to the  |South_Western_Main_Line|South_Western_Main_Line|  being in Surbiton as much of Kingstons wealth and status were as a direct consequence of the road and stagecoach network developed as a result of its crossing on the Thames. Local landowners would not consent to the line coming through their land so in 1838 the rail station was built a few miles out at Surbiton, which was known as Kingston Upon Railway and led to the development of  |Surbiton|Surbiton| . Kingston recognised the need for a railway, and in the 1860s  |Kingston|Kingston_Railway_Station|  opened.
