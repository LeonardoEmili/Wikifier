A lunar calendar is a  |calendar|Calendar|  based upon the  |month|Month| ly cycles of the  |Moons|Moon| |phases|Lunar_Phase|  , in contrast to  |solar_calendars|Solar_Calendar| , whose annual cycles are based only directly upon the  |solar_year|Solar_Year| . The most commonly used calendar, the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , is a solar calendar system that originally evolved out of a lunar calendar system. A purely lunar calendar is also distinguished from a  |lunisolar_calendar|Lunisolar_Calendar| , whose  |lunar_months|Lunar_Month|  are brought into alignment with the solar year through some process of  |intercalation|Intercalation| . The details of when months begin varies from calendar to calendar, with some using  |new|New_Moon| ,  |full|Full_Moon| , or  |crescent|Crescent|  moons and others employing detailed calculations.     Since each  |lunation|Lunation|  is approximately   days , it is common for the months of a lunar calendar to alternate between 29 and 30  days. Since the period of twelve such lunations, a lunar year, is only 354  days, 8  hours, 48  minutes, 34  seconds , purely lunar calendars lose around 11  days per year relative to the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| . In purely lunar calendars like the  |Islamic_calendar|Islamic_Calendar| , the lack of intercalation causes the lunar months to cycle through all the seasons of the Gregorian year over the course of a  |33_lunar-year_cycle|List_Of_Islamic_Yearsmodern| .     Although the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  is in common and legal use in most countries, traditional lunar and lunisolar calendars continue to be used throughout the  |Old_World|Old_World|  to determine  |religious_festivals|Religious_Festival|  and  |national_holidays|National_Day| . Examples of such holidays include  |Ramadan|Ramadan|  ;  |Easter|Easter| ; the  |Chinese|Chinese_New_Year| ,  |Japanese|Japanese_New_Year| ,  |Korean|Korean_New_Year| ,  |Vietnamese|Vietnamese_New_Year| , and  |Mongolian_New_Year|Mongolian_New_Year|  ; the  |Nepali_New_Year|Nepali_New_Year|  ; the  |Mid-Autumn_Festival|Mid-Autumn_Festival|  and  |Chuseok|Chuseok|  ;  |Loi_Krathong|Loi_Krathong|  ;  |Sunuwar|Sunuwar|  calendar;  |Vesak|Vesak| / |Buddhas_Birthday|Buddhas_Birthday|  ;  |Diwali|Diwali|  ; and  |Rosh_Hashanah|Rosh_Hashanah|  .       A lunar calendar was found at  |Warren_Field|Warren_Field|  in  |Scotland|Scotland|  and has been dated to  , during the  |Mesolithic_period|Mesolithic_Scotland| . Nancy Owano, Scotland lunar-calendar find sparks Stone Age rethink,   Some scholars argue for lunar calendars still earlier— |Rappenglück|Michael_Rappenglueck|  in the marks on a   year-old  |cave_painting|Cave_Painting|  at  |Lascaux|Lascaux|  and  |Marshack|Alexander_Marshack|  in the marks on a   year-old bone baton—but their findings remain controversial.

Scholars have argued that ancient hunters conducted regular astronomical observations of the Moon back in the  |Upper_Palaeolithic|Upper_Paleolithic| .  Samuel L. Macey dates the earliest uses of the Moon as a time-measuring device back to 28,000-30,000 years ago.           Most calendars referred to as lunar calendars are in fact  |lunisolar_calendars|Lunisolar_Calendar| . Their months are based on observations of the lunar cycle, with  |intercalation|Intercalation|  being used to bring them into general agreement with the solar year. The solar  |civic_calendar|Egyptian_Calendar|  that was used in  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt|  showed traces of its origin in the earlier lunar calendar, which continued to be used alongside it for religious and agricultural purposes. Present-day lunisolar calendars include the  |Chinese|Chinese_Calendar| ,  |Hindu|Hindu_Calendar| , and  |Thai|Thai_Lunar_Calendar|  calendars.      |Synodic_months|Synodic_Month|  are 29 or 30  days in length, making a  |lunar_year|Lunar_Year|  of 12 months about 11 days shorter than a  |solar_year|Solar_Year| . Some lunar calendars do not use intercalation, such as most  |Islamic_calendars|Islamic_Calendar| . For those that do, such as the  |Hebrew_calendar|Hebrew_Calendar| , the most common form of intercalation is to add an additional month every second or third year. Some lunisolar calendars are also calibrated by annual natural events which are affected by lunar cycles as well as the solar cycle. An example of this is the lunar calendar of the  |Banks_Islands|Banks_Islands| , which includes three months in which the edible  |palolo_worms|Palolo_Worm|  mass on the beaches. These events occur at the last quarter of the lunar month, as the reproductive cycle of the palolos is synchronized with the moon. R.H.Codrington. The Melanesians: Their anthropology and folklore Oxford, Clarendon Press       Lunar and lunisolar calendars differ as to which day is the first day of the month. In some lunisolar calendars, such as the  |Chinese_calendar|Chinese_Calendar| , the first day of a month is the day when an astronomical  |new_moon|New_Moon|  occurs in a particular time zone. In others, such as some  |Hindu_calendars|Hindu_Calendar| , each month begins on the day after the full moon or the new moon. Others were based in the past on the first sighting of a  |lunar_crescent|Lunar_Phase| , such as the  |Hebrew_calendar|Hebrew_Calendar|  and the  |Hijri_calendar|Hijri_Calendar| .       The length of each lunar cycle varies slightly from the average value. In addition, observations are subject to uncertainty and weather conditions. Thus to avoid uncertainty about the calendar, there have been attempts to create fixed arithmetical rules to determine the start of each calendar month.     The average length of the  |synodic_month|Synodic_Month|  is  days. Thus it is convenient if months generally alternate between 29 and 30  days . The distribution of hollow and full months can be determined using  |continued_fractions|Continued_Fraction| , and examining successive approximations for the length of the month in terms of fractions of a day. In the list below, after the number of days listed in the numerator of the fraction in the first columns, an integer number of months as listed in the denominator have been completed; the second column records the deviation accumulated with respect to the true synodic month duration and the time needed to achieve that deviation:          These fractions can be used to construct a lunar calendar, or in combination with a solar calendar to produce a  |lunisolar_calendar|Lunisolar_Calendar| . A 49-month cycle was proposed as the basis of an alternative  |Easter_computation|Computus|  by  |Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  around 1700.  by Ari Belenkiy and Eduardo Vila Echagüe ; Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London . The  |tabular_Islamic_calendars|Tabular_Islamic_Calendar|  360-month cycle is equivalent to 24×15  months, minus a correction of one day.          |Gezer_Calendar|Gezer_Calendar| |Haida|Haida_Peoplecalendar| |Islamic_calendar|Islamic_Calendar| |Nepal_Sambat|Nepal_Sambat| |Javanese_calendar|Javanese_Calendar| |Assyrian_calendar|Assyrian_Calendar| |Yoruba_calendar|Yoruba_Calendar| |Igbo_calendar|Igbo_Calendar| |Myanmar_calendar|Myanmar_Calendar| .
