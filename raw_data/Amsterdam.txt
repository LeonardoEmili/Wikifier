As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an  |alpha-world_city|Alpha-World_City|  by the  |Globalization_and_World_Cities|Globalization_And_World_Cities|  study group. The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands. After Athens in 1888 and Florence in 1986, Amsterdam was in 1986 chosen as the  |European_Capital_of_Culture|European_Capital_Of_Culture| , confirming its eminent position in Europe and the Netherlands. See  for an overview of the European cities and capitals of culture over the years.

Also, many of the worlds largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as leading technology companies  |Uber|Uber| ,  |Netflix|Netflix|  and  |Tesla|Tesla,_Inc.| .  In 2012, Amsterdam was ranked the second best city to live in by the  |Economist_Intelligence_Unit|Economist_Intelligence_Unit|   and 12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer.  The city was ranked 4th place globally as top tech hub in the Savills Tech Cities 2019 report ,  and 3rd in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow in their Innovation Cities Index 2009.  The  |Port_of_Amsterdam|Port_Of_Amsterdam|  is the fifth largest in Europe.

They draw more than 5  million international visitors annually.  The city is also well known for its nightlife and festival activity; several of its nightclubs  are among the worlds most famous. It is also one of the worlds most multicultural cities, with at least 177 nationalities represented.             After the floods of 1170 and 1173, locals near the river Amstel built a bridge over the river and a dam across it, giving its name to the village: Aemstelredamme . The earliest recorded use of that name is in a document dated 27 October 1275, which exempted inhabitants of the village from paying  |bridge_tolls|Toll_Bridge|  to Count  |Floris_V|Floris_V,_Count_Of_Holland| . This allowed the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the  |County_of_Holland|County_Of_Holland| , paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams. The certificate describes the inhabitants as homines manentes apud Amestelledamme .  By 1327, the name had developed into Aemsterdam.                 Amsterdam is much younger than Dutch cities such as  |Nijmegen|Nijmegen| ,  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam| , and  |Utrecht|Utrecht| . In October 2008,  |historical_geographer|Historical_Geographer|  Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then, since  |reclamation_of_land|Reclamation_Of_Land|  may not have been for farming—it may have been for  |peat|Peat| , for use as fuel.      Amsterdam was granted  |city_rights|City_Rights_In_The_Low_Countries|  in either 1300 or 1306.  From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League| . In 1345, an alleged  |Eucharistic_miracle|Blessed_Sacrament|  in the  |Kalverstraat|Kalverstraat|  rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the  |adoption_of_the_Protestant_faith|Protestant_Reformation| . The Miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. In the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for Dutch Catholics. The  Stille Omgang —a silent walk or  |procession|Procession|  in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the Protestant Netherlands since the late 19th century.  In the heyday of the Silent Walk, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam. In the 21st century this has reduced to about 5000.          In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against  |Philip_II_of_Spain|Philip_Ii_Of_Spain|  and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the  |religious_persecution|Religious_Persecution|  of Protestants by the newly introduced  |Inquisition|Inquisition_Of_The_Netherlands| . The revolt escalated into the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War| , which ultimately led to Dutch independence.  Strongly pushed by  |Dutch_Revolt|Dutch_Revolt|  leader  |William_the_Silent|William_The_Silent| , the  |Dutch_Republic|Dutch_Republic|  became known for its relative  |religious|History_Of_Religion_In_The_Netherlands|  tolerance.  |Jews|History_Of_The_Jews_In_The_Netherlands|  from the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula| ,  |Huguenots|Huguenot|  from France, prosperous merchants and printers from  |Flanders|Flanders| , and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the citys intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European  |free_press|Freedom_Of_The_Press| . Case in point: After  |his_trial_and_sentencing|Galileo_Affair|  in Rome in 1633,  |Galileo|Galileo_Galilei|  chose  |Lodewijk_Elzevir|Lodewijk_Elzevir|  in Amsterdam to publish one of his finest works,  Two New Sciences . See Wade Rowland , Galileos Mistake, A new look at the epic confrontation between Galileo and the Church, New York:  |Arcade_Publishing|Arcade_Publishing| , , p. 260.            The 17th century is considered Amsterdams  Golden Age , during which it became the wealthiest city in the western world. E. Haverkamp-Bergmann, Rembrandt; The Night Watch , p. 57 Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| , North America, and Africa, as well as present-day  |Indonesia|Indonesia| ,  |India|India| ,  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka| , and  |Brazil|Brazil| , forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdams merchants had the largest share in both the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company|  and the  |Dutch_West_India_Company|Dutch_West_India_Company| . These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became  |Dutch_colonies|Dutch_Empire| .     Amsterdam was Europes most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading  |Financial_centre|Financial_Centre|  of the western world.  , The University of  |North_Carolina|North_Carolina|  at Pembroke In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the international trading Dutch East India Company became the worlds first  |stock_exchange|Stock_Exchange|  by trading in its own shares.  The Bank of Amsterdam started operations in 1609, acting as a full service bank for Dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank.       Amsterdams prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The  |wars|Anglo-Dutch_Wars|  of the  |Dutch_Republic|Dutch_Republic|  with  |England|Kingdom_Of_England|  and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , Amsterdams significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the  |French_Empire|First_French_Empire| . However, the later establishment of the  |United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands|United_Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands|  in 1815 marked a turning point.        The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdams second Golden Age.  New museums, a railway station, and the  |Concertgebouw|Concertgebouw|  were built; in this same time, the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  reached the city. The  |Amsterdam–Rhine_Canal|Amsterdam–Rhine_Canal|  was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the  |Rhine|Rhine| , and the  |North_Sea_Canal|North_Sea_Canal|  was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the  |North_Sea|North_Sea| . Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906,  |Joseph_Conrad|Joseph_Conrad|  gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in The Mirror of the Sea.          Shortly before the First World War, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the Aardappeloproer . People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.      On 1 January 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and  |Schellingwoude|Schellingwoude| , all lying north of Amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city.    from website for the centrale dorpen raad Between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the  |Jordaan|Jordaan|  district in the  |Frederik_Hendrikbuurt|Frederik_Hendrikbuurt|  and surrounding neighbourhoods.      |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| |invaded_the_Netherlands|Battle_Of_The_Netherlands|  on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000  |Dutch_Jews|Dutch_Jews|  were deported to  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps| , of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. In response, the Dutch Communist Party organised the  |February_strike|February_Strike|  attended by 300,000 people to protest against the raids. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl  |Anne_Frank|Anne_Frank| , who died in the  |Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp|Bergen-Belsen_Concentration_Camp| .  At the end of the Second World War, communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats,  |raw_sugar|Sugar|  beets, and  |Tulip|Tulip|  bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive.  Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported Jews.        Many new suburbs, such as  |Osdorp|Osdorp| ,  |Slotervaart|Slotervaart| ,  |Slotermeer|Slotermeer|  and  |Geuzenveld|Geuzenveld| , were built in the years after the Second World War.    These suburbs contained many public parks and wide open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people.  A  |metro|Amsterdam_Metro|  started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of  |Bijlmermeer|Bijlmermeer|  in the citys  |Zuidoost|Amsterdam-Zuidoost|  exclave and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect  |Amsterdam_Centraal|Amsterdam_Centraal_Station|  and city centre with other parts of the city.     The required large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdams former Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the Jodenbreestraat, were widened and almost all of their houses were demolished. At the peak of the demolition, the Nieuwmarktrellen  broke out;  the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.     As a result, the demolition was stopped and the highway was never built; only the metro was completed. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished Waterlooplein. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as Stadsherstel Amsterdam, were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing. The entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a  |protected_area|Protected_Area| . Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the  |Grachtengordel|Grachtengordel|  was added to the  |UNESCO_World_Heritage_List|World_Heritage_Site| .         In the early years of the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre unaffordable for the citys inhabitants.  These developments have evoked comparisons with  |Venice|Venice| , a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.      Construction of a metro line connecting the part of the city north of the river  |IJ|Ij|  to the centre was started in 2003. The project was controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor three by 2008,  because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times.  The metro line was completed in 2018.      Since 2014, renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal, especially in areas directly bordering the city centre, such as  |Frederik_Hendrikbuurt|Frederik_Hendrikbuurt| . This urban renewal and expansion of the traditional centre of the city—with the construction on artificial islands of the new eastern  |IJburg|Ijburg|  neighbourhood—is part of the Structural Vision Amsterdam 2040 initiative.               Amsterdam is located in the Western Netherlands, in the province of  |North_Holland|North_Holland| , although it is not its capital which is  |Haarlem|Haarlem| . The river  |Amstel|Amstel|  ends in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the  |IJ|Ij| . Amsterdam is about   |below_sea_level|Above_Mean_Sea_Level| .  The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large  |polders|Polder| . A man-made forest,  |Amsterdamse_Bos|Amsterdamse_Bos| , is in the southwest. Amsterdam is connected to the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  through the long  |North_Sea_Canal|North_Sea_Canal| .     Amsterdam is intensely urbanised, as is the  |Amsterdam_metropolitan_area|Amsterdam_Metropolitan_Area|  surrounding the city. Comprising  of land, the  |city_proper|City_Limits|  has 4,457 inhabitants per km 2 and 2,275 houses per km 2 .    Parks and  |nature_reserves|Nature_Reserve|  make up 12% of Amsterdams land area.             Amsterdam has more than  of  |canals|Canals_Of_Amsterdam| , most of which are navigable by boat. The citys three main canals are the Prinsengracht, Herengracht, and Keizersgracht.     In the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the  |Singel|Singel| , which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a  |seaport|Port_Of_Amsterdam| . It has been compared with  |Venice|Venice| , due to its division into about 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.           Amsterdam has an  |oceanic_climate|Oceanic_Climate|    strongly influenced by its proximity to the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. While winters and summers are generally mild, temperatures can vary year by year. There can occasionally be cold snowy winters and hot humid summers.     Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in  |USDA|United_States_Department_Of_Agriculture| |Hardiness_zone|Hardiness_Zone|  8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant  |heat-island_effect|Urban_Heat_Island| , nights rarely fall below , while it could easily be  in Hilversum,  southeast.     Summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month. The average daily high in August is , and  or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from  to .     Days with more than  of  |precipitation|Precipitation|  are common, on average 133 days per year.     Amsterdams average annual precipitation is .  A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.                 In 1300, Amsterdams population was around 1,000 people.  While many towns in Holland experienced population decline during the 15th and 16th centuries, Amsterdams population grew,  mainly due to the rise of the profitable  |Baltic_maritime_trade|Baltic_Maritime_Trade|  after the Burgundian victory in the  |Dutch–Hanseatic_War|Dutch–Hanseatic_War| .  Still, the population of Amsterdam was only modest compared to the towns and cities of  |Flanders|County_Of_Flanders|  and  |Brabant|Duchy_Of_Brabant| , which comprised the most urbanised area of the Low Countries.     This changed when, during the  |Dutch_Revolt|Dutch_Revolt| , many people from the Southern Netherlands fled to the North, especially after  |Antwerp_fell_to_Spanish_forces|Fall_Of_Antwerp|  in 1585. Jewish people from Spain, Portugal and Eastern Europe similarly settled in Amsterdam, as did Germans and Scandinavians. In thirty years, Amsterdams population more than doubled from 1585 to 1610.  By 1600, its population was around 50,000. During the 1660s, Amsterdams population reached 200,000.  The citys growth levelled off and the population stabilised around 240,000 for most of the 18th century.      In 1750, Amsterdam was the  |fourth_largest_city_in_western_Europe|List_Of_Largest_European_Cities_In_History| , behind London , Paris and Naples .  This was all the more remarkable as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the  |Dutch_Republic|Dutch_Republic| , which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as  |Leiden|Leiden|  ,  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam|  ,  |Haarlem|Haarlem|  , and  |Utrecht|Utrecht|  .     The citys population declined in the early 19th century,  dipping under 200,000 in 1820.  By the second half of the 19th century, industrialisation spurred renewed growth.  Amsterdams population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959,  before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanisation to so-called groeikernen such as  |Purmerend|Purmerend|  and  |Almere|Almere| .    Between 1970 and 1980, Amsterdam experienced its sharp population decline, peaking at a net loss of 25,000 people in 1973. By 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents.  This was soon followed by  |reurbanisation|Reurbanization|  and  |gentrification|Gentrification| ,  leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. Also in the 2010s, much of Amsterdams population growth was due to immigration to the city.  Amsterdams population is expected to top its previous high in 2019, reaching 873,000.             In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly  |Huguenots|Huguenot| ,  |Flemings|Flemish_People| ,  |Sephardi_Jews|Sephardi_Jews|  and  |Westphalia|Westphalia| ns. Huguenots came after the  |Edict_of_Fontainebleau|Edict_Of_Fontainebleau|  in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War| . The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was  |Jewish|History_Of_The_Jews_In_Amsterdam| . Just twenty per cent of them survived the  |Shoah|The_Holocaust| .      The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies|  in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s  |guest_workers|Foreign_Worker|  from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the  |Bijlmer|Bijlmermeer|  area. Other immigrants, including refugees  |asylum_seekers|Right_Of_Asylum|  and  |illegal_immigrants|Illegal_Immigration| , came from Europe,  |America|Americas| , Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many old Amsterdammers moved to new cities like  |Almere|Almere|  and  |Purmerend|Purmerend| , prompted by the third  |planological|Land-Use_Planning|  bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called groeikernen , literally cores of growth. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the  |Jordaan|Jordaan|  abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the  |social_housing|Public_Housing|  projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city   s children.    Ethnic Dutch  now make up a minority of the total population, although by far the largest one. Only one in three inhabitants under 15 is an autochtoon, or a person who has two parents of Dutch origin.  Segregation along ethnic lines is clearly visible, with people of non-Western origin, considered a separate group by  |Statistics_Netherlands|Statistics_Netherlands| , concentrating in specific neighbourhoods especially in  |Nieuw-West|Amsterdam_Nieuw-West| ,  |Zeeburg|Zeeburg| ,  |Bijlmer|Bijlmermeer|  and in certain areas of  |Amsterdam-Noord|Amsterdam-Noord| .       In 2000, Christians formed the largest  |religious_group|Religious_Denomination|  in the city . The next largest religion was Islam , most of whose followers were  |Sunni|Sunni| .            In 1578, the largely Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule,  late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities.  Roman Catholic priests were driven out of the city. Following the Dutch takeover, all churches were converted to Protestant worship.   |Calvinism|Calvinism|  was declared the main religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the  |Catholic_hierarchy|Hierarchy_Of_The_Catholic_Church|  was prohibited. This led to the establishment of schuilkerken, covert religious buildings that were hidden in pre-existing buildings. Catholics, some Jewish and dissenting Protestants worshiped in such buildings.  A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular  |Sefardic_Jews|Sephardi_Jews|  from Spain and Portugal,    |Huguenots|Huguenot|  from France,   |Lutherans|Lutheranism| ,  |Mennonites|Mennonites| , and Protestants from across the Netherlands.  This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking churches. In 1603, the Jewish received permission to practice their religion. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated.  The Jews came to call the town  |Jerusalem_of_the_West|Jerusalem_Of_The_West| .      As they became established in the city, other  |Christian_denominations|Christian_Denomination|  used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the  |Begijnhof|Begijnhof,_Amsterdam| . Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland| .  Being Calvinists, the Huguenots soon integrated into the  |Dutch_Reformed_Church|Dutch_Reformed_Church| , though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker Walloon, are recognisable today as they offer occasional services in French.     In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of  |Ashkenazim|Ashkenazi_Jews| , Jews from  |Central_and_Eastern_Europe|Central_Europe| . Jews often fled the  |pogroms|Pogrom|  in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were  |refugees|Refugee|  from the  |Khmelnytsky_Uprising|Khmelnytsky_Uprising|  in eastern Poland and the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| . They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the Amsterdam dialect adding a large  |Yiddish|Yiddish_Language|  local vocabulary.      Despite an absence of an official Jewish  |ghetto|Ghetto| , most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighbourhood was the Jodenbreestraat. The neighbourhood comprised the Waterlooplein and the  |Nieuwmarkt|Nieuwmarkt| .  Buildings in this neighbourhood fell into disrepair after the Second World War,  and a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the subway. This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned.   The neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.       Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853.  Translated in  One of the principal architects behind the citys Catholic churches,  |Cuypers|Pierre_Cuypers| , was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central station and the  |Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum| .       In 1924, the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  of the Netherlands hosted the  |International_Eucharistic_Congress|Eucharistic_Congress|  in Amsterdam,  and numerous Catholic  |prelates|Prelate|  visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums.  Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time.  Only in the 20th century was Amsterdams relation to Catholicism normalised,  but despite its far larger  |population_size|Population_Size| , the episcopal see of the city was placed in the provincial town of  |Haarlem|Haarlem| .      In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by immigration from former colonies.  |Hinduism|Hinduism|  has been introduced from the Hindu diaspora from Suriname  and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world.  Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian immigrants have established African churches,  often in parking garages in the  |Bijlmer|Bijlmermeer|  area.        Amsterdam experienced an influx of religions and cultures after the Second World War. With 180 different nationalities, , Gemeente Amsterdam Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. Quest, issue of March 2009 The proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about 50%  and 88% of the population are Dutch citizens.      Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free  |Dutch-language|Dutch_Language|  courses, which have benefited many immigrants.                 Amsterdam fans out south from the  |Amsterdam_Centraal_railway_station|Amsterdam_Centraal_Railway_Station|  and  |Damrak|Damrak| , the main street off the station. The oldest area of the town is known as  |De_Wallen|De_Wallen|  . It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the citys famous red light district. To the south of De Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein.     The medieval and colonial age  |canals_of_Amsterdam|Canals_Of_Amsterdam| , known as grachten, embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of  |Jordaan|Jordaan|  and de Pijp. The  |Museumplein|Museumplein|  with the citys major museums, the  |Vondelpark|Vondelpark| , a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer  |Joost_van_den_Vondel|Joost_Van_Den_Vondel| , and the  |Plantage|Plantage|  neighbourhood, with the  |zoo|Natura_Artis_Magistra| , are also located outside the Grachtengordel.     Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are  |polders|Polder| . This can be recognised by the suffix -meer which means lake, as in  |Aalsmeer|Aalsmeer| ,  |Bijlmermeer|Bijlmermeer| ,  |Haarlemmermeer|Haarlemmermeer| , and  |Watergraafsmeer|Watergraafsmeer| .                The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious  |city_planning|Urban_Planning| .  In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the  |IJ|Ij|  bay. Known as the  |Grachtengordel|Grachtengordel| , three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the Herengracht , Keizersgracht , and Prinsengracht .  The fourth and outermost canal is the  |Singelgracht|Singelgracht| , which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and innermost canal, the  |Singel|Singel| .     The canals served for defence,  |water_management|Water_Resource_Management|  and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and  |earthen_dikes|Earthworks| , with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry  |superstructures|Superstructure| .  The original plans have been lost, so historians, such as Ed Taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental.      Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic  |windshield_wiper|Windscreen_Wiper|  as the historian  |Geert_Mak|Geert_Mak|  calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.  Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the  |Nieuwezijds_Voorburgwal|Nieuwezijds_Voorburgwal|  and the  |Spui|Spui| .              After the development of Amsterdams canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century,  |Samuel_Sarphati|Samuel_Sarphati|  devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the  |Grachtengordel|Grachtengordel| . The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the Paleis voor Volksvlijt.        Following Sarphati, civil engineers Jacobus van Niftrik and Jan Kalff designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the citys centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development.  Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.      In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: Plan Zuid, designed by the architect  |Berlage|Hendrik_Petrus_Berlage| , and West. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of housing blocks for all social classes.       After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the citys shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by  |motor_car|Car| . The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the Westelijke Tuinsteden. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the Bijlmer.            Amsterdam has a rich  |architectural_history|History_Of_Architecture| . The oldest building in Amsterdam is the  |Oude_Kerk|Oude_Kerk,_Amsterdam|  , at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306.  The oldest wooden building is Het Houten Huys  at the  |Begijnhof|Begijnhof,_Amsterdam| . It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of  |Gothic_architecture|Gothic_Architecture|  in Amsterdam. The oldest stone building of the Netherlands, The Moriaan is build in  |s-Hertogenbosch|S-Hertogenbosch| .     In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the  |architectural_style|Architectural_Style|  of the  |Renaissance|The_Renaissance| . Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their  |stepped_gable|Crow-Stepped_Gable|  façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own  |Renaissance_architecture|Renaissance_Architecture| . These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect  |Hendrick_de_Keyser|Hendrick_De_Keyser| .  One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the  |Westerkerk|Westerkerk| . In the 17th century  |baroque_architecture|Baroque_Architecture|  became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdams  |Golden_Age|Dutch_Golden_Age| . The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were  |Jacob_van_Campen|Jacob_Van_Campen| ,  |Philips_Vingboons|Philips_Vingboons|  and  |Daniel_Stalpaert|Daniël_Stalpaert| .          Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants houses throughout the city. A famous building in  |baroque_style|Baroque|  in Amsterdam is the  |Royal_Palace|Royal_Palace_Of_Amsterdam|  on  |Dam_Square|Dam_Square| . Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by  |French_culture|Culture_Of_France| . This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles.  Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a  |neo-gothic|Gothic_Revival_Architecture|  style. At the end of the 19th century, the  |Jugendstil|Art_Nouveau|  or  |Art_Nouveau|Art_Nouveau|  style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the  |Museum_Square|Museumplein|  in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the  |modern_era|Modern_History|  was  |Art_Deco|Art_Deco| . Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the  |Amsterdamse_School|Amsterdam_School| . Whole districts were built this style, such as the Rivierenbuurt.  A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.     The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.   Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the citys centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early   20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.   Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants houses lining the canals.               Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. The  |Vondelpark|Vondelpark| , the largest park in the city, is located in the  |Oud-Zuid|Amsterdam_Oud-Zuid|  neighbourhood and is named after the 17th-century Amsterdam author  |Joost_van_den_Vondel|Joost_Van_Den_Vondel| . Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground and several  |horeca|Horeca|  facilities. In the  |Zuid|Amsterdam-Zuid|  borough, is the Beatrixpark, named after  |Queen_Beatrix|Beatrix_Of_The_Netherlands| . Between Amsterdam and  |Amstelveen|Amstelveen|  is the  |Amsterdamse_Bos|Amsterdamse_Bos|  , the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5  million people visit the park, which has a size of 1.000 hectares and is approximately three times the size of  |Central_Park|Central_Park| .  .  |City_of_Amsterdam|Government_Of_Amsterdam| . Retrieved on 27 November 2008. The  |Amstelpark|Amstelpark|  in the  |Zuid|Amsterdam-Zuid|  borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include the  |Sarphatipark|Sarphatipark|  in the  |De_Pijp|De_Pijp|  neighbourhood, the  |Oosterpark|Oosterpark|  in the  |Oost|Amsterdam-Oost|  borough and the  |Westerpark|Westerpark|  in the  |Westerpark|Westerpark|  neighbourhood. The city has three beaches: Nemo Beach, Citybeach Het stenen hoofd and Blijburg, all located in the Centrum borough.     The city has many open squares . The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam,  |Dam_Square|Dam_Square| , is the main city square and has the  |Royal_Palace|Royal_Palace_Of_Amsterdam|  and  |National_Monument|National_Monument| .  |Museumplein|Museumplein|  hosts various museums, including the  |Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum| ,  |Van_Gogh_Museum|Van_Gogh_Museum| , and  |Stedelijk_Museum|Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam| .

Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.63  million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day-trippers visiting the city every year.  The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the citys centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005.  The majority of tourists originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated Rembrandt 400 , to celebrate the 400th birthday of  |Rembrandt_van_Rijn|Rembrandt| . Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.                De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a designated area for  |legalised_prostitution|Prostitution_In_The_Netherlands|  and is Amsterdams largest and most well known  |red-light_district|Red-Light_District| . This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by  |sex_workers|Sex_Worker|  who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

The first ballet performances in the Netherlands were given in Schouwburg in 1642 with the Ballet of the Five Senses.   In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera.  In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam . An improved  |metronome|Metronome|  was invented in 1812 by  |Dietrich_Nikolaus_Winkel|Dietrich_Nikolaus_Winkel| .

The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter.  The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail & Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A  |parking_garage|Multi-Storey_Car_Park|  can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.

The city of Amsterdam is a  |municipality|List_Of_Municipalities_Of_The_Netherlands|  under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected  |municipal_council|Municipal_Council| , a  |municipal_executive_board|College_Van_Burgemeester_En_Wethouders|  and a  |mayor|Burgemeester| . Since 1981, the  |municipality|List_Of_Municipalities_Of_The_Netherlands|  of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous  |boroughs|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam| , called stadsdelen or districts. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of  |Amsterdam_boroughs|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam|  was reduced to eight:  |Amsterdam-Centrum|Amsterdam-Centrum|  covering the city centre including the  |canal_belt|Canals_Of_Amsterdam| ,  |Amsterdam-Noord|Amsterdam-Noord|  consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the  |IJ_lake|Ij| ,  |Amsterdam-Oost|Amsterdam-Oost|  in the east,  |Amsterdam-Zuid|Amsterdam-Zuid|  in the south,  |Amsterdam-West|Amsterdam-West|  in the west,  |Amsterdam_Nieuw-West|Amsterdam_Nieuw-West|  in the far west,  |Amsterdam_Zuidoost|Amsterdam_Zuidoost|  in the southeast, and  |Westpoort|Westpoort|  covering the  |Port_of_Amsterdam|Port_Of_Amsterdam|  area.           As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected  |municipal_council|Municipal_Council| , a  |municipal_executive_board|College_Van_Burgemeester_En_Wethouders|  and a government appointed   |mayor|Burgemeester|  . The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board, but also has individual responsibilies in maintaining public order. On 27 June 2018,  |Femke_Halsema|Femke_Halsema|   was appointed as the first woman to be  |Mayor_of_Amsterdam|List_Of_Mayors_Of_Amsterdam|  by the  |Kings_Commissioner|Kings_Commissioner|  of  |North_Holland|North_Holland|  for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam  |municipal_council|Municipal_Council|  and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She replaces  |Eberhard_van_der_Laan|Eberhard_Van_Der_Laan|   who was the Mayor of Amsterdam from 2010 until his death in October 2017. After the  |2014_municipal_council_elections|Dutch_Municipal_Elections,_2014| , a governing majority of  |D66|Democrats_66| ,  |VVD|Peoples_Party_For_Freedom_And_Democracy|  and  |SP|Socialist_Party|  was formed – the first coalition without the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  since  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .  Next to the  |Mayor|Burgemeester| , the  |municipal_executive_board|College_Van_Burgemeester_En_Wethouders|  consists of eight wethouders appointed by the  |municipal_council|Municipal_Council| |D66|Democrats_66|  alderpersons, two  |VVD|Peoples_Party_For_Freedom_And_Democracy|  alderpersons and two  |SP|Socialist_Party|  alderpersons.      On 18 September 2017, it was announced by  |Eberhard_van_der_Laan|Eberhard_Van_Der_Laan|  in an open letter to Amsterdam citizens that  |Kajsa_Ollongren|Kajsa_Ollongren|  would take up his office as acting Mayor of Amsterdam with immediate effect due to ill health.  Ollongren was succeeded as acting Mayor by Eric van der Burg on 26 October 2017 and by  |Jozias_van_Aartsen|Jozias_Van_Aartsen|  on 4 December 2017.        Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight  |boroughs|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam| , called stadsdelen or districts, a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. The  |boroughs|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam|  are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of  |Amsterdam_boroughs|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam|  reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council , elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth,  |Westpoort|Westpoort| , covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.     Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the  |borough|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam|  system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the  |Amsterdam_boroughs|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam|  lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.     The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees . Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.             Amsterdam is usually understood to refer to the  |municipality|List_Of_Municipalities_Of_The_Netherlands|  of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of  |Durgerdam|Durgerdam| , may not be considered part of Amsterdam.      |Statistics_Netherlands|Statistics_Netherlands|  uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam , Greater Amsterdam  and the urban region Amsterdam . The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the Stadsregio Amsterdam . The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of  |Zaanstad|Zaanstad|  and  |Wormerland|Wormerland| . It excludes  |Graft-De_Rijp|Graft-De_Rijp| .     The smallest of these areas is the  |municipality|List_Of_Municipalities_Of_The_Netherlands|  of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013. The conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013. It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities, and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013. Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of  |Zaanstad|Zaanstad| . The largest area by population, the  |Amsterdam_Metropolitan_Area|Amsterdam_Metropolitan_Area|  , has a population of 2,33 million.  It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerland, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area  |Randstad|Randstad| , with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.      Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the Stadsregio Amsterdam has a formal governmental status. Its responsibities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions.              Under the  |Dutch_Constitution|Constitution_Of_The_Netherlands| , Amsterdam is the  |capital_of_the_Netherlands|Capital_Of_The_Netherlands| . Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions Amsterdam and capital in chapter 2, article 32: The kings confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in the capital Amsterdam .  Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned the city of Amsterdam .  For a royal investiture, therefore, the  |States_General_of_the_Netherlands|States_General_Of_The_Netherlands|  meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the  |Nieuwe_Kerk|Nieuwe_Kerk|  on  |Dam_Square|Dam_Square| , immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby  |Royal_Palace_of_Amsterdam|Royal_Palace_Of_Amsterdam| . Normally, however, the Parliament sits in  |The_Hague|The_Hague| , the city which has historically been the seat of the  |Dutch_government|Politics_Of_The_Netherlands| , the  |Dutch_monarchy|Monarchy_Of_The_Netherlands| , and the  |Dutch_supreme_court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_Netherlands| . Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.          The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three  |St_Andrews_crosses|Saltire| , aligned in a vertical band on the citys shield . These St Andrews crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours  |Amstelveen|Amstelveen|  and  |Ouder-Amstel|Ouder-Amstel| . This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the  |flag_of_Amsterdam|Flag_Of_Amsterdam| , flown by the city government, but also as  |civil_ensign|Civil_Ensign|  for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the  |Imperial_Crown_of_Austria|Imperial_Crown_Of_Austria| . In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans,  |Maximilian_I|Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the  |kings|King_Of_The_Romans|  crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilians  |imperial_crown|Imperial_Crown|  when he was crowned  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| . In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilians crown in Amsterdams coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of  |Emperor_Rudolph_II|Rudolf_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , a crown that became the Imperial  |Crown_of_Austria|Austrian_Crown_Jewels| . The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the  |Republic_of_the_Seven_United_Netherlands|Dutch_Republic| . Last came the citys official motto: Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig , bestowed on the city in 1947 by  |Queen_Wilhelmina|Wilhelmina_Of_The_Netherlands| , in recognition of the citys bravery during the Second World War.                       Currently, there are sixteen  |tram_routes|Trams_In_Amsterdam|  and five  |metro_routes|Amsterdam_Metro| . All are operated by municipal public transport operator  |Gemeentelijk_Vervoerbedrijf|Gemeentelijk_Vervoerbedrijf|  , which also runs the city bus network.     Four fare-free GVB ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the  |IJ_lake|Ij|  to the  |borough|Boroughs_Of_Amsterdam|  of  |Amsterdam-Noord|Amsterdam-Noord| , and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a  |boat_sharing|Boat_Sharing|  operation, electric rental boats and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdams waterways.     Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by  |Connexxion|Connexxion|  and  |EBS|Egged| . International coach services are provided by  |Eurolines|Eurolines|  from  |Amsterdam_Amstel_railway_station|Amsterdam_Amstel_Railway_Station| ,  |IDBUS|Idbus|  from  |Amsterdam_Sloterdijk_railway_station|Amsterdam_Sloterdijk_Railway_Station| , and  |Megabus|Megabus|  from the Zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city.     In order to facilitate easier transport to the center of Amsterdam, the city has various P+R Locations where people can park their car at an affordable price and transfer to one of the numerous public transport lines.        Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of  |Kilometre_Zero|Kilometre_Zero| , of the  |highway_system_of_the_Netherlands|List_Of_Motorways_In_The_Netherlands| ,  with freeways numbered One to Eight planned to originate from the city. The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads  |A1|A1_Motorway| ,  |A2|A2_Motorway| , and  |A4|A4_Motorway|  originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan. The  |A3|A3_Motorway|  to  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam|  was cancelled in 1970 in order to conserve the  |Groene_Hart|Groene_Hart| . Road  |A8|A8_Motorway| , leading north to  |Zaandam|Zaandam|  and the  |A10|A10_Motorway| |Ringroad|Beltway|  were opened between 1968 and 1974.  Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the  |A7|A7_Motorway|  and  |A6|A6_Motorway| , carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.     The  |A10_ringroad|A10_Motorway|  surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch  |national_network_of_freeways|List_Of_Motorways_In_The_Netherlands| .  |Interchanges|Interchange|  on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 city roads, numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without  |grade_separation|Grade_Separation| , and sometimes without a  |central_reservation|Central_Reservation| . Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 Centrumring is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the citys centre.     In the city centre, driving a car is discouraged. Parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are  |one-way|One-Way_Traffic| .
