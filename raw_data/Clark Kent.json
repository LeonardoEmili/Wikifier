Clarks middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, all being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.       In the earliest Superman comics, Clark Kents primary purpose was to fulfill the perceived dramatic requirement that a costumed superhero cannot remain on full duty all the time. Clark thus acted as little more than a front for Supermans activities. Although his name and history were taken from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the  Daily Planet , he receives late-breaking news before the general public, has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his story deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilitiesâ€”bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved.      To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a largely passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch.

As an added precaution, Superman would vibrate his face slightly , so that photographs would only show his features as a blur, thus preventing the danger of photographs of both identities being reliably compared.  However, more subsequent stories showing Superman being photographed have tended to ignore this factor. The 2004 series  Superman: Birthright  also explained that Supermans eyes are an inhumanly vivid shade of blue, which Clarks glasses diffuse to make his eyes appear more human. A subsequent explanation is the fact that most people only know of Clark as a name in a byline and only see Superman from a distance, if they see him at all. As most people do not spend much time with both Clark Kent and Superman, the similar appearances are not considered.   A variation of this idea was seen when Lex Luthor had a massive investigation carried out to determine the connection between Clark Kent and Superman; while the resulting data gathered allowed a computer to deduce that Clark Kent was Superman, Luthor dismissed that theory as he is psychologically incapable of understanding why Superman would want to be someone like Clark, believing that Superman would constantly revel in his power just because that is what Luthor would do.

Arriving as they put this disguise together, Lois Lane suggests the alternative of regular glasses and casual hair, on the grounds that the original look gave the impression that he had something to hide, while nobody would particularly pay attention to Kal-El when he looked like this.   Various stories over the decades often show Superman relying upon an imitator on occasions when Clark and Superman are required to appear together. The most prominent such means include:    Superman robot s, androids that physically resemble Superman in powers and appearance.  Superman robots were primarily used during the Silver Age, but were largely disposed of after the early 1970s.  Clark Kent robots were also maintained by Superman for similar purposes.    Batman disguising himself as either Clark or Superman. This was most often seen in Silver Age stories.    Shapeshifters have also aided Clark in protecting his secret identity. For example, after the Return of Superman storyline in the 1990s, Clark  was photographed besides Superman after Superman had returned from the dead, Matrix using her shape-shifting abilities to create the impression that Clark Kent had been trapped in an underground bunker during Doomsdays rampage to account for Clark and Supermans mutual absences.

But within a short time, Joe Shuster and his ghost artists began depicting Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the S insignia on his chestâ€”an image that became so iconic that other superheroes, during the Golden Age and later periods, would copy the same type of change during transformations.

As a dramatic plot device, Clark often has to quickly improvise in order to find a way to change unnoticed. For example, in Superman , Clark, unable to use a newer, open-kiosk pay phone , runs down the street and rips open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath. He quickly enters a revolving door, spinning through it at incredible speed while changing clothes. Thus made invisible, he appears to have entered the building as Clark Kent and exited seconds later as Superman. Later in the film, when the need to change is more urgent , he simply jumps out a window of the Daily Planet offices, changing at super-speed as he falls and flies off. Further films in the series continued this tradition, with Clark blurring into Superman, changing at super-speed while he runs.     In Lois & Clark, Clarks usual method of changing was to either suddenly remember something urgent that required his immediate attention or leave the room/area under the pretense of contacting a source, summoning the police, heading to a breaking storys location, etc. The change would then frequently occur off-screen, although the shirt-rip reveal was a prominently used move well-associated with the show. Clark also developed a method of rapidly spinning into his costume at super speed which became a trademark change, especially during the third and fourth seasons of the series, and extremely popular with the shows fans. An alternate universe Clark was shown to enter an empty room and emerge as Superman a moment later, although he did adopt the spinning move eventually at Lois advice.

He carries a backpack with him to work every day, containing his change of clothes. He begins to practice his speed change at home and at the Daily Planet. He changes in a superspeed spin in the Daily Planets phone booth and once even in his office chair. The last minute of the last episode of Smallville had Clark responding to an emergency, rushing to the top of the Daily Planet building, and then using the familiar shirt-rip while the camera zoomed in on the familiar S-logo to the original John Williams fanfare.          There is debate as to which of the two identities is the real person and which is the faÃ§ade. Fans and Superman scholars follow one of three interpretations:   Superman is real, Clark Kent the mask: Pre-Crisis interpretations of Superman assumed that Clark Kent was the mask and Kal-El the person . In one 1960s comic, when Kent finds himself at a loose end when staff at the  Daily Planet  go on strike, he seriously considers it a chance to try out a new identity in case he has to abandon Clark Kent role permanently . His options include becoming a full-time policeman or even a mere tramp whom no one would ever suspect of being the Man of Steel .

        ", the director of the first Reeve movie, stated that he believes Clark Kent to be the disguise .   Clark Kent is real, Superman the mask: With John Byrnes more assertive revamp of Clark Kent as well as Supermans greater grounding in Earth culture and humanity , Superman is considered the mask and Clark the person. This is made explicit by Clark himself in Superman 53, when following his revelation to Lois of his role as Superman , he states: Im Clark, the man you love. Superman is the creation  â€“ you named me, Lois. In pre-Crisis continuity, Kal-El was already a toddler before leaving Krypton, and retained memories of that childhood that later resurfaced, while, in Post-Crisis continuity, he was sent to Earth pre-natally in a birthing matrix  and raised entirely by the Kents. As a result of their rearing, Kal-El grows up to think of himself as Clark Kent, completely unaware of his alien heritage until he was well into adulthood . Although the morals instilled in him by the Kents have motivated Kal-El to use his abilities to help others, he developed the Superman persona to protect his Clark Kent identity. In the  Superman: The Animated Series  episode The Late Mr. Kent , wherein Clark Kent is presumed dead, Superman expresses frustration at the idea of not being Clark and having to be someone else instead . In a previous episode, the third part of the Last Son of Krypton arc, Jonathan Pa Kent assures his adoptive son that he will always be Clark Kent and that Superman just helps out every now and then. In the Tempus Fugitive episode of Lois & Clark, Clark attempts to persuade Lois that Superman does not define him: Superman is what I can do. Clark is who I am.   Neither Clark Kent nor Superman is the real person: Some versions of Superman explain that the Clark Kent and Superman identities are different facets of the same person. It has been implied, especially in the alternate future story  Kingdom Come , that the Clark Kent persona represents the values taught to him by his Midwestern parents. These values are what he holds most dear, giving him an instinctive knowledge of right and wrong that allows him to adopt his Superman persona without being consumed by the moral implications of his actions. Superman is the means through which he can bring this example to the world at large. At the storys climax, when Superman stands poised to destroy the United Nations, Norman McCay makes him realise that, when he abandoned Clark Kent fifteen years prior and retreated into his Superman self, he lost his instinctive morality, and thus the ability to be a heroic Superman. With this knowledge and a pair of glasses given to him as a gift by Wonder Woman, Clark regains his humanity and sets out to become a hero again by re-fertilizing the formerly-irradiated fields of Kansas.

Examples include the episodes Mystery of the Broken Statues, A Ghost for Scotland Yard, The Man in the Lead Mask, and The Golden Vulture. George Reeves Kent/Superman is also established as a champion of justice for the oppressed in episodes like The Unknown People and The Birthday Letter. Although Kent is described in the show introduction as mild-mannered , he can be very assertive, often giving orders to people and taking authoritative command of situations, though, as in the Pre-Crisis Superman stories at that time, Clark is still considered the secret identity. He gets people to trust his judgment very easily and has a good, often wisecracking, sense of humor.
