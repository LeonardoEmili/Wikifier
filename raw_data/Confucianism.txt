                   Confucianism, also known as Ruism, is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient  |China|China| . Variously described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life, Confucianism developed from what was later called the  |Hundred_Schools_of_Thought|Hundred_Schools_Of_Thought|  from the teachings of the  |Chinese_philosopher|Chinese_Philosophy| |Confucius|Confucius|  .     Confucius considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of  |the_theology_and_values|Chinese_Theology|  inherited from the  |Shang|Shang_Dynasty|  and  |Zhou_dynasties|Zhou_Dynasty|  for the  |Warring_States_period|Warring_States_Period| . Confucianism was suppressed during the  |Legalist|Legalism|  and autocratic  |Qin_dynasty|Qin_Dynasty|  , but survived. During the  |Han_dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  , Confucian approaches edged out the proto-Taoist  |Huang–Lao|Huang–Lao|  as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism.      A Confucian revival began during the  |Tang_dynasty|Tang_Dynasty|  . In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to  |Buddhism|Buddhism|  and Taoism and was reformulated as  |Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism| . This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the  |imperial_exams|Imperial_Exams|  and the core philosophy of the  |scholar_official_class|Scholar-Officials|  in the  |Song_dynasty|Song_Dynasty|  . The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the  |New_Culture_Movement|New_Culture_Movement|  of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for Chinas weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the  |Three_Principles_of_the_People|Three_Principles_Of_The_People|  with the establishment of the  |Republic_of_China|Republic_Of_China| , and then  |Maoism|Maoism|  under the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| . In the late twentieth century Confucian  |work_ethic|Work_Ethic|  has been credited with the rise of the  |East_Asian_economy|Economy_Of_East_Asia| .     With particular emphasis on the importance of the family and social harmony, rather than on an otherworldly source of spiritual values, the core of Confucianism is  |humanistic|Humanism| . . According to  |Herbert_Fingarettes|Herbert_Fingarette|  conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which regards the  |secular|Secularity|  as  |sacred|Sacred|  , Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism, considering the ordinary activities of human life—and especially human relationships—as a manifestation of the sacred, because they are the expression of humanitys moral nature , which has a transcendent anchorage in  |Heaven|Tian|   and unfolds through an appropriate respect for the spirits or gods  of the world. While Tiān has some characteristics that overlap the category of godhead, it is primarily an impersonal  |absolute_principle|Absolute| , like the  Dào  or the  Brahman . Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of the Tiān. Confucian liturgy  led by Confucian priests or sages of rites  to worship the gods in public and ancestral  |Chinese_temples|Chinese_Temple|  is preferred on certain occasions, by Confucian religious groups and for civil religious rites, over Taoist or popular ritual.     The worldly concern of Confucianism rests upon the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor, especially self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue in a morally organised world. Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include rén, yì, and lǐ, and zhì. Rén is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven. Yì is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. Lǐ is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven. Zhì is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of rén and yì.     Traditionally, cultures and countries in the  |Chinese_cultural_sphere|East_Asian_Cultural_Sphere|  are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including mainland  |China|Culture_Of_China| ,  |Taiwan|Culture_Of_Taiwan| ,  |Hong_Kong|Culture_Of_Hong_Kong| ,  |Macau|Culture_Of_Macau| ,  |Korea|Culture_Of_Korea| ,  |Japan|Culture_Of_Japan| , and  |Vietnam|Culture_Of_Vietnam| , as well as various territories settled predominantly by  |Chinese_people|Han_Chinese| , such as  |Singapore|Culture_Of_Singapore| . Today, it has been credited for shaping  |East_Asia|East_Asia| n societies and  |Chinese_communities|Overseas_Chinese| , and to some extent, other parts of  |Asia|Asia| .   In the last decades there have been talks of a Confucian Revival in the academic and the scholarly community, Benjamin Elman, John Duncan and Herman Ooms ed. Rethinking Confucianism: Past and Present in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam . Yu Yingshi, Xiandai Ruxue Lun . and there has been a grassroots proliferation of various types of  |Confucian_churches|Confucian_Churches| . In late 2015  |many_Confucian_personalities|Holy_Confucian_Churchfounding_Members|  formally established a national  |Holy_Confucian_Church|Holy_Confucian_Church|   in China to unify the many Confucian congregations and civil society organisations.          Strictly speaking, there is no term in Chinese which directly corresponds to Confucianism . In the Chinese language, the character rú 儒 meaning scholar or learned or refined man is generally used both in the past and the present to refer to things related to Confucianism. The character rú in ancient China had diverse meanings. Some examples include to tame , to mould , to educate , to refine .   Several different terms, some of which with modern origin, are used in different situations to express different facets of Confucianism, including:    – ru school of thought ;    – ru religion in the sense of ru doctrine ;    – Ruology or ru learning ;    – Confuciuss doctrine ;    – Kong familys business , a pejorative phrase used in the  |New_Culture_Movement|New_Culture_Movement|  and the  |Cultural_Revolution|Cultural_Revolution| .     Three of them use rú. These names do not use the name Confucius at all, but instead focus on the ideal of the Confucian man. The use of the term Confucianism has been avoided by some modern scholars, who favor Ruism and Ruists instead. Robert Eno argues that the term has been burdened... with the ambiguities and irrelevant traditional associations . Ruism, as he states, is more faithful to the original Chinese name for the school.      According to  |Zhou_Youguang|Zhou_Youguang| , 儒 rú originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confuciuss times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by  |Mencius|Mencius|  and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.
