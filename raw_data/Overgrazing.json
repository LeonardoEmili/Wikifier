Hardins example could only apply to unregulated use of land regarded as a common resource.     Normally, rights of use of Common land in England and Wales were, and still are, closely regulated, and available only to commoners . If excessive use was made of common land, for example in overgrazing, a common would be stinted , that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure; thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. This important part of actual historic practice was absent from the economic model of Hardin.
