The Arabs translated Hindu texts on numerology and spread them to the western world due to their trade links with them. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India.

A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b then a marks the end of the number , so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b–9 , therefore the weight b 1 is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c , then the third digit has a weight 34 × 35 1190 and we have the following sequence:     a , ba , ca , .., 9a , bb , cb , .., 9b , bca , .., 99a , bcb , etc.     Unlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed – the a would terminate the number.
