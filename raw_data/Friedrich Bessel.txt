     Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel  was a  |German|Germany| |_astronomer|Astronomer| ,  |mathematician|Mathematician| ,  |physicist|Physicist|  and  |geodesist|Geodesy| . He was the first astronomer who determined reliable values for the distance from the sun to another star by the method of  |parallax|Parallax| . A special type of mathematical functions were named  |Bessel_functions|Bessel_Function|  after Bessels death, though they had originally been discovered by  |Daniel_Bernoulli|Daniel_Bernoulli|  and then generalised by Bessel.         Bessel was born in  |Minden|Minden| ,  |Westphalia|Westphalia| , administrative center of  |Minden_Ravensberg|Minden_Ravensberg| , as second son of a civil servant. He was born into a large family in Germany. At the age of 14 Bessel was apprenticed to the import-export concern Kulenkamp at  |Bremen|Bremen| . The businesss reliance on cargo ships led him to turn his  |mathematical|Mathematics|  skills to problems in  |navigation|Navigation| . This in turn led to an interest in  |astronomy|Astronomy|  as a way of determining  |longitude|Longitude| .     Bessel came to the attention of a major figure of German astronomy at the time,  |Heinrich_Wilhelm_Olbers|Heinrich_Wilhelm_Olbers| , by producing a refinement on the orbital calculations for  |Halleys_Comet|Halleys_Comet|  in 1804, using old observation data taken from  |Thomas_Harriot|Thomas_Harriot|  and  |Nathaniel_Torporley|Nathaniel_Torporley|  in 1607.     Two years later Bessel left Kulenkamp and became  |Johann_Hieronymus_Schröters|Johann_Hieronymus_Schröter|  assistant at  |Lilienthal|Lilienthal_Lower_Saxony|  Observatory near  |Bremen|Bremen| . There he worked on  |James_Bradleys|James_Bradley|  stellar observations to produce precise positions for some 3,222 stars.     In January 1810, at the age of 25, Bessel was appointed director of the newly founded  |Königsberg_Observatory|Königsberg_Observatory|  by King  |Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia|Frederick_William_Iii_Of_Prussia| . On the recommendation of fellow mathematician and physicist  |Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|  Clifford J. Cunningham, Bodes Law and the Discovery of Juno: Historical Studies in Asteroid Research, Springer, 2017, pp. 121ff.. he was awarded an honorary doctor degree from the  |University_of_Göttingen|University_Of_Göttingen|  in March 1811.     Around that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence.

However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are not known. Oscar Sheynin, , Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 88.     In 1842 Bessel took part in the annual meeting of the  |British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science|British_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Science|  in Manchester, accompanied by the geophysicist  |Georg_Adolf_Erman|Georg_Adolf_Erman|  and the mathematician  |Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi|Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi| .     Bessel married Johanna, the daughter of the chemist and pharmacist  |Karl_Gottfried_Hagen|Karl_Gottfried_Hagen|  who was the uncle of the physician and biologist  |Hermann_August_Hagen|Hermann_August_Hagen|  and the hydraulic engineer  |Gotthilf_Hagen|Gotthilf_Hagen| , the latter also Bessels student and assistant from 1816 to 1818. The physicist  |Franz_Ernst_Neumann|Franz_Ernst_Neumann| , Bessels close companion and colleague, was married to Johanna Hagens sister Florentine. Neumann introduced Bessels exacting methods of measurement and data reduction into his mathematico-physical seminar, which he co-directed with  |Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi|Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi|  at Königsberg.  These exacting methods had a lasting impact upon the work of Neumanns students and upon the Prussian conception of precision in measurement.     Bessel had two sons and three daughters. His eldest daughter, Marie, married Georg Adolf Erman, member of the scholar family  |Erman|Erman| . One of their sons was the renowned  |Egyptologist|Egyptologist| |_Adolf_Erman|Adolf_Erman| .     After several months of illness Bessel died in March 1846 at his observatory from  |retroperitoneal_fibrosis|Retroperitoneal_Fibrosis| .             While the observatory was still in construction Bessel elaborated the Fundamenta Astronomiae based on Bradleys observations. As a preliminary result he produced tables of  |atmospheric_refraction|Atmospheric_Refraction|  that won him the  |Lalande_Prize|Lalande_Prize|  from the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in 1811. The Königsberg Observatory began operation in 1813.     Starting in 1819, Bessel determined the position of over 50,000 stars using a  |meridian_circle|Meridian_Circle|  from  |Reichenbach|Georg_Von_Reichenbach| , assisted by some of his qualified students. The most prominent of them was  |Friedrich_Wilhelm_Argelander|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Argelander| .     With this work done, Bessel was able to achieve the feat for which he is best remembered today: he is credited with being the first to use the  |stellar_parallax|Stellar_Parallax|  in  |calculating_the_distance_to_a_star|Cosmic_Distance_Ladder| . Astronomers had believed for some time that parallax would provide the first accurate measurement of interstellar distances. In 1838 Bessel announced that  |61_Cygni|61_Cygni|  had a parallax of 0.314  |arcseconds|Arcsecond| ; which, given the diameter of the  |Earths|Earth|  orbit, indicated that the star is 10.3  |ly|Light_Year|  away.    Given the current measurement of 11.4 ly, Bessels figure had an error of 9.6%. Nearly at the same time  |Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_Struve|Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_Struve|  and  |Thomas_Henderson|Thomas_James_Henderson|  measured the parallaxes of  |Vega|Vega|  and  |Alpha_Centauri|Alpha_Centauri| .     As well as helping determine the parallax of 61 Cygni, Bessels precise measurements using a new meridian circle from Adolf Repsold allowed him to notice deviations in the motions of  |Sirius|Sirius|  and  |Procyon|Procyon| , which he deduced must be caused by the gravitational attraction of unseen companions.                  His announcement of Siriuss dark companion in 1844 was the first correct claim of a previously unobserved companion by positional measurement, and eventually led to the discovery of  |Sirius_B|Sirius_B| .     Bessel was the first scientist who realized the effect later called  personal equation , that several simultaneously observing persons determine slightly different values, especially recording the transition time of stars.          In 1824, Bessel developed a new method for calculation the circumstances of eclipses using the so-called  |Besselian_elements|Besselian_Elements| . His method simplified the calculation to such an extent, without sacrificing accuracy, that it is still in use today.     Bessels work in 1840 contributed to the  |discovery_of_Neptune|Discovery_Of_Neptune|  in 1846 at  |Berlin_Observatory|Berlin_Observatory| , several months after Bessels death. On Bessels proposal the  |Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences|Prussian_Academy_Of_Sciences|  started the edition of the Berliner Akademische Sternkarten  as an international project. One unpublished new chart enabled  |Johann_Gottfried_Galle|Johann_Gottfried_Galle|  to find Neptune near the position calculated by LeVerrier in 1846.     In the second decade of the 19th century while studying the dynamics of many-body gravitational systems, Bessel developed what are now known as  |Bessel_functions|Bessel_Function| . Critical for the solution of certain  |differential_equations|Differential_Equations| , these functions are used throughout both classical and  |quantum_physics|Quantum_Physics| .     Bessel is responsible for the correction to the formula for the  |sample_variance|Sample_Variance|  estimator named in his honour. This is the use of the factor n  −  1 in the denominator of the formula, rather than just n. This occurs when the sample mean rather than the population mean is used to centre the data and since the sample mean is a linear combination of the data the residual to the sample mean overcounts the number of degrees of freedom by the number of constraint equations — in this case one. .     An additional field of work was  |geodesy|Geodesy| .    Bessel published a method for solving the main    |geodesic_problem|Geodesics_On_An_Ellipsoid| .    He was responsible for the survey of East Prussia which joined the Prussian and Russian triangulation networks    and he obtained an estimate of increased accuracy for the  |figure_of_the_Earth|Figure_Of_The_Earth| ,   nowadays referred to as the  |Bessel_ellipsoid|Bessel_Ellipsoid| .       Despite lacking a university education, Bessel was a major figure in astronomy during his lifetime. He was elected as member of the  |Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences|Prussian_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in 1812, the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in 1816, foreign member of the  |Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences|Royal_Swedish_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in 1823, and fellow of the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  in 1825. In 1832, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the  |American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|American_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences| .  In 1827 Bessel became member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, predecessor of the  |Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|Royal_Netherlands_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences| .      Bessel won the  |Gold_Medal_of_the_Royal_Astronomical_Society|Gold_Medal_Of_The_Royal_Astronomical_Society|  twice in 1829 and 1841.     The largest  |crater|Bessel|  in the Moons  |Mare_Serenitatis|Mare_Serenitatis|  and the  |main_belt|Main_Belt|  asteroid  |1552_Bessel|1552_Nbsp_Bessel| , as well as two fjords in Greenland,  |Bessel_Fjord_NE_Greenland|Bessel_Fjord|  and  |Bessel_Fjord_NW_Greenland|Bessel_Fjord_Nw_Greenland| , were named in his honour.         ;Latin             ;German              I.
