                 Recursion  occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from  |linguistics|Linguistics|  to  |logic|Logic| . The most common application of recursion is in  |mathematics|Mathematics|  and  |computer_science|Computer_Science| , where a  |function|Function|  being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances , it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.          In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibits recursive behavior when it can be defined by two properties:   A simple base case — a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer   A recursive step — a set of rules that reduces all other cases toward the base case     For example, the following is a recursive definition of a persons ancestors:   Ones parents are ones ancestors .   The ancestors of ones ancestors are also ones ancestors .     The  |Fibonacci_sequence|Fibonacci_Sequence|  is another classic example of recursion:                   /math  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Drucker2008  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name ns02  /ref  ref nameHunter  /ref  ref nameHunter/  ref  /ref  math /math  math /math  math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  source lang c .
