In  |statistics|Statistics| , a location family is a class of  |probability_distributions|Probability_Distribution|  that is  |parametrized|Statistical_Parameter|  by a scalar- or vector-valued parameter x0 , which determines the location or shift of the distribution. Formally, this means that the  |probability_density_functions|Probability_Density_Function|  or  |probability_mass_functions|Probability_Mass_Function|  in this class have the form   : f f.    Here, x0 is called the location parameter. Examples of location parameters include the  |mean|Mean| , the  |median|Median| , and the  |mode|Mode| .     Thus in the one-dimensional case if x0 is increased, the probability density or mass function shifts rigidly to the right, maintaining its exact shape.     A location parameter can also be found in families having more than one parameter, such as  |location–scale_families|Location–Scale_Family| . In this case, the probability density function or probability mass function will be a special case of the more general form   : f f    where x0 is the location parameter, θ represents additional parameters, and f  is a function parametrized on the additional parameters.       An alternative way of thinking of location families is through the concept of  |additive_noise|Additive_Noise| . If x0 is a constant and W is random  |noise|Noise|.
