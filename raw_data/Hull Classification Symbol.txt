           The  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy| ,  |United_States_Coast_Guard|United_States_Coast_Guard| , and United States  |National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration|National_Oceanic_And_Atmospheric_Administration|  use a hull classification symbol  to identify their ships by type and by individual ship within a type. The system is analogous to the  |pennant_number|Pennant_Number|  system that the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  and other European and  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  navies use.           The U.S. Navy began to assign unique  |Naval_Registry_Identification_Numbers|Naval_Registry_Identification_Number|  to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ships name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the  |battleship|Battleship| |Indiana|Uss_Indiana|  was USS Indiana , the  |cruiser|Cruiser| |Olympia|Uss_Olympia|  was USS Olympia , and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes—for example, USS Indiana could be referred to as USS Indiana and USS Olympia could also be referred to as USS Olympia , while USS Pennsylvania could be referred to as USS Pennsylvania . However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.     During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as  |patrol_vessels|Patrol_Vessel| ,  |mine_warfare_vessels|Minelayer| , and various types of naval  |auxiliary_ships|Auxiliary_Ship| , some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received  |section_patrol|Section_Patrol|  numbers , while those intended for other purposes received identification numbers , generally abbreviated Id. No. or ID; some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service never were acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an SP-435 and an Id. No 435 . The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boats or ships name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as hull codes or hull numbers, it was used in a similar manner to todays system and can be considered its precursor. Naval History and heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images .       The  |United_States_Revenue_Cutter_Service|United_States_Revenue_Cutter_Service| , which merged with the  |United_States_Lifesaving_Service|United_States_Lifesaving_Service|  in January 1915 to form the modern  |United_States_Coast_Guard|United_States_Coast_Guard| , began following the Navys lead in the 1890s, with its  |cutters|United_States_Coast_Guard_Cutter|  having parenthetical numbers called  |Naval_Registry_Identification_Numbers|Naval_Registry_Identification_Number|  following their names, such as , etc. This persisted until the Navys modern hull classification systems introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.         Like the U.S. Navy, the  |United_States_Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey|United_States_Coast_And_Geodetic_Survey|  – a uniformed seagoing service of the  |United_States_Government|United_States_Government|  and a predecessor of the  |National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration|National_Oceanic_And_Atmospheric_Administration|  – adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, Category I  |oceanographic|Oceanography| |survey_ships|Survey_Ship| , were classified as ocean survey ships and given the designation OSS . Intermediate-sized Category II oceanographic survey ships received the designation MSS for medium survey ship, and smaller Category III oceanographic survey ships were given the classification CSS for coastal survey ship. A fourth designation, ASV for auxiliary survey vessel, included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named Pioneer was an ocean survey ship officially known as  |USC_&_GS_Pioneer|Usc_&_Gs_Pioneer| .   The Coast and Geodetic Surveys system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Surveys fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.             The U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, identification numbers , and the other numbering systems described above. In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.     The combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser  was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship. Derdall and DiGiulian,      Hull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the  |aircraft_carrier|Aircraft_Carrier|   and BB-1 was the battleship .     Ship types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The  |Naval_Vessel_Register|Naval_Vessel_Register|  maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.     After  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a  |frigate|Frigate|  as a type of surface warship larger than a  |destroyer|Destroyer|  and smaller than a cruiser. In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a  |flotilla_leader|Flotilla_Leader|  , or destroyer leader . Hence the U.S. Navys use of DL for frigate prior to 1975, while frigates in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a  |destroyer_escort|Destroyer_Escort|  ,  |ocean_escort|Ocean_Escort|  , or DE . The  |United_States_Navy_1975_ship_reclassification|United_States_Navy_1975_Ship_Reclassification|  of  |cruisers|Cruiser| , frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived  |cruiser_gap|United_States_Navy_1975_Ship_Reclassificationthe_Cruiser_Gap|  with the  |Soviet_Navy|Soviet_Navy|  by redesignating the former frigates as cruisers .       If a U.S. Navy ships hull classification symbol begins with T- , it is part of the  |Military_Sealift_Command|Military_Sealift_Command| , has a primarily civilian crew, and is a  |United_States_Naval_Ship|United_States_Naval_Ship|  in non-commissioned service – as opposed to a  |commissioned|Ship_Commissioning| |United_States_Ship|United_States_Ship|  with an all-military crew.       If a ships hull classification symbol begins with W , it is a ship of the  |United_States_Coast_Guard|United_States_Coast_Guard| . Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a W to their beginning. In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for  |high_endurance_cutter|High_Endurance_Cutter|  and WMEC for  |medium_endurance_cutter|Medium_Endurance_Cutter|  .       The  |National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration|National_Oceanic_And_Atmospheric_Administration|  , a component of the  |United_States_Department_of_Commerce|United_States_Department_Of_Commerce| , includes the  |National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration_Commissioned_Officer_Corps|National_Oceanic_And_Atmospheric_Administration_Commissioned_Officer_Corps|  , one of the seven  |uniformed_services_of_the_United_States|Uniformed_Services_Of_The_United_States| , and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The  |NOAA_fleet|Noaa_Ships_And_Aircraft|  also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls hull numbers, for its ships.     After NOAA took over the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with research vessels of other government agencies, it adopted a new system of ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories,  |research_ships|Research_Ship|  and  |survey_ships|Survey_Ship| . The research ships, which include  |oceanographic|Oceanography|  and  |fisheries|Fishery|  research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with R , while the survey ships, generally  |hydrographic|Hydrography|  survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with S . The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA class of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ships  |gross_ton|Gross_Ton| nage and  |horsepower|Horsepower| , while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.     Generally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example,  or . Wertheim, The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems, p. 1005.     Unlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, S 222 was assigned to , then assigned to NOAAS Thomas Jefferson , which entered NOAA service after Mount Mitchell was stricken.         The U.S. Navys system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows of most U.S. Navy ships.     The ship designator and hull number systems roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging Steel Navy . During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navys clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the Jeffersonian Gunboats of the early 1800s and the Tinclad river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.     It is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, DD does not stand for anything more than Destroyer . SS simply means Submarine . And FF is the post-1975 type code for Frigate.      The hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B        Warships are designed to participate in combat operations.     The origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes. Derdall and DiGiulian,           Aircraft carriers are ships designed primarily for the purpose of conducting combat operations by aircraft which engage in attacks against airborne, surface, sub-surface and shore targets. Contrary to popular belief, the CV hull classification symbol does not stand for carrier vessel . CV derives from the cruiser designation, with the v for French voler, to fly  . Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS  Langley  to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, CVE for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1  |Long_Island|Uss_Long_Island|  to CVE-127  |Okinawa|Uss_Okinawa|  before being discontinued.

The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers. Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so. Before 1920, ships were called no. X , with the type fully pronounced. The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to B-X , C-X , D-X et cetera—for example, before 1920,  would have been called USS Minnesota, Battleship number  22 orally and USS Minnesota, B-22 in writing. After 1920, the ships name would have been both written and pronounced USS Minnesota .

DL: Destroyer Leader   DLG: Frigate, Guided Missile   DLGN: Frigate, Guided Missile, Nuclear-Propulsion The DL category was established in 1951 with the abolition of the CLK category. CLK 1 became DL 1 and DD 927–930 became DL 2–5. By the mid-1950s the term Destroyer Leader had been dropped in favor of Frigate. Most DLGs and DLGNs were reclassified as CGs and CGNs, 30 June 1975. However, DLG 6–15 became DDG 37–46. The old DLs were already gone by that time. Only applied to .

Hull designations will be changed from LCS to FF; existing LCSs back-fitted with modifications may also earn the FF label.  – News.USNI.org, 15 January 2015 The Navy is hoping to start retrofitting technological upgrades onto existing and under construction LCSs before 2019.  – Military.com, 4 March 2015   M:  |Monitor|Monitor|    TB:  |Torpedo_boat|Torpedo_Boat|        Submarines are all self-propelled submersible types regardless of whether employed as combatant, auxiliary, or research and development vehicles which have at least a residual combat capability. While some classes, including all diesel-electric submarines, are retired from USN service, non-U.S. navies continue to employ SS, SSA, SSAN, SSB, SSC, SSG, SSM, and SST types. Russia still employs several SSA and SSAN class submarines like the Delta Stretch as well as one SST, China has older SSB and SSG types such as the Golf and Mod Romeo classes, and North Korea has built many SSCs and SSMs. See 2007–2008 Janes Fighting Ships. With the advent of new  |Air_Independent_Propulsion|Air_Independent_Propulsion| /Power systems, both SSI and SSP are used to distinguish the types within the USN, but SSP has been declared the preferred term. SSK, retired by the USN, continues to be used colloquially and interchangeably with SS for diesel-electric attack/patrol submarines within the USN, and, more formally, by the Royal Navy and British firms such as  |Janes_Information_Group|Janes_Information_Group| .
