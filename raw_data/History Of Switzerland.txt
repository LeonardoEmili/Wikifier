   Since 1848 the  |Swiss_Confederation|Swiss_Confederation|  has been a  |federal_republic|Federal_Republic|  of relatively autonomous  |cantons|Cantons_Of_Switzerland| , some of which have a history of confederacy that goes back more than 700 years, putting them among the worlds oldest surviving  |republics|Republic| .     The  |early_history|Early_History_Of_Switzerland|  of the region is tied to that of  |Alpine_culture|History_Of_The_Alps| . Switzerland was inhabited by the Helvetii, and it came under  |Roman_rule|Switzerland_In_The_Roman_Era|  in the 1st century BC.  |Gallo-Roman_culture|Gallo-Roman_Culture|  was amalgamated with  |Germanic_influence|Migration_Period|  during  |Late_Antiquity|Late_Antiquity| , with the eastern part of Switzerland becoming  |Alemanni|Alemanni| c territory. The area of Switzerland was incorporated in the  |Frankish_Empire|Frankish_Empire|  in the 6th century. In the high medieval period, the eastern part became part of the  |Duchy_of_Swabia|Duchy_Of_Swabia|  within the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  while the western part was part of  |Burgundy|Kingdom_Of_Burgundy| .     The  |Old_Swiss_Confederacy|Old_Swiss_Confederacy|  in the late medieval period    established its independence from the  |House_of_Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg|  and the  |Duchy_of_Burgundy|Duchy_Of_Burgundy| , and in the  |Italian_Wars|Italian_Wars|  gained territory  |south_of_the_Alps|Transalpine_Campaigns_Of_The_Old_Swiss_Confederacy|  from the  |Duchy_of_Milan|Duchy_Of_Milan| .   The  |Swiss_Reformation|Swiss_Reformation|  divided the Confederacy and resulted in a drawn-out history of internal strife between the  Thirteen Cantons  in the  |Early_Modern_period|Early_Modern_Switzerland| .   In the wake of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| , Switzerland fell to a  |French_invasion|French_Invasion_Of_Switzerland|  in 1798 and was reformed into the  |Helvetic_Republic|Helvetic_Republic| , a French client state. Napoleons  Act of Mediation  in 1803 restored the status of Switzerland as a Confederation, and after the end of the Napoleonic period, the Swiss Confederation underwent a period of  |turmoil|Restoration_And_Regeneration_In_Switzerland|  culminating in a  |brief_civil_war|Sonderbund_War|  in 1847 and the creation of a  |federal_constitution|Switzerland_As_A_Federal_State|  in 1848.     The  |history_of_Switzerland_since_1848|Modern_History_Of_Switzerland|  has been largely one of success and prosperity.  |Industrialisation|Industrialisation|  transformed the traditionally agricultural economy, and  |Swiss_neutrality|Swiss_Neutrality| |during_the_World_Wars|Switzerland_During_The_World_Wars|  and the success of the  |banking_industry|Banking_In_Switzerland|  furthered the ascent of Switzerland to its status as one of the worlds  |most_stable_economies|Economy_Of_Switzerland| .     Switzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community|  in 1972, and has participated in the process of  |European_integration|European_Integration|  by way of  |bilateral_treaties|Switzerland–European_Union_Relations| , but it has notably resisted full accession to the  |European_Union|European_Union|  even though its territory has been surrounded by EU member states since 1995.                  |Archeological|Archeology|  evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers were already settled in the lowlands north of the  |Alps|Swiss_Alps|  in the  |Middle_Paleolithic|Middle_Paleolithic|  period 150,000 years ago.  By the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  period, the area was relatively densely populated. Remains of  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| |pile_dwellings|Pile_Dwelling|  from as early as 3800 BC  have been found in the shallow areas of many lakes. Around 1500 BC,  |Celt|Celt| ic tribes settled in the area. The  |Raetia|Raetia| ns lived in the eastern regions, while the west was occupied by the  |Helvetii|Helvetii| .              In 58 BC, the Helvetii tried to evade migratory pressure from  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples|  by moving into  |Gaul|Gaul| , but were defeated by  |Julius_Caesars|Julius_Caesar|  armies and then sent back. The alpine region became integrated into the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  and was extensively romanized in the course of the following centuries. The center of Roman administration was at Aventicum . In 259,  |Alamanni|Alamanni|  tribes overran the  |Limes|Germanic_Limes| , putting the settlements on Swiss territory on the frontier of the Roman Empire.          The first Christian bishoprics were founded in the fourth century.     With the  |fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire|Decline_Of_The_Roman_Empire| , Germanic tribes entered the area.  |Burgundians|Burgundians|  settled in the west; while in the north,  |Alamanni|Alamanni|  settlers slowly forced the earlier Celto-Roman population to retreat into the mountains. Burgundy became a part of the kingdom of the  |Franks|Franks|  in 534; two years later, the dukedom of the Alamans followed suit. In the Alaman-controlled region, only isolated Christian communities continued to exist and  |Irish_monks|Hiberno-Scottish_Mission|  re-introduced the Christian faith in the early 7th century.          Under the  |Carolingian|Carolingian|  kings, the  |feudal_system|Feudalism|  proliferated, and monasteries and bishoprics were important bases for maintaining the rule. The  |Treaty_of_Verdun|Treaty_Of_Verdun|  of 843 assigned  |Upper_Burgundy|Upper_Burgundy|  to  |Lotharingia|Lotharingia| , and  |Alemannia|Alemannia|  to the eastern kingdom of  |Louis_the_German|Louis_The_German|  which would become part of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .     In the 10th century, as the rule of the Carolingians waned,  |Magyars|Magyars|  destroyed  |Basel|Basel|  in 917 and  |St._Gallen|St._Gallen|  in 926. Only after the victory of King  |Otto_I|Otto_I_The_Great|  over the Magyars in 955 in the  |Battle_of_Lechfeld|Battle_Of_Lechfeld| , were the Swiss territories reintegrated into the empire.     In the 12th century, the dukes of  |Zähringen|House_Of_Zähringen|  were given authority over part of the Burgundy territories which covered the western part of modern Switzerland. They founded many cities, including  |Fribourg|Fribourg|  in 1157, and  |Bern|Bern|  in 1191. The Zähringer dynasty ended with the death of  |Berchtold_V|Berchtold_V_Of_Zähringen|  in 1218, and their cities subsequently became  reichsfrei  , while the dukes of  |Kyburg|House_Of_Kyburg|  competed with the house of  |Habsburg|Habsburg|  over control of the rural regions of the former Zähringer territory.     Under the  |Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen|  rule, the alpine passes in Raetia and the  |St_Gotthard_Pass|St_Gotthard_Pass|  gained importance. The latter especially became an important direct route through the mountains.  |Uri|Canton_Of_Uri|  and  |Schwyz|Canton_Of_Schwyz|  were accorded the  Reichsfreiheit  to grant the empire direct control over the mountain pass. Most of the territory of  |Unterwalden|Unterwalden|  at this time belonged to monasteries which had previously become reichsfrei.     The extinction of the  |Kyburg|House_Of_Kyburg|  dynasty paved the way for the Habsburg dynasty to bring much of the territory south of the Rhine under their control, aiding their rise to power.  |Rudolph_of_Habsburg|Rudolph_I_Of_Germany| , who became King of Germany in 1273, effectively revoked the status of Reichsfreiheit granted to the Forest Cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden. The Forest Cantons thus lost their independent status and were governed by  |reeves|Vogt| .                      On 1 August 1291, the cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden united to defend the peace upon the death of Emperor Rudolf I of Habsburg, forming the nucleus of the  |Old_Swiss_Confederacy|Old_Swiss_Confederacy| .     By 1353, the three original cantons had been joined by the cantons of  |Glarus|Canton_Of_Glarus|  and  |Zug|Canton_Of_Zug|  and the city states of  |Lucerne|Lucerne| ,  |Zürich|Zürich| , and  |Bern|Bern| , forming the Old Federation of eight states that persisted during much of the 15th century.   At the battle of  |Sempach|Battle_Of_Sempach|  1386, the Swiss defeated the Habsburgs, gaining increased autonomy within the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .     Zürich was expelled from the Confederation from 1440 to 1450 due to a conflict over the territory of  |Toggenburg|Toggenburg|  . The Confederations power and wealth increased significantly, with victories over  |Charles_the_Bold|Charles_The_Bold|  of  |Burgundy|Duchy_Of_Burgundy|  during the 1470s and the success of Swiss  |mercenaries|Mercenary| .     The traditional listing order of the  |cantons_of_Switzerland|Cantons_Of_Switzerland|  reflects this state, listing the eight Old Cantons first, with the city states preceding the founding cantons, followed by cantons that joined the Confederation after 1481, in historical order.     The Swiss defeated the  |Swabian_League|Swabian_League|  in 1499 and gained greater collective autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, including exemption from the Imperial reforms of 1495 and immunity from most Imperial courts. In 1506, Pope  |Julius_II|Julius_Ii|  engaged the  |Swiss_Guard|Swiss_Guard| , which continues to serve the papacy to the present day. The expansion of the Confederation and the reputation of invincibility acquired during the earlier wars suffered a first setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the  |Battle_of_Marignano|Battle_Of_Marignano| .            The  |Reformation_in_Switzerland|Reformation_In_Switzerland|  began in 1523, led by  |Huldrych_Zwingli|Huldrych_Zwingli| , priest of the  |Great_Minster_church|Great_Minster_Church|  in Zürich since 1518. Zürich adopted the  |Protestant|Protestant|  religion, joined by Berne, Basel, and Schaffhausen, while Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Zug, Fribourg and Solothurn remained Catholic. Glarus and Appenzell were split. This led to multiple inter-cantonal religious wars  in 1529 and 1531, because each canton usually made the opposing religion illegal, and to the formation of two diets, the Protestant one meeting in Aarau and the Catholic one in Lucerne Hughes, Christopher, Switzerland p.66 ff, 84. Bonjour, Edgar et al. A short History of Switzerland p.191. but the Confederation survived.            During the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , Switzerland was a relative oasis of peace and prosperity  in war-torn Europe, mostly because all major powers in Europe depended on Swiss mercenaries, and would not let Switzerland fall into the hands of one of their rivals. Politically, they all tried to take influence, by way of mercenary commanders such as  |Jörg_Jenatsch|Jörg_Jenatsch|  or  |Johann_Rudolf_Wettstein|Johann_Rudolf_Wettstein| . The Drei Bünde of  |Grisons|Grisons| , at that point not yet a member of the Confederacy, were involved in the war from 1620, which led to their loss of the  |Valtellina|Valtellina|  in 1623.          At the  |Treaty_of_Westphalia|Treaty_Of_Westphalia|  in 1648, Switzerland attained legal independence from the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . The Valtellina became a dependency of the Drei Bünde again after the Treaty and remained so until the founding of the  |Cisalpine_Republic|Cisalpine_Republic|  by  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte|  in 1797.     In 1653, peasants of territories subject to  |Lucerne|Lucerne| ,  |Bern|Bern| ,  |Solothurn|Solothurn| , and  |Basel|Basel|  revolted because of currency devaluation. Although the authorities prevailed in this  |Swiss_peasant_war|Swiss_Peasant_War| , they did pass some tax reforms and the incident in the long term prevented an  |absolutist|Absolutism|  development as would occur at some other courts of Europe. The confessional tensions remained, however, and erupted again in the  |First_War_of_Villmergen|First_War_Of_Villmergen| , in 1656, and the  |Toggenburg_War|Toggenburg_War|  , in 1712.              During the  |French_Revolutionary_Wars|French_Revolutionary_Wars| , the French army  |invaded_Switzerland|French_Invasion_Of_Switzerland|  and turned it into an ally known as the  |Helvetic_Republic|Helvetic_Republic|  . It had a central government with little role for cantons. The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernizing reforms took place. Marc H. Lerner, The Helvetic Republic: An Ambivalent Reception of French Revolutionary Liberty, French History 181 pp 50-75. R.R. Palmer, The Age of the Democratic Revolution 2:394-421     Resistance was strongest in the more traditional Catholic bastions, with armed uprisings breaking out in spring 1798 in the central part of Switzerland. The French Army suppressed the uprisings but support for revolutionary ideas steadily declined. The reform element was weak, and most Swiss resented their loss of local democracy, the centralization, the new taxes, the warfare, and the hostility to religion.      Major steps taken to emancipate the Jews included the repeal of special taxes and oaths in 1798. However, reaction took place in 1815, and not until 1879 were the Jews granted equal rights with the Christians. Holger Böning, Bürgerliche Revolution und Judenemanzipation in der Schweiz, Jahrbuch des Instituts für Deutsche Geschichte , Vol. 14, pp 157-180     In 1803, Napoleons  |Act_of_Mediation|Act_Of_Mediation|  partially restored the sovereignty of the cantons, and the former tributary and allied territories of  |Aargau|Aargau| ,  |Thurgau|Thurgau| , Grisons,  |St._Gallen|Canton_Of_St._Gallen| ,  |Vaud|Vaud|  and  |Ticino|Ticino|  became cantons with equal rights. Napoleon and his enemies fought numerous campaigns in Switzerland that ruined many localities.          The  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  of 1814–15 fully  |reestablished_Swiss_independence|Restoration_And_Regeneration_In_Switzerland|  and the European powers agreed to recognize permanent Swiss neutrality. At this time,  |Valais|Valais| ,  |Neuchâtel|Canton_Of_Neuchâtel|  and  |Geneva|Canton_Of_Geneva|  also joined Switzerland as new cantons, thereby  |extending_Swiss_territory|Enlargement_Of_Switzerland|  to its current boundaries.     The long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed as :   :It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages , suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works. William Martin, Histoire de la Suisse , pp 187-88, quoted in Crane Brinson, A Decade of Revolution: 1789-1799 p. 235     On 6 April 1814, the so-called  |Long_Diet|Long_Diet|  met at  |Zurich|Zurich|  to replace the constitution. Wilhelm Oechsli, History of Switzerland 1499-1914, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 365.     Cantonal constitutions were worked out independently from 1814, in general restoring the late feudal conditions of the 17th and 18th century. The  |Tagsatzung|Tagsatzung|  was re-organized by the  |Federal_Treaty|Federal_Treaty|   of 7 August 1815.     The liberal  |Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland|Free_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland|  was strong in the largely Protestant cantons obtained the majority in the  |Federal_Diet|Tagsatzung|  in the early 1840s. It proposed a new Constitution for the Swiss Confederation which would draw the several cantons into a closer relationship. In addition to the centralization of the Swiss government, the new Constitution also included protections for trade and other progressive reform measures. The Federal Diet, with the approval of a majority of cantons, had taken measures against the Catholic Church such as the closure of monasteries and convents in  |Aargau|Aargau|  in 1841,  and the seizure of their properties. Catholic Lucerne, in retaliation, in 1844 recalled the  |Jesuits|Society_Of_Jesus|  to head its education. That succeeded and seven Catholic cantons formed the Sonderbund. This caused a liberal-radical move in the Protestant cantons to take control of the national Diet in 1847. The Diet ordered the Sonderbund dissolved, igniting a small-scale civil war against rural cantons were strongholds of pro-Catholic  |ultramontanism|Ultramontanism| . William L. Langer, Political and social Upheaval 1832-1852 : 133-37.               The Radical-liberal-Protestant element charged that the Sonderbund was in violation of the  |Federal_Treaty|Federal_Treaty|  of 1815, §6 of which expressly forbade such separate alliances. Forming a majority in the Tagsatzung they decided to dissolve the Sonderbund on October 21, 1847. W. B. Duffield, The War of the Sonderbund English Historical Review 1040 , pp. 675-698  Joachim Remak, A Very Civil War: The Swiss Sonderbund War of 1847  The odds were against the Catholics, who were heavily outnumbered in population; they were outnumbered in soldiers by 79,000 to 99,000, and lacked enough well-trained soldiers, officers and generals. When the Sonderbund refused to disband, the national army attacked in a brief civil war between the Catholic and the Protestant cantons, known as the Sonderbundskrieg The national army was composed of soldiers of all the other cantons except  |Neuchâtel|Canton_Of_Neuchâtel|  and  |Appenzell_Innerrhoden|Appenzell_Innerrhoden|  . The Sonderbund was easily defeated in less than a month; there were about 130 killed. Apart from small riots, this was the last armed conflict on Swiss territory. Ralph Weaver, Three Weeks in November: A Military History of the Swiss Civil War of 1847  Many Sonderband leaders fled to Italy, but the victors were generous. They invited the defeated cantons to join them in a program of federal reform, and a new constitution was drafted along American lines. National issues were to be under the control of the national parliament, and the Jesuits were expelled. The Swiss voted heavily in favor of the new constitution by 2 million against 300,000. Switzerland became calm. However conservatives around Europe became frightened, and prepared their own forces to meet possible challenges, which indeed soon exploded the  |Revolutions_of_1848|Revolutions_Of_1848| . In those violent revolutions, outside Switzerland, the conservatives were always successful. Langer, Political and Social upheaval pp 135-37              As a consequence of the civil war, Switzerland adopted a  |federal_constitution|Swiss_Federal_Constitution|  in 1848, amending it extensively in 1874 and establishing federal responsibility for defense, trade, and legal matters, leaving all other matters to the cantonal governments. From then, and over much of the 20th century, continuous political, economic, and social improvement has characterized Swiss history.     While Switzerland was primarily rural, the cities experienced an industrial revolution in the late 19th century, focused especially on textiles. In Basel, for example, textiles, including silk, were the leading industry. In 1888 women made up 44% of the wage earners. Nearly half the women worked in the textile mills, with household servants the second largest job category. The share of women in the workforce was higher between 1890 and 1910 than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s. Regina Wecker, Frauenlohnarbeit - Statistik und Wirklichkeit in der Schweiz an der Wende zum 20, Jahrhundert Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Geschichte 343 pp 346-356.        Swiss Universities in the late 19th century are notable for the number of female students receiving medical education.                The major powers respected Switzerlands neutrality during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . In the  |Grimm–Hoffmann_Affair|Grimm–Hoffmann_Affair| , the Allies denounced a proposal by one politician to negotiate peace on the Eastern Front; they wanted the war there to continue so as to tie Germany down.     While the industrial sector began to grow in the mid-19th century, Switzerlands emergence as one of the most prosperous nations in Europe—the Swiss miracle —was a development of the  |short_20th_century|Short_20Th_Century| , among other things tied to the role of  |Switzerland_during_the_World_Wars|Switzerland_During_The_World_Wars| .

Germany  |considered_invading|Operation_Tannenbaum|  Switzerland during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , but never attacked. Lets Swallow Switzerland by Klaus Urner . Under General  |Henri_Guisan|Henri_Guisan| , the Swiss army prepared for mass mobilization of militia forces against invasion, and prepared strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the  Réduit . Switzerland remained independent and neutral through a combination of military deterrence, economic concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion.     Attempts by Switzerlands small Nazi party to cause an  Anschluss  with Germany failed miserably, largely due to Switzerlands multicultural heritage, strong sense of national identity, and long tradition of direct democracy and civil liberties. The Swiss press vigorously criticized the Third Reich, Georges André Chevallaz, The Challenge of Neutrality: Diplomacy and the Defense of Switzerland, pp 120.    often infuriating German leaders. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.     Switzerlands trade was blockaded by both the  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  and by the  |Axis|Axis_Powers| . Both sides openly exerted pressure on Switzerland not to trade with the other. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion, and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached their zenith after a crucial rail link through  |Vichy_France|Vichy_France|  was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Switzerland relied on trade for half of its food and essentially all of its fuel, but controlled vital trans-alpine rail tunnels between Germany and Italy.     Switzerlands most important exports during the war were precision machine tools, watches, jewel bearings , electricity, and dairy products. During World War Two, the  |Swiss_franc|Swiss_Franc|  was the only remaining major freely convertible currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the  |Swiss_National_Bank|Swiss_National_Bank| . Between 1940 and 1945, the German  |Reichsbank|Reichsbank|  sold 1.3 billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency. The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 238 .     Hundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was  |monetary_gold|Gold_Standard|  plundered from the  |central_banks|Central_Bank|  of occupied countries. 581,000 francs of Melmer gold taken from  |Holocaust|The_Holocaust|  victims in eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks. The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 249 . In total, trade between Germany and Switzerland contributed about 0.5% to the German war effort but did not significantly lengthen the war. The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 518 .     Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned 300,000 refugees.  104,000 of these were foreign troops interned according to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers outlined in the  |Hague_Conventions|Hague_Conventions| . The rest were foreign civilians and were either interned or granted tolerance or residence permits by the cantonal authorities. Refugees were not allowed to hold jobs. 60,000 of the refugees were civilians escaping persecution by the Nazis. Of these, 26,000 to 27,000 were Jews. The Bergier Commission Final Report, page 117 . Between 10,000 and 25,000 civilian refugees were refused entry.  states 24,000  At the beginning of the war, Switzerland had a Jewish population of between 18,000  accessed Feb 4, 2009 and 28,000  states 28,000 and a total population of about 4 million.     Within Switzerland at the time of the conflict there was moderate polarization. Some were pacifists. Some took sides according to international capitalism or international communism. Others leaned more towards their language group, with some in French-speaking areas more pro-Allied, and some in Swiss-German areas more pro-Axis. The government attempted to thwart the activities of any individual, party, or faction in Switzerland that acted with extremism or attempted to break the unity of the nation. The Swiss-German speaking areas moved linguistically further away from the standard German spoken in Germany, with more emphasis on local Swiss dialects.     In the 1960s, significant controversy arose among historians regarding the nations relations with Nazi Germany. Hadrien Buclin, Surmonter le passé?: les intellectuels de gauche et le débat des années soixante sur la deuxième guerre mondiale, Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Geschichte 632 pp 233-249.     By the 1990s the controversies included a  |class-action_lawsuit|World_Jewish_Congress_Lawsuit_Against_Swiss_Banks|  brought in New York over Jewish assets in Holocaust-era bank accounts. The government commissioned an authoritative study of Switzerlands interaction with the Nazi regime. The final report by this independent panel of international scholars, known as the  |Bergier_Commission|Bergier_Commission| ,  was issued in 2002.
