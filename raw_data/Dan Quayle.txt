It was a factual comparison, although Quayles advisers cautioned beforehand that it could be used against him.

Murphy Brown Reflections on Urban America  to the  |Commonwealth_Club_of_California|Commonwealth_Club_Of_California|  on the subject of the  |Los_Angeles_riots|1992_Los_Angeles_Riots| .  In the speech he blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the single mother title character in the television program  Murphy Brown  as an example of how popular culture contributes to this poverty of values , saying, It doesnt help matters when  |prime-time|Prime_Time|  TV has Murphy Brown—a character who supposedly epitomizes todays intelligent, highly paid, professional woman—mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another lifestyle choice.      The  |Murphy_Brown_speech|Murphy_Brownmurphy_Becomes_A_Single_Mother|  became one of the most memorable incidents of the 1992 campaign. Long after the outcry had ended, the comment continued to have an effect on U.S. politics.  |Stephanie_Coontz|Stephanie_Coontz| , a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of  |marriage|Marriage| , says that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the collapse of the family.  In 2002,  |Candice_Bergen|Candice_Bergen| , the actress who played Brown, said I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did. Others interpreted it differently; singer  |Tanya_Tucker|Tanya_Tucker|  was widely quoted as saying Who the hell is Dan Quayle to come after single mothers?        Throughout his time as vice president, Quayle was widely ridiculed in the media and many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and an incompetent individual.  Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayles incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either impossible , self-contradictory , self-contradictory and confused , or just confused .     Shortly after Bush announced the  |Space_Exploration_Initiative|Space_Exploration_Initiative| , which included a  |manned_landing|Human_Mission_To_Mars|  on  |Mars|Mars| , Quayle was asked his thoughts on sending humans to Mars. In his response, he made a series of scientifically incorrect statements: Mars is essentially in the same  |orbit|Solar_Systemstructure_And_Composition|  ...Mars is somewhat the same  |distance_from_the_Sun|Astronomical_Unitexamples| , which is very important.

He was the subject of widespread ridicule for his error. According to The New York Times  and Quayles memoirs, he was relying on cards provided by the school, which Quayle says included the misspelling. Quayle said he was uncomfortable with the version he gave, but did so because he decided to trust the schools incorrect written materials instead of his own judgment.       In the  |1992_election|1992_United_States_Presidential_Election| , Bush and Quayle were challenged in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket of  |Arkansas_Governor|List_Of_Governors_Of_Arkansas| |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  and  |Tennessee|Tennessee| |Senator|United_States_Senate| |Al_Gore|Al_Gore|  and the independent ticket of Texas businessman  |Ross_Perot|Ross_Perot|  and retired Vice Admiral  |James_Stockdale|James_Stockdale| .     As Bush lagged in the polls in the weeks preceding the August  |1992_Republican_National_Convention|1992_Republican_National_Convention| , some Republican strategists  viewed Quayle as a liability to the ticket and pushed for his replacement.

Quayle faced off against Gore and Stockdale in the vice presidential  |debate|Debate|  on October 13, 1992.  He attempted to avoid the one-sided outcome of his debate with Bentsen four years earlier by staying on the offensive.  Quayle criticized Gores book  Earth in the Balance  with specific page references, though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group  |FAIR|Fairness_And_Accuracy_In_Reporting|  for inaccuracy.  In Quayles closing argument, he sharply asked voters, Do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth? and Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president? Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused.  Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayles performance, and his camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater, but post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore or Quayle had won.
