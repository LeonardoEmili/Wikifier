   Habakkuk, who was active around 612 BC, was a  |prophet|Prophet|  whose oracles and prayer are recorded in the  |Book_of_Habakkuk|Book_Of_Habakkuk| , the eighth of the collected  |twelve_minor_prophets|Twelve_Minor_Prophets|  in the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| . He is revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims.     Almost all the information we have about Habakkuk is drawn from the book of the Bible bearing his name, with no biographical details provided other than his title, the prophet . Outside the Bible, he is mentioned over the centuries in the forms of  |Christian|Christian_Tradition|  and  |Rabbinic_tradition|Rabbinic_Tradition| .       Almost nothing is known about Habakkuk, aside from what are stated within the book of the Bible bearing his name, or those inferences that may be drawn from that book. His name appears in the Bible only in  |Habakkuk_1_1|Habakkuk_1Verse_1|  and  |3_1|Habakkuk_3Verse_1| , with no biographical details provided other than his title the prophet.  Even the origin of his name is uncertain.     For almost every other prophet, more information is given, such as the name of the prophets hometown, his occupation, or information concerning his parentage or tribe. For Habakkuk, however, there is no reliable account of any of these. Although his home is not identified, scholars conclude that Habakkuk lived in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  at the time he wrote his prophecy. Further analysis has provided an approximate date for his prophecy and possibilities concerning his activities and background.     Beyond the Bible, considerable conjecture has been put forward over the centuries in the form of  |Christian|Christian_Tradition|  and  |Rabbinic_tradition|Rabbinic_Tradition| , but such accounts are dismissed by modern scholars as speculative and apocryphal.            Because the book of Habakkuk consists of five oracles about the  |Chaldea|Chaldea| ns , and the Chaldean rise to power is dated circa 612 BC, it is assumed he was active about that time, making him an early contemporary of  |Jeremiah|Jeremiah|  and  |Zephaniah|Zephaniah| . Jewish sources, however, do not group him with those two prophets, who are often placed together, so it is possible that he was slightly earlier than these prophets.     Because the final chapter of his book is a song, it is sometimes assumed that he was a member of the  |tribe_of_Levi|Tribe_Of_Levi| , which served as musicians in  |Solomons_Temple|Solomons_Temple| .       The name Habakkuk, or Habacuc, appears in the Hebrew Bible only in  |Habakkuk_1_1|Habakkuk_1Verse_1|  and  |3_1|Habakkuk_3Verse_1| . In the  |Masoretic_Text|Masoretic_Text| , it is written in  . This name does not occur elsewhere. The  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  transcribes his name into  |Greek|Koine_Greek|  as  , and the  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  transcribes it into  |Latin|Latin|  as Abacuc.     The etymology of the name is not clear, and its form has no parallel in Hebrew. The name is possibly related to the  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Language|  khabbaququ, the name of a fragrant plant, or the Hebrew root , meaning embrace .       Habakkuk appears in  |Bel_and_the_Dragon|Bel_And_The_Dragon| , which is part of the  |deuterocanonical|Deuterocanonical| |_Additions_to_Daniel|Additions_To_Daniel| . Verses 33–39 state that Habakkuk is in Judea; after making some stew, he is instructed by an  |angel_of_the_Lord|Angel_Of_The_Lord|  to take the stew to Daniel, who is in the lions den in  |Babylon|Babylon| . After proclaiming that he is unaware of both the den and Babylon, the angel transports Habakkuk to the lions den. Habakkuk gives Daniel the food to sustain him, and is immediately taken back to his own place .     Habakkuk is also mentioned in the  Lives of the Prophets , which also mentions his time in Babylon.     According to the  |Zohar|Zohar|  Habakkuk is the boy born to the Shunamite woman through  |Elishas|Elisha|  blessing:                 The only work attributed to Habakkuk is the short book of the Bible that bears his name. The book of Habakkuk consists of five oracles about the  |Chaldea|Chaldea| ns  and a song of praise to  |God|God| .     The style of the book has been praised by many scholars, suggesting that its author was a man of great literary talent. The entire book follows the structure of a  |chiasmus|Chiasmus|  in which  |parallelism_of_thought|Parallelism|  is used to bracket sections of the text.     Habakkuk is unusual among the prophets in that he openly questions the working of God . In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action: O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you “Violence!” and you will not save? . The writings address the questions of why God allows the wicked to prosper; why God delays answering prayer; and, why God is sometimes silent.       The final resting place of Habakkuk has been claimed at multiple locations. The fifth-century Christian historian  |Sozomen|Sozomen|  claimed that the relics of Habakkuk were found at Cela, when God revealed their location to  |Zebennus|Zebennus| , bishop of  |Eleutheropolis|Eleutheropolis| , in a dream. Currently, one location in Israel and one in Iran lay claim to being the burial site of the prophet.          The burial place of Habakkuk is identified by Jewish tradition as a hillside in the  |Upper_Galilee|Upper_Galilee_Regional_Council|  region of northern  |Israel|Israel| , close to the villages  |Kadarim|Kadarim|  and  |Hukok|Hukok| , about six miles southwest of  |Safed|Safed|  and twelve miles north of  |Mount_Tabor|Mount_Tabor| . A small stone building, erected during the 20th century, protects the tomb. Tradition dating as early as the 12th century AD holds that Habakkuks tomb is at this location, but the tomb may also be of a local  |sheikh|Sheikh|  of  |Yaquq|Yaquq| , a name related to the biblical place named Hukkok ,  whose pronunciation and spelling in Hebrew are close to Habakkuk . Archaeological findings in this location include several burial places dated to the  |Second_Temple_period|Second_Temple_Period| .          A  |mausoleum|Mausoleum|  southeast of the city of  |Tuyserkan|Tuyserkan|  in the west of  |Iran|Iran|  is also believed to be Habakkuks burial place. It is protected by Irans  |Cultural_Heritage_Handcrafts_and_Tourism_Organization|Cultural_Heritage_Handcrafts_And_Tourism_Organization| . The Organizations guide to the  |Hamadan_Province|Hamadan_Province|  states that Habakkuk was believed to be a guardian to  |Solomons_Temple|Solomons_Temple| , and that he was captured by the Babylonians and remained in their prison for some years. After being freed by  |Cyrus_the_Great|Cyrus_The_Great| , he went to  |Ecbatana|Ecbatana|  and remained there until he died, and was buried somewhere nearby, in what is today Tuyserkan. Habakkuk is called both Habaghugh and Hayaghugh by the Muslim locals.     The surrounding shrine may date to the period of the  |Seljuq_Empire|Seljuq_Empire|  ; it consists of an octagonal wall and conical dome. Underneath the shrine is a hidden basement with three floors. In the center of the shrines courtyard is the grave where Habakkuk is said to be buried. A stone upon the grave is inscribed in both Hebrew and  |Persian|Persian_Language|  stating that the prophets father was Shioua Lovit, and his mother was Lesho Namit. Both Muslims and Jews visit it to pay their respects.         On the  |Eastern_Orthodox_liturgical_calendar|Eastern_Orthodox_Liturgical_Calendar| , his feast day is December 2. In the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| , the twelve minor prophets are read in the  |Roman_Breviary|Roman_Breviary|  during the fourth and fifth weeks of November, which are the last two weeks of the liturgical year, and his feast day is January 15. This day is also celebrated as his feast by the  |Greek_Orthodox_Church|Greek_Orthodox_Church| . In 2011, he was commemorated with the other  |Minor_Prophets|Minor_Prophets|  in the  |calendar_of_saints|Calendar_Of_Saints|  of the  |Armenian_Apostolic_Church|Armenian_Apostolic_Church|  on February 8.     Habakkuk has also been commemorated in  |sculpture|Sculpture| . In 1435, the  |Florentine|Florence|  artist  |Donatello|Donatello|  created a sculpture of the prophet for the bell tower of Florence. This statue, nicknamed  Zuccone  because of the shape of the head, now resides in the  |Museo_dellOpera_del_Duomo|Museo_Dellopera_Del_Duomo| . The  |Basilica_of_Santa_Maria_del_Popolo|Basilica_Of_Santa_Maria_Del_Popolo|  in  |Rome|Rome|  contains a Baroque  |sculpture_of_Habakkuk|Habakkuk_And_The_Angel|  by the 17th-century artist  |Bernini|Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini| . Between 1800 and 1805, the  |Brazil|Brazil| ian sculptor  |Aleijadinho|Aleijadinho|  completed a  |soapstone|Soapstone|  sculpture of Habakkuk as part of his  |Twelve_Prophets|Twelve_Prophets_Of_Aleijadinho| . The figures are arranged around the forecourt and monumental stairway in front of the Santuário do Bom Jesus do Matosinhos at  |Congonhas|Congonhas| .         Although not mentioned by name in the Quran, Habakkuk is recognized as an Islamic prophet because he is believed to herald the coming of Muhammad and the Quran in the  |Book_of_Habakkuk|Book_Of_Habakkuk| .     In the court of  |Al_Mamun|Al_Mamun| , Imam  |Ali_al_Ridha|Ali_Al_Ridha| , a descendant of the Prophet  |Muhammad|Muhammad|  and chief Islamic scholar in the time of the  |Abbasid_Caliphs|Abbasid_Caliphs| , was asked by the  |Exilarch|Exilarch|  to prove that Muhammad was a prophet through the  |Torah|Torah| . Among his many proofs, Imam Ridha asks Do you know the prophet Habakkuk? He said, “Yes. I know of him.” al-Ridha said, “and this is narrated in your book, ‘Allah brought down speech on Mount Faran, and the heavens were ﬁlled with the gloriﬁcation of Muhammad and his community. His horse carries him over water as it carries him over land. He will bring a new book to us after the ruin of the holy house ’ What is meant by this book is the Quran. Do you know this and believe in it?” The Exilarch said, “Habakkuk the prophet has said this and we do not deny what he said.”        Although the Quran only mentions around twenty-five  |prophets|Prophet|  by name, and alludes to a few others, it has been a cardinal doctrine of Islam that many more prophets were sent by  |God|God|  who are not mentioned in the scripture. Cf. Quran 16:36 Thus, Muslims have traditionally had no problem accepting those other Hebrew prophets not mentioned in the  |Quran|Quran|  or  |hadith|Hadith|  as legitimate prophets of God, especially as the Quran itself states: Surely We sent down the  |Torah|Torah|  , wherein is guidance and light; thereby the Prophets , who had surrendered themselves, gave judgment for those who were Jewish, as did the masters and the  |rabbis|Rabbi| , following such portion of Gods Book as they were given to keep and were witnesses to, Quran 5:44, cf. Arberry translation. with this passage having often been interpreted by Muslims to include within the phrase prophets an allusion to all the prophetic figures of the Jewish scriptural portion of the  |neviim|Neviim| , that is to say all the prophets of Israel after  |Moses|Moses|  and  |Aaron|Aaron| . Thus, Islamic authors have often alluded to Habakkuk as a prophet in their works, Ibn Qutaybah, Dalāil al-Nubuwwa, XLVII-XLVIIII, cited in Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , pp. 269-270 Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 381, tr. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, pp. 389-390 See Walid Saleh , In Defense of the Bible: A Critical Edition and an Introduction to Al-Biqais Bible Treatise , et passim and followed the pronunciation of his name with the traditional  |salutations_of_peace|Peace_Be_Upon_Him|  bestowed by Muslims onto prophets after the utterance of their names. Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 381, tr. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, pp. 389-390     Some medieval Muslim scholars even provided commentaries on the biblical  |Book_of_Habakkuk|Book_Of_Habakkuk| , with the primary purpose of showing that the prophet had predicted the coming of  |Muhammad|Muhammad|  in Habakkuk 3:2–6, in a manner akin to the earlier Christian tradition of seeing in the books prophecies allusions to the advent of  |Christ|Christ| . Lejla Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo , p. 47 For example, the medieval exegete Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī provided a commentary on select verses from the  |book_of_Habakkuk|Book_Of_Habakkuk| , saying the prophets words for his rays become light alluded to the spread of  |Islam|Islam| ; Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 381, tr. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, p. 391 that his words his glory comes to town, his power appears in his courts referred to Muhammads stay in the town of  |Yathrib|Yathrib|  and the help he received there from the  |ansar|Ansar| ; Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 382, tr. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, p. 391 and that his words death goes before him was a prophecy about the fear of the Muslim armies during the military campaigns of Muhammad and his  |companions|Sahaba| . Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 383, tr. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, p. 391 Likewise, Habakkuk 3:5–6 also received similar commentaries from medieval Islamic thinkers. Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 383, tr. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, p. 391     The famous and revered  |Persian|Persian_People|  Islamic  |scholar|Scholar|  and  |polymath|Polymath| |_Ibn_Qutaybah|Ibn_Qutaybah| , who served as a  |judge|Qadi|  during the  |Abbasid_Caliphate|Abbasid_Caliphate| , said of the prophet Habakkuk: Among the words of Habakkuk, who prophesied in the days of  |Daniel|Daniel| , Habakkuk says: God came from  |Teman|Teman| , and the holy one from the mountains of  |Paran|Desert_Of_Paran|  and the earth was filled with the sanctification of the praiseworthy one , and with his right hand he exercised power over the earth and the necks of the nations, Ibn Qutaybah, Dalāil al-Nubuwwa, XLVII-XLVIIII, cited in Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , p. 269 which has been interpreted by scholars to be a clear allusion to Habakkuk 3:3-4. Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , p. 269 Elsewhere, the same scholar glossed Habakkuk 3:4, 15 as follows: The earth shines with his light, and his horses launched into the sea, Ibn Qutaybah, Dalāil al-Nubuwwa, XLVIII, cited in Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , p. 269 again interpreting the prophecy to be an allusion to the coming of  |Muhammad|Muhammad| . Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , p. 264 One further prophecy of Habakkuk which Ibn Qutaybah cited, from extra-canonical Hebraic literature, was You shall be exceedingly filled in your bows ... o Praised One , Ibn Qutaybah, Dalāil al-Nubuwwa, XLVIII, cited in Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , p. 269 which he read as being a clear statement of ... name ... his characteristics. Ibn Qutaybah, Dalāil al-Nubuwwa, XLVIII, cited in Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible , p. 269 This final prophecy attributed to Habakkuk was also referred to by later scholars like  |Ibn_al_Jawzi|Ibn_Al_Jawzi|  and  |Ibn_Qayyim_al_Jawziyyah|Ibn_Qayyim_Al_Jawziyyah| .
