                 Dolphin is a common name of  |aquatic_mammals|Aquatic_Mammal|  within the infraorder  |Cetacea|Cetacea| . The term dolphin usually refers to the extant families  |Delphinidae|Delphinidae|  ,  |Platanistidae|Platanistidae|  ,  |Iniidae|Iniidae|  , and  |Pontoporiidae|Pontoporiidae|  , and the extinct  |Lipotidae|Lipotidae|  . There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.     Dolphins range in size from the  long and   |Mauis_dolphin|Mauis_Dolphin|  to the  and   |killer_whale|Killer_Whale| . Several species exhibit  |sexual_dimorphism|Sexual_Dimorphism| , in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as  |seals|Pinniped| , some dolphins can travel at . Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or  |blubber|Blubber| , under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.     Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the  |right_whale_dolphin|Right_Whale_Dolphin| , prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.     Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as  |dolphin_drive_hunting|Dolphin_Drive_Hunting| . Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from  |bycatch|Bycatch| , habitat loss, and  |marine_pollution|Marine_Pollution| . Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series  |Free_Willy|Free_Willy| . Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. The most common dolphin species in captivity is the  |bottlenose_dolphin|Bottlenose_Dolphin| , while there are around 60  |captive_killer_whales|Captive_Killer_Whales| .       The name is originally from  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|   , dolphin ,  which was related to the Greek  , womb . The animals name can therefore be interpreted as meaning a fish with a womb .  The name was transmitted via the  |Latin|Latin|  delphinus ,   Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus Digital Library , which in  |Medieval_Latin|Medieval_Latin|  became dolfinus and in  |Old_French|Old_French|  daulphin, which reintroduced the ph into the word. The term mereswine has also historically been used.         The term dolphin can be used to refer to, under the  |parvorder|Parvorder| |Odontoceti|Odontoceti| , all the species in the family  |Delphinidae|Delphinidae|  and the river dolphin families  |Iniidae|Iniidae|  , Pontoporiidae ,  |Lipotidae|Lipotidae|  and  |Platanistidae|Platanistidae|  .    This term has often been misused in the US, mainly in the fishing industry, where all small  |cetacea|Cetacea| ns  are considered porpoises,  while the fish  dorado  is called dolphin fish.  In common usage the term whale is used only for the larger cetacean species,  while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered dolphins.  The name dolphin is used casually as a synonym for  |bottlenose_dolphin|Bottlenose_Dolphin| , the most common and familiar species of dolphin.  There are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the  |killer_whale|Killer_Whale| , the  |melon-headed_whale|Melon-Headed_Whale| , the  |pygmy_killer_whale|Pygmy_Killer_Whale| , the  |false_killer_whale|False_Killer_Whale| , and the two species of  |pilot_whales|Pilot_Whale| , all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae and qualify as dolphins.  Though the terms dolphin and porpoise are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their behavior. Porpoises belong to the family Phocoenidae and share a common ancestry with the Delphinidae.     A group of dolphins is called a school or a pod . Male dolphins are called bulls , females cows and young dolphins are called calves .          |Platanistidae|Platanistidae| |Ganges_and_Indus_river_dolphin|Ganges_And_Indus_River_Dolphin| , Platanista gangetica with two subspecies    |Ganges_river_dolphin|Ganges_River_Dolphin|  , Platanista gangetica gangetica  |Indus_river_dolphin|Indus_River_Dolphin|  , Platanista gangetica minor  |Iniidae|Iniidae| |Amazon_river_dolphin|Amazon_River_Dolphin|  , Inia geoffrensis  |Orinoco_river_dolphin|Orinoco_River_Dolphin|  , Inia geoffrensis humboldtiana  |Araguaian_river_dolphin|Araguaian_River_Dolphin|  , Inia araguaiaensis  |Bolivian_river_dolphin|Bolivian_River_Dolphin| , Inia boliviensis  |Lipotidae|Lipotidae| |Baiji|Baiji|  , Lipotes vexillifer   Family  |Pontoporiidae|Pontoporiidae| |La_Plata_dolphin|La_Plata_Dolphin|  , Pontoporia blainvillei  |oceanic_dolphins|Oceanic_Dolphin|    Genus  Delphinus   |Long-beaked_common_dolphin|Long-Beaked_Common_Dolphin| , Delphinus capensis  |Short-beaked_common_dolphin|Short-Beaked_Common_Dolphin| , Delphinus delphis  Tursiops   |Common_bottlenose_dolphin|Common_Bottlenose_Dolphin| , Tursiops truncatus  |Indo-Pacific_bottlenose_dolphin|Indo-Pacific_Bottlenose_Dolphin| , Tursiops aduncus  |Burrunan_dolphin|Burrunan_Dolphin| , Tursiops australis, a newly discovered species from the sea around  |Melbourne|Melbourne|  in September 2011.

This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring. A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld California. Other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or have been reported in the wild, such as a bottlenose- Atlantic spotted hybrid. The best known hybrid is the wolphin , a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is a fertile hybrid. Two wolphins currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male false killer whale and a female bottlenose. Wolphins have also been observed in the wild.         thu with fish and aquatic reptiles     Dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order . They are related to the  |Indohyus|Indohyus| , an extinct chevrotain -like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.     The primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes , first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5â€“10  million years later.     Archaeoceti is a parvorder comprising ancient whales. These ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales, stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment . Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with  |Ambulocetus|Ambulocetus|  49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with  |Protocetus|Protocetus| , the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with  |Basilosaurus|Basilosaurus| .
