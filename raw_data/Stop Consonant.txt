        In  |phonetics|Phonetics| , a stop, also known as a plosive or oral occlusive , is a  |consonant|Consonant|  in which the vocal tract is  |blocked|Manner_Of_Articulation|  so that all  |airflow|Airstream_Mechanism|  ceases.     The occlusion may be made with the tongue tip or blade  tongue body , lips , or glottis . Stops contrast with  |nasals|Nasal_Occlusive| , where the vocal tract is blocked but airflow continues through the nose, as in  and , and with  |fricatives|Fricatives| , where partial occlusion impedes but does not block airflow in the vocal tract.       The terms stop, occlusive, and plosive are often used interchangeably. Linguists who distinguish them may not agree on the distinction being made. The terms refer to different features of the consonant. Stop refers to the airflow that is stopped. Occlusive refers to the articulation, which occludes the vocal tract. Plosive refers to the release burst of the consonant. Some object to the use of plosive for  |inaudibly_released_stops|Unreleased_Stop| , which may then instead be called applosives .     Either occlusive or stop may be used as a general term covering the other together with nasals. That is, occlusive may be defined as  |oral|Oral_Consonant|  occlusive plus nasal occlusives , or stop may be defined as oral stops plus nasal stops .  |Ladefoged|Peter_Ladefoged|  and  |Maddieson|Ian_Maddieson|  prefer to restrict stop to oral occlusives. They say,   :what we call simply nasals are called nasal stops by some linguists. We avoid this phrase, preferring to reserve the term stop for sounds in which there is a complete interruption of airflow.      In addition, they use plosive for a  |pulmonic|Pulmonic_Consonant|  stop; stops in their usage include  |ejective|Ejective_Consonant|  and  |implosive|Implosive_Consonant|  consonants.      If a term such as plosive is used for oral obstruents, and nasals are not called nasal stops, then a stop may mean the  |glottal_stop|Glottal_Stop| ; plosive may even mean non-glottal stop. In other cases, however, it may be the word plosive that is restricted to the glottal stop. Note that, generally speaking, stops do not have plosion . In English, for example, there are stops with  |no_audible_release|No_Audible_Release| , such as the  in apt. However, pulmonic stops do have plosion in other environments.
