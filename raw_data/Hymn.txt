   A hymn is a type of  |song|Song| , usually  |religious|Religious| , specifically written for the purpose of adoration or  |prayer|Prayer| , and typically addressed to a  |deity|Deity|  or deities, or to a prominent figure or  |personification|Personification| . The word hymn derives from  |Greek|Greek_Language|   , which means a song of praise . A writer of hymns is known as a  |hymnodist|Hymnodist| . The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody. Collections of hymns are known as  |hymnals|Hymnal|  or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.     Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of  |Christianity|Christianity| , hymns are also a fixture of other  |world_religions|Major_Religious_Groups| , especially on the Indian subcontinent. Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.       Ancient hymns include the  |Egyptian|Ancient_Egyptian_Religion|   Great Hymn to the Aten , composed by  |Pharaoh|Pharaoh| |Akhenaten|Akhenaten| ; the Hurrian  |Hymn_to_Nikkal|Hymn_To_Nikkal| ; the  Vedas , a collection of hymns in the tradition of  |Hinduism|Hinduism| ; and the  |Psalms|Psalms| , a collection of songs from  |Judaism|Judaism| . The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the  |Homeric_Hymns|Homeric_Hymns| , a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the  |ancient_Greek_religions|Religion_In_Ancient_Greece| . Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns  by the  |Alexandria|Alexandria| n poet  |Callimachus|Callimachus| .      |Patristic|Church_Fathers|  writers began applying the term , or hymnus in  |Latin|Latin| , to  |Christian|Christianity|  songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for  |psalm|Psalms|  . Entry on , Liddell and Scott,  A Greek-English Lexicon  , p. 1849; entry on hymnus, Lewis and Short,  A Latin Dictionary  , p. 872.       Originally modeled on the  |Book_of_Psalms|Psalms|  and other poetic passages  in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the  |Christian_God|God_In_Christianity| . Many refer to  |Jesus_Christ|Jesus_Christ|  either directly or indirectly.     Since the earliest times, Christians have sung psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , both in private devotions and in corporate worship .     Non-scriptural hymns from the Early Church still sung today include  |Phos_Hilaron|Phos_Hilaron| ,  |Sub_tuum_praesidium|Sub_Tuum_Praesidium| , and  |Te_Deum|Te_Deum| .     One definition of a hymn is ...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshippers attitude toward God or Gods purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it.      Christian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as  |Christmas|Christmas| ,  |Easter|Easter|  and the Feast of  |All_Saints|All_Saints_Day| , or during particular seasons such as  |Advent|Advent|  and  |Lent|Lent| . Others are used to encourage reverence for the  |Bible|Bible|  or to celebrate Christian practices such as the  |eucharist|Eucharist|  or  |baptism|Baptism| . Some hymns praise or address individual  |saints|Saints| , particularly the  |Blessed_Virgin_Mary|Blessed_Virgin_Mary| ; such hymns are particularly prevalent in  |Catholicism|Roman_Catholic_Church| ,  |Eastern_Orthodoxy|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  and to some extent  |High_Church|High_Church| |Anglicanism|Anglicanism| .     A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called hymnody; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period . A collection of hymns is called a  hymnal  or hymnary. These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a hymnologist, and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is  |hymnology|Hymnology| . The music to which a hymn may be sung is a  |hymn_tune|Hymn_Tune| .     In many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the  |Jesus_movement|Jesus_Movement|  and  |Jesus_music|Jesus_Music| . Of note, in recent years, Christian traditional hymns have seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or  |Calvinistic|Calvinism|  in nature, as modern hymn writers such as  |Keith_and_Kristyn_Getty|Keith_&_Kristyn_Getty|   and  |Sovereign_Grace|Sovereign_Grace_Churches|  Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards such as the hymn,  In Christ Alone .        In ancient and medieval times,  |string_instruments|String_Instrument|  such as the  |harp|Harp| ,  |lyre|Lyre|  and  |lute|Lute|  were used with psalms and hymns.     Since there is a lack of  |musical_notation|Musical_Notation|  in early writings, Entry on Hymn: 4. Hymn Sources and Transmission, Warren Anderson, et al.  . the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of  |Gregorian_chant|Gregorian_Chant|  or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight  |church_modes|Church_Modes| , and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in  |Latin|Latin| , many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century  Of the Fathers Heart Begotten  sung to the 11th century plainsong Divinum Mysterium.          Later hymnody in the  |Western_church|Western_Church|  introduced four-part vocal  |harmony|Harmony|  as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by  |organ|Organ|  and choir. It shares many elements with  |classical_music|European_Classical_Music| .     Today, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and  a cappella  congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.     To illustrate  |Protestant|Protestant|  usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the  |Methodist|Methodist|  churches, which are based upon  |Anglican|Anglican_Church|  practice, hymns are sung during the  |processional|Processional_Hymn|  to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the  |recessional|Recessional_Hymn| , and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in a common book such as the  |United_Methodist_Hymnal|United_Methodist_Hymnal| . The  |Doxology|Doxology|  is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.      |Contemporary_Christian_worship|Contemporary_Worship| , as often found in  |Evangelicalism|Evangelicalism|  and  |Pentecostalism|Pentecostalism| , may include the use of  |contemporary_worship_music|Contemporary_Worship_Music|  played with  |electric_guitars|Electric_Guitar|  and the  |drum_kit|Drum_Kit| , sharing many elements with  |rock_music|Rock_Music| .     Other groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied  a cappella  congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the Brethren , the  |Churches_of_Christ|Churches_Of_Christ| ,  |Mennonites|Mennonites| , several Anabaptist-based denominations—such as the  |Apostolic_Christian_Church_of_America|Apostolic_Christian_Church_Of_America| — |Primitive_Baptists|Primitive_Baptists| , and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the  |Free_Church_of_Scotland|Free_Church_Of_Scotland|  have abandoned this stance.           |Eastern_Christianity|Eastern_Christianity|   has a variety of ancient hymnographical traditions.      |Byzantine|Byzantine_Rite|  chant is almost always  |a_cappella|A_Cappella| , and instrumental accompaniment is rare. It is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship.     Instruments are common in Oriental traditions. The  |Coptic|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_Of_Alexandria|  tradition which makes use of the  |cymbals|Cymbal|  and the  |Triangle|Triangle| . The  |Indian_Orthodox|Indian_Orthodox|  use of the  |organ|Organ| . The  |Tewahedo_Church|Tewahedo_Church| es use  |drums|Drum| ,  |cymbals|Cymbal|  and other instruments on certain occasions.           |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas| , in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem.      The  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the  |regulative_principle_of_worship|Regulative_Principle_Of_Worship| , favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as  |exclusive_psalmody|Exclusive_Psalmody| . Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the  |Presbyterian_churches_of_western_Scotland|Scottish_Presbyterian| .        The other Reformation approach, the  |normative_principle_of_worship|Normative_Principle_Of_Worship| , produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing.  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  is notable not only as a reformer, but as the  |author_of_many_hymns|List_Of_Hymns_By_Martin_Luther|  including Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott , which is sung today even by Catholics, and  |Gelobet_seist_du,_Jesu_Christ|Gelobet_Seist_Du,_Jesu_Christ|  for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the  |Unitas_Fratrum|Unitas_Fratrum| . Count  |Zinzendorf|Zinzendorf| , the Lutheran leader of the  |Moravian_Church|Moravian_Church|  in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly  |Psalms|Psalm| ;  |Isaac_Watts|Isaac_Watts|  followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.    Watts , whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts first hymn, Behold the glories of the Lamb .    Found in few hymnals today, the hymn has eight stanzas in common meter and is based on Revelation 5:6, 8, 9, 10, 12.      Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called the father of English hymnody , but Erik Routley sees him more as the liberator of English hymnody , because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.      Later writers took even more freedom, some even including  |allegory|Allegory|  and  |metaphor|Metaphor|  in their texts.      |Charles_Wesleys|Charles_Wesley|  hymns spread Methodist  |theology|Theology| , not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing ones personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:             Wesleys contribution, along with the  |Second_Great_Awakening|Second_Great_Awakening|  in  |America|United_States|  led to a new style called  |gospel|Gospel_Music| , and a new explosion of sacred music writing with  |Fanny_Crosby|Fanny_Crosby| ,  |Lina_Sandell|Lina_Sandell| ,  |Philip_Bliss|Philip_Bliss| ,  |Ira_D._Sankey|Ira_D._Sankey| , and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated gospel songs as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain and usually a faster tempo than the hymns. As examples of the distinction,  |Amazing_Grace|Amazing_Grace|  is a hymn , but  |How_Great_Thou_Art|How_Great_Thou_Art|  is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship per se by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants .     The  |Methodist_Revival|Methodist_Revival|  of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in  |Welsh|Welsh_Language| , which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are  |William_Williams_Pantycelyn|William_Williams_Pantycelyn|  and  |Ann_Griffiths|Ann_Griffiths| . The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and congregational four-part singing in  |Wales|Wales| . E. Wyn James, The Evolution of the Welsh Hymn, in Dissenting Praise, ed. I. Rivers & D. L. Wykes ; E. Wyn James, Popular Poetry, Methodism, and the Ascendancy of the Hymn, in The Cambridge History of Welsh Literature, ed. Geraint Evans & Helen Fulton ; E. Wyn James, ‘German Chorales and American Songs and Solos: Contrasting Chapters in Welsh Congregational Hymn-Singing’, The Bulletin of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 295, Vol. 22:2 , 43–53.     Along with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from  |Mozart|Mozart|  to  |Monteverdi|Monteverdi| , the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  continued to produce many popular hymns such as  |Lead,_Kindly_Light|Lead,_Kindly_Light| ,  |Silent_Night|Silent_Night| , O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers.     Many churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by  |popular_music|Popular_Music| . This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants . This is not new; the Christian  |pop_music|Contemporary_Christian_Music|  style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.     This long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn , contemporary worship music and  |gospel_music|Gospel_Music|  . This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.        |African-Americans|African-American|  developed a rich hymnody from  |spirituals|Spiritual|  during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.

Hymn writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th-century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers. Surprisingly,  |Stephen_Foster|Stephen_Foster|  wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.     Thomas Symmes spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes colleagues who felt it was like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time .  |William_Billings|William_Billings| , a  |singing_school|Singing_School|  teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions. Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on  |common_measure|Common_Measure|   which was the typical way hymns were sung, but he attempted to have a Sufficiency in each measure . Bostons  |Handel_and_Haydn_Society|Handel_And_Haydn_Society|  aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their Collection of Church Music . In the late 19th century  |Ira_D._Sankey|Ira_D._Sankey|  and  |Dwight_L._Moody|Dwight_L._Moody|  developed the relatively new subcategory of  |gospel_hymns|Gospel_Hymn| . Music, David. Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996.     Earlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially  |shape_notes|Shape_Note| , exploded in America, and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to  |sing_from_sight|Sight-Reading| , instead of the more common  |lining_out|Lining_Out|  that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune books were published, including  |B.F._Whites|Benjamin_Franklin_White|   Sacred Harp , and earlier works like the  |Missouri_Harmony|The_Missouri_Harmony| ,  Kentucky Harmony ,  |Hesperian_Harp|The_Hesperian_Harp| , D.H. Mansfields The American Vocalist, The Social Harp, the  Southern Harmony ,  |William_Walkers|William_Walker|   Christian Harmony ,  |Jeremiah_Ingalls|Jeremiah_Ingalls|  Christian Harmony, and literally many dozens of others. Shape notes were important in the spread of more modern singing styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony ,  |fuging|Fuguing_Tune|  sections,  |anthems|Anthem|  and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household. It isnt uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books, which was considered great fun, and there are surviving accounts of  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln|  and his sweetheart singing together from the Missouri Harmony during his youth.     By the 1860s musical reformers like  |Lowell_Mason|Lowell_Mason|  were actively campaigning for the introduction of more refined and modern singing styles, and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of  |Victorian|Victorian_Era|  hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained  |choirs|Choir|  to do their churchs singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the  Sacred Harp , which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was re-discovered by  |Alan_Lomax|Alan_Lomax|  in the 1960s . Indeed, the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in Sacred Harp singing , with annual conventions popping up in  |all_50_states|United_States|  and in a number of European countries recently, including the  |UK|United_Kingdom| ,  |Germany|Germany| ,  |Ireland|Ireland|  and  |Poland|Poland| , as well as in  |Australia|Australia| .     Today Sacred Harp singing is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe, drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic, beautiful sound of the music. Although the lyrics tend to be highly religious in nature, the tradition is largely secular, and participation if open to all who care to attend.           The meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each  |stanza|Stanza|  of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymns text with an appropriate  |hymn_tune|Hymn_Tune|  for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters . Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.     The meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as 87.87.87 , which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 ; S.M. is short meter ; C.M. is common metre , while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.      Also, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn , the meter is called Irregular.         The  |Sikh|Sikh|  holy book, the  |Guru_Granth_Sahib|Guru_Granth_Sahib|  Ji , is a collection of hymns  or  Gurbani  describing the qualities of God  and why one should meditate on Gods name. The Guru Granth Sahib is divided by their musical setting in different  |ragas|Raga|   into fourteen hundred and thirty pages known as Angs in Sikh tradition.  |Guru_Gobind_Singh|Guru_Gobind_Singh|  , the tenth guru, after adding  |Guru_Tegh_Bahadurs|Guru_Tegh_Bahadur| |bani|Gurbani|  to the  |Adi_Granth|Adi_Granth|    affirmed the sacred text as his successor, elevating it to Guru Granth Sahib.  The text remains the holy scripture of the Sikhs, regarded as the teachings of the Ten Gurus.  The role of Guru Granth Sahib, as a source or guide of prayer,  is pivotal in  |Sikh|Sikh|.
