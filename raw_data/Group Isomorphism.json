Intuitively, group theorists view two isomorphic groups as follows: For every element g of a group G, there exists an element h of H such that h behaves in the same way as g . For instance, if g generates G, then so does h. This implies in particular that G and H are in bijective correspondence. Thus, the definition of an isomorphism is quite natural.

For example, for , multiplying all elements of Z 7 by 3, modulo 7, is an automorphism of order 6 in the automorphism group, because , while lower powers do not give 1. Thus this automorphism generates Z 6 . There is one more automorphism with this property: multiplying all elements of Z 7 by 5, modulo 7. Therefore, these two correspond to the elements 1 and 5 of Z 6 , in that order or conversely.     The automorphism group of Z 6 is isomorphic to Z 2 , because only each of the two elements 1 and 5 generate Z 6 , so apart from the identity we can only interchange these.     The automorphism group of  has order 168, as can be found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so we can choose which plays the role of .
