            Hydropower or water power  is  |power|Power|  derived from the  |energy|Energy|  of falling or fast-running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower from many kinds of  |watermills|Watermill|  has been used as a  |renewable_energy|Renewable_Energy|  source for  |irrigation|Irrigation|  and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as  |gristmills|Gristmill| ,  |sawmills|Sawmill| ,  |textile|Textile|  mills,  |trip_hammers|Trip_Hammer| , dock  |cranes|Crane| , domestic  |lifts|Elevator| , and  |ore|Ore|  mills. A  |trompe|Trompe| , which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.       In the late 19th century, hydropower became a source for generating  |electricity|Electricity| .  |Cragside|Cragside|  in Northumberland was the first house powered by  |hydroelectricity|Hydroelectricity|  in 1878  and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at  |Niagara_Falls|Niagara_Falls|  in 1879. In 1881, street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower.     Since the early 20th century, the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of hydroelectric power. International institutions such as the  |World_Bank|World_Bank|  view hydropower as a means for  |economic_development|Economic_Development|  without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere,    but  |dams|Dam|  can have significant negative  |social|Social_Impact_Assessment|  and  |environmental_impacts|Environmental_Impact_Assessment| .

The earliest evidence of  |water_wheels|Water_Wheel|  and  |watermills|Watermill|  date back to the  |ancient_Near_East|Ancient_Near_East|  in the 4th century BC, Terry S. Reynolds, Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel, JHU Press, 2002 , p. 14 specifically in the  |Persian_Empire|Persian_Empire|  before 350  BCE, in the regions of  |Iraq|Iraq| ,  |Iran|Iran| ,  and  |Egypt|Egypt| .  In China, watermills were widely used since the  |Han_dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  . In China and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated pot wheel pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals. In the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  , water-powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone.     The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as  |hushing|Hushing| . The method was first used at the  |Dolaucothi_Gold_Mines|Dolaucothi_Gold_Mines|  in  |Wales|Wales|  from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in Spain at such mines as  |Las_Médulas|Las_Médulas| . Hushing was also widely used in  |Britain|Great_Britain|  in the  |Medieval|Middle_Ages|  and later periods to extract  |lead|Lead|  and  |tin|Tin|  ores.  It later evolved into  |hydraulic_mining|Hydraulic_Mining|  when used during the  |California_Gold_Rush|California_Gold_Rush| .     In the  |Muslim_world|Muslim_World|  during the  |Islamic_Golden_Age|Islamic_Golden_Age|  and  |Arab_Agricultural_Revolution|Arab_Agricultural_Revolution|  , engineers made wide use of hydropower as well as early uses of  |tidal_power|Tidal_Power| ,  |Ahmad_Y_al_Hassan|Ahmad_Y_Al_Hassan|  .

A variety of water-powered industrial mills were used in the Islamic world, including  |fulling|Fulling|  mills,  |gristmills|Gristmill| ,  |paper_mills|Paper_Mill| ,  |hullers|Rice_Huller| ,  |sawmills|Sawmill| ,  |ship_mills|Ship_Mill| ,  |stamp_mills|Stamp_Mill| ,  |steel_mills|Steel_Mill| ,  |sugar_mills|Sugar_Refinery| , and  |tide_mills|Tide_Mill| . By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from  |Al_Andalus|Al_Andalus|  and  |North_Africa|North_Africa|  to the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  and  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| . Adam Robert Lucas , Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe , Technology and Culture 46 , pp. 1–30 Muslim engineers also used  |water_turbines|Water_Turbine| , employed  |gears|Gear|  in watermills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of  |dams|Dams|  as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.  |Ahmad_Y_al_Hassan|Ahmad_Y_Al_Hassan| ,       Islamic mechanical engineer  |Al_Jazari|Al_Jazari|  described designs for 50 devices, many of them water powered, in his book, The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. These include  |an_endless_belt_with_jugs_attached|Scoop_Wheel| , a cow-powered  |shadoof|Shadoof| , and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.       In 1753, French engineer  |Bernard_Forest_de_Bélidor|Bernard_Forest_De_Bélidor|  published Architecture Hydraulique which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines.  The growing demand for the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  would drive development as well.       |Hydraulic_power_networks|Hydraulic_Power_Network|  used pipes to carry pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in  |Victorian|Victorian_Era|  cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in  |Geneva|Geneva| , Switzerland. The world-famous  |Jet_dEau|Jet_Deau|  was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network.      At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main source of power for new inventions such as  |Richard_Arkwrights|Richard_Arkwright| |_water_frame|Water_Frame| .  Although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small  |blast_furnaces|Blast_Furnace|    and  |gristmills|Gristmill| , such as those built at  |Saint_Anthony_Falls|Saint_Anthony_Falls| , which uses the 50-foot drop in the  |Mississippi_River|Mississippi_River| .     In the 1830s, at the early peak in the US  |canal|Canal| -building, hydropower provided the energy to transport  |barge|Barge|  traffic up and down steep hills using  |inclined_plane_railroads|Cable_Railway| . As railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the  |history_of_Lowell_Massachusetts|History_Of_Lowell_Massachusetts|  is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.      Technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed  |turbine|Turbine|  or  |water_motor|Water_Engine| . In 1848  |James_B_Francis|James_B_Francis| , while working as head engineer of Lowells Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency. He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a sites specific flow conditions. The  |Francis_reaction_turbine|Francis_Turbine|  is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry,  |Lester_Allan_Pelton|Lester_Allan_Pelton|  developed the high efficiency  |Pelton_wheel_impulse_turbine|Pelton_Wheel| , which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.       A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available  |power|Power| . Power is a function of the  |hydraulic_head|Hydraulic_Head|  and  |volumetric_flow_rate|Volumetric_Flow_Rate| . The head is the energy per unit weight of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.     The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity:     ::   -    -        :where   ::    is the useful power output    ::    is the efficiency of the turbine    ::   is the  |mass_flow_rate|Mass_Flow_Rate|     ::    is the  |density|Density|  of water    ::   is the  |volumetric_flow_rate|Volumetric_Flow_Rate|    :: g is the  |acceleration_due_to_gravity|Standard_Gravity|     ::   h  is the difference in height between the outlet and inlet     To illustrate, the power output of a turbine that is 85% efficient, with a flow rate of 80 cubic metres per second and a head of 145 metres , is 97 Megawatts:   :   0.85  1000     80     9.81     145     97   106   97         Operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as  |ASME|Asme|  PTC 18 and  |IEC|International_Electrotechnical_Commission|  60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturers guaranteed efficiency. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tail water level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of  |significant_digits|Significant_Digit|  of constants must be considered.     Some hydropower systems such as  |water_wheels|Water_Wheel|  can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.    The water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of  |flow_records|Streamflow| , sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant  |environmental_impact|Environmental_Impact_Of_Reservoirs| , as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, probable maximum flood that can be expected at the site; a  |spillway|Spillway|  is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam. A computer  |model_of_the_hydraulic_basin|Hydrological_Model|  and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.       Large dams can ruin river ecosystems, cover large areas of land causing green house gas emissions from underwater rotting vegetation and displace thousands of people and affect their livelihood.

Where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate  |compressed_air|Compressed_Air|  directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the  |Montreal_River|Montreal_River|  at Ragged Shutes near  |Cobalt_Ontario|Cobalt_Ontario|  in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.           Hydroelectricity is the application of hydropower to generate electricity.   It is the primary use of hydropower today.    |Hydroelectric_power_plants|Hydroelectric_Power_Plant|  can include a  |reservoir|Reservoir|   to exploit the energy of falling water, or can use the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of water as in  |run_of_the_river_hydroelectricity|Run_Of_The_River_Hydroelectricity| .   Hydroelectric plants can vary in size from small community sized plants  to very large plants supplying power to a whole country.   As of 2019, the  |five_largest_power_stations_in_the_world|List_Of_Largest_Power_Stations|  are conventional hydroelectric power stations with dams.     Hydroelectricity can also be used to store energy in the form of  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy|  between two reservoirs at different heights with  |pumped_storage_hydroelectricity|Pumped_Storage_Hydroelectricity| .   Water is pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.     Other forms of electricity generation with hydropower include  |tidal_stream_generators|Tidal_Stream_Generator|  using energy from  |tidal_power|Tidal_Power|  generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity.   |conventional|Hydroelectricitygenerating_Methods| |_Chief_Joseph_Dam|Chief_Joseph_Dam|  near  |Bridgeport_Washington|Bridgeport_Washington| , is a major  |run_of_the_river_station|Run_Of_The_River_Hydroelectricity| |_Micro_hydro|Micro_Hydro| |_Ffestiniog_Pumped_Storage_Scheme|Ffestiniog_Power_Station|  in  |Wales|Wales| .
