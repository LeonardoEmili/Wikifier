Preacher is an  |American_comic_book|American_Comic_Book|  series published by  |Vertigo|Vertigo| , an  |imprint|Imprint|  of  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| . The series was created by writer  |Garth_Ennis|Garth_Ennis|  and artist  |Steve_Dillon|Steve_Dillon|  with painted covers by  |Glenn_Fabry|Glenn_Fabry| .     The series consists of 75 issues in total - 66 regular, monthly issues, five  |one-shot_specials|One-Shot|  and a four-issue Preacher: Saint of Killers  |limited_series|Limited_Series| . The final monthly issue, number 66, was published in October 2000. The entire run has been collected in three series of trade paperbacks, an original run of nine volumes, a second run of six, and three special oversized Absolute volumes.            Preacher tells the story of  |Jesse_Custer|Jesse_Custer| , a preacher in the small  |Texas|Texas|  town of Annville. Custer is accidentally possessed by the supernatural creature named Genesis, the infant of the unauthorized, unnatural coupling of an angel and a demon. The incident flattens Custers church and kills his entire congregation.     Genesis has no sense of individual will, but since it is composed of both pure goodness and pure evil, its power might rival that of God Himself, making Jesse Custer, bonded to Genesis, potentially the most powerful being in the universe.     Driven by a strong sense of right and wrong, Custer journeys across the United States attempting to literally find God, who abandoned Heaven the moment Genesis was born. He also begins to discover the truth about his new powers. They allow him, when he wills it, to command the obedience of those who hear and comprehend his words. He is joined by his old girlfriend  |Tulip_OHare|Tulip_Ohare| , as well as a hard-drinking Irish vampire named  |Cassidy|Cassidy| .     During the course of their journeys, the three encounter enemies and obstacles both sacred and profane, including  |The_Saint_of_Killers|The_Saint_Of_Killers| , an invincible, quick-drawing, perfect-aiming, come-lately  |Angel_of_Death|Death|  answering only to He who sits on the throne ; a disfigured suicide attempt survivor turned rock-star named Arseface; a serial-killer called the Reaver-Cleaver; The Grail, a secret organization controlling the governments of the world and protecting the bloodline of Jesus; Herr Starr, ostensible Allfather of the Grail, a megalomaniac with a penchant for prostitutes, who wishes to use Custer for his own ends; several fallen angels; and Jesses own  |redneck|Redneck|  family â€” particularly his nasty  |Cajun|Cajun|  grandmother, her mighty bodyguard Jody, and the animal-loving T.C.                                        |Garth_Ennis|Garth_Ennis| , feeling Preacher would translate perfectly as a film, sold the  |film_rights|Film_Rights|  to  |Electric_Entertainment|Electric_Entertainment| .  |Rachel_Talalay|Rachel_Talalay|  was hired to direct, with Ennis writing the script. Rupert Harvey and  |Tom_Astor|Tom_Astor|  were set as producers. By May 1998, Ennis completed three drafts of the script, based largely on the Gone to Texas story arc.  The filmmakers found it difficult financing Preacher because investors found the idea religiously controversial. Ennis approached  |Kevin_Smith|Kevin_Smith|  and  |Scott_Mosier|Scott_Mosier|  to help finance the film under their  |View_Askew_Productions|View_Askew_Productions|  banner. Ennis, Smith and Mosier  |pitch|Pitch| ed Preacher to  |Bob_Weinstein|Bob_Weinstein|  at  |Miramax_Films|Miramax_Films| .     Weinstein was confused by the characterization of  |Jesse_Custer|Jesse_Custer| . Miramax also did not want to share the box office gross with Electric Entertainment, ultimately dropping the pitch. By May 2000, Smith and Mosier were still attached to produce with Talalay directing, but Smith did not know the status of Preacher, feeling it would languish in  |development_hell|Development_Hell| .  By then, Storm Entertainment, a UK-based production company known for their work on  |independent_films|Independent_Films| , joined the production with Electric Entertainment. In September 2001, the two companies announced Preacher had been  |greenlight|Greenlight| ed to commence  |pre-production|Pre-Production| , with filming to begin in November and Talalay still directing Ennis script.  The production and start dates were pushed back because of financial issues  of the $25 million projected budget.      |James_Marsden|James_Marsden|  was cast in the lead role as Jesse Custer sometime in 2002. He explained, It was something I never knew anything about, but once I got my hands on the comic books, I was blown away by it. In a March 2004 interview, Marsden said the filmmakers were hoping for filming to start the following August.  With the full-length film adaptation eventually abandoned with budgetary concerns,  |HBO|Hbo|  announced in November 2006 that they commissioned  |Mark_Steven_Johnson|Mark_Steven_Johnson|  and  |Howard_Deutch|Howard_Deutch|  to produce a  |television_pilot|Television_Pilot| . Johnson was to write with Deutch directing.  Impressed with Johnsons pilot script, HBO had him write the  |series_bible|Bible|  for the first season.  Johnson originally planned to turn each comic book issue into a single episode on a  |shot-for-shot|Shot-For-Shot|  basis. I gave the comics, and I said, Every issue is an hour. Garth Ennis said You dont have to be so beholden to the comic. And Im like, No, no, no. Its got to be like the comic.      Johnson also wanted to make sure that  |one-shots|One-Shot|  were included as well.  Johnson changed his position, citing new storylines conceived by Ennis. Well, there would be nothing new to add if we did that, so Garth and I have been creating new stories for the series, he said. I love the book so much and I was telling Garth that he has to make the stories we are coming up with as comics because I want to see them. By August 2008, new  |studio_executives|Studio_Executive|  at HBO decided to abandon the idea, finding it too stylistically dark and religiously controversial.   |Columbia_Pictures|Columbia_Pictures|  then purchased the film rights in October 2008 with  |Sam_Mendes|Sam_Mendes|  planned to direct.  |Neal_H._Moritz|Neal_H._Moritz|  and Jason Netter would have produced the film. The previous scripts written by Ennis would not have been used.           On November 16, 2013, it was announced that  |AMC|Amc|  would be shooting a pilot for Preacher.
