        Phase modulation  is a  |modulation|Modulation|  pattern for conditioning communication signals for  |transmission|Transmission| . It encodes a message signal as variations in the  |instantaneous_phase|Instantaneous_Phase|  of a  |carrier_wave|Carrier_Wave| . Phase modulation is one of the two principal forms of  |angle_modulation|Angle_Modulation| , together with  |frequency_modulation|Frequency_Modulation| .     The phase of a carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing signal level of the message signal. The peak amplitude and the frequency of the carrier signal are maintained constant, but as the amplitude of the message signal changes, the phase of the carrier changes correspondingly.     Phase modulation is widely used for transmitting  |radio|Radio|  waves and is an integral part of many digital transmission coding schemes that underlie a wide range of technologies like  |Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi| ,  |GSM|Gsm|  and  |satellite_television|Satellite_Television| .     PM is used for signal and  |waveform|Waveform|  generation in  |digital_synthesizers|Digital_Synthesizer| , such as the  |Yamaha_DX7|Yamaha_Dx7| , to implement  |FM_synthesis|Fm_Synthesis| . A related type of sound synthesis called  |phase_distortion|Phase_Distortion_Synthesis|  is used in the  |Casio_CZ_synthesizers|Casio_Cz_Synthesizers| .          PM changes the  |phase_angle|Phase_Angle|  of the  |complex_envelope|Complex_Envelope|  in direct proportion to the message signal.     If m is the message signal to be transmitted and the carrier onto which the signal is modulated is   : c Ac  ,     then the modulated signal is   : y Ac      This shows how m modulates the phase - the greater m is at a point in time, the greater the phase shift of the modulated signal at that point. It can also be viewed as a change of the frequency of the carrier signal, and phase modulation can thus be considered a special case of FM in which the carrier frequency modulation is given by the time  |derivative|Derivative|  of the phase modulation.     The modulation signal could here be   : m       The mathematics of the  |spectral|Spectral_Density|  behavior reveals that there are two regions of particular interest:   For small  |amplitude|Amplitude|  signals, PM is similar to  |amplitude_modulation|Amplitude_Modulation|  and exhibits its unfortunate doubling of  |baseband|Baseband| |bandwidth|Bandwidth|  and poor efficiency.   For a single large  |sinusoidal|Sinusoidal|  signal, PM is similar to FM, and its  |bandwidth|Bandwidth|  is approximately   :: 2  ,   :where f    and h is the modulation index defined below. This is also known as  |Carsons_Rule|Carson_Bandwidth_Rule|  for PM.       As with other  |modulation_indices|Modulation_Index| , this quantity indicates by how much the modulated variable varies around its unmodulated level. It relates to the variations in the phase of the carrier signal:   : h      ,   where     is the peak phase deviation.
