     Galatia  was an ancient area in the highlands of central  |Anatolia|Anatolia| , roughly corresponding to the  |provinces|Provinces_Of_Turkey|  of  |Ankara|Ankara_Province| ,  |Çorum|Çorum_Province| , and  |Yozgat|Yozgat_Province| , in modern  |Turkey|Turkey| . Galatia was named after the  |Gauls|Gauls|  from  |Thrace|Thrace|  , who settled here and became its ruling caste in the 3rd century BC, following the  |Gallic_invasion_of_the_Balkans|Gallic_Invasion_Of_The_Balkans|  in 279 BC. It has been called the Gallia of the East, Roman writers calling its inhabitants Galli .       Galatia was bounded on the north by  |Bithynia|Bithynia|  and  |Paphlagonia|Paphlagonia| , on the east by  |Pontus|Pontus|  and  |Cappadocia|Cappadocia| , on the south by  |Cilicia|Cilicia|  and  |Lycaonia|Lycaonia| , and on the west by  |Phrygia|Phrygia| . Its capital was Ancyra .             The terms Galatians came to be used by the Greeks for the three Celtic peoples of Anatolia: the  |Tectosages|Tectosages| , the  |Trocmii|Trocmii| , and the  |Tolistobogii|Tolistobogii| .   By the 1st century BC the Celts had become so Hellenized that some Greek writers called them Hellenogalatai . See Diod.5.32-3; Just.26.2. Cf. Liv.38.17; Strabo 13.4.2. The Romans called them Gallograeci. Though the Celts had, to a large extent, integrated into  |Hellenistic|Hellenistic_Period|  Asia Minor, they preserved their linguistic and ethnic identity.     By the 4th century BC the Celts had penetrated into the  |Balkans|Balkans| , coming into contact with the  |Thracians|Thracians|  and Greeks. See The  |Periplus_of_Scylax|Periplus_Of_Scylax|  In 380 BC they fought in the southern regions of  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia|  , and rumors circulated around the ancient world that  |Alexander_the_Greats|Alexander_The_Great|  father,  |Philip_II_of_Macedonia|Philip_Ii_Of_Macedonia|  had been assassinated by a dagger of Celtic origins. See Diod. 16, 94, 3   |Arrian|Arrian|  writes that Celts established on the Ionic coast were among those who came to meet Alexander the Great during a campaign against the  |Getae|Getae|  in 335 BC. See also Strabo, vii, 3, 8. Several ancient accounts mention that the Celts formed an alliance with  |Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse|Dionysius_I_Of_Syracuse|  who sent them to fight alongside the  |Macedonians|Ancient_Macedonians|  against the  |Thebans|Thebes_Greece| . Justin, xx, 4, 9; Xen., Hell., vii, 1, 20, 31; Diod., xv, 70. For a full discussion see  |Henri_Hubert|Henri_Hubert| , The Rise of the Celts, 1966 pp. 5-6 In 279 BC two Celtic factions united under the leadership of  |Brennus|Brennus|  and began to push southwards from southern Bulgaria towards the Greek states. According to  |Livy|Livy| , a sizable force split off from this main group and head toward  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor| .      For several years a federation of Hellespontine cities, including  |Byzantion|Byzantion|  and  |Chalkedon|Chalkedon|  prevented the Celts from entering Asia Minor but this changed when  |Nikomedes_I|Nicomedes_I_Of_Bithynia|  of  |Bithynia|Bithynia|  allied with some of the Celtic leaders in a war against his brother  |Zipoetes|Zipoetes|  and the  |Seleucid|Seleucid|  king  |Antiochus_I|Antiochus_I_Soter| . When the Celts finally entered Asia Minor chaos ensued until the Celts were briefly routed by Antiochus army in the  |Battle_of_Elephants|Battle_Of_Elephants| . In the aftermath of the battle the Celts withdrew to  |Phrygia|Phrygia| , eventually settling in Galatia.   The territory of Celtic Galatia included the cities of  |Ancyra|Ankara|  ,  |Pessinus|Pessinus| ,  |Tavium|Tavium| , and  |Gordion|Gordium| .             Upon the death of Deiotarus, the Kingdom of Galatia was given to  |Amyntas|Amyntas_Of_Galatia| , an auxiliary commander in the Roman army of Brutus and Cassius who gained the favor of Mark Antony. It appears Amyntas was quite prodigious in striking coins for his various exploits — After his death in 25 BC, Galatia was incorporated by  |Augustus|Augustus|  into the Roman Empire, becoming a Roman province.  Near his capital Ancyra , Pylamenes, the kings heir, rebuilt a temple of the  |Phrygia|Phrygia| n god  |Men|Men|  to venerate Augustus , as a sign of fidelity. It was on the walls of this temple in Galatia that the major source for the  Res Gestae  of Augustus were preserved for modernity. Few of the provinces proved more enthusiastically loyal to Rome.      |Josephus|Josephus|  related the Biblical figure  |Gomer|Gomer|  to Galatia : For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians, but were then called Gomerites.  |Josephus|Josephus| .  Antiquities of the Jews , I:6. Others have related Gomer to  |Cimmerians|Cimmerians| .      |Paul_the_Apostle|Paul_The_Apostle|  visited Galatia in his missionary journeys, Acts  and Acts  and wrote to the Christians there in the  |Epistle_to_the_Galatians|Epistle_To_The_Galatians| .     Although originally possessing a strong  |cultural_identity|Celts| , by the 2nd century AD, the Galatians had become  |assimilated|Cultural_Assimilation|   into the  |Hellenistic_civilization|Hellenistic_Period|  of  |Anatolia|Anatolia| .    The Galatians were still speaking the  |Galatian_language|Galatian_Language|  in the time of St.  |Jerome|Jerome|  , who wrote that the Galatians of Ancyra and the  |Treveri|Treveri|  of  |Trier|Trier|   spoke the same  |language|Gaulish_Language|  .     In an administrative reorganisation , two new provinces succeeded it, Galatia Prima and Galatia Secunda or Salutaris objet dart, 3rd century BC.  |Istanbul_Archaeological_Museum|Istanbul_Archaeological_Museum| |_Hidirsihlar|Hidirsihlar| |_tumulus|Tumulus| ,  |Bolu|Bolu| |_Bolu|Bolu| |_torc|Torc| .
