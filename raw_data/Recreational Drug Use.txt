        Recreational drug use is the use of a  |psychoactive_drug|Psychoactive_Drug|  to induce an  |altered_state_of_consciousness|Altered_State_Of_Consciousness|  for pleasure, by modifying the perceptions, feelings, and emotions of the user. When a psychoactive drug enters the users body, it induces an  |intoxicating_effect|Substance_Intoxication| . Generally, recreational drugs are in three categories:  |depressants|Depressant|  ;  |stimulants|Stimulant|  ; and  |hallucinogens|Hallucinogen|  . Many people also use prescribed and illegal  |opioids|Opioids|  along with  |opiates|Opiates|  and  |benzodiazepines|Benzodiazepines| . In popular practice, recreational drug use generally is a tolerated social behaviour, rather than perceived as the serious medical condition of  |self-medication|Self-Medication| . However, heavy use of some drugs is socially stigmatized.     Recreational drugs include  |alcohol|Alcohol|  ;  |cannabis|Cannabis|  and  |hashish|Hashish| ;  |nicotine|Nicotine|  ;  |caffeine|Caffeine|  ;  |prescription_drugs|Prescription_Drugs| ; and the  |controlled_substances|Controlled_Substance|  listed as illegal drugs in the  |Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs|Single_Convention_On_Narcotic_Drugs|  and the  |Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances|Convention_On_Psychotropic_Substances|  of the United Nations. What controlled substances are considered illegal drugs varies by country, but usually includes  |methamphetamine|Methamphetamine| ,  |heroin|Heroin| ,  |cocaine|Cocaine| ,  |LSD|Lsd| ,  |psilocybin_mushrooms|Psilocybin_Mushroom| ,  |MDMA|Mdma|  and  |club_drugs|Club_Drug| . In 2015, it was estimated that about 5% of people aged 15 to 65 had used  |illegal_drugs|Illegal_Drugs|  at least once .                         Many researchers have explored the  |etiology|Etiology|  of recreational drug use. Some of the most common theories are: genetics, personality type, psychological problems, self-medication, gender, age, instant gratification, basic human need, curiosity, rebelliousness, a sense of belonging to a group, family and attachment issues, history of trauma, failure at school or work, socioeconomic stressors, peer pressure, juvenile delinquency, availability, historical factors, or sociocultural influences.  There has not been agreement around any one single cause. Instead, experts tend to apply the  |biopsychosocial_model|Biopsychosocial_Model| . Any number of these factors are likely to influence an individuals drug use as they are not  |mutually_exclusive|Mutually_Exclusive| .  Regardless of genetics, mental health or traumatic experiences, social factors play a large role in exposure to and availability of certain types of drugs and patterns of drug use.     According to addiction researcher Martin A. Plant, many people go through a period of self-redefinition before initiating recreational drug use. They tend to view using drugs as part of a general lifestyle that involves belonging to a subculture that they associate with heightened status and the challenging of social norms. Plant says, “From the users point of view there are many positive reasons to become part of the milieu of drug taking. The reasons for drug use appear to have as much to do with needs for friendship, pleasure and status as they do with unhappiness or poverty. Becoming a drug taker, to many people, is a positive affirmation rather than a negative experience.”               |Anthropological|Anthropological|  research has suggested that humans may have evolved to counter-exploit plant  |neurotoxins|Neurotoxin|  . The ability to use botanical chemicals to serve the function of  |endogenous|Endogenous| |neurotransmitters|Neurotransmitter|  may have improved survival rates, conferring an evolutionary advantage. A typically restrictive prehistoric diet may have emphasised the apparent benefit of consuming  |psychoactive_drugs|Psychoactive_Drug| , which had themselves evolved to imitate neurotransmitters.  Chemical–ecological adaptations, and the genetics of  |hepatic|Hepatic| |enzymes|Enzymes| , particularly  |cytochrome|Cytochrome| |P450|Cytochrome_P450| , have led researchers to propose that humans have shared a co-evolutionary relationship with  |psychotropic|Psychotropic|  plant substances that is millions of years old.                Severity and type of risks that come with recreational drug use vary widely with the drug in question and the amount being used. There are many factors in the environment and within the user that interact with each drug differently. Overall, some studies suggest that alcohol is one of the most dangerous of all recreational drugs; only heroin, crack cocaine, and methamphetamines are judged to be more harmful. However, studies which focus on a moderate level of alcohol consumption have concluded that there can be substantial health benefits from its use, such as decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and cognitive decline.     This claim has been disputed. Researcher  |David_Nutt|David_Nutt|  stated that these studies showing benefits for moderate alcohol consumption lacked control for the variable of what the subjects were drinking, beforehand.  Experts in the UK have suggested that some drugs that may be causing less harm, to fewer users , include cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, and ecstasy. These drugs are not without their own particular risks.           The concept of responsible drug use is that a person can use drugs recreationally or otherwise with reduced or eliminated risk of negatively affecting other aspects of ones life or other peoples lives. Advocates of this philosophy point to the many well-known artists and intellectuals who have used drugs, experimentally or otherwise, with few detrimental effects on their lives. Responsible drug use becomes problematic only when the use of the substance significantly interferes with the users daily life.     Responsible drug use advocates that users should not take drugs at the same time as activities such as driving, swimming, operating machinery, or other activities that are unsafe without a sober state. Responsible drug use is emphasized as a primary prevention technique in harm-reduction drug policies. Harm-reduction policies were popularized in the late 1980s, although they began in the 1970s counter-culture, when cartoons explaining responsible drug use and the consequences of irresponsible drug use were distributed to users.  Another issue is that the illegality of drugs in itself also causes social and economic consequences for those using them—the drugs may be cut with adulterants and the purity varies wildly, making overdoses more likely—and legalization of drug production and distribution would reduce these and other dangers of illegal drug use.  Harm reduction seeks to minimize the harm that can occur through the use of various drugs, whether legal , or illegal . For example, people who take drugs intravenously can minimize harm to both themselves and members of the community through proper injecting technique, using new needles and syringes each time, and proper disposal of all injecting equipment.       In efforts to curtail recreational drug use, governments worldwide introduced several laws prohibiting the possession of almost all varieties of recreational drugs during the 20th century. The Wests  |War_on_Drugs|War_On_Drugs|  however, is now facing increasing criticism. Evidence is insufficient to tell if behavioral interventions help prevent recreational drug use in children.      One in four adolescents has used an illegal drug and one in ten of those adolescents who need addiction treatment get some type of care.  School-based programs are the most commonly used method for drug use education despite the success rates of these intervention programs this success is highly dependent on the commitment of participants.                    Alcohol is the most widely used drug in Australia.  86.2% of Australians aged 12 years and over have consumed alcohol at least once in their lifetime, compared to 34.8% of Australians aged 12 years and over who have used cannabis at least once in their lifetime.         In the 1960s, the number of Americans who had tried cannabis at least once increased over twentyfold. In 1969, the FBI reported that between the years 1966 and 1968, the number of arrests for marijuana possession, which had been outlawed throughout the United States under  |Marijuana_Tax_Act_of_1937|Marihuana_Tax_Act_Of_1937| , had increased by 98%.  Despite acknowledgement that drug use was greatly growing among Americas youth during the late 1960s, surveys have suggested that only as much as 4% of the American population had ever smoked marijuana by 1969.  Jennifer Robison, Gallup.com, 2 July 2002, Accessed 13 November 2013 By 1972, however, that number would increase to 12%. That number would then double by 1977.     The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana along with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug, i.e., having the relatively highest abuse potential and no accepted medical use. Most marijuana at that time came from Mexico, but in 1975 the Mexican government agreed to eradicate the crop by spraying it with the herbicide paraquat, raising fears of toxic side effects. Colombia then became the main supplier. The zero tolerance climate of the Reagan and Bush administrations resulted in passage of strict laws and mandatory sentences for possession of marijuana and in heightened vigilance against smuggling at the southern borders. The  |war_on_drugs|War_On_Drugs|  thus brought with it a shift from reliance on imported supplies to domestic cultivation . Beginning in 1982, the Drug Enforcement Administration turned increased attention to marijuana farms in the United States, and there was a shift to the indoor growing of plants specially developed for small size and high yield. After over a decade of decreasing use, marijuana smoking began an upward trend once more in the early 1990s, especially among teenagers, but by the end of the decade this upswing had leveled off well below former peaks of use.           Many movements and organizations are advocating for or against the  |liberalization_of_the_use_of_recreational_drugs|Drug_Liberalization| , notably  |cannabis_legalization|Cannabis_Legalization| .  |Subcultures|Subculture|  have emerged among users of recreational drugs, as well as among those who abstain from them, such as  |teetotalism|Teetotalism|  and  |straight_edge|Straight_Edge|  .     The prevalence of recreational drugs in human societies is widely reflected in fiction, entertainment, and the arts, subject to prevailing laws and social conventions. In  |video_games|Video_Games| , for example, enemies are often drug dealers, a narrative device that justifies the player killing them. Other games portray drugs as a kind of  |power-up|Power-Up|  ; their effect is often unrealistically conveyed by making the screen wobble and blur.          The following substances are used recreationally:     |Alcohol|Alcohol| |ethanol|Ethanol| , . Drinking alcohol creates  |intoxication|Alcohol_Intoxication| , relaxation and lowered inhibitions. It is produced by the  |fermentation|Fermentation|  of  |sugars|Sugar|  by  |yeasts|Yeast|  to create  |wine|Wine| ,  |beer|Beer| , and  |distilled_liquor|Distilled_Liquor|  . In most areas of the world, it is legal for those over a certain age . It is an  |IARC|International_Agency_For_Research_On_Cancer| |Group_1_carcinogen|List_Of_Iarc_Group_1_Carcinogens|  and a  |teratogen|Teratogen| .  Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening.     |Amphetamines|Amphetamine| : Used recreationally to provide alertness and a sense of energy. Prescribed for  |ADHD|Adhd| , narcolepsy, depression and weight loss. A potent  |central_nervous_system|Central_Nervous_System| |stimulant|Stimulant| , in the 1940s and 50s  |methamphetamine|Methamphetamine|  was used by Axis and Allied troops in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , and, later on, other armies, and by Japanese factory workers. It increases muscle strength and fatigue resistance and improves reaction time.  Methamphetamine use can be  |neurotoxic|Neurotoxic| , which means it damages  |dopamine|Dopamine|  neurons.  As a result of this brain damage, chronic use can lead to  |post_acute_withdrawal_syndrome|Post_Acute_Withdrawal_Syndrome| .     |Caffeine|Caffeine| |coffee|Coffee| ,  |black_tea|Black_Tea| ,  |energy_drinks|Energy_Drink| , some  |soft_drinks|Soft_Drink|  , and  |chocolate|Chocolate| . It is the worlds most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but has only mild dependence liability for long-term users.     |Cannabis|Cannabis| |marijuana|Marijuana|  and  |hashish|Hashish| , which are smoked or eaten. It contains at least 85  |cannabinoids|Cannabinoid| . The primary  |psychoactive|Psychoactive|  component is  |THC|Thc| , which mimics the neurotransmitter  |anandamide|Anandamide| , named after the  |Hindu|Hindu|  ananda, joy, bliss, delight .    |Cocaine|Cocaine| |crack_cocaine|Crack_Cocaine|  is typically smoked. When transformed into its freebase form,  |crack|Crack_Cocaine| , the cocaine vapour may be inhaled directly. This is thought to increase  |bioavailability|Bioavailability| , but has also been found to be toxic, due to the production of  |methylecgonidine|Methylecgonidine|  during  |pyrolysis|Pyrolysis| .   |British_Journal_of_Pharmacology|British_Journal_Of_Pharmacology| |MDMA|Mdma| |club_drug|Club_Drug|  in the  |rave|Rave|  scene.    |Electronic_cigarette|Electronic_Cigarette|  Most  |e-cigarette_liquids|Construction_Of_Electronic_Cigarettese-Cigarette_Liquid|  contain  |nicotine|Nicotine| , but the level of nicotine varies depending on user-preference and manufacturers.  Nicotine is highly  |addictive|Addictive| ,    comparable to heroin or cocaine.  E-cigarettes are being used to inhale MDMA, cocaine powder, crack cocaine, synthetic cathinones, mephedrone, α-PVP, synthetic cannabinoids, opioids, heroin, fentanyl, tryptamines, and ketamine.     |Ketamine|Ketamine| |dissociative|Dissociative|  and  |analgesic|Analgesic|  qualities and illegally in the  |club_drug|Club_Drug|  scene.    |Lean|Purple_Drank| |soft_drinks|Soft_Drinks|  and  |codeine|Codeine| . It originated in the 1990s in  |Houston|Houston| . Ever since then, this drug usage has grown and many people use this at parties becoming popular at the rave scene. Many people would get a drowsy feeling when consuming this drug.    |LSD|Lsd| |ergoline|Ergoline|  derivative, that was first  |synthesized|Organic_Synthesis|  in 1938 by Hofmann. However, he failed to notice its psychedelic potential until 1943.  In the 1950s, it was used in psychological therapy, and, covertly, by the  |CIA|Cia|  in Project  |MKULTRA|Mkultra| , in which the drug was administered to unwitting US and Canadian citizens. It played a central role in 1960s counter-culture, and was banned in October 1968 by US President  |Lyndon_B_Johnson|Lyndon_B_Johnson| .      |Nitrous_oxide|Nitrous_Oxide| , as it causes perceptual effects, a high and at higher doses, hallucinations.    |Opiates|Opiates|  and  |opioids|Opioids| |oxycodone|Oxycodone| ,  |hydrocodone|Hydrocodone| ,  |codeine|Codeine| ,  |fentanyl|Fentanyl| ,  |heroin|Heroin| , and  |morphine|Morphine| . Opioids have a high potential for  |addiction|Addiction|  and have the ability to induce severe physical  |withdrawal|Drug_Withdrawal|  symptoms upon cessation of frequent use. Heroin can be smoked, insufflated or turned into a solution with water and injected.    |Psilocybin_mushrooms|Psilocybin_Mushroom| : This hallucinogenic drug was an important drug in the  |psychedelic|Psychedelic_Drug|  scene. Until 1963, when it was chemically analysed by  |Albert_Hofmann|Albert_Hofmann| , it was completely unknown to modern science that  Psilocybe semilanceata  contains  |psilocybin|Psilocybin| , a hallucinogen previously identified only in species native to Mexico, Asia, and North America.     |Tobacco|Tobacco|  Nicotiana tabacum . Nicotine is the key drug contained in tobacco leaves, which are either smoked, chewed or  |snuff|Snuff| ed. It contains nicotine, which crosses the  |blood–brain_barrier|Blood–Brain_Barrier|  in 10–20 seconds. It mimics the action of the  |neurotransmitter|Neurotransmitter| |acetylcholine|Acetylcholine|  at  |nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptors|Nicotinic_Acetylcholine_Receptors|  in the brain and the  |neuromuscular_junction|Neuromuscular_Junction| . The  |neuron|Neuron| al forms of the receptor are present both post- |synaptically|Synapse|   and pre-synaptically, where they can influence the release of multiple neurotransmitters.     |Tranquilizers|Tranquilizers| |barbiturates|Barbiturates| ,  |benzodiazepines|Benzodiazepines| |Bath_salts|Bath_Salts|  : this is the street name for  |Mephedrone|Mephedrone| / |Methylenedioxypyrovalerone|Methylenedioxypyrovalerone| |DMT|N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|  – primary ingredient in  |ayahuasca|Ayahuasca| , can also be smoked in a  |crack_pipe|Crack_Pipe| ; briefly causes a total loss of connection to external reality     |Peyote|Peyote| |mescaline|Mescaline| , native to southwestern  |Texas|Texas|  and  |Mexico|Mexico| |Salvia_divinorum|Salvia_Divinorum| |Mexican|Yucatán_Peninsula|  herb in the  |mint|Lamiaceae|  family; not considered recreational, most likely due to the nature of the hallucinations    |Synthetic_cannabis|Synthetic_Cannabis| |JWH-018|Jwh-018| ,  |AM-2201|Am-2201| |Research_chemicals|Research_Chemical| :  |2C|2C|  variants, etc.                Drugs often associated with a particular  |route_of_administration|Route_Of_Administration| . Many drugs can be consumed in more than one way. For example,  |marijuana|Marijuana|  can be swallowed like food or smoked, and cocaine can be sniffed in the nostrils, injected, or, with various modifications, smoked.      |inhalation|Inhalation| |insufflation|Insufflation| |mucous_membranes|Mucous_Membranes| . Drugs that are sniffed , or snorted , include powdered amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, ketamine and MDMA. Additionally, snuff tobacco    |intravenous_injection|Intravenous_Injection| |morphine|Morphine|  and heroin, less commonly other opioids. Stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine may also be injected. In rare cases, users inject other drugs.   oral intake: caffeine, ethanol, cannabis edibles, psilocybin mushrooms,  |coca_tea|Coca_Tea| ,  |poppy_tea|Poppy_Tea| ,  |laudanum|Laudanum| ,  |GHB|Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate| , ecstasy pills with MDMA or various other substances , prescription and over-the-counter drugs    |sublingual|Sublingual_Administration| |blood|Blood|  through  |tissues|Tissue|  under the tongue. Many psychoactive drugs can be or have been specifically designed for sublingual administration, including  |barbiturates|Barbiturate| , benzodiazepines,   |opioid|Opioid| |analgesics|Analgesics|  with poor gastrointestinal bioavailability,  |LSD|Lsd|  blotters,  |coca|Coca_Plant|  leaves, some hallucinogens. This route of administration is activated when chewing some forms of  |smokeless_tobacco|Smokeless_Tobacco|  .    |intrarectal|Rectal| |smoking|Smoking|  : tobacco, cannabis,  |opium|Opium| ,  |crystal_meth|Methamphetamine| ,  |phencyclidine|Phencyclidine| ,  |crack_cocaine|Crack_Cocaine|  and heroin known as  |chasing_the_dragon|Chasing_The_Dragon| |methylphenidate|Methylphenidate|   and  |fentanyl|Fentanyl|      Many drugs are taken through various routes. Intravenous route is the most efficient, but also one of the most dangerous. Nasal, rectal, inhalation and smoking are safer. The oral route is one of the safest and most comfortable, but of little  |bioavailability|Bioavailability| .            |Depressants|Depressant|  are psychoactive drugs that temporarily diminish the function or activity of a specific part of the body or mind.  Colloquially, depressants are known as downers , and users generally take them to feel more relaxed and less tense. Examples of these kinds of effects may include anxiolysis, sedation, and hypotension. Depressants are widely used throughout the world as  |prescription_medicines|Prescription_Medicine|  and as  |illicit_substances|Prohibition| . When these are used, effects may include  |anxiolysis|Anxiolysis|  ,  |analgesia|Analgesia|  ,  |sedation|Sedation| ,  |somnolence|Somnolence| , cognitive/memory impairment,  |dissociation|Dissociation| , muscle relaxation, lowered  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure| / |heart_rate|Heart_Rate| ,  |respiratory_depression|Respiratory_Depression| ,  |anesthesia|Anesthesia| , and  |anticonvulsant|Anticonvulsant|  effects. Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of  |GABA|Gaba|  or  |opioid|Opioid|  activity, and inhibition of  |adrenergic|Adrenergic| ,  |histamine|Histamine|  or  |acetylcholine|Acetylcholine|  activity. Some are also capable of inducing feelings of  |euphoria|Euphoria|  . The most widely used depressant by far is  |alcohol|Alcohol| .     Stimulants or uppers , such as  |amphetamines|Amphetamines|  or  |cocaine|Cocaine| , which increase mental or physical function, have an opposite effect to depressants.        |Antihistamines|Antihistamine|  inhibit the release or action of  |histamine|Histamine| . Antihistamine can be used to describe any histamine antagonist, but the term is usually reserved for the  |classical_antihistamines|H1_Antagonist|  that act upon the  |H_1_histamine_receptor|Histamine_H1_Receptor| . Antihistamines are used as treatment for  |allergies|Allergies| . Allergies are caused by an excessive response of the body to  |allergens|Allergens| , such as the  |pollen|Pollen|  released by grasses and trees. An allergic reaction causes release of histamine by the body. Other uses of antihistamines are to help with normal symptoms of insect stings even if there is no allergic reaction. Their recreational appeal exists mainly due to their  |anticholinergic|Anticholinergic|  properties, that induce  |anxiolysis|Anxiolysis|  and, in some cases such as  |diphenhydramine|Diphenhydramine| ,  |chlorpheniramine|Chlorpheniramine| , and  |orphenadrine|Orphenadrine| , a characteristic euphoria at moderate doses. High dosages taken to induce recreational drug effects may lead to overdoses. Antihistamines are also consumed in combination with alcohol, particularly by youth who find it hard to obtain alcohol. The combination of the two drugs can cause intoxication with lower alcohol doses.     Hallucinations and possibly delirium resembling the effects of  |Datura_stramonium|Datura_Stramonium|  can result if the drug is taken in much higher than therapeutical dosages. Antihistamines are widely available over the counter at drug stores , in the form of allergy medication and some  |cough_medicines|Cough_Medicine| . They are sometimes used in combination with other substances such as alcohol.   The most common unsupervised use of antihistamines in terms of volume and percentage of the total is perhaps in parallel to the medicinal use of some antihistamines to stretch out and intensify the effects of opioids and depressants. The most commonly used are  |hydroxyzine|Hydroxyzine| , mainly to stretch out a supply of other drugs, as in medical use, and the above-mentioned ethanolamine and alkylamine-class first-generation antihistamines, which are – once again as in the 1950s – the subject of medical research into their anti-depressant properties.     For all of the above reasons, the use of medicinal scopolamine for recreational uses is also seen.        |Analgesics|Analgesic|  are used to relieve  |pain|Pain|  . The word analgesic derives from Greek αν-  and άλγος . Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the  |peripheral|Peripheral_Nervous_System|  and  |central|Central_Nervous_System|  nervous systems; they include  |paracetamol|Paracetamol|  , the  |nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs|Nonsteroidal_Anti-Inflammatory_Drug|  such as the  |salicylates|Salicylate| , and  |opioid|Opioid|  drugs such as  |hydrocodone|Hydrocodone| ,  |codeine|Codeine| ,  |heroin|Heroin|  and  |oxycodone|Oxycodone| . Some further examples of the  |brand_name|Brand| |prescription|Prescription_Medication| |opiates|Opiate|  and  |opioid|Opioid|  analgesics that may be used recreationally include Vicodin, Lortab, Norco , Avinza, Kapanol , Opana, Paramorphan , Dilaudid, Palladone , and OxyContin .        |Tranquilizers|Tranquilizer| |Barbiturates|Barbiturate| |Benzodiazepines|Benzodiazepine| |Ethanol|Ethanol| |Nonbenzodiazepines|Nonbenzodiazepine|    Others    |carisoprodol|Carisoprodol| |chloral_hydrate|Chloral_Hydrate| |diethyl_ether|Diethyl_Ether| |ethchlorvynol|Ethchlorvynol| |gamma-butyrolactone|Gamma-Butyrolactone| |gamma-hydroxybutyrate|Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate| |glutethimide|Glutethimide| |kava|Kava| |ketamine|Ketamine| |meprobamate|Meprobamate| |methaqualone|Methaqualone| |phenibut|Phenibut| |propofol|Propofol| |theanine|Theanine| |valerian|Valerian| |Stimulants|Stimulant| , also known as psychostimulants ,  induce  |euphoria|Euphoria|  with improvements in mental and physical function, such as enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion. Due to their effects typically having an up quality to them, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as uppers .  |Depressants|Depressant|  or downers , which decrease mental or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be their functional opposites.     Stimulants enhance the activity of the  |central|Central_Nervous_System|  and  |peripheral_nervous_systems|Peripheral_Nervous_System| . Common effects may include increased  |alertness|Alertness| ,  |awareness|Awareness| ,  |wakefulness|Wakefulness| ,  |endurance|Endurance| ,  |productivity|Productivity| , and  |motivation|Motivation| ,  |arousal|Arousal| ,  |locomotion|Animal_Locomotion| ,  |heart_rate|Heart_Rate| , and  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure| , and a diminished desire for  |food|Food|  and  |sleep|Sleep| .     Use of stimulants may cause the body to significantly reduce its production of natural body chemicals that fulfill similar functions. Once the effect of the ingested stimulant has worn off the user may feel depressed, lethargic, confused, and miserable. This is referred to as a crash , and may provoke reuse of the stimulant.     Examples include:    |Sympathomimetics|Sympathomimetic|  —e.g. amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine,  |methylphenidate|Methylphenidate| ,  |ephedrine|Ephedrine| ,  |pseudoephedrine|Pseudoephedrine| |Entactogens|Entactogen|  —e.g.  |MDMA|Mdma| |Eugeroics|Eugeroics| , e.g.  |modafinil|Modafinil| |arecoline|Arecoline| |caffeine|Caffeine| |nicotine|Nicotine| |rauwolscine|Rauwolscine| |yohimbine|Yohimbine|             Catnip: Catnip contains a sedative known as  |nepetalactone|Nepetalactone|  that activates opioid receptors. In cats it elicits sniffing, licking, chewing, head shaking, rolling, and rubbing which are indicators of pleasure. In humans, however, catnip does not act as a euphoriant.    Cannabis:  |Tetrahydrocannabinol|Tetrahydrocannabinol| , the main psychoactive ingredient in this plant, can have sedative and euphoric properties.   Stimulants: Psychomotor stimulants produce locomotor activity , euphoria, , and anorexia. The amphetamines are the best known drugs in this category... Alan W.

They can cause subjective changes in  |perception|Perception| ,  |thought|Thought| ,  |emotion|Emotion|  and  |consciousness|Consciousness| . Unlike other psychoactive drugs such as  |stimulants|Stimulants|  and  |opioids|Opioids| , hallucinogens do not merely amplify familiar states of mind but also induce experiences that differ from those of ordinary consciousness, often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as  |trance|Trance| ,  |meditation|Meditation| , conversion experiences, and  |dreams|Dream| .     Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants have a long worldwide history of use within medicinal and religious traditions. They are used in  |shamanic|Shamanic|  forms of ritual  |healing|Healing|  and  |divination|Divination| , in  |initiation_rites|Initiation_Rites| , and in the religious rituals of  |syncretistic|Syncretistic|  movements such as  |União_do_Vegetal|União_Do_Vegetal| ,  |Santo_Daime|Santo_Daime| ,  |Temple_of_the_True_Inner_Light|Temple_Of_The_True_Inner_Light| , and the  |Native_American_Church|Native_American_Church| .
