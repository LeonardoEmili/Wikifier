   In  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| , Ask and Embla —male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the  Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the  Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by  |Snorri_Sturluson|Snorri_Sturluson| . In both sources,  |three|Numbers_In_Germanic_Paganism|  gods, one of whom is  |Odin|Odin| , find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.           |Old_Norse|Old_Norse|   literally means  |ash_tree|Fraxinus_Excelsior|  but the  |etymology|Etymology|  of embla is uncertain, and two possibilities of the meaning of embla are generally proposed. The first meaning,  |elm_tree|Ulmus_Glabra|  , is problematic, and is reached by deriving Elm-la from Almilōn and subsequently to  . Simek . The second suggestion is  |vine|Vine|  , which is reached through Ambilō, which may be related to the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  term  , itself meaning vine,  |liana|Liana|  . Simek . The latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories.     According to  |Benjamin_Thorpe|Benjamin_Thorpe| |_Grimm|Jacob_Grimm|  says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assiduous labour; the same relation as  |Meshia_and_Meshiane|Mashya_And_Mashyana| , the  |ancient_Persian|Iranian_Religion|  names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees. Thorpe .       In stanza 17 of the Poetic Edda poem  Völuspá , the  |völva|Völva|  reciting the Poem states that  |Hœnir|Hœnir| ,  |Lóðurr|Lóðurr|  and  |Odin|Odin|  once found Ask and Embla on Land. The Völva says that the two were capable of very little, lacking in  ørlög  and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods:          The meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary. Schach .     According to chapter 9 of the Prose Edda book  Gylfaginning , the three brothers  |Vili_Vé|Vili_And_Vé| , and Odin, are the creators of the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of  |Midgard|Midgard| . Byock .              A  |Proto_Indo_European|Proto_Indo_Europeans|  basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of embla meaning vine. In Indo-European societies, an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and  |sexual_intercourse|Sexual_Intercourse| . Vines were used as a flammable wood, where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood, resulting in fire. Further evidence of ritual making of fire in  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia|  has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a  |Bronze_Age_grave_in_Kivik|The_Kings_Grave| ,  |Scania|Scania| ,  |Sweden|Sweden| .      |Jaan_Puhvel|Jaan_Puhvel|  comments that ancient myths teem with trite first couples of the type of  |Adam_and_his_by_product_Eve|Adam_And_Eve| . In Indo-European tradition, these range from the Vedic Yama and Yamī and the Iranian Mašya and Mašyānag to the Icelandic Askr and Embla, with trees or rocks as preferred raw material, and  |dragons|Dragon|  teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure . Puhvel .     In his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in Indo-European society, Anders Hultgård observes that myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient Europe and Indo-Europe and Indo-European-speaking peoples of Asia Minor and Iran. By contrast the cultures of the Near East show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive mans origin from clay, earth or blood by means of a divine creation act . Hultgård .       Two wooden figures—the  |Braak_Bog_Figures|Braak_Bog_Figures| —of more than human height were unearthed from a  |peat_bog|Peat_Bog|  at  |Braak|Braak|  in  |Schleswig|Duchy_Of_Schleswig| ,  |Germany|Germany| . The figures depict a nude male and a nude female.  |Hilda_Ellis_Davidson|Hilda_Ellis_Davidson|  comments that these figures may represent a Lord and Lady of the  |Vanir|Vanir| , a group of Norse gods, and that another memory of may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore . Davidson .     A figure named  |Æsc|Oisc_Of_Kent|   appears as the son of  |Hengest|Hengist_And_Horsa|  in the  |Anglo_Saxon|Anglo_Saxons|  genealogy for the kings of  |Kent|Kent| . This has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre-Norse  |Germanic_mythology|Germanic_Mythology| . Orchard .     Connections have been proposed between Ask and Embla and the  |Vandal|Vandals|  kings Assi and Ambri, attested in  |Paul_the_Deacons|Paul_The_Deacon|  7th century AD work  Origo Gentis Langobardorum . There, the two ask the god  |Godan|Wōdanaz|  for victory. The name Ambri, like Embla, likely derives from Ambilō.       A stanza preceding the account of the creation of Ask and Embla in Völuspá provides a catalog of  |dwarfs|Dwarf| , and stanza 10 has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth. This may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans, and that the three gods gave them life. Lindow . Carolyne Larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in Old Norse works due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees; Ask and Embla. Larrington .       Ask and Embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions. A sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern Swedish city of  |Sölvesborg|Sölvesborg| , created in 1948 by Stig Blomberg. Ask and Embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the  |Oslo_City_Hall|Oslo_City_Hall|  in  |Oslo|Oslo| ,  |Norway|Norway| , by  |Dagfin_Werenskiold|Dagfin_Werenskiold| .
