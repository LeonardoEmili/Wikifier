         Osmium  is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Os and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal|  in the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group|  that is found as a  |trace_element|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  in alloys, mostly in  |platinum|Platinum|  ores. Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with an experimentally measured  |density|Density|  of . Manufacturers use its  |alloys|Alloy|  with platinum,  |iridium|Iridium| , and other platinum-group metals to make  |fountain_pen|Fountain_Pen| |nib_tipping|Nib_Nib_Tipping| ,  |electrical_contacts|Electrical_Contacts| , and in other applications that require extreme durability and  |hardness|Hardness| . The  |elements_abundance|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  in the Earths crust is among the rarest.                Osmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest  |stable_element|Stable_Element| ; it is approximately twice as dense as  |lead|Lead|  and slightly denser than  |iridium|Iridium| .  Calculations of density from the  |X-ray_diffraction|X-Ray_Diffraction|  data may produce the most reliable data for these elements, giving a value of  for osmium, slightly denser than the  of iridium; both metals are nearly 23 times as dense as water.       Osmium is a hard but brittle  |metal|Metal|  that remains  |lustrous|Lustrous|  even at high temperatures. It has a very low  |compressibility|Compressibility| . Correspondingly, its  |bulk_modulus|Bulk_Modulus|  is extremely high, reported between  and , which rivals that of  |diamond|Diamond|  . The hardness of osmium is moderately high at .    Because of its  |hardness|Hardness| , brittleness, low  |vapor_pressure|Vapor_Pressure|  , and very high  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  , solid osmium is difficult to machine, form, or work.                    Osmium forms compounds with  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  ranging from −2 to +8. The most common oxidation states are +2, +3, +4, and +8. The +8 oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridiums +9  and is encountered only in  |xenon|Xenon| ,    |ruthenium|Ruthenium| ,   |hassium|Hassium| ,  and  |iridium|Iridium| .  The oxidation states −1 and −2 represented by the two reactive compounds  and  are used in the synthesis of osmium  |cluster_compounds|Cluster_Chemistrytransition_Metal_Carbonyl_Clusters| .       The most common compound exhibiting the +8 oxidation state is  |osmium_tetroxide|Osmium_Tetroxide| . This toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air. It is a very volatile, water-soluble, pale yellow, crystalline solid with a strong smell. Osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide forms red osmates  upon reaction with a base. With  |ammonia|Ammonia| , it forms the nitrido-osmates .    Osmium tetroxide boils at 130  ° |C|Celsius|  and is a powerful  |oxidizing|Oxidizer|  agent. By contrast,  |osmium_dioxide|Osmium_Dioxide|  is black, non-volatile, and much less reactive and toxic.     Only two osmium compounds have major applications: osmium tetroxide for  |staining|Staining|  tissue in  |electron_microscopy|Electron_Microscopy|  and for the oxidation of  |alkenes|Alkenes|  in  |organic_synthesis|Organic_Synthesis| , and the non-volatile osmates for  |organic_oxidation_reactions|Sharpless_Asymmetric_Dihydroxylation| .     Osmium pentafluoride is known, but osmium trifluoride has not yet been synthesized. The lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens, so that the trichloride, tribromide, triiodide, and even diiodide are known. The oxidation state +1 is known only for osmium iodide , whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium, such as  |triosmium_dodecacarbonyl|Triosmium_Dodecacarbonyl|  , represent oxidation state 0.       In general, the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by  |ligands|Ligand|  that are good σ-donors  and π-acceptors . The higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ- and π-donors, such as  and .      Despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states, osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids, including  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| , but is attacked by fused alkalis.           Osmium has seven naturally occurring  |isotopes|Isotope| , six of which are stable: , , , , , and .  undergoes  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay|  with such a long  |half-life|Half-Life|   years, approximately  times the  |age_of_the_universe|Age_Of_The_Universe| , that for practical purposes it can be considered stable. Alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes, but it has been observed only for , presumably due to very long half-lives. It is predicted that  and  can undergo  |double_beta_decay|Double_Beta_Decay|  but this radioactivity has not been observed yet.       is the descendant of   and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as  |meteoric|Meteorite| |rocks|Rock|  . It has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the  |mantle|Earths_Mantle|  roots of continental  |cratons|Craton| . This decay is a reason why rhenium-rich minerals are abnormally rich in .  However, the most notable application of osmium isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium, to characterise the layer of  |shocked_quartz|Shocked_Quartz|  along the  |Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Boundary|  that marks the extinction of the non-avian  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|  65 million years ago.        Osmium was discovered in 1803 by  |Smithson_Tennant|Smithson_Tennant|  and  |William_Hyde_Wollaston|William_Hyde_Wollaston|  in  |London|London| ,  |England|England| .  The discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group| . Platinum reached Europe as platina , first encountered in the late 17th century in silver mines around the  |Chocó_Department|Chocó_Department| , in  |Colombia|Colombia| .  The discovery that this metal was not an alloy, but a distinct new element, was published in 1748.    Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia|   to create soluble salts. They always observed a small amount of a dark, insoluble residue.  |Joseph_Louis_Proust|Joseph_Louis_Proust|  thought that the residue was  |graphite|Graphite| .   |Victor_Collet-Descotils|Victor_Collet-Descotils| ,  |Antoine_François,_comte_de_Fourcroy|Antoine_François,_Comte_De_Fourcroy| , and  |Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin|Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin|  also observed iridium in the black platinum residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough material for further experiments. Later the two French chemists Antoine-François Fourcroy and Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’.      In 1803,  |Smithson_Tennant|Smithson_Tennant|  analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed was of this new metal—which he named ptene, from the Greek word  for winged.   However, Tennant, who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue, continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained a yellow solution  by reactions with  |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  at red heat. After acidification he was able to distill the formed OsO 4 . He named it osmium after  |Greek|Greek_Language|  osme meaning a smell , because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile  |osmium_tetroxide|Osmium_Tetroxide| .  Discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  on June 21, 1804.       |Uranium|Uranium|  and osmium were early successful  |catalysts|Catalyst|  in the  |Haber_process|Haber_Process| , the  |nitrogen_fixation|Nitrogen_Fixation|  reaction of  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  and  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  to produce  |ammonia|Ammonia| , giving enough yield to make the process economically successful. At the time, a group at  |BASF|Basf|  led by  |Carl_Bosch|Carl_Bosch|  bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants, removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium.      Nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of  |platinum|Platinum|  and  |nickel|Nickel|  ores.             Osmium is one of the even-numbered elements, which puts it in the upper half of  |elements_commonly_found_in_space|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements| . It is, however, the  |least_abundant|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  stable element in Earths  |crust|Crust| , with an average mass fraction of 50   |parts_per_trillion|Parts-Per_Notation|  in the  |continental_crust|Continental_Crust| .      Osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural  |alloys|Alloy| ; especially the iridium–osmium alloys,  |osmiridium|Osmiridium|  , and  |iridosmium|Osmiridium|  .  In  |nickel|Nickel|  and  |copper|Copper|  deposits, the platinum group metals occur as  |sulfides|Sulfide| |emiste|Emist| .g., PtBiTee.g., PdSbe.g., PtAs 2 crustal intrusions from belowNH 4 62  kg |s|S| TEMsee imageOsFeCN |emist|Emist| founded in 1906, when three German companies, Auer-Gesellschaft, AEG and Siemens & Halske, combined their lamp production facilitiesthe latter is German for tungstenOsO 4 VIIIleft imagessuch as  |corn_oil|Corn_Oil| .
