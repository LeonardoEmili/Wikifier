      A borough is an  |administrative_division|Administrative_Division|  in various  |English-speaking|English_Language|  countries. In principle, the term borough designates a self-governing walled town, although in practice, official use of the term varies widely.               The word borough derives from common  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic_Language|  , meaning fort : compare with bury, burgh and brough ,  ,  ,  , , burg ,  , and the Germanic borrowing present in neighbouring  |Indo-European_languages|Indo-European_Languages|  such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . The incidence of these words as suffixes to place names  usually indicates that they were once fortified settlements.     In the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , boroughs were settlements in England that were granted some  |self-government|Self-Government| ; burghs were the Scottish equivalent. In  |medieval_England|Medieval_England| , boroughs were also entitled to elect members of  |parliament|Parliament_Of_England| . The use of the word borough probably derives from the burghal system of  |Alfred_the_Great|Alfred_The_Great| . Alfred set up a system of defensive strong points ; in order to maintain these particular settlements, he granted them a degree of autonomy. After the  |Norman_Conquest|Norman_Conquest| , when certain towns were granted self-governance, the concept of the burh/borough seems to have been reused to mean a self-governing settlement.     The concept of the borough has been used repeatedly throughout the world. Often, a borough is a single town with its own local government. However, in some cities it is a subdivision of the city . In such cases, the borough will normally have either limited powers delegated to it by the citys local government, or no powers at all. In other places, such as the  |U.S._state|U.S._State|  of  |Alaska|Alaska| , borough designates a whole  |region|Region| ; Alaskas largest borough, the  |North_Slope_Borough|North_Slope_Borough,_Alaska| , is comparable in area to the entire  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , although its population is less than that of  |Swanage|Swanage|  on Englands south coast with around 9,600 inhabitants. In  |Australia|Australia| , a borough was once a self-governing small town, but this designation has all but vanished, except for the only remaining borough in the country, which is the  |Borough_of_Queenscliffe|Borough_Of_Queenscliffe| .     Boroughs as administrative units are to be found in  |Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland|  and the United Kingdom, more specifically in England and  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland| . Boroughs also exist in the  |Canadian_province|Provinces_And_Territories_Of_Canada|  of  |Quebec|Quebec|  and formerly in  |Ontario|Ontario| , in some states of the United States, in  |Israel|Israel| , formerly in  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  and only one left in Australia.       The word borough derives from the  |Old_English|Old_English|  word burh, meaning a  |fortified|Fortress|  settlement. Other English derivatives of burh include bury, brough and burgh. There are obvious  |cognates|Cognates|  in other  |Indo-European_languages|Indo-European_Languages| . For example; burgh in  |Scots|Scots_Language|  and  |Middle_English|Middle_English| ; burg in  |German|German_Language|  and  |Old_English|Old_English| , The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition borg in Scandinavian languages; parcus in  |Latin|Latin|  and pyrgos in  |Greek|Greek_Language| , برج in  |Persian|Persian_Language| .     A number of other European languages have cognate words that were borrowed from the Germanic languages during the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , including brog in  |Irish|Irish_Language| , bwr or bwrc, meaning wall, rampart in  |Welsh|Welsh_Language| , bourg in  |French|French_Language| , burg in  |Catalan|Catalan_Language|  ,  borgo  in  |Italian|Italian_Language| , burgo in Portuguese and Castilian , the -bork of  |Lębork|Lębork|  and  |Malbork|Malbork|  in Polish and the -bor of  |Maribor|Maribor|  in Slovenian.     The burg element, which means castle or fortress , is often confused with berg meaning hill or mountain . Hence the berg element in  |Bergen|Bergen|  or  |Heidelberg|Heidelberg|  relates to a hill, rather than a fort. In some cases, the berg element in place names has converged towards burg/borough; for instance Farnborough, from fernaberga .       In many parts of England, borough is pronounced  as an independent word, and as  when a suffix of a place-name. As a suffix, it is sometimes spelled -brough .     In the United States, borough is pronounced . When appearing as the suffix -burg in place-names, it is pronounced .           In  |Australia|Australia| , the term borough is an occasionally used term for a local government area. Currently there is only one borough in Australia, the  |Borough_of_Queenscliffe|Borough_Of_Queenscliffe|  in  |Victoria|Victoria| , although there have been more in the past. However, in some cases it can be integrated into the councils name instead of used as an official title, such as the  |Municipality_of_Kingborough|Municipality_Of_Kingborough|  in  |Tasmania|Tasmania| .          In  |Quebec|Quebec| , the term borough is generally used as the English translation of  |arrondissement|Arrondissement| , referring to an administrative division of a municipality, or a district. Only eight municipalities in Quebec are divided into boroughs. See  |List_of_boroughs_in_Quebec|List_Of_Boroughs_In_Quebec| .     It was previously used in  |Metropolitan_Toronto|Metropolitan_Toronto| ,  |Ontario|Ontario| , to denote suburban municipalities including Scarborough, York, North York, Etobicoke prior to their conversion into cities. The Borough of  |East_York|East_York|  was the last Toronto municipality to hold this status, relinquishing it upon becoming part of the  |City_of_Toronto_government|City_Of_Toronto_Government|  on January 1, 1998.       The  |Colombian_Municipalities|Municipalities_Of_Colombia|  are subdivided into boroughs with a local executive and an administrative board for local government.   These Boroughs are divided in neighborhoods.     Also, the principal cities had boroughs with the same features as the European or American cities, including  |Soacha|Soacha|  in  |Bogotá|Bogotá| ,  |Bello|Bello,_Antioquia| ,  |La_Estrella|La_Estrella,_Colombia| ,  |Sabaneta|Sabaneta,_Antioquia| ,  |Envigado|Envigado|  and  |Itagüí|Itagüí|  on  |Medellín|Medellín| .          There are four borough districts designated by the  |Local_Government_Reform_Act_2014|Local_Government_Reform_Act_2014| |Clonmel|Clonmel| ,  |Drogheda|Drogheda| ,  |Sligo|Sligo| , and  |Wexford|Wexford| . A  |local_boundary_review|Local_Electoral_Area_Boundary_Committee|  reporting in 2018 proposed granting borough status to any district containing a  |census_town|List_Of_Census_Towns_In_The_Republic_Of_Ireland|  with a population over 30,000; this would have included the towns of  |Dundalk|Dundalk| ,  |Bray|Bray,_County_Wicklow| , and  |Navan|Navan| .  This requires an amendment to the 2014 act, promised for 2019 by minister  |John_Paul_Phelan|John_Paul_Phelan| .      Historically, there were 117 parliamentary boroughs in the  |Irish_House_of_Commons|Irish_House_Of_Commons| , of which 80 were disfranchised by the  |Acts_of_Union_1800|Acts_Of_Union_1800|  and all but 11 abolished under the  |Municipal_Corporations_Act_1840|Municipal_Corporations_Act_1840| . Under the  |Local_Government_Act_1898|Local_Government_Act_1898| , six of these became  |county_boroughs|County_Borough| :  |Dublin|Dublin| ,  |Belfast|Belfast| ,  |Cork|Cork| ,  |Derry|Derry| ,  |Limerick|Limerick|  and  |Waterford|Waterford| . From 1921, Belfast and Derry were part of  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland|  and stayed within the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  on the establishment of the  |Irish_Free_State|Irish_Free_State|  in 1922.  |Galway|Galway|  was a borough from 1937 until upgraded to a county borough in 1985.   The county boroughs in the Republic of Ireland were redesignated as cities under the  |Local_Government_Act_2001|Local_Government_Act_2001| .      |Dún_Laoghaire|Corporation_Of_Dún_Laoghaire|  was a borough from 1930 until merged into  |Dún_Laoghaire–Rathdown|Dún_Laoghaire–Rathdown|  county in 1994.       There were five borough councils in place at the time of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 which abolished all second-tier local government units of borough and town councils. Each local government authority outside of Dublin, Cork City and Galway City was divided into areas termed  |municipal_districts|Municipal_District| . In four of the areas which had previously been contained borough councils, as listed above, these were instead termed Borough Districts. Kilkenny had previously had a borough council, but its district was to be called the Municipal District of Kilkenny City, in recognition of its historic  |city_status|City_Status_In_Ireland| .        Under Israeli law, inherited from  |British_Mandate|Mandatory_Palestine|  municipal law, the possibility of creating a municipal borough exists. However, no borough was actually created under law until 2005–2006, when  |Neve_Monosson|Neve_Monosson|  and  |Maccabim-Reut|Maccabim-Reut| , both communal settlements  founded in 1953 and 1984, respectively, were declared to be autonomous municipal boroughs , within their mergers with the towns of  |Yehud|Yehud|  and  |Modiin|Modiin| . Similar structures have been created under different types of legal status over the years in Israel, notably  |Kiryat_Haim|Qiryat_Chaim|  in  |Haifa|Haifa| ,  |Jaffa|Jaffa|  in  |Tel_Aviv-Yafo|Tel_Aviv-Yafo|  and  |Ramot|Ramot|  and  |Gilo|Gilo|  in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| . However, Neve Monosson is the first example of a full municipal borough actually declared under law by the Minister of the Interior, under a model subsequently adopted in  |Maccabim-Reut|Maccabim-Reut|  as well.     It is the declared intention of the Interior Ministry to use the borough mechanism in order to facilitate municipal mergers in Israel, after a 2003 wide-reaching merger plan, which, in general, ignored the sensitivities of the communal settlements, and largely failed.       In  |Mexico|Mexico|  as translations from  |English|English_Language|  to Spanish applied to  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City| , the word borough has resulted in a delegación , referring to the 16 administrative areas within the Mexico City, now call Alcaldías.        In the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , the municipalities of  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam|  and  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  were divided into administrative boroughs, or  |deelgemeente|Deelgemeente| n, which had their own borough council and a borough mayor. Other large cities are usually divided into districts, or  |stadsdelen|Stadsdeel| , for census purposes. The deelgemeenten were abolished in 2014.        |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  formerly used the term borough to designate self-governing towns of more than 1,000 people, although 19th century census records show many boroughs with populations as low as 200.   A borough of more than 20,000 people could become a city by proclamation. Boroughs and cities were collectively known as municipalities, and were  |enclaves|Enclave|  separate from their surrounding counties. Boroughs proliferated in the suburban areas of the larger cities: By the 1980s there were 19 boroughs and three cities in the area that is now the City of Auckland.     In the 1980s, some boroughs and cities began to be merged with their surrounding counties to form  |districts|District|  with a mixed urban and rural population. A  |nationwide_reform_of_local_government_in_1989|1989_Local_Government_Reforms|  completed the process. Counties and boroughs were abolished and all boundaries were redrawn. Under the new system, most territorial authorities cover both urban and rural land. The more populated councils are classified as cities, and the more rural councils are classified as districts. Only  |Kawerau|Kawerau|  District, an enclave within  |Whakatane_District|Whakatane| , continues to follow the tradition of a small town council that does not include surrounding rural area.       In  |Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad_And_Tobago| , a Borough is a unit of  |Local_Government|Local_Government| . There are 3 boroughs in The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago:    |Chaguanas|Chaguanas| |Arima|Arima| |Point_Fortin|Point_Fortin|                    During the medieval period many towns were granted self-governance by the Crown, at which point they became referred to as boroughs. The formal status of borough came to be conferred by  |Royal_Charter|Royal_Charter| . These boroughs were generally governed by a self-selecting corporation . Sometimes boroughs were governed by  |bailiffs|Bailiffs|  or headboroughs.     Debates on the Reform Bill  had highlighted the variations in systems of governance of towns, and a  |Royal_Commission|Royal_Commission|  was set up to investigate the issue. This resulted in a regularisation of municipal government . 178 of the ancient boroughs were reformed as municipal boroughs, with all municipal corporations to be elected according to a standard franchise based on property ownership. The unreformed boroughs either lapsed in borough status, or were reformed at a later time. Several new municipal boroughs were formed in the new industrial cities after the bill enacted, according to the provisions of the bill.     As part of a large-scale reform of local government in England and Wales  |in_1974|Local_Government_Act_1972| , municipal boroughs were finally abolished . However, the civic traditions of many boroughs were continued by the grant of a  |charter|Royal_Charter|  to their successor district councils. In smaller boroughs, a  |town_council|Parish_Councils_In_England|  was formed for the area of the abolished borough, while  |charter_trustees|Charter_Trustees|  were formed in other former boroughs. In each case, the new body was allowed to use the regalia of the old corporation, and appoint ceremonial office holders such as sword and mace bearers as provided in their original charters. The council or trustees may apply for an  |Order_in_Council|Order_In_Council|  or  |Royal_Licence|Royal_Licence|  to use the former borough  |coat_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms| .           |From_1265|Simon_De_Montforts_Parliament| , two burgesses from each borough were summoned to the  |Parliament_of_England|Parliament_Of_England| , alongside two  |knights|Knight|  from each  |county|County| . Thus parliamentary constituencies were derived from the ancient boroughs. Representation in the  |House_of_Commons|United_Kingdom_House_Of_Commons|  was decided by the House itself, which resulted in boroughs being established in some small settlements for the purposes of parliamentary representation, despite their possessing no actual corporation.     After the Reform Act, which disenfranchised many of the  |rotten_boroughs|Rotten_Borough|  , parliamentary constituencies began to diverge from the ancient boroughs. While many ancient boroughs remained as municipal boroughs, they were disenfranchised by the Reform Act.          The  |Local_Government_Act_1888|Local_Government_Act_1888|  established a new sort of borough – the county borough. These were designed to be counties-to-themselves; administrative divisions to sit alongside the new administrative counties. They allowed urban areas to be administered separately from the more rural areas. They, therefore, often contained pre-existing municipal boroughs, which thereafter became part of the second tier of local government, below the administrative counties and county boroughs.     The county boroughs were, like the municipal boroughs, abolished in 1974, being reabsorbed into their parent counties for administrative purposes.          In 1899, as part of a reform of local government in the  |County_of_London|County_Of_London| , the various parishes in London were reorganised as new entities, the metropolitan boroughs. These were reorganised further when  |Greater_London|Greater_London|  was formed out of Middlesex and the County of London in 1965. These council areas are now referred to as London boroughs rather than metropolitan boroughs .     When the new metropolitan counties  were created in 1974, their sub-divisions also became metropolitan boroughs in many, but not all, cases; in many cases these metropolitan boroughs recapitulated abolished county boroughs . The metropolitan boroughs possessed slightly more autonomy from the metropolitan county councils than the shire county districts did from their county councils.     With the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, these metropolitan boroughs became independent, and continue to be so at present.      |districts|Districts_Of_England|  and  |unitary_authority|Unitary_Authority|  areas are called borough . Until 1974, this was a status that denoted towns with a certain type of local government . Since 1974, it has been a purely ceremonial style granted by royal charter to districts which may consist of a single town or may include a number of towns or rural areas. Borough status entitles the council chairman to bear the title of  |mayor|Mayors_In_England| . Districts may apply to the  |British_Crown|Monarchy_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  for the grant of borough status upon advice of the  |Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom|Privy_Council_Of_The_United_Kingdom| .       In  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland| , local government was reorganised in 1973. Under the legislation that created the 26  |districts_of_Northern_Ireland|Districts_Of_Northern_Ireland| , a district council whose area included an existing  |municipal_borough|Municipal_Borough|  could resolve to adopt the charter of the old municipality and thus continue to enjoy borough status. Districts that do not contain a former borough can apply for a charter in a similar manner to English districts.                 In the United States, a borough is a unit of  |local_government|Local_Government|  below the level of the  |state|U.S._State| . The term is currently used in seven states.     The following states use, or have used, the word with the following meanings:    |Alaska|Alaska| , as a  |county-equivalent|County-Equivalent|  —  |List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska|List_Of_Boroughs_And_Census_Areas_In_Alaska| |Connecticut|Connecticut| , as an incorporated municipality within, or consolidated with, a  |town|New_England_Town|  — see  |Borough|Borough| |Michigan|Michigan| , formerly applied to a village in the midst of forming a city.  Also in Michigan is  |Mackinac_Island|Mackinac_Island,_Michigan| , which was a borough from 1817 to 1847, when it became a  |village|Administrative_Divisions_Of_Michiganvillages| ; it has been a  |city|Administrative_Divisions_Of_Michigancity|  since 1899.    |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| , as a type of independent incorporated municipality — see  |Borough|Borough| |New_York|New_York_State| , as one of the five divisions of New York City, each coextensive with a county — see  |Borough|Borough| |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania| , as a type of municipality comparable to a town — see  |Borough|Borough| |Virginia|Virginia| , as a division of a city under certain circumstances — see      Certain names of places, such as  |Hillsboro,_Oregon|Hillsboro,_Oregon| ;  |Greensboro,_North_Carolina|Greensboro,_North_Carolina| ;  |Tyngsborough,_Massachusetts|Tyngsborough,_Massachusetts| ; and  |Maynesborough,_New_Hampshire|Berlin,_New_Hampshire|  reflect the historical use of borough as a geographical unit in the United States.
