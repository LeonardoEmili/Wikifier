               In  |Newtonian_mechanics|Newtonian_Mechanics| , linear momentum, translational momentum, or simply momentum  is the product of the  |mass|Mass|  and  |velocity|Velocity|  of an object. It is a  |vector|Euclidean_Vector|  quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If  is an objects mass and  is its velocity , then the object’s momentum is:     m     In  |SI_units|International_System_Of_Units| , momentum is measured in  |kilogram_meters_per_second|Kilogram_Metre_Per_Second|  .      |Newtons_second_law|Newtons_Second_Law|  of motion states that a bodys rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. Momentum depends on the  |frame_of_reference|Frame_Of_Reference| , but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity, meaning that if a  |closed_system|Closed_System|  is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in  |special_relativity|Special_Relativity|  and, in a modified form, in  |electrodynamics|Electrodynamics| ,  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| ,  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory| , and  |general_relativity|General_Relativity| . It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time:  |translational_symmetry|Translational_Symmetry| .     Advanced formulations of classical mechanics,  |Lagrangian|Lagrangian_Mechanics|  and  |Hamiltonian_mechanics|Hamiltonian_Mechanics| , allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is generalized momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a  |wave_function|Wave_Function| . The momentum and position operators are related by the  |Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle|Heisenberg_Uncertainty_Principle| .     In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluids and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the  |Navier–Stokes_equations|Navier–Stokes_Equations|  for fluids or the  |Cauchy_momentum_equation|Cauchy_Momentum_Equation|  for deformable solids or fluids.            Momentum is a  |vector_quantity|Vector_Quantity| .       The momentum of a particle is conventionally represented by the letter . It is the product of two quantities, the particles  |mass|Mass|   and its  |velocity|Velocity|     : p m v.     The unit of momentum is the product of the units of mass and velocity. In  |SI_units|Si_Units| , if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters per second . In  |cgs_units|Centimetre–Gram–Second_System_Of_Units| , if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters per second .     Being a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1  kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1  m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1  kg⋅m/s due north measured with reference to the ground.       The momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses  and , and velocities  and , the total momentum is   :   p & p1 + p2     & m1 v1 + m2 v2      The momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:   : p   mi vi .     A system of particles has a  |center_of_mass|Center_Of_Mass| , a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:   : r          If one or more of the particles is moving, the center of mass of the system will generally be moving as well . If the total mass of the particles is m , and the center of mass is moving at velocity , the momentum of the system is:   : p mv    This is known as  |Eulers_first_law|Eulers_Laws_Of_Motion| .           If the net force  applied to a particle is constant, and is applied for a time interval , the momentum of the particle changes by an amount   :   p F   t      In differential form, this is  |Newtons_second_law|Newtons_Second_Law| ; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to the instantaneous force  acting on it,   : F       If the net force experienced by a particle changes as a function of time, , the change in momentum  between times  and  is   :   p J   F  dt      Impulse is measured in the  |derived_units|Si_Derived_Unit|  of the  |newton_second|Newton_Second|  or  |dyne|Dyne|  second     Under the assumption of constant mass , it is equivalent to write   : F   m  m a,   hence the net force is equal to the mass of the particle times its  |acceleration|Acceleration| .     Example |newtons|Newton|  due north. The change in momentum is 6  kg⋅m/s due north. The rate of change of momentum is 3  /s due north which is numerically equivalent to 3  newtons.       In a  |closed_system|Closed_System|  the total momentum is constant. This fact, known as the law of conservation of momentum, is implied by  |Newtons_laws_of_motion|Newtons_Laws_Of_Motion| .   Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. Because of the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that  and . Therefore,   :   -     with the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,   :     0.     If the velocities of the particles are  and  before the interaction, and afterwards they are  and , then   : m1 u + m2 u m1 v + m2 v.     This law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including  |collisions|Collision|  and separations caused by explosive forces. It can also be generalized to situations where Newtons laws do not hold, for example in the  |theory_of_relativity|Theory_Of_Relativity|  and in  |electrodynamics|Classical_Electromagnetism| .          Momentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a  |frame_of_reference|Frame_Of_Reference| , in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.     Suppose a particle has position  in a stationary frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed , the position changes with time as   : x x - ut    This is called a  |Galilean_transformation|Galilean_Transformation| . If the particle is moving at speed  in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed   : v   v-u    Since  does not change, the accelerations are the same:   : a   a    Thus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newtons second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or  |Galilean_invariance|Galilean_Invariance| .      A change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen, where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is the  |center_of_mass_frame|Center_Of_Mass_Frame|  – one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame,   the total momentum is zero.       By itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion,  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy| , must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an  elastic collision ; if not, it is an  inelastic collision .                An elastic collision is one in which no  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  is absorbed in the collision. Perfectly elastic collisions can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A  |slingshot_maneuver|Gravity_Assist|  of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two  |pool|Pool_Billiards|  balls is a good example of an almost totally elastic collision, due to their high  |rigidity|Stiffness| , but when bodies come in contact there is always some  |dissipation|Dissipation| .      A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are  and  before the collision and  and  after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:   :   m1 u1 + m2 u2 & m1 v1 + m2 v2      m1 u12 +   m2 u22 &   m1 v12 +   m2 v22      A change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass , one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed  . The center of mass is moving at speed  and both bodies are moving towards it at speed . Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed . The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by   :   v1 & u2    v2 & u1        In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by    : v   u +   u    : v   u +   u    If one body has much greater mass than the other, its velocity will be little affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change.               In an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is converted into other forms of energy . Examples include  |traffic_collisions|Traffic_Collisions| ,  in which the effect of loss of kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms ;  and  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator|  in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.     In a perfectly inelastic collision , both bodies have the same motion afterwards. If one body is motionless to begin with, the equation for conservation of momentum is   : m1 u1   v    so   : v   u1    In a frame of reference moving at the speed R  |omet|Omet| vvx,vy,vz    pvalignalign |themati|Themati| as in the figure |trophysi|Trophysi| tdvdttdmdtincorrecttdvdtdmdtdmdmt+dt m - dm v + dv v - u talignalignalign t -     x - v t  1 pvFd   |ysi|Ysi| in this expression and in what follows the   |metric_signature|Metric_Signature|  has been used, different authors use different conventionsUV |contravariant|Covariance_And_Contravariance_Of_Vectors| Ud      PUin Minkowski spacePc,  c, P   PPPc2-v2m0cP Lknown as the Lagrange or  |Euler–Lagrange_equations|Euler–Lagrange_Equation|  dd t    qj       although its time derivative might appearconstanta function of generalized coordinates and their derivativesH alignq  pip  qi    td   talign |ysi|Ysi| shift  |symmetry|Symmetry| position in space is the  |canonical_conjugate|Canonical_Conjugate|  quantity to momentum Lorentz force F  +        |SI_units|International_System_Of_Units| P g1  c2EBg d   tQ  +  dd t      T nj i jEi Ej -     E2  Bj -     B2 or on a very small scale in mediag1c2EH B  +  p  ipppincluding  |visible_light|Light| ,  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  light, and  |radio_waves|Radio_Waves| the particle aspect of lightsee  |Abraham–Minkowski_controversy|Abraham–Minkowski_Controversy| gDDt  tv zx  vx  zD   t D   t  |chani|Chani| see  |Types_of_viscosity|Viscositytypes_Of_Viscosity|   p  t2 |P-waves|P-Wave| |S-waves|S-Waves| also known by his Latinized name  |Avicenna|Avicenna| 2004.
