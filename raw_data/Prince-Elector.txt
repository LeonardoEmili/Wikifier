            The Prince-electors  of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , or Electors for short, were the members of the  |electoral_college|Electoral_College|  that elected the  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| .     From the 13th century onwards, the Prince-Electors had the privilege of  |electing_the_monarch|Imperial_Election|  who would receive the  |coronation|Coronation_Of_The_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  at the hands of the  |Pope|Pope| . After 1508, the election was sufficient to acquire the Imperial title.  |Charles_V|Charles_V_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  was the last person to be a crowned Emperor ; his successors were only elected Emperors by the electoral college, each being titled Elected Emperor of the Romans . In practice, election by the princely electoral college was merely a  |de_jure|De_Jure|  requirement.  |De_facto|De_Facto|  the Imperial throne followed the  |order_of_succession|Order_Of_Succession|  of the Austrian  |House_of_Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg| |House_of_Austria|House_Of_Austria|  except for  |Charles_VII|Charles_Vii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and  |Francis_I|Francis_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  , both of whom were related to the Habsburgs by blood and/or marriage. The Electors merely ratified such inheritance.     The dignity of Elector carried great prestige and was considered to be second only to that of King or Emperor.  The Electors had exclusive privileges that were not shared with the other princes of the Empire, and they continued to hold their original titles alongside that of Elector. The  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent|  to a secular prince-elector was known as an electoral prince .     Kurfürst Kur- is based on the  |Middle_High_German|Middle_High_German|  irregular verb kiesen  |Deutsches_Wörterbuch|Deutsches_Wörterbuch| ,  and  and is related etymologically to the English word choose . In English, the s / r mix in the Germanic verb conjugation has been regularized to s throughout, while German retains the r in Kur-. There is also a modern German verb küren which means to choose in a ceremonial sense.  Fürst  is German for prince, but while the German language distinguishes between the head of a principality  and the son of a monarch , English uses prince for both concepts. Fürst itself is related to English first and is thus the foremost person in his realm. Note that prince derives from Latin princeps, which carried the same meaning.       Electors were reichsstände , enjoying precedence over the other princes. They were, until the 18th century, exclusively entitled to be addressed with the title Durchlaucht . In 1742, the electors became entitled to the superlative Durchläuchtigste , while other princes were promoted to Durchlaucht.     As Imperial Estates, the electors enjoyed all the privileges of the other princes enjoying that status, including the right to enter into alliances, autonomy in relation to dynastic affairs and precedence over other subjects. The Golden Bull had granted them the  |Privilegium_de_non_appellando|Privilegium_De_Non_Appellando| , which prevented their subjects from lodging an appeal to a higher Imperial court. However, while this privilege, and some others, were automatically granted to Electors, they were not exclusive to them and many of the larger Imperial Estates were also to be individually granted some or all those rights and privileges. Even a small  |Free_Imperial_City|Free_Imperial_City|  such as  |Schwäbisch_Gmünd|Schwäbisch_Gmünd|  had been granted the Privilegium de non appellando in 1475. Cf.  |Kaiser_Friedrich_III_Privilegium_de_non_appellando_für_Schwäbisch_Gmünd_1475|_S_De_Kaiser_Friedrich_Iii_Privilegium_De_Non_Appellando_Für_Schwäbisch_Gmünd_1475|        The electors, like the other princes ruling States of the Empire, were members of the  |Imperial_Diet|Imperial_Diet| , which was divided into three collegia |Council_of_Princes_in_1792|List_Of_Imperial_Diet_Participants| , twenty-three belonged to electors. The lay electors therefore exercised considerable influence, being members of the small Council of Electors and holding a significant number of votes in the Council of Princes. The assent of both bodies was required for important decisions affecting the structure of the Empire, such as the creation of new electorates or States of the Empire.     In addition to voting by colleges or councils, the Imperial Diet also voted on religious lines, as provided for by the  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia| . The Archbishop of Mainz presided over the  |Catholic|Roman_Catholicism|  body, or corpus catholicorum, while the Elector of Saxony presided over the  |Protestant|Protestantism|  body, or  corpus evangelicorum . The division into religious bodies was on the basis of the official religion of the state, and not of its rulers. Thus, even when the Electors of Saxony were Catholics during the eighteenth century, they continued to preside over the corpus evangelicorum, since the state of Saxony was officially Protestant.             The electors were originally summoned by the Archbishop of Mainz within one month of an Emperors death, and met within three months of being summoned. During the interregnum, imperial power was exercised by two  |imperial_vicars|Imperial_Vicar| . Each vicar, in the words of the Golden Bull, was the administrator of the empire itself, with the power of passing judgments, of presenting to ecclesiastical benefices, of collecting returns and revenues and investing with fiefs, of receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the holy empire . The Elector of Saxony was vicar in areas operating under Saxon law , while the Elector Palatine was vicar in the remainder of the Empire . The Elector of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, but when the latter was granted a new electorate in 1648, there was a dispute between the two as to which was vicar. In 1659, both purported to act as vicar, but the other vicar recognised the Elector of Bavaria. Later, the two electors made a pact to act as joint vicars, but the Imperial Diet rejected the agreement. In 1711, while the Elector of Bavaria was under the  |ban_of_the_Empire|Ban_Of_The_Empire| , the Elector Palatine again acted as vicar, but his cousin was restored to his position upon his restoration three years later. Finally, in 1745, the two agreed to alternate as vicars, with Bavaria starting first. This arrangement was upheld by the Imperial Diet in 1752. In 1777 the question was settled when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria. On many occasions, however, there was no interregnum, as a new king had been elected during the lifetime of the previous Emperor.      |Frankfurt|Frankfurt_Am_Main|  regularly served as the site of the election from the fifteenth century on, but elections were also held at  |Cologne|Cologne|  ,  |Regensburg|Regensburg|  , and  |Augsburg|Augsburg|  . An elector could appear in person or could appoint another elector as his proxy. More often, an electoral suite or embassy was sent to cast the vote; the credentials of such representatives were verified by the Archbishop of Mainz, who presided over the ceremony. The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or Wahlkapelle, was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased , but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice. Electors drafted a  Wahlkapitulation , or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.     In the 10th and 11th centuries, princes often acted merely to confirm hereditary succession in the Saxon  |Ottonian_dynasty|Ottonian_Dynasty|  and Franconian  |Salian_dynasty|Salian_Dynasty| . But with the actual formation of the prince-elector class, elections became more open, starting with the election of  |Lothair_II|Lothair_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 1125. The  |Staufen|Hohenstaufen|  dynasty managed to get its sons formally elected in their fathers lifetimes almost as a formality. After these lines ended in extinction, the electors began to elect kings from different families so that the throne would not once again settle within a single dynasty. For some two centuries, the monarchy was elective both in theory and in practice; the arrangement, however, did not last, since the powerful  |House_of_Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg|  managed to secure succession within their dynasty during the fifteenth century. All kings elected from 1438 onwards were from among the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria until 1740, when the archduchy was inherited by a woman,  |Maria_Theresa|Maria_Theresa_Of_Austria| , sparking the  |War_of_the_Austrian_Succession|War_Of_The_Austrian_Succession| . A representative of the House of Wittelsbach was elected for a short period of time, but in 1745, Maria Theresas husband,  |Francis_I|Francis_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, became King. All of his successors were also from the same family. Hence, for the greater part of the Empires history, the role of the electors was largely ceremonial.                  Each elector held a High Office of the Empire  and was a member of the  |Imperial_Household|Imperial_Household| . The three spiritual electors were all Arch-Chancellors  |Archbishop_of_Mainz|Archbishop_Of_Mainz|  was Arch-Chancellor of Germany, the  |Archbishop_of_Cologne|Archbishop_Of_Cologne|  was Arch-Chancellor of Italy, and the  |Archbishop_of_Trier|Archbishop_Of_Trier|  was Arch-Chancellor of Burgundy. The other offices were as follows:          When the  |Duke_of_Bavaria|Duke_Of_Bavaria|  replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, he assumed the latters office of Arch-Steward. When the Count Palatine was granted a new electorate, he assumed the position of Arch-Treasurer of the Empire. When the Duke of Bavaria was banned in 1706, the Elector Palatine returned to the office of Arch-Steward, and in 1710 the Elector of Hanover was promoted to the post of Arch-Treasurer. Matters were complicated by the Duke of Bavarias restoration in 1714; the Elector of Bavaria resumed the office of Arch-Steward, while the Elector Palatine returned to the post of Arch-Treasurer, and the Elector of Hanover was given the new office of Archbannerbearer. The Electors of Hanover, however, continued to be styled Arch-Treasurers, though the Elector Palatine was the one who actually exercised the office until 1777, when he inherited Bavaria and the Arch-Stewardship. After 1777, no further changes were made to the Imperial Household; new offices were planned for the Electors admitted in 1803, but the Empire was abolished before they could be created. The Duke of Württemberg, however, started to adopt the trappings of the Arch-Bannerbearer.     Many High Officers were entitled to use  |augmentations|Augmentation_Of_Honour|  on their  |coats_of_arms|Heraldry| ; these augmentations, which were special marks of honour, appeared in the centre of the electors shields atop the other charges . The Arch-Steward used  gules an orb Or  . The Arch-Marshal utilised the more complicated  per fess sable and argent , two swords in saltire gules . The Arch-Chamberlains augmentation was  azure a sceptre palewise Or , while the Arch-Treasurers was gules the crown of Charlemagne Or . As noted above, the Elector Palatine and the Elector of Hanover styled themselves Arch-Treasurer from 1714 until 1777; during this time, both electors used the corresponding augmentations. The three Arch-Chancellors and the Arch-Cupbearer did not use any augmentations.     The electors discharged the ceremonial duties associated with their offices only during coronations, where they bore the crown and regalia of the Empire. Otherwise, they were represented by holders of corresponding  |Hereditary_Offices_of_the_Household|Hereditary_Offices_Of_The_Household|  . The Arch-Butler was represented by the Butler  , the Arch-Seneschal by the  |Steward|Steward|  , the Arch-Chamberlain by the  |Chamberlain|Chamberlain|  , the Arch-Marshal by the  |Marshal|Marshal|  , and the Arch-Treasurer by the  |Treasurer|Treasurer|  . The Duke of Württemberg assigned the count of Zeppelin- |Aschhausen|Aschhausen|  as hereditary Bannerbearer.            The German practice of electing  |monarchs|Monarch|  began when ancient  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples|  formed ad hoc coalitions and elected the leaders thereof. Elections were irregularly held by the  |Franks|Franks| , whose  |successor_states|Successor_State|  include  |France|France|  and the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . The  |French_monarchy|List_Of_French_Monarchs|  eventually became  |hereditary|Heredity| , but the Holy Roman Emperors remained elective, at least in theory, although the Habsburgs provided most of the later monarchs. While all free men originally exercised the right to vote in such elections, suffrage eventually came to be limited to the leading men of the realm. In the election of  |Lothar_II|Lothar_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 1125, a small number of eminent  |nobles|Nobility|  chose the monarch and then submitted him to the remaining magnates for their approbation.     Soon, the right to choose the monarch was settled on an exclusive group of princes, and the procedure of seeking the approval of the remaining nobles was abandoned. The college of electors was mentioned in 1152 and again in 1198. The composition of electors at that time is unclear, but appears to have included representatives of the church and the  |dukes|Duke|  of the  |four_nations_of_Germany|Stem_Duchy| |Franks|Franks|  ,  |Swabians|Swabians|  ,  |Saxons|Saxons|   and  |Bavarians|Bavarians|  .         The electoral college is known to have existed by 1152, but its composition is unknown. A letter written by  |Pope_Urban_IV|Pope_Urban_Iv|  in 1265 suggests that by  |immemorial_custom|Time_Immemorial|  , seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor. The pope wrote that the seven electors were those who had just voted in the election of 1257, which resulted in the election of two kings.      Three ecclesiastical Electors:   The  |Archbishop_of_Mainz|Archbishopric_Of_Mainz| |_Archbishop_of_Trier|Electorate_Of_Trier| |_Archbishop_of_Cologne|Electorate_Of_Cologne| |_King_of_Bohemia|King_Of_Bohemia| |_Count_Palatine_of_the_Rhine|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate| |_Duke_of_Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony| |_Margrave_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg|      The three Archbishops oversaw the most venerable and powerful  |sees|Episcopal_See|  in Germany, while the other four were supposed to represent the dukes of the four nations. The Count Palatine of the Rhine held most of the former Duchy of Franconia after the last Duke died in 1039. The Margrave of Brandenburg became an Elector when the Duchy of Swabia was dissolved after the last Duke of Swabia was beheaded in 1268. Saxony, even with diminished territory, retained its eminent position.     The Palatinate and Bavaria were originally held by the same individual, but in 1253, they were divided between two members of the  |House_of_Wittelsbach|House_Of_Wittelsbach| . The other electors refused to allow two princes from the same dynasty to have electoral rights, so a heated rivalry arose between the Count Palatine and the Duke of Bavaria over who should hold the Wittelsbach seat.     Meanwhile, the King of Bohemia, who held the ancient imperial office of Arch-Cupbearer, asserted his right to participate in elections. Sometimes he was challenged on the grounds that his kingdom was not German, though usually he was recognized, instead of Bavaria which after all was just a younger line of Wittelsbachs.     The  |Declaration_of_Rhense|Declaration_Of_Rhense|  issued in 1338 had the effect that election by the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. The  |Golden_Bull_of_1356|Golden_Bull_Of_1356|  finally resolved the disputes among the electors. Under it, the Archbishops of  |Mainz|Archbishop_Of_Mainz| ,  |Trier|Archbishop_Of_Trier| , and  |Cologne|Electorate_Of_Cologne| , as well as the  |King_of_Bohemia|King_Of_Bohemia| , the  |Count_Palatine_of_the_Rhine|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate| , the  |Duke_of_Saxony|Duke_Of_Saxony| , and the  |Margrave_of_Brandenburg|Margrave_Of_Brandenburg|  held the right to elect the King.          The colleges composition remained unchanged until the 17th century, although the Electorate of Saxony was transferred from the senior to the junior branch of the Wettin family in 1547, in the aftermath of the  |Schmalkaldic_War|Schmalkaldic_War| .         In 1621, the Elector Palatine,  |Frederick_V|Frederick_V_Elector_Palatine| , came under the  |imperial_ban|Imperial_Ban|  after participating in the  |Bohemian_Revolt|Thirty_Years_Warthe_Bohemian_Revolt|  . The Elector Palatines seat was conferred on the Duke of Bavaria, the head of a junior branch of his family. Originally, the Duke held the electorate personally, but it was later made hereditary along with the duchy. When the Thirty Years War concluded with the  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia|  in 1648, a new electorate was created for the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Since the Elector of Bavaria retained his seat, the number of electors increased to eight; the two Wittelsbach lines now sufficiently estranged so as not to pose a combined potential threat.     In 1685, the religious composition of the College of Electors was disrupted when a Catholic branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the Palatinate. A new Protestant electorate was created in 1692 for the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who became known as the Elector of Hanover . The Elector of Saxony converted to Catholicism in 1697 so that he could become King of Poland, but no additional Protestant electors were created. Although the Elector of Saxony was personally Catholic, the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant, and the Elector even remained the leader of the  |Protestant_body_in_the_Reichstag|Imperial_Diet_Religious_Bodies| .     In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria and Archbishop of Cologne were  |banned|Imperial_Ban|  during the  |War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War_Of_The_Spanish_Succession| , but both were restored in 1714 after the  |Peace_of_Baden|Treaty_Of_Baden| . In 1777, the number of electors was reduced to eight when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.     Many changes to the composition of the college were necessitated by  |Napoleons|Napoleon_I_Of_France|  aggression during the early 19th century. The  |Treaty_of_Lunéville|Treaty_Of_Lunéville|  , which ceded territory on the  |Rhines|Rhine|  left bank to  |France|France| , led to the abolition of the archbishoprics of Trier and Cologne, and the transfer of the remaining spiritual Elector from Mainz to  |Regensburg|Regensburg| . In 1803, electorates were created for the  |Duke_of_Württemberg|Rulers_Of_Württemberg| , the  |Margrave_of_Baden|Margrave_Of_Baden| , the  |Landgrave_of_Hesse_Kassel|Landgrave_Of_Hesse_Kassel| , and the  |Duke_of_Salzburg|Duchy_Of_Salzburg| , bringing the total number of electors to ten. When  |Austria|Austria|  annexed Salzburg under the  |Treaty_of_Pressburg_|Treaty_Of_Pressburg| , the Duke of Salzburg moved to the  |Grand_Duchy_of_Würzburg|Grand_Duchy_Of_Würzburg|  and retained his electorate. None of the new electors, however, had an opportunity to cast votes, as the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806, and the new electorates were never confirmed by the Emperor.         After the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in August 1806, the Electors continued to reign over their territories, many of them taking higher titles. The Electors of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony styled themselves Kings, while the Electors of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt,  |Regensburg|Karl_Theodor_Anton_Maria_Von_Dalberg| , and  |Würzburg|Ferdinand_Iii_Grand_Duke_Of_Tuscany|  became Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hesse-Kassel, however, retained the meaningless title Elector of Hesse , thus distinguishing himself from other Hessian princes . Napoleon soon exiled him and Kassel was annexed to the  |Kingdom_of_Westphalia|Kingdom_Of_Westphalia| , a new creation. The King of Great Britain remained at war with Napoleon and continued to style himself Elector of Hanover, while the Hanoverian government continued to operate in London.     The  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  accepted the Electors of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony as Kings, along with the newly created Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hanover finally joined his fellow Electors by declaring himself the King of Hanover. The restored Elector of Hesse, a Napoleonic creation, tried to be recognized as the King of the  |Chatti|Chatti| . However, the European powers refused to acknowledge this title at the  |Congress_of_Aix_la_Chapelle_|Congress_Of_Aix_La_Chapelle|  and instead listed him with the  |grand_dukes|Grand_Duchy|  as a Royal Highness .  Believing the title of Prince-Elector to be superior in dignity to that of Grand Duke, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel chose to remain an Elector, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor to elect. Hesse-Kassel remained the only Electorate in Germany until 1866, when the country backed the losing side in the  |Austro_Prussian_War|Austro_Prussian_War|  and was absorbed into Prussia.         Religion was a factor in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor, as some  |Protestant|Protestant|  electors would refuse to vote for a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  and  |vice_versa|Vice_Versa| . Most of the time, religion played a minor role and was overshadowed by other factors, including dynastic, territorial and other political interests. For example, the Protestant  |Elector_of_Saxony|Elector_Of_Saxony|  voted for  |Ferdinand_II_Archduke_of_Austria|Ferdinand_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , putting his political interests first even though Ferdinand was a staunch  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  who would eventually lead the Empire into the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| .     At the height of the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , there were times when the electoral college had a Protestant majority. However, all of the Holy Roman Emperors were Catholic. Some historians maintain that  |Ferdinand_I|Ferdinand_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  had been touched by the reformed philosophies and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. See Parker, pp. 20–50. Other historians maintain he was as Catholic as his brother, but tended to see religion as outside the political sphere. Holborn, pp. 250–251.         The  |Elector_of_Mainz|Archbishopric_Of_Mainz|  was always a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| .   The  |Elector_of_Trier|Electorate_Of_Trier|  was always a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| .   The  |Elector_of_Cologne|Electorate_Of_Cologne|  was usually a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| , with the exception of  |Hermann_V_von_Wied|Hermann_V_Von_Wied|   and  |Gebhard_Truchsess_von_Waldburg|Gebhard_Truchsess_Von_Waldburg|  .       The  |Elector_of_Bohemia|Kingdom_Of_Bohemia|  was usually a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| , with the exception of  |George_of_Podebrady|George_Of_Podebrady|   and  |Frederick_I|Frederick_V_Of_The_Palatinate|  .   The  |Elector_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg| , who was also  |Duke_of_Prussia|List_Of_Monarchs_Of_Prussia|  from 1618 , was a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  until 1539, then a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  until 1613, then a  |Calvinist|Calvinist|  until the end of the Empire.   The  |Elector_Palatine|Electoral_Palatinate|  was a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  until the 1530s, then a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  until 1559, then a  |Calvinist|Calvinist|  until 1575, then again a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  until 1583, then again a  |Calvinist|Calvinist|  until 1623, when the electoral dignity was lost to  |Bavaria|Electoral_Bavaria| .   The  |Elector_of_Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony|  was a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  until 1525, then a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  until 1697, and then again a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| .       The  |Elector_of_Bavaria|Electorate_Of_Bavaria|  was always a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| .   The  |Elector_of_Hanover|Elector_Of_Hanover| , was a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  until 1714, when he became  |King_of_Great_Britain|List_Of_British_Monarchs|  and also the head of the  |Anglican|Anglican| |_Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| .
