             In  |theoretical_physics|Theoretical_Physics| , quantum chromodynamics  is the theory of the  |strong_interaction|Strong_Interaction|  between  |quarks|Quark|  and  |gluons|Gluon| , the fundamental particles that make up composite  |hadrons|Hadron|  such as the  |proton|Proton| ,  |neutron|Neutron|  and  |pion|Pion| . QCD is a type of  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory|  called a  |non_abelian_gauge_theory|Non_Abelian_Gauge_Theory| , with symmetry group  |SU|Special_Unitary_Group| . The QCD analog of electric charge is a property called color. Gluons are the  |force_carrier|Force_Carrier|  of the theory, like photons are for the electromagnetic force in  |quantum_electrodynamics|Quantum_Electrodynamics| . The theory is an important part of the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  of  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics| . A large body of  |experimental_evidence_for_QCD|Quantum_Chromodynamicsexperimental_Tests|  has been gathered over the years.     QCD exhibits two main properties:    |Color_confinement|Color_Confinement| . This is a consequence of the constant force between two color charges as they are separated: In order to increase the separation between two quarks within a hadron, ever-increasing amounts of energy are required. Eventually this energy becomes so great as to  |spontaneously_produce|Mass–Energy_Equivalence|  a quark–antiquark pair, turning the initial hadron into a pair of hadrons instead of producing an isolated color charge. Although analytically unproven, color confinement is well established from  |lattice_QCD|Lattice_Qcd|  calculations and decades of experiments.       |Asymptotic_freedom|Asymptotic_Freedom| , a steady reduction in the strength of interactions between quarks and gluons as the energy scale of those interactions increases . The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by  |David_Gross|David_Gross|  and  |Frank_Wilczek|Frank_Wilczek| ,    and independently by  |David_Politzer|David_Politzer|  in the same year.    For this work all three shared the 2004  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics| .        Physicist  |Murray_Gell_Mann|Murray_Gell_Mann|  coined the word quark in its present sense. It originally comes from the phrase Three quarks for Muster Mark in  Finnegans Wake  by  |James_Joyce|James_Joyce| . On June 27, 1978, Gell-Mann wrote a private letter to the editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, in which he related that he had been influenced by Joyces words: The allusion to three quarks seemed perfect.        The three kinds of  |charge|Charge|  in QCD  are usually referred to as  |color_charge|Color_Charge|  by loose analogy to the three kinds of  |color|Color| |_perceived_by_humans|Color_Vision| . Other than this nomenclature, the quantum parameter color is completely unrelated to the everyday, familiar phenomenon of color.     The force between quarks is known as the colour force  |wikt_colour_force|Wikt_Colour_Force|   or  |strong_interaction|Strong_Interaction| , and is responsible for the  |strong_nuclear_force|Strong_Nuclear_Force| .     Since the theory of electric charge is dubbed  |electrodynamics|Electrodynamics|  , the  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  word χρῶμα chroma color is applied to the theory of color charge, chromodynamics .          With the invention of  |bubble_chambers|Bubble_Chamber|  and  |spark_chambers|Spark_Chamber|  in the 1950s, experimental  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  discovered a large and ever-growing number of particles called  |hadrons|Hadron| . It seemed that such a large number of particles could not all be  |fundamental|Fundamental_Particles| . First, the particles were classified by  |charge|Charge|  and  |isospin|Isospin|  by  |Eugene_Wigner|Eugene_Wigner|  and  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg| ; then, in 1953–56,          according to  |strangeness|Strangeness|  by  |Murray_Gell_Mann|Murray_Gell_Mann|  and  |Kazuhiko_Nishijima|Kazuhiko_Nishijima|  . To gain greater insight, the hadrons were sorted into groups having similar properties and masses using the  eightfold way , invented in 1961 by Gell-Mann Gell-Mann, M. . The Eightfold Way: A Theory of strong interaction symmetry . California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena. Synchrotron Lab . and  |Yuval_Neeman|Yuval_Neeman| . Gell-Mann and  |George_Zweig|George_Zweig| , correcting an earlier approach of  |Shoichi_Sakata|Shoichi_Sakata| , went on to propose in 1963 that the structure of the groups could be explained by the existence of three  |flavors|Flavour|  of smaller particles inside the hadrons: the  |quarks|Quark| .     Perhaps the first remark that quarks should possess an additional quantum number was made    as a short footnote in the preprint of  |Boris_Struminsky|Boris_Struminsky|  B. V. Struminsky, Magnetic moments of baryons in the quark model.  |JINR|Jinr| -Preprint P-1939, Dubna, Russia.

The problem considered in this preprint was suggested by Nikolay Bogolyubov, who advised Boris Struminsky in this research. In the beginning of 1965,  |Nikolay_Bogolyubov|Nikolay_Bogolyubov| ,  |Boris_Struminsky|Boris_Struminsky|  and  |Albert_Tavkhelidze|Albert_Tavkhelidze|  wrote a preprint with a more detailed discussion of the additional quark quantum degree of freedom.  |N_Bogolubov|Nikolay_Bogolyubov| , B.

Report presented at the 99th Session of the JINR Scientific Council, Dubna, 19–20 January 2006.     A similar mysterious situation was with the  |Δ_baryon|Delta_Baryon| ; in the quark model, it is composed of three  |up_quarks|Up_Quark|  with parallel spins. In 1964–65,  |Greenberg|Oscar_W_Greenberg|  O. W. Greenberg, Spin and Unitary Spin Independence in a Paraquark Model of Baryons and Mesons. Phys. Rev. Lett. 13, 598–602 . and  |Han|Moo_Young_Han| – |Nambu|Yoichiro_Nambu|  M. Y. Han and Y. Nambu, Three-Triplet Model with Double SU Symmetry. Phys. Rev. 139, B1006–B1010 independently resolved the problem by proposing that quarks possess an additional  |SU|Special_Unitary_Group| |_gauge|Gauge_Theory| |_degree_of_freedom|Degrees_Of_Freedom| , later called color charge. Han and Nambu noted that quarks might interact via an octet of vector  |gauge_bosons|Gauge_Boson| : the  |gluons|Gluon| .     Since free quark searches consistently failed to turn up any evidence for the new particles, and because an elementary particle back then was defined as a particle which could be separated and isolated, Gell-Mann often said that quarks were merely convenient mathematical constructs, not real particles. The meaning of this statement was usually clear in context: He meant quarks are confined, but he also was implying that the strong interactions could probably not be fully described by quantum field theory.      |Richard_Feynman|Richard_Feynman|  argued that high energy experiments showed quarks are real particles: he called them  partons  . By particles, Feynman meant objects which travel along paths, elementary particles in a field theory.     The difference between Feynmans and Gell-Manns approaches reflected a deep split in the theoretical physics community. Feynman thought the quarks have a distribution of position or momentum, like any other particle, and he believed that the diffusion of parton momentum explained  |diffractive_scattering|Pomeron| . Although Gell-Mann believed that certain quark charges could be localized, he was open to the possibility that the quarks themselves could not be localized because space and time break down. This was the more radical approach of  |S_matrix_theory|S_Matrix_Theory| .      |James_Bjorken|James_Daniel_Bjorken|  proposed that pointlike partons would imply certain relations in  |deep_inelastic_scattering|Deep_Inelastic_Scattering|  of  |electrons|Electron|  and protons, which were verified in experiments at  |SLAC|Slac|  in 1969. This led physicists to abandon the S-matrix approach for the strong interactions.     In 1973 the concept of  |color|Color_Charge|  as the source of a strong field was developed into the theory of QCD by physicists  |Harald_Fritzsch|Harald_Fritzsch|  and  |Heinrich_Leutwyler|Heinrich_Leutwyler| , together with physicist Murray Gell-Mann.  In particular, they employed the general field theory developed in 1954 by  |Chen_Ning_Yang|Chen_Ning_Yang|  and  |Robert_Mills|Robert_Mills|   , in which the carrier particles of a force can themselves radiate further carrier particles.     The discovery of  |asymptotic_freedom|Asymptotic_Freedom|  in the strong interactions by  |David_Gross|David_Gross| ,  |David_Politzer|David_Politzer|  and  |Frank_Wilczek|Frank_Wilczek|  allowed physicists to make precise predictions of the results of many high energy experiments using the quantum field theory technique of  |perturbation_theory|Perturbation_Theory| . Evidence of gluons was discovered in  |three_jet_events|Three_Jet_Event|  at  |PETRA|Petra|  in 1979. These experiments became more and more precise, culminating in the verification of  |perturbative_QCD|Perturbative_Qcd|  at the level of a few percent at the  |LEP|Lep|  in  |CERN|Cern| .     The other side of asymptotic freedom is  |confinement|Color_Confinement| . Since the force between color charges does not decrease with distance, it is believed that quarks and gluons can never be liberated from hadrons. This aspect of the theory is verified within  |lattice_QCD|Lattice_Qcd|  computations, but is not mathematically proven. One of the  |Millennium_Prize_Problems|Millennium_Prize_Problems|  announced by the  |Clay_Mathematics_Institute|Clay_Mathematics_Institute|  requires a claimant to produce such a proof. Other aspects of  |non_perturbative|Non_Perturbative|  QCD are the exploration of phases of  |quark_matter|Qcd_Matter| , including the  |quark–gluon_plasma|Quark–Gluon_Plasma| .     The relation between the short-distance particle limit and the confining long-distance limit is one of the topics recently explored using  |string_theory|String_Theory| , the modern form of S-matrix theory.                    Every field theory of  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  is based on certain symmetries of nature whose existence is deduced from observations. These can be    |local_symmetries|Local_Symmetry| , that are the symmetries that act independently at each point in  |spacetime|Spacetime| . Each such symmetry is the basis of a  |gauge_theory|Gauge_Theory|  and requires the introduction of its own  |gauge_bosons|Gauge_Boson| .    |global_symmetries|Global_Symmetry| , which are symmetries whose operations must be simultaneously applied to all points of spacetime.     QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory  of the  |SU|Special_Unitary_Group|  gauge group obtained by taking the  |color_charge|Color_Charge|  to define a local symmetry.     Since the strong interaction does not discriminate between different flavors of quark, QCD has approximate flavor symmetry, which is broken by the differing masses of the quarks.     There are additional global symmetries whose definitions require the notion of  |chirality|Chirality| , discrimination between left and right-handed. If the  |spin|Spin|  of a particle has a positive  |projection|Projection|  on its direction of motion then it is called left-handed; otherwise, it is right-handed. Chirality and handedness are not the same, but become approximately equivalent at high energies.   Chiral symmetries involve independent transformations of these two types of particle.   Vector symmetries mean the same transformation is applied on the two chiralities.   Axial symmetries are those in which one transformation is applied on left-handed particles and the inverse on the right-handed particles.       As mentioned, asymptotic freedom means that at large energy – this corresponds also to short distances – there is practically no interaction between the particles. This is in contrast – more precisely one would say  dual – to what one is used to, since usually one connects the absence of interactions with large  distances. However, as already mentioned in the original paper of Franz Wegner, F. Wegner, Duality in Generalized Ising Models and Phase Transitions without Local Order Parameter, J. Math. Phys. 12 2259–2272.     : Reprinted in  |Claudio_Rebbi|Claudio_Rebbi|  , Lattice Gauge Theories and Monte Carlo Simulations, World Scientific, Singapore , p. 60–73. Abstract:   a solid state theorist who introduced 1971 simple gauge invariant lattice models, the high-temperature behaviour of the original model, e.g. the strong decay of correlations at large distances, corresponds to the low-temperature behaviour of the dual model, namely the asymptotic decay of non-trivial correlations, e.g. short-range deviations from almost perfect arrangements, for short distances. Here, in contrast to Wegner, we have only the dual model, which is that one described in this article. Perhaps one can guess that in the original model mainly the quarks would fluctuate, whereas in the present one, the dual model, mainly the gluons do.       The color group SU corresponds to the local symmetry whose gauging gives rise to QCD. The electric charge labels a representation of the local symmetry group U which is gauged to give  |QED|Quantum_Electrodynamics| |abelian_group|Abelian_Group| . If one considers a version of QCD with N f  flavors of massless quarks, then there is a global  flavor symmetry group SU L  & times; SU R  & times; U B & times; U A . The chiral symmetry is  |spontaneously_broken|Spontaneous_Symmetry_Breaking|  by the  |QCD_vacuum|Qcd_Vacuum|  to the vector SU V  with the formation of a  |chiral_condensate|Chiral_Condensate| . The vector symmetry, U B corresponds to the baryon number of quarks and is an exact symmetry. The axial symmetry U A is exact in the classical theory, but broken in the quantum theory, an occurrence called an  |anomaly|Anomaly| . Gluon field configurations called  |instantons|Instanton|  are closely related to this anomaly.     There are two different types of SU symmetry: there is the symmetry that acts on the different colors of quarks, and this is an exact gauge symmetry mediated by the gluons, and there is also a flavor symmetry which rotates different flavors of quarks to each other, or flavor SU. Flavor SU is an approximate symmetry of the vacuum of QCD, and is not a fundamental symmetry at all. It is an accidental consequence of the small mass of the three lightest quarks.     In the  |QCD_vacuum|Qcd_Vacuum|  there are vacuum condensates of all the quarks whose mass is less than the QCD scale. This includes the up and down quarks, and to a lesser extent the strange quark, but not any of the others. The vacuum is symmetric under SU  |isospin|Isospin|  rotations of up and down, and to a lesser extent under rotations of up, down and strange, or full flavor group SU, and the observed particles make isospin and SU multiplets.     The approximate flavor symmetries do have associated gauge bosons, observed particles like the rho and the omega, but these particles are nothing like the gluons and they are not massless. They are emergent gauge bosons in an approximate  |string_description_of_QCD|Ads_Qcd| .       The dynamics of the quarks and gluons are controlled by the quantum chromodynamics  |Lagrangian|Lagrangian| . The  |gauge_invariant|Gauge_Invariant|  QCD Lagrangian is          where     is the quark field, a dynamical function of spacetime, in the  |fundamental_representation|Fundamental_Representation|  of the  |SU|Su|  gauge  |group|Group| , indexed by i,  ; D  is the  |gauge_covariant_derivative|Gauge_Covariant_Derivative| ; the γ μ are  |Dirac_matrices|Dirac_Matrices|  connecting the spinor representation to the vector representation of the  |Lorentz_group|Lorentz_Group| .     The symbol Ga   represents the gauge invariant  |gluon_field_strength_tensor|Gluon_Field_Strength_Tensor| , analogous to the  |electromagnetic_field_strength_tensor|Electromagnetic_Tensor| , F μν , in  |quantum_electrodynamics|Quantum_Electrodynamics| . It is given by:      : Ga     -     + g f           where     are the  |gluon_fields|Gluon_Field| , dynamical functions of spacetime, in the  |adjoint_representation|Adjoint_Representation|  of the SU gauge group, indexed by a, b,...; and f abc  are the  |structure_constants|Structure_Constants|  of SU. Note that the rules to move-up or pull-down the a, b, or c indices are trivial, , so that f abc  f abc  f a bc whereas for the μ or ν indices one has the non-trivial relativistic rules corresponding to the  |metric_signature|Metric_Signature|  .     The variables m and g correspond to the quark mass and coupling of the theory, respectively, which are subject to renormalization.     An important theoretical concept is the  Wilson loop  . In lattice QCD, the final term of the above Lagrangian is discretized via Wilson loops, and more generally the behavior of Wilson loops can distinguish  |confined|Color_Confinement|  and deconfined phases.            Quarks are massive spin-  |fermions|Fermion|  which carry a  |color_charge|Color_Charge|  whose gauging is the content of QCD. Quarks are represented by  |Dirac_fields|Dirac_Field|  in the  |fundamental_representation|Fundamental_Representation|  3 of the  |gauge_group|Gauge_Group| |_SU|Su| . They also carry electric charge  and participate in  |weak_interactions|Weak_Interactions|  as part of  |weak_isospin|Weak_Isospin|  doublets. They carry global quantum numbers including the  |baryon_number|Baryon_Number| , which is  for each quark,  |hypercharge|Hypercharge|  and one of the  |flavor_quantum_numbers|Flavor| .     Gluons are spin-1  |bosons|Boson|  which also carry  |color_charges|Color_Charge| , since they lie in the  |adjoint_representation|Adjoint_Representation_Of_A_Lie_Group|  8 of SU. They have no electric charge, do not participate in the weak interactions, and have no flavor. They lie in the  |singlet_representation|Singlet_State|  1 of all these symmetry groups.     Every quark has its own antiquark. The charge of each antiquark is exactly the opposite of the corresponding quark.       According to the rules of  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory| , and the associated  |Feynman_diagrams|Feynman_Diagram| , the above theory gives rise to three basic interactions: a quark may emit a gluon, a gluon may emit a gluon, and two gluons may directly interact. This contrasts with  |QED|Quantum_Electrodynamics| , in which only the first kind of interaction occurs, since  |photons|Photon|  have no charge. Diagrams involving  |Faddeev–Popov_ghosts|Faddeev–Popov_Ghost|  must be considered too .       Detailed computations with the above-mentioned Lagrangian See all standard textbooks on the QCD, e.g., those noted above show that the effective potential between a quark and its anti-quark in a  |meson|Meson|  contains a term that increases in proportion to the distance between the quark and anti-quark , which represents some kind of stiffness of the interaction between the particle and its anti-particle at large distances, similar to the  |entropic_elasticity|Entropic_Force|  of a  |rubber|Rubber|  band . This leads to confinement   Confinement gives way to a  |quark–gluon_plasma|Quark–Gluon_Plasma|  only at extremely large pressures and/or temperatures, e.g. for T   5  10    K or larger. of the quarks to the interior of hadrons, i.e.  |mesons|Meson|  and  |nucleons|Nucleon| , with typical radii R c , corresponding to former  |Bag_models|Bag_Model|  of the hadrons  |Kenneth_A_Johnson|Kenneth_A_Johnson| . . The bag model of quark confinement. Scientific American. The order of magnitude of the bag radius is 1  fm . Moreover, the above-mentioned stiffness is quantitatively related to the so-called area law behaviour of the expectation value of the  |Wilson_loop|Wilson_Loop|  product P W of the ordered coupling constants around a closed loop W; i.e.   PW  is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop. For this behaviour the non-abelian behaviour of the gauge group is essential.       Further analysis of the content of the theory is complicated. Various techniques have been developed to work with QCD. Some of them are discussed briefly below.          This approach is based on asymptotic freedom, which allows  |perturbation_theory|Perturbation_Theory|  to be used accurately in experiments performed at very high energies. Although limited in scope, this approach has resulted in the most precise tests of QCD to date.          called the latticee.g. nuclear matter or the interior of neutron stars23which expands around heavy quark mass near infinitywhich expands around large ratios of energy scalesChiral limit i.e. massless fermions |rticle_physi|Rticle_Physi|  this includes the  |Drell_Yan_process|Drell_Yan_Process|  1976i,k  si    J  sk  sk    Hi,ki,kquenchingannealingsee below1977i,kk,ln,mm,i3the spin glasses belong to themforce proportional to the length3where R c  is a characteristic correlation length for the glued loops, corresponding to the above-mentioned bag radius , while λ w is the wavelength of an excitationRPHD72004 .
