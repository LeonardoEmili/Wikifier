      Edith of England, also spelt Eadgyth or Ædgyth , a member of the  |House_of_Wessex|House_Of_Wessex| , was  |German_queen|German_Queen|  from 936, by her marriage with King  |Otto_I|Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| .       Edith was born to the reigning  |English|Kingdom_Of_England|  king  |Edward_the_Elder|Edward_The_Elder|  by his second wife,  |Ælfflæd|Ælfflæd,_Wife_Of_Edward_The_Elder| , and hence was a granddaughter of King  |Alfred_the_Great|Alfred_The_Great| . She had an older sister,  |Eadgifu|Eadgifu_Of_Wessex| .     At the request of the  |East_Frankish|East_Frankish|  king  |Henry_the_Fowler|Henry_The_Fowler| , who wished to stake a claim to equality and to seal the alliance between the two Saxon kingdoms, her half-brother King  |Æthelstan|Æthelstan|  sent his sisters Edith and Edgiva to  |Germany|Kingdom_Of_Germany| . Henrys eldest son and heir to the throne Otto was instructed to choose whichever one pleased him best. Otto chose Edith, according to  |Hrotsvitha|Hrotsvitha|  a woman of pure noble countenance, graceful character and truly royal appearance , and married her in 930.        In 936 Henry the Fowler died and his eldest son Otto, Ediths husband, was crowned king at  |Aachen_Cathedral|Aachen_Cathedral| . A surviving report of the ceremony by the medieval chronicler  |Widukind_of_Corvey|Widukind_Of_Corvey|  makes no mention of his wife having been crowned at this point, but according to Bishop  |Thietmar_of_Merseburgs|Thietmar_Of_Merseburg|  chronicle, Eadgyth was nevertheless  |anointed|Anointing|  as queen, albeit in a separate ceremony.     As queen consort, Edith undertook the usual state duties of a First Lady : when she turns up in the records it is generally in connection with gifts to the states  |favoured_monasteries|List_Of_Imperial_Abbeys|  or memorials to holy women and saints. In this respect she seems to have been more diligent than her now widowed and subsequently sainted mother-in-law, Queen  |Matilda|Matilda_Of_Ringelheim| , whose own charitable activities only achieve a single recorded mention from the period of Eadgyths time as queen. There was probably rivalry between the  |Benedictine|Order_Of_Saint_Benedict| |Monastery_of_St_Maurice|:De:Mauritiuskloster|  founded at  |Magdeburg|Magdeburg|  by Otto and Eadgyth in 937, a year after coming to the throne, and Matildas foundation  |Quedlinburg_Abbey|Quedlinburg_Abbey| , intended by her as a memorial to her husband, the late King Henry. Edith accompanied her husband on his travels, though not during battles. While Otto fought against the rebellious dukes  |Eberhard_of_Franconia|Eberhard_Of_Franconia|  and  |Gilbert_of_Lorraine|Gilbert,_Duke_Of_Lorraine|  in 939, she spent the hostilities at  |Lorsch_Abbey|Lorsch_Abbey| .     Like her brother, Æthelstan, Edith was devoted to the cult of their ancestor Saint  |Oswald_of_Northumbria|Oswald_Of_Northumbria|  and was instrumental in introducing this cult into Germany after her marriage to the emperor. Her lasting influence may have caused certain monasteries and churches in the  |Duchy_of_Saxony|Duchy_Of_Saxony|  to be dedicated to this saint.      Eadgyths death in 946 at a relatively young age, in her thirties, was unexpected. Otto apparently mourned the loss of a beloved spouse. He married  |Adelaide_of_Italy|Adelaide_Of_Italy|  in 951.       Edith and Ottos children were:    |Liudolf,_Duke_of_Swabia|Liudolf,_Duke_Of_Swabia| |Liutgarde|Liutgard_Of_Saxony|  , married the  |Lotharingia|Lotharingia| n duke  |Conrad_the_Red|Conrad_The_Red|  in 947   both buried in  |St._Albans_Abbey,_Mainz|St._Albans_Abbey,_Mainz| .          Initially buried in the St Maurice monastery, Ediths tomb since the 16th century has been located in  |Magdeburg_Cathedral|Magdeburg_Cathedral| . Long regarded as a  |cenotaph|Cenotaph| , a lead coffin inside a stone sarcophagus with her name on it was found and opened in 2008 by archaeologists during work on the building. An inscription recorded that it was the body of Eadgyth, reburied in 1510. The fragmented and incomplete bones were examined in 2009, then brought to  |Bristol|Bristol| , England, for tests in 2010.     The investigations at Bristol, applying  |isotope|Technetium-99M|  tests on tooth enamel, checked whether she was born and brought up in  |Wessex|Wessex|  and  |Mercia|Mercia| , as written history indicated.  Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 February 2014. Testing on the bones revealed that they are the remains of Eadgyth, from study made of the enamel of the teeth in her upper jaw.  Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 February 2014. Testing of the enamel revealed that the individual entombed at Magdeburg had spent time as a youth in the  |chalk|Chalk| y uplands of  |Wessex|Wessex| .  The Times, Simon de Bruxelles, 17 June 2010 The bones are the oldest found of a member of English royalty.      Following the tests the bones were re-interred in a new titanium coffin in her tomb at Magdeburg Cathedral on 22 October 2010.  in:  |Spiegel_Online|Spiegel_Online|.
