         Elbridge Thomas Gerry  was an American  |politician|Politician|  and  |diplomat|Diplomat| . As a  |Democratic_Republican|Democratic_Republican_Party|  he served as the fifth  |vice_president_of_the_United_States|Vice_President_Of_The_United_States|  under President  |James_Madison|James_Madison|  from March 1813 until his death in November 1814. The phenomenon of  |gerrymandering|Gerrymandering|  was named after him.     Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gerry vocally opposed British colonial policy in the 1760s, and was active in the early stages of organizing the resistance in the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| . Elected to the  |Second_Continental_Congress|Second_Continental_Congress| , Gerry signed both the  |Declaration_of_Independence|United_States_Declaration_Of_Independence|  and the  |Articles_of_Confederation|Articles_Of_Confederation| . He was one of three men who attended the  |Constitutional_Convention|Constitutional_Convention|  in 1787 who refused to sign the  |United_States_Constitution|United_States_Constitution|  because it did not then include a  |Bill_of_Rights|United_States_Bill_Of_Rights| . After its ratification he was elected to the inaugural  |United_States_Congress|United_States_Congress| , where he was actively involved in drafting and passage of the Bill of Rights as an advocate of individual and state liberties.     Gerry was at first opposed to the idea of  |political_parties|Political_Parties| , and cultivated enduring friendships on both sides of the political divide between  |Federalists|Federalist_Party|  and Democratic-Republicans. He was a member of a diplomatic delegation to  |France|France|  that was treated poorly in the  |XYZ_Affair|Xyz_Affair| , in which Federalists held him responsible for a breakdown in negotiations. Gerry thereafter became a Democratic-Republican, running unsuccessfully for  |Governor_of_Massachusetts|Governor_Of_Massachusetts|  several times before winning the office in 1810. During his second term, the legislature approved new state senate districts that led to the coining of the word gerrymander ; he lost the next election, although the state senate remained Democratic-Republican. Chosen by Madison as his vice presidential candidate in 1812, Gerry was elected, but died a year and a half into his term. He is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence who is buried in  |Washington_DC|Washington_Dc| .       Elbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in  |Marblehead_Massachusetts|Marblehead_Massachusetts| . His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant. Purcell, p. 46 Gerrys first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mothers ancestors. Greenleaf, p. 77 Gerrys parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood. Of these, Elbridge was the third. Billias, p. 5 He was first educated by private tutors, and entered  |Harvard_College|Harvard_College|  shortly before turning fourteen. After receiving a BA in 1762 and an MA in 1765, he entered his fathers merchant business. By the 1770s the Gerrys numbered among the wealthiest Massachusetts merchants, with trading connections in  |Spain|Spain| , the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| , and along the North American coast. Billias, p. 4 Gerrys father, who had emigrated from England in 1730, was active in local politics and had a leading role in the local militia. Billias, p. 3       Gerry was from an early time a vocal opponent of  |Parliamentary|Parliament_Of_Great_Britain|  efforts to tax the colonies after the  |French_and_Indian_War|French_And_Indian_War|  ended in 1763. In 1770 he sat on a Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods. He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including  |Samuel_Adams|Samuel_Adams| ,  |John_Adams|John_Adams| ,  |Mercy_Otis_Warren|Mercy_Otis_Warren| , and others.     In May 1772 he won election to the Great and General Court of the  |Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay|Province_Of_Massachusetts_Bay|  . There he worked closely with Samuel Adams to advance colonial opposition to Parliamentary colonial policies. He was responsible for establishing Marbleheads  |committee_of_correspondence|Committee_Of_Correspondence| , one of the first to be set up after that of  |Boston|Boston| . Austin, pp. 6–27 However, an incident of mob action prompted him to resign from the committee the next year. Gerry and other prominent Marbleheaders had  |established_a_hospital|Essex_Hospital|  for performing  |smallpox_inoculations|Smallpox_Vaccine|  on  |Cat_Island|Cat_Island| ; because the means of transmission of the disease were not known at the time, fears amongst the local population led to protests which escalated into violence that wrecked the facilities and threatened the proprietors other properties. Gilje, pp. 44–45     Gerry reentered politics after the  |Boston_Port_Act|Boston_Port_Act|  closed that citys port in 1774, and Marblehead became an alternative port to which relief supplies from other colonies could be delivered. As one of the towns leading merchants and Patriots, Gerry played a major role in ensuring the storage and delivery of supplies from Marblehead to Boston, interrupting those activities only to care for his dying father. He was elected as a representative to the  |First_Continental_Congress|First_Continental_Congress|  in September 1774, but declined, still grieving the loss of his father. Billias, pp. 42–44       Gerry was elected to the provincial assembly, which reconstituted itself as the  |Massachusetts_Provincial_Congress|Massachusetts_Provincial_Congress|  after British Governor  |Thomas_Gage|Thomas_Gage|  dissolved the body in October 1774. Billias, p. 46 He was assigned to its committee of safety, responsible for assuring that the provinces limited supplies of weapons and gunpowder remained out of  |British_Army|British_Army|  hands. His actions were partly responsible for the storage of weapons and ammunition in  |Concord|Concord_Massachusetts| ; these stores were the target of the British raiding expedition that sparked the start of the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War|  with the  |Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord|Battles_Of_Lexington_And_Concord|  in April 1775. Billias, p. 49  Billias, p. 52 During the  |Siege_of_Boston|Siege_Of_Boston|  that followed, Gerry continued to take a leading role in supplying the nascent  |Continental_Army|Continental_Army| , something he would continue to do as the war progressed. Billias, pp. 55–56 He leveraged business contacts in France and Spain to acquire not just munitions, but supplies of all types, and was involved in the transfer of financial subsidies from Spain to Congress. He sent ships to ports all along the American coast, and dabbled in financing  |privateering|Privateering|  operations against British shipping. Billias, pp. 124–30        Unlike some other merchants, there is no evidence that Gerry profiteered directly from the hostilities , although his war-related merchant activities notably increased the familys wealth. Billias, pp. 56, 123 His gains were tempered to some extent by the precipitous decline in the value of  |paper_currencies|Paper_Currency| , which he held in large quantities and speculated in. Billias, pp. 134–35     Gerry served in the  |Second_Continental_Congress|Second_Continental_Congress|  from February 1776 to 1780, when matters of the ongoing war occupied the bodys attention. He was influential in convincing a number of delegates to support passage of the  |United_States_Declaration_of_Independence|United_States_Declaration_Of_Independence|  in the debates held during the summer of 1776; John Adams wrote of him, If every Man here was a Gerry, the Liberties of America would be safe against the Gates of Earth and Hell. He was implicated as a member of the so-called  |Conway_Cabal|Conway_Cabal|  , a group of Congressmen and military officers who were dissatisfied with the performance of General  |George_Washington|George_Washington|  during the  |1777_military_campaign|Philadelphia_Campaign| . However, Gerry took Pennsylvania leader  |Thomas_Mifflin|Thomas_Mifflin| , one of Washingtons critics, to task early in the episode, and specifically denied knowledge of any sort of conspiracy against Washington in February 1778. Billias, pp. 76–77     Gerrys political philosophy was one of limited central government, and he regularly advocated for the maintenance of  |civilian_control_of_the_military|Civilian_Control_Of_The_Military| . He held these positions fairly consistently throughout his political career  and was well known for his personal integrity. Billias, pp. 140, 152, 192 In later years he opposed the idea of political parties, remaining somewhat distant from both the developing  |Federalist|Federalist_Party|  and  |Democratic_Republican|Democratic_Republican_Party|  parties until later in his career. It was not until 1800 that he would formally associate with the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to what he saw as attempts by the Federalists to centralize too much power in the national government. Billias, p. 105     In 1780 he resigned from the Continental Congress over the issue, and refused offers from the state legislature to return to the Congress. Billias, p. 101 He also refused appointment to the state senate, claiming he would be more effective in the states lower chamber, and also refused appointment as a county judge, comparing the offer by Governor  |John_Hancock|John_Hancock|  to those made by royally-appointed governors to benefit their political allies. Billias, p. 102 He was elected a Fellow of the  |American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|American_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences|  in 1781.      Gerry was convinced to rejoin the  |Confederation_Congress|Confederation_Congress|  in 1783, when the state legislature agreed to support his call for needed reforms. Billias, p. 103 He served in that body until September 1785, during which time it met in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| . The following year he married Ann Thompson, the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant who was twenty years his junior; his best man was his good friend  |James_Monroe|James_Monroe| . Ammon, p. 61 The couple had ten children between 1787 and 1801, straining Anns health.      The war made Gerry sufficiently wealthy that when it ended he sold off his merchant interests, and began investing in land. In 1787 he purchased the  |Cambridge_Massachusetts|Cambridge_Massachusetts|  estate of the last royal lieutenant governor of Massachusetts,  |Thomas_Oliver|Thomas_Oliver| , which had been confiscated by the state. This  property, known as  |Elmwood|Elmwood| , became the family home for the rest of Gerrys life.  He continued to own property in Marblehead, and bought a number of properties in other Massachusetts communities. He also owned shares in the  |Ohio_Company|Ohio_Company_Of_Associates| , prompting some political opponents to characterize him as an owner of vast tracts of western lands. Billias, p. 137       Gerry played a major role in the  |Constitutional_Convention|U_S_Constitutional_Convention| , held in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  during the summer of 1787. Billias, p. 158 In its deliberations, he consistently advocated for a strong delineation between state and federal government powers, with state legislatures shaping the membership of federal government positions. Gerrys opposition to popular election of representatives was rooted in part by the events of  |Shays_Rebellion|Shays_Rebellion| , a populist uprising in western Massachusetts in the year preceding the convention. Despite that position, he also sought to maintain individual liberties by providing checks on government power that might abuse or limit those freedoms. Billias, pp. 153–54     He supported the idea that the  |Senate|United_States_Senate|  composition should not be determined by population; the view that it should instead be composed of equal numbers of members for each state prevailed in the  |Connecticut_Compromise|Connecticut_Compromise| . The compromise was adopted on a narrow vote in which the Massachusetts delegation was divided, Gerry and  |Caleb_Strong|Caleb_Strong|  voting in favor. Billias, p. 178 Gerry further proposed that senators of a state, rather than casting a single vote on behalf of the state, vote instead as individuals. Billias, p. 182 Gerry was also vocal in opposing the  |Three_Fifths_Compromise|Three_Fifths_Compromise| , which counted  |slaves|Slavery_In_The_United_States|  as three fifths of a free person for the purposes of apportionment in the  |House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives| , which gave southern states a decided advantage. Billias, p. 168            Because of his fear of  |demagoguery|Demagoguery|  and belief the people of the United States could be easily misled, Gerry also advocated  |indirect_elections|Indirect_Election| . Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining them for the lower house of Congress, Gerry did obtain such indirect elections for the Senate, whose members were to be selected by the state legislatures. Gerry also advanced numerous proposals for indirect elections of the President of the United States, most of them involving limiting the right to vote to the state governors and  |electors|United_States_Electoral_College| .   A Founding Father in Dissent, Elbridge Gerry Helped Inspire Bill of Rights in His Opposition to the Constitution . National Archives.       Gerry was also unhappy about the lack of enumeration of any specific individual liberties in the proposed constitution, and generally opposed proposals that strengthened the central government. He was one of only three delegates who voted against the proposed constitution in the convention , citing a concern about the conventions lack of authority to enact such major changes to the nations system of government, and to the constitutions lack of  |federal_features|Federation| . Billias, p. 159, 200       During the ratification debates that took place in the states following the convention, Gerry continued his opposition, publishing a widely circulated letter documenting his objections to the proposed constitution. Billias, p. 209 In the document, he cited the lack of a  |Bill_of_Rights|United_States_Bill_Of_Rights|  as his primary objection, but also expressed qualified approval of the constitution, indicating that he would accept it with some amendment. Billias, pp. 207–08 Strong pro-Constitution forces attacked him in the press, comparing him unfavorably to the  |Shaysites|Shays_Rebellion| .  |Henry_Jackson|Henry_Jackson|  was particularly vicious: done more injury to this country by that infamous Letter than he will be able to make atonement in his whole life , and  |Oliver_Ellsworth|Oliver_Ellsworth| , a convention delegate from  |Connecticut|Connecticut| , charged him with deliberately courting the Shays faction. Billias, p. 212     One consequence of the furor over his letter was that he was not selected as a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention Billias, p. 211 although he was later invited to attend by the conventions leadership. The convention leadership was dominated by Federalists, and Gerry was not given any formal opportunity to speak. He left the convention after a shouting match with convention chair  |Francis_Dana|Francis_Dana| . Billias, p. 213 Massachusetts ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Billias, p. 214 The debate had the result of estranging Gerry from a number of previously-friendly politicians, including chairman Dana and  |Rufus_King|Rufus_King| . Billias, pp. 207–08, 213       Anti-Federalist forces nominated Gerry for governor in 1788, but he was predictably defeated by the popular incumbent  |John_Hancock|John_Hancock| . Billias, p. 215 Following its ratification, Gerry recanted his opposition to the Constitution, noting that a number of other state ratifying conventions had called for amendments that he supported. Billias, p. 207 He was nominated by friends for a seat in the inaugural House of Representatives, where he then served two terms. Billias, pp. 216, 243        In June 1789 Gerry proposed that Congress consider all of the proposed constitutional amendments that various state ratifying conventions had called for . Billias, p. 229 In the debate that followed, he led opposition to some of the proposals, arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties. He successfully lobbied for inclusion of  |freedom_of_assembly|Freedom_Of_Assembly|  in the  |First_Amendment|First_Amendment_Of_The_United_States_Constitution| , and was a leading architect of the  |Fourth_Amendment|Fourth_Amendment_Of_The_United_States_Constitution|  protections against search and seizure. Billias, p. 231 He sought unsuccessfully to insert the word expressly into the  |Tenth_Amendment|Tenth_Amendment_To_The_United_States_Constitution| , which might have more significantly limited the federal governments power. Billias, pp. 233–34     He was successful in efforts to severely limit the federal governments ability to control  |state_militias|State_Defense_Force| . Billias, p. 232 In tandem with this protection, he had once argued against the idea of the federal government controlling a large  |standing_army|Standing_Army| , comparing it – most memorably and mischievously – to a standing  |penis|Human_Penis|      Gerry vigorously supported  |Alexander_Hamiltons|Alexander_Hamilton|  reports on public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamiltons new  |Bank_of_the_United_States|First_Bank_Of_The_United_States| , positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization. Billias, pp. 223, 237 Although he had speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit , there is no evidence he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank. Billias, pp. 240, 242 He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to  |republican_ideals|Republicanism_In_The_United_States| , and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties. He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the  |Treasury_Department|United_States_Treasury_Department|  because its head might gain more power than the President. Billias, p. 225 He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency , seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments. Billias, p. 226     Gerry did not stand for re-election in 1792, returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife. Billias, p. 243 He agreed to serve as a  |presidential_elector|Presidential_Elector|  for John Adams in the  |1796_election|1796_United_States_Presidential_Election| . Billias, p. 245 During Adams term in office, Gerry maintained good relations with both Adams and Vice President  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| , hoping that the divided executive might lead to less friction. His hopes were not realized: the split between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans widened. Purcell, pp. 51–52             President Adams appointed Gerry to be a member of a special diplomatic commission sent to  |Republican_France|French_First_Republic|  in 1797. Tensions had risen between the two nations after the 1796 ratification of the  |Jay_Treaty|Jay_Treaty| , made between the United States and Great Britain. It was seen by French leaders as signs of an Anglo-American alliance, and France had consequently stepped up seizures of American ships. Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 537–38 Adams chose Gerry, over his cabinets opposition , because of their long-standing relationship; Adams described Gerry as one of the two most impartial men in America . Ferling, p. 345     Gerry joined co-commissioners  |Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney|Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney|  and  |John_Marshall|John_Marshall|  in France in October 1797, and met briefly with Foreign Minister  |Talleyrand|Charles_Maurice_De_Talleyrand| . Stinchcombe, pp. 596–97 Some days after that meeting, the delegation was approached by three French agents who demanded substantial bribes from the commissioners before negotiations could continue. Billias, pp. 268–69 The commissioners refused, and sought unsuccessfully to engage Talleyrand in formal negotiations. Billias, pp. 272–75 Believing Gerry to be the most approachable of the commissioners, Talleyrand successively froze first Pinckney and then Marshall out of the informal negotiations, and they left France in April 1798. Stinchcombe, pp. 598–613 Gerry, who sought to leave with them, stayed behind because Talleyrand threatened war if he left. Billias, p. 280 Gerry refused to make any significant negotiations afterward and left Paris in August. Billias, p. 283     By then, dispatches describing the commissions reception had been published in the United States, raising calls for war. Ferling, pp. 354–57 The undeclared naval  |Quasi_War|Quasi_War|  followed. Smith, p. 130 Federalists, notably Secretary of State  |Timothy_Pickering|Timothy_Pickering| , accused Gerry of supporting the French and abetting the breakdown of the talks, while Adams and Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson supported him. Billias, pp. 289–93 The negative press damaged Gerrys reputation, and he was  |burned_in_effigy|Burning_In_Effigy|  by protestors in front of his home. He was only later vindicated, when his correspondence with Talleyrand was published. In response to the Federalist attacks on him, and because of his perception that the Federalist-led military buildup threatened republican values, Gerry formally joined the Democratic-Republican Party in early 1800, standing for election as  |Governor_of_Massachusetts|Governor_Of_Massachusetts| . Billias, pp. 289, 301       For years, Gerry unsuccessfully sought the governorship of Massachusetts  . His opponent in these races, Caleb Strong, was a popular moderate Federalist, whose party dominated the states politics despite a national shift toward the Republicans. Buel, pp. 39–44 In 1803 Republicans in the state were divided, and Gerry only had regional support of the party. He decided not to run in 1804, returning to semi-retirement Billias, pp. 304–305 and to deal with a personal financial crisis. His brother Samuel Russell had mismanaged his own business affairs, and Gerry had propped him up by  |guaranteeing_a_loan|Loan_Guarantee|  that was due. The matter ultimately ruined Gerrys finances for his remaining years. Billias, pp. 305–06     Republican  |James_Sullivan|James_Sullivan|  won the governors seat from Strong in 1807, but his successor was unable to hold the seat in the 1809 election, which went to Federalist  |Christopher_Gore|Christopher_Gore| . Buel, pp. 73–82, 103–04 Gerry stood for election again in 1810 against Gore, and won a narrow victory. Republicans cast Gore as an ostentatious British-loving  |Tory|Tory|  who wanted to restore the monarchy , and Gerry as a patriotic American, while Federalists described Gerry as a French partizan and Gore as an honest man devoted to ridding the government of foreign influence. Billias, p. 313 A temporary lessening in the threat of war with Britain aided Gerry. Buel, pp. 104–07 The two battled again in 1811, with Gerry once again victorious in a highly acrimonious campaign. Buel, pp. 116–17 Formisano, p. 74        Gerrys first year as governor was less controversial than his second, because the Federalists controlled the state senate. He preached moderation in the political discourse, noting that it was important that the nation present a unified front in its dealings with foreign powers. Buel, pp. 107–08 In his second term, with full Republican control of the legislature, he became notably more partisan, purging much of the state government of Federalist appointees. The legislature also enacted reforms of the court system that resulted in an increase in the number of judicial appointments, which Gerry filled with Republican partisans. However, infighting within the party and a shortage of qualified candidates played against Gerry, and the Federalists scored points by complaining vocally about the partisan nature of the reforms. Buel, pp. 144–47     Other legislation passed during Gerrys second year included a bill broadening the membership of  |Harvards_Board_of_Overseers|Harvard_Board_Of_Overseers|  to diversify its religious membership, and another that liberalized religious taxes. The Harvard bill had significant political slant because the recent split between orthodox  |Congregationalists|Congregationalist|  and  |Unitarians|Unitarianism|  also divided the state to some extent along party lines, and Federalist Unitarians had recently gained control over the Harvard board. Formisano, p. 76     In 1812 the state adopted new constitutionally-mandated electoral district boundaries. The Republican-controlled legislature had created district boundaries designed to enhance their partys control over state and national offices, leading to some oddly shaped legislative districts. Hart, p. 3:458 Although Gerry was unhappy about the highly partisan districting , he signed the legislation. The shape of one of the state senate districts in  |Essex_County|Essex_County_Massachusetts|  was compared to a  |salamander|Salamanders_In_Folklore_And_Legend|  by a local Federalist newspaper in a political cartoon, calling it a Gerry-mander . Billias, p. 317 Ever since, the creation of such districts has been called  |gerrymander|Gerrymander| ing.     Gerry also engaged in partisan investigations of potential libel against him by elements of the Federalist press, further damaging his popularity with moderates. The redistricting controversy, along with the libel investigation and the impending  |War_of_1812|War_Of_1812| , contributed to Gerrys defeat in 1812 . Buel, pp. 148–49 Billias, p. 323 The gerrymandering of the state senate was a notable success in the 1812 election: the body was thoroughly dominated by Republicans, even though the house and the governors seat went to Federalists by substantial margins.       Gerrys financial difficulties prompted him to ask President  |James_Madison|James_Madison|  for a federal position after his loss in the 1812 election . He was chosen by the Democratic-Republican party congress to be Madisons vice presidential running mate in the  |1812_presidential_election|1812_United_States_Presidential_Election| , although the nomination was first offered to  |John_Langdon|John_Langdon| . He was viewed as a relatively safe choice who would attract Northern votes but not pose a threat to James Monroe, who was thought likely to succeed Madison. Madison easily won reelection, and Gerry took the oath of office at Elmwood in March 1813. Billias, p. 324 At that time the office of vice president was largely a  |sinecure|Sinecure| ; Gerrys duties included advancing the administrations agenda in Congress and dispensing  |patronage|Patronage|  positions in New England. Billias, p. 327 Gerrys actions in support of the  |War_of_1812|War_Of_1812|  had a partisan edge: he expressed concerns over a possible Federalist seizure of Fort Adams  as a prelude to Anglo-Federalist cooperation, and sought the arrest of printers of Federalist newspapers. Morison, p. 2:57        On November 23, 1814, Gerry fell seriously ill while visiting  |Joseph_Nourse|Joseph_Nourse|  of the Treasury Department,  and died not long after returning to his home in the  |Seven_Buildings|Seven_Buildings| . Billias, p. 329 He is buried in the  |Congressional_Cemetery|Congressional_Cemetery|  in  |Washington_DC|Washington_Dc| , Purcell, p. 53 with a memorial by  |John_Frazee|John_Frazee| .  He is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence who was buried in the nations capital city. Roberts and Schmidt, p. 47 The estate he left his wife and children was rich in land and poor in cash, but he had managed to repay his brothers debts with his pay as vice president. Aged 68 at the start of his Vice Presidency, he would be the oldest person to become Vice President until  |Charles_Curtis|Charles_Curtis|  in 1929.          Gerry is generally remembered for the use of his name in the word  gerrymander , for his refusal to sign the United States Constitution, and for his role in the XYZ Affair. His path through the politics of the age has been difficult to characterize; early biographers, including his son-in-law  |James_T_Austin|James_T_Austin|  and  |Samuel_Eliot_Morison|Samuel_Eliot_Morison| , struggled to explain his apparent changes in position. Biographer  |George_Athan_Billias|George_Athan_Billias|  posits that Gerry was a consistent advocate and practitioner of republicanism as it was originally envisioned, Billias, p. 2 and that his role in the Constitutional Convention had a significant impact on the document it eventually produced. Billias, p. 204     Gerry had ten children, of whom seven survived into adulthood:   Catharine Gerry   Eliza Gerry   Ann Gerry   Elbridge Gerry, Jr.     |Thomas_Russell_Gerry|Thomas_Russell_Gerry|  , who married Hannah Green Goelet    Helen Maria Gerry   James Thompson Gerry , who left  |West_Point|West_Point|  upon his fathers death and was Commander of the war-sloop  |USS_Albany_|Uss_Albany| ; the sloop disappeared with all hands 28 or 29 September 1854 near the West Indies.
