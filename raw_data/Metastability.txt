        In  |physics|Physics| , metastability is a stable state of a  |dynamical_system|Dynamical_System|  other than the systems  |state_of_least_energy|Ground_State| .   A ball resting in a hollow on a slope is a simple example of metastability. If the ball is only slightly pushed, it will settle back into its hollow, but a stronger push may start the ball rolling down the slope. Bowling pins show similar metastability by either merely wobbling for a moment or tipping over completely. A common example of metastability in science is  |isomer|Isomer| isation. Higher energy isomers are long lived as they are prevented from rearranging to their preferred  |ground_state|Ground_State|  by barriers in the potential energy.     During a metastable state of finite lifetime, all state-describing parameters reach and hold stationary values. In isolation:   the state of least energy is the only one the system will inhabit for an indefinite length of time, until more external energy is added to the system ;   the system will spontaneously leave any other state to eventually return to the least energetic state.     The metastability concept originated in the physics of  |first-order_phase_transitions|Phase_Transitionmodern_Classifications| . It then acquired new meaning in the study of aggregated  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle|  or in molecules, macromolecules or clusters of atoms and molecules. Later, it was borrowed for the study of decision-making and information transmission systems.     Many complex natural and man-made systems can demonstrate metastability.   Metastability is common in  |physics|Physics|  and  |chemistry|Chemistry|  – from an atom to statistical ensembles of molecules  at molecular levels or as a whole . The abundance of states is more prevalent as the systems grow larger and/or if the forces of their mutual interaction are spatially less uniform or more diverse.   In  |dynamic_systems|Systems_Dynamics|   like electronic circuits, signal trafficking, decisional systems and neuroscience – the time-invariance of the active or reactive patterns with respect to the external influences defines stability and metastability . In these systems, the equivalent of  |thermal_fluctuations|Thermal_Fluctuations|  in molecular systems is the white noise that affects signal propagation and the decision-making.         |Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics|Non-Equilibrium_Thermodynamics|  is a branch of physics that studies the dynamics of statistical ensembles of molecules via unstable states. Being stuck in a thermodynamic trough without being at the lowest energy state is known as having kinetic stability or being kinetically persistent. The particular motion or  |kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics|  of the atoms involved has resulted in getting stuck, despite there being preferable alternatives.          Metastable  |states_of_matter|States_Of_Matter|   range from melting solids , boiling liquids  and  |sublimating_solids|Sublimation|  to  |supercooled|Supercooling|  liquids or  |superheated|Superheating|  liquid-gas mixtures. Extremely pure, supercooled water stays liquid below 0  °C and remains so until applied vibrations or condensing seed doping initiates  |crystallization|Crystallization|  centers. This is a common situation for the droplets of atmospheric clouds.            Metastable phases are common in condensed matter and crystallography. Notably, this is the case for  |anatase|Anatase| , a metastable polymorph of  |titanium_dioxide|Titanium_Dioxide| , which despite commonly being the first phase to form in many synthesis processes due to its lower  |surface_energy|Surface_Energy| , is always metastable, with  |rutile|Rutile|  being the most stable phase at all temperatures and pressures  in the Journal of Materials Science 2011 .   As another example,  |diamond|Diamond|  is a stable phase only at very high pressures, but is a metastable form of carbon at  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Conditions_For_Temperature_And_Pressure| . It can be converted to  |graphite|Graphite|  , but only after overcoming an  |activation_energy|Activation_Energy|  – an intervening hill.  |Martensite|Martensite|  is a metastable phase used to control the hardness of most steel. The bonds between the building blocks of  |polymers|Polymer|  such as  |DNA|Dna| ,  |RNA|Rna| , and  |proteins|Protein|  are also metastable.  |Adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  is a highly metastable molecule, colloquially described as being full of energy that can be used in many ways in biology.  Metastable  |polymorphs|Polymorphism|  of  |silica|Quartz|  are commonly observed. In some cases, such as in the  |allotropes|Allotropes|  of solid  |boron|Boron| , acquiring a sample of the stable phase is difficult.  Generally speaking,  |emulsions|Emulsion| / |colloid|Colloid| al systems and  |glass|Glass| es are metastable.      |Sandpiles|Abelian_Sandpile_Model|  are one system which can exhibit metastability if a steep slope or tunnel is present.  |Sand_grains|Sand|  form a pile due to  |friction|Friction| . It is possible for an entire large sand pile to reach a point where it is stable, but the addition of a single grain causes large parts of it to collapse.     The  |avalanche|Avalanche|  is a well-known problem with large piles of snow and ice crystals on steep slopes. In dry conditions, snow slopes act similarly to sandpiles. An entire mountainside of snow can suddenly slide due to the presence of a skier, or even a loud noise or vibration.         Aggregated systems of  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle|  described by  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|   are found to have many distinguishable states. Of these, one  is indefinitely stable: the  |ground_state|Ground_State|  or  |global_minimum|Global_Minimum| .     All other states besides the ground state have higher energies.  Of all these other states, the metastable states are the ones having  |lifetimes|Half-Life|  lasting at least 10 2 to 10 3 times longer than the shortest lived states of the set.     A metastable state is then long-lived  but not eternal . Being excited – of an energy above the ground state – it will eventually decay to a more stable state, releasing energy. Indeed, above  |absolute_zero|Absolute_Zero| , all states of a system have a non-zero probability to decay; that is, to spontaneously fall into another state . One mechanism for this to happen is through  |tunnelling|Quantum_Tunnelling| .       Some energetic states of an  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|   are much longer-lived than other , e.g.  |technetium-99m|Technetium-99M| .  The isotope  |tantalum-180m|Isotopes_Of_Tantalumtantalum-180M| , although being a metastable excited state, is long-lived enough that it has never been observed to decay, with a half-life calculated to be least  years,   over 3 million times the current  |age_of_the_universe|Age_Of_The_Universe| .       Some atomic energy levels are metastable.  |Rydberg_atoms|Rydberg_Atom|  are an example of metastable excited atomic states. Transitions from metastable excited levels are typically those forbidden by electric dipole  |selection_rules|Selection_Rule| . This means that any transitions from this level are relatively unlikely to occur. In a sense, an electron that happens to find itself in a metastable configuration is trapped there. Of course, since transitions from a metastable state are not impossible , the electron will eventually decay to a less energetic state, typically by an electric quadrupole transition, or often by non-radiative de-excitation .     This slow-decay property of a metastable state is apparent in  |phosphorescence|Phosphorescence| , the kind of  |photoluminescence|Photoluminescence|  seen in glow-in-the-dark toys that can be charged by first being exposed to bright light. Whereas spontaneous emission in atoms has a typical timescale on the order of 10 −8 seconds, the decay of metastable states can typically take milliseconds to minutes, and so light emitted in phosphorescence is usually both weak and long-lasting.       In chemical systems, a system of atoms or molecules involving a change in  |chemical_bond|Chemical_Bond|  can be in a metastable state, which lasts for a relatively long period of time. Molecular vibrations and  |thermal_motion|Temperature|  make chemical species at the energetic equivalent of the top of a round hill very short-lived. Metastable states that persist for many seconds are found in energetic valleys which are not the lowest possible valley . A common type of metastability is  |isomerism|Isomerism| .     The stability or metastability of a given chemical system depends on its environment, particularly  |temperature|Temperature|  and  |pressure|Pressure| . The difference between producing a stable vs. metastable entity can have important consequences. For instances, having the wrong crystal  |polymorph|Polymorphism|  can result in failure of a drug while in storage between manufacture and administration. Process Chemistry in the Pharmaceutical Industry. Kumar G. Gadamasetti, editor. 1999, pp. 375–378 The map of which state is the most stable as a function of pressure, temperature and/or composition is known as a  |phase_diagram|Phase_Diagram| . In regions where a particular state is not the most stable, it may still be metastable.    |Reaction_intermediates|Reaction_Intermediate|  are relatively short-lived, and are usually thermodynamically unstable rather than metastable. The  |IUPAC|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry|  recommends referring to these as transient rather than metastable.      Metastability is also used to refer to specific situations in mass spectrometry  and spectrochemistry.                The evolution of a many-body quantum system between its characteristic set of states may be influenced by the following external actions:   The environment may act  |chaotically|Chaos_Theory|  on the system, adding uncertainty to all state energies – as in  |spectral_line_broadening|Spectral_Linespectral_Line_Broadening_And_Shift| .    |Resonant|Resonance|  exterior actions may nudge the system into a lower cohesive energy state while making it release an  intrinsic amount or  quanta  of its energy – as in  |stimulated_emissions|Stimulated_Emission| .   Alternatively, external  |catalytic|Catalyst|  fields of forces may briefly flatten some of the  barriers  in the  |potential|Potential|  landscape of the system and help it  tunnel  through to lower energy states.   Under the impact of thermal or directional external actions, some systems  may wander for extremely long periods of time among a certain sub-group of their states . As such the enzymes will enter a biochemical reaction sequence with an initial configuration, perform the many steps of the sequence as catalysts while continuously contorting, and eventually leave that reaction sequence in the same configuration as they entered it, ready to perform again.       A digital circuit is supposed to be found in a small number of stable digital states within a certain amount of time after an input change. However if an input changes at the wrong moment a digital circuit which employs feedback  can  |enter_a_metastable_state|Metastability_In_Electronics|  and take an unbounded length of time to finally settle into a fully stable digital state.        |Metastability_in_the_brain|Metastability_In_The_Brain|  is a phenomenon studied in  |computational_neuroscience|Computational_Neuroscience|.
