   In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a  |field|Field|   is algebraically closed if every  |non_constant_polynomial|Degree_Of_A_Polynomial|  in   has a  |root|Zero_Of_A_Function|  in .       As an example, the field of  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation x 2  +  1    0   has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients are real. The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number|  is not algebraically closed. Also, no  |finite_field|Finite_Field|  F is algebraically closed, because if a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n  are the elements of F, then the polynomial   ···    +  1   has no zero in F. By contrast, the  |fundamental_theorem_of_algebra|Fundamental_Theorem_Of_Algebra|  states that the field of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number|  is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of  |algebraic_numbers|Algebraic_Number| .       Given a field F, the assertion F is algebraically closed is equivalent to other assertions:       The field F is algebraically closed if and only if the only  |irreducible_polynomials|Irreducible_Polynomial|  in the  |polynomial_ring|Polynomial_Ring|  Fx are those of degree one.     The assertion the polynomials of degree one are irreducible is trivially true for any field. If F is algebraically closed and p is an irreducible polynomial of Fx, then it has some root a and therefore p is a multiple of x   & minus;  a. Since p is irreducible, this means that p    k, for some k  ∈  F     . On the other hand, if F is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial p in Fx without roots in F. Let q be some irreducible factor of p. Since p has no roots in F, q also has no roots in F. Therefore, q has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in F.       The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial p of degree n  ≥  1, with  |coefficients|Coefficient|  in F,  |splits_into_linear_factors|Factorization| . In other words, there are elements k,  x 1 ,  x 2 ,  ...,  x n  of the field F such that p    k  ···  .     If F has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in Fx has some root in F; in other words, F is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for F if F is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field K, any polynomial in Kx can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.       If every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F, then every non-constant polynomial has a root in F. Shipman, J.  The Mathematical Intelligencer, Volume 29 , Number 4. pp. 9-14 It follows that a field is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F.       The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper  |algebraic_extension|Algebraic_Extension| .     If F has no proper algebraic extension, let p be some irreducible polynomial in Fx. Then the  |quotient|Quotient_Ring|  of Fx modulo the  |ideal|Ideal|  generated by p is an algebraic extension of F whose  |degree|Degree_Of_A_Field_Extension|  is equal to the degree of p. Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of p is  1.     On the other hand, if F has some proper algebraic extension K, then the  |minimal_polynomial|Minimal_Polynomial|  of an element in K     F is irreducible and its degree is greater than  1.       The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper  |finite_extension|Finite_Extension|  because if, within the  |previous_proof|Algebraically_Closed_Fieldthe_Field_Has_No_Proper_Algebraic_Extension| , the term algebraic extension is replaced by the term finite extension , then the proof is still valid.     F n  has some eigenvectorF is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number n, every  |linear_map|Linear_Map|  from F n  into itself has some  |eigenvector|Eigenvector| .     An  |endomorphism|Endomorphism|  of F n  has an eigenvector if and only if its  |characteristic_polynomial|Characteristic_Polynomial|  has some root. Therefore, when F is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of F n  has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of F n  has an eigenvector, let p be an element of Fx. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial q which has roots if and only if p has roots. But if q    x n   +  a n   & minus;  1 x n   & minus;  1 +  ···  +  a 0 , then q is the characteristic polynomial of the n×n  |companion_matrix|Companion_Matrix|    :   & 0 &   & 0 & -a0  & 0 &   & 0 & -a1  & 1 &   & 0 & -a2  &   &   &   &   & 0 &   & 1 & -a        The field F is algebraically closed if and only if every  |rational_function|Rational_Function|  in one variable x, with coefficients in F, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form a/ n , where n is a natural number, and a and b are elements of F.     If F is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in Fx are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the  |theorem_on_partial_fraction_decomposition|Partial_Fraction_Decompositionstatement_Of_Theorem| .     On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field F. Let p be an irreducible element in Fx. Then the rational function 1/p can be written as the sum of a polynomial function q with rational functions of the form a/ n . Therefore, the rational expression   :     can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since p is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.       For any field F, if two polynomials p,q  ∈  Fx are  |relatively_prime|Coprime|  then they do not have a common root, for if a  ∈  F was a common root, then  p and  q would both be multiples of x   & minus;  a and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds are precisely the algebraically closed fields.     If the field F is algebraically closed, let p and q be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let r be their  |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor| . Then, since r is not constant, it will have some root a, which will be then a common root of p and q.     If F is not algebraically closed, let p be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then p and p are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots .       If F is an algebraically closed field and n is a natural number, then F contains all nth roots of unity, because these are the n zeroes of the polynomial x n    & minus;  1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a cyclotomic extension, and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its cyclotomic closure. Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form x n    & minus;  a splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.     If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of  |first_order_logic|First_Order_Logic|  is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same  |characteristic|Characteristic| . Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic  0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic  0, but there is some natural number N such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic  p when p      N. See subsections Rings and fields and Properties of mathematical theories in §2 of J. Barwises An introduction to first-order logic .     Every field F has some extension which is algebraically closed. Such an extension is called an algebraically closed extension. Among all such extensions there is one and only one  which is an  |algebraic_extension|Algebraic_Extension|  of F; See Langs Algebra, §VII.2 or van der Waerdens Algebra I, §10.1. it is called the  |algebraic_closure|Algebraic_Closure|  of F.     The theory of algebraically closed fields has  |quantifier_elimination|Quantifier_Elimination| .
