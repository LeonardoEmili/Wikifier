                       The Sea of Marmara , also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity|  as the Propontis, is the  |inland_sea|Inland_Sea| , entirely within the borders of  |Turkey|Turkey| , that connects the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  to the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea| , thus separating Turkeys  |Asia|Asia| n and  |Europe|Europe| an parts. The  |Bosphorus|Bosphorus|  strait connects it to the Black Sea and the  |Dardanelles|Dardanelles|  strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates  |Istanbul|Istanbul|  into its Asian and European sides. The Sea of Marmara is a small sea with an area of , and dimensions .  Its greatest depth is .       The sea takes its name from  |Marmara_Island|Marmara_Island| , which is rich in sources of  |marble|Marble| , from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|   , marble .      The seas ancient Greek name Propontis derives from pro- and pontos , deriving from the fact that the Greeks sailed through it to reach the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea| , Pontos. In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , a storm on Propontis brought the  |Argonauts|Argonauts|  back to an island they had left, precipitating a battle where either  |Jason|Jason|  or  |Heracles|Heracles|  killed  |King_Cyzicus|Cyzicus| , who mistook them for his  |Pelasgia|Pelasgia| n enemies.        The surface  |salinity|Salinity|  of the sea averages about 22 parts per thousand, which is slightly greater than that of the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea| , but only about two-thirds that of most  |oceans|Ocean| . The water is much more saline at the sea bottom, averaging salinities of around 38 parts per thousand, similar to that of the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea| . This high-density saline water, like that of the Black Sea, does not migrate to the surface. Water from the  |Susurluk|Simav_River| ,  |Biga|Biga_Çayı|  and Gonen Rivers also reduces the salinity of the sea, though with less influence than on the Black Sea. With little land in  |Thrace|Thrace|  draining southward, almost all of these rivers flow from  |Anatolia|Anatolia| .     The sea contains the  |archipelago|Archipelago|  of the  |Prince_Islands|Prince_Islands|  and  |Marmara_Island|Marmara_Island| ,  |Avşa|Avşa|  and  |Paşalimanı|Paşalimanı| .     The south coast of the sea is heavily indented, and includes the  |Gulf_of_İzmit|Gulf_Of_İZmit|  , the  |Gulf_of_Gemlik|Gulf_Of_Gemlik|  ,  |Gulf_of_Bandırma|Gulfs_Of_Turkey|   and the  |Gulf_of_Erdek|Gulfs_Of_Turkey|  . During a storm on December 29, 1999, the Russian  |oil_tanker|Oil_Tanker|  Volgoneft broke in two in the Sea of Marmara, and more than 1,500 tonnes of  |oil|Oil|  were spilled into the water.     The  |North_Anatolian_Fault|North_Anatolian_Fault| , which has triggered many major  |earthquakes|Earthquake|  in recent years, such as the August and November 1999 earthquakes in  |Izmit|1999_İZmit_Earthquake|  and  |Düzce|1999_Düzce_Earthquake| , respectively, runs under the sea.       The  |International_Hydrographic_Organization|International_Hydrographic_Organization|  defines the limits of the Sea of Marmara as follows:      ::On the West. The  |Dardanelles|Dardanelles|  limit of the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea|  A line joining Kum Kale and  |Cape_Helles|Cape_Helles|  .     ::On the Northeast. A line joining Cape Rumili with Cape Anatoli .       Towns and cities on the Marmara Sea coast include:     |Bosphorus|Bosphorus| , southern end and  |Istanbul|Istanbul| |Istanbul|Istanbul| |Yassıada|Yassıada| |Yeşilköy|Yeşilköy| |Kadıköy|Kadıköy| .
