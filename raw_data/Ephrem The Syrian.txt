           Ephrem the Syrian  was a  |Syriac_Christian|Syriac_Christianity|  deacon and a prolific Syriac-language hymnographer and  |theologian|Christian_Theology|  of the fourth century.     Ephrem is especially beloved in the Assyrian  |Syriac_Orthodox_Church|Syriac_Orthodox_Church| , and counted as a Venerable Father in the  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| . His  |feast_day|Feast_Day|  is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers. He was declared a  |Doctor_of_the_Church|Doctor_Of_The_Church|  in the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  in 1920.     Ephrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose  |exegesis|Exegesis| . These were works of practical theology for the edification of the  |Church|Christian_Church|  in troubled times. So popular were his works, that, for centuries after his death, Christian authors wrote hundreds of  |pseudepigrapha|Pseudepigrapha| l works in his name. He has been called the most significant of all of the fathers of the Syriac-speaking church tradition. Parry , p. 180       Ephrem was born around the year 306 in the city of  |Nisibis|Nisibis|  , in the contested border region between  |Sassanid_Assyria|Asōristān|  and  |Roman_Mesopotamia|Roman_Mesopotamia| ,  |then-recently|Peace_Of_Nisibis|  acquired by Rome.         Internal evidence from Ephrems hymnody suggests that both his parents were part of the growing Christian community in the city, although later  |hagiographers|Hagiographer|  wrote that his father was a pagan priest.  Numerous languages were spoken in the Nisibis of Ephrems day, mostly dialects of  |Aramaic|Aramaic_Language| . The Christian community used the  |Syriac_dialect|Syriac_Language| . The culture included pagan religions,  |Judaism|Judaism|  and early Christian sects.      |Jacob|Jacob_Of_Nisibis| , the second  |bishop|Bishop|  of Nisibis,  was appointed in 308, and Ephrem grew up under his leadership of the community. Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the  |First_Council_of_Nicea|First_Council_Of_Nicea|  in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a  |son_of_the_covenant|Members_Of_The_Covenant| , an unusual form of syriac proto- |monasticism|Monasticism| . Jacob appointed Ephrem as a teacher . He was ordained as a  |deacon|Deacon|  either at his baptism or later. Parry , pp. 180-181 He began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a herdsman , to his bishop as the shepherd , and to his community as a fold . Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the  |School_of_Nisibis|School_Of_Nisibis| , which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the  |Syriac_Orthodox_Church|Syriac_Orthodox_Church| .      In 337, Emperor  |Constantine_I|Constantine_I| , who had legalised and promoted the practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire, died. Seizing on this opportunity,  |Shapur_II|Shapur_Ii|  of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| . Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers. In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like  |Noahs_Ark|Noahs_Ark| , floating to safety on the flood.     One important physical link to Ephrems lifetime is the  |baptistery|Baptistery|  of Nisibis. The inscription tells that it was constructed under Bishop Vologeses in 359. In that year, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported.  |Constantius_II|Constantius_Ii|  was unable to respond; the campaign of  |Julian|Julian_The_Apostate|  in 363 ended with his death in battle. His army elected  |Jovian|Jovian|  as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population.     Ephrem, with the others, went first to Amida , eventually settling in  |Edessa|Edessa,_Mesopotamia|   in 363. Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the  |School_of_Edessa|School_Of_Edessa| . Edessa had always been at the heart of the Syriac-speaking world, and the city was full of rival philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called Palutians in Edessa, after a former bishop.  |Arians|Arianism| ,  |Marcionites|Marcionism| ,  |Manichees|Manichaeism| ,  |Bardaisan|Bardaisan| ites and various  |gnostic_sects|Gnosticism|  proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer,  |Jacob_of_Serugh|Jacob_Of_Serugh| , wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims. The most reliable date for his death is 9 June 373.             Over four hundred  |hymns|Hymn|  composed by Ephrem still exist. Granted that some have been lost, Ephrems productivity is not in doubt. The church historian  |Sozomen|Sozomen|  credits Ephrem with having written over three million lines. Ephrem combines in his writing a threefold heritage: he draws on the models and methods of early  |Rabbinic_Judaism|Rabbinic_Judaism| , he engages skillfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.     The most important of his works are his lyric, teaching hymns . These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. The madrāšê are written in stanzas of  |syllabic_verse|Syllabic_Verse|  and employ over fifty different metrical schemes. Each madrāšâ had its qālâ , a traditional tune identified by its opening line. All of these qālê are now lost. It seems that  |Bardaisan|Bardaisan|  and  |Mani|Mani|  composed madrāšê, and Ephrem felt that the medium was a suitable tool to use against their claims.  The madrāšê are gathered into various hymn cycles. Each group has a title — Carmina Nisibena, On Faith, On Paradise, On Virginity, Against Heresies — but some of these titles do not do justice to the entirety of the collection . Each madrāšâ usually had a refrain , which was repeated after each stanza. Later writers have suggested that the madrāšê were sung by all-women choirs with an accompanying lyre.     Particularly influential were his Hymns Against Heresies. Mourachian, Mark. Hymns Against Heresies: Comments on St. Ephrem the Syrian . Sophia 37:2, , pp. 30-31. Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles. Eph 4:14, as quoted in Mourachian He devised hymns laden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as  |docetism|Docetism| . The Hymns Against Heresies employ colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christs unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christs nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christs followers with their false teachings.     Ephrem also wrote verse homilies . These sermons in poetry are far fewer in number than the madrāšê. The mêmrê were written in a heptosyllabic  |couplets|Couplet|  .     The third category of Ephrems writings is his prose work. He wrote a biblical commentary on the  |Diatessaron|Diatessaron|  , the Syriac original of which was found in 1957. His Commentary on Genesis and Exodus is an exegesis of  |Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis|  and  |Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus| . Some fragments exist in Armenian of his commentaries on the  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles|  and  |Pauline_Epistles|Pauline_Epistles| .     He also wrote refutations against  |Bardaisan|Bardaisan| , Mani,  |Marcion|Marcion_Of_Sinope|  and others.     Ephrem is attributed with writing  |hagiographies|Hagiography|  such as  The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot , though this credit is called into question.      Ephrem wrote exclusively in the  |Syriac_language|Syriac_Language| , which is a dialect of middle Aramaic, but translations of his writings exist in  |Classical_Armenian|Classical_Armenian_Language| ,  |Coptic|Coptic_Language| ,  |Old_Georgian|Old_Georgian_Language| ,  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek|  and other languages. Some of his works are only extant in translation . Syriac churches still use many of Ephrems hymns as part of the annual cycle of worship. However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals.     The most complete, critical text of authentic Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium.     As Chronologist, St. Ephrem the Syrian has composed the history of the Patriarchs and Kings from the Creation to the Crucifixion of Christ, https://web.archive.org/web/20160810191441/http://www.filbluz.ca/resources/Book-of-the-cave-of-Treasure.pdf The Book of the Cave of Treasure, translated by W. Budge from the Syriac text of the British Museum Mss Add. 25875, published by The Religious Tract Society, 1927.       Ephrems writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios  and six root metaphors .        Ephrems artful meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church. This occurred to the extent that there is a huge corpus of Ephrem pseudepigraphy and legendary  |hagiography|Hagiography| . Some of these compositions are in verse, often a version of Ephrems heptosyllabic couplets. Most of these works are considerably later compositions in Greek. Students of Ephrem often refer to this corpus as having a single author called Greek Ephrem , or Ephraem Graecus . This is not to say that all texts ascribed to Ephrem in Greek are by others, but many are. Although Greek compositions are the main source of pseudepigraphal material, there are also works in  |Latin|Latin| ,  |Slavonic|Slavonic_Language|  and  |Arabic|Arabic_Language| . There has been very little critical examination of these works, and many are still treasured by some churches as authentic.     The best known of these writings is the  Prayer of Saint Ephrem , which is recited at every service during  |Great_Lent|Great_Lent|  and other fasting periods in  |Eastern_Christianity|Eastern_Christianity| .             Soon after Ephrems death, legendary accounts of his life began to circulate. One of the earlier modifications is the statement that Ephrems father was a pagan priest of Abnil or Abizal. However, internal evidence from his authentic writings suggest that he was raised by Christian parents.      The second legend attached to Ephrem is that he was a monk. In Ephrems day, monasticism was in its infancy in Egypt. He seems to have been a part of the  |members_of_the_covenant|Members_Of_The_Covenant| , a close-knit, urban community of Christians that had covenanted themselves to service and had  |refrained_from_sexual_activity|Sexual_Abstinence| . Some of the Syriac terms that Ephrem used to describe his community were later used to describe monastic communities, but the assertion that he was a monk is anachronistic. Later hagiographers often painted a picture of Ephrem as an extreme ascetic, but the internal evidence of his authentic writings show him to have had a very active role, both within his church community and through witness to those outside of it.     Ephrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in  |Eastern_Christianity|Eastern_Christianity| . In the  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  scheme of hagiography, Ephrem is counted as a Venerable Father . His  |feast_day|Feast_Day|  is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers , which is the Saturday before the beginning of  |Great_Lent|Great_Lent| .     Ephrem is popularly believed to have taken legendary journeys. In one of these he visits  |Basil_of_Caesarea|Basil_Of_Caesarea| . This links the Syrian Ephrem with the  |Cappadocian_Fathers|Cappadocian_Fathers|  and is an important theological bridge between the spiritual view of the two, who held much in common. Ephrem is also supposed to have visited  |Saint_Pishoy|Saint_Pishoy|  in the monasteries of  |Scetes|Scetes|  in  |Egypt|Egypt| . As with the legendary visit with Basil, this visit is a theological bridge between the origins of monasticism and its spread throughout the church.     On 5 October 1920, Pope  |Benedict_XV|Benedict_Xv|  proclaimed Ephrem a  |Doctor_of_the_Church|Doctor_Of_The_Church|  .  at Vatican.va This proclamation was made before critical editions of Ephrems authentic writings were available.     The most popular title for Ephrem is Harp of the Spirit . He is also referred to as the Deacon of Edessa, the Sun of the Syrians and a Pillar of the Church.  at newadvent.org     His Roman Catholic feast day of 9 June conforms to his date of death. For 48 years , it was on 18 June, and this date is still observed in the Extraordinary Form.     Ephrem is honored with a  |feast_day|Feast_Day|  on the  |liturgical_calendar_of_the_Episcopal_Church|Calendar_Of_Saints|  on June 10.
