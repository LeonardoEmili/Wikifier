                    Diana, Princess of Wales  was a member of the  |British_royal_family|British_Royal_Family| . She was the first wife of  |Charles,_Prince_of_Wales|Charles,_Prince_Of_Wales| , and the mother of  |Prince_William|Prince_William|  and  |Prince_Harry|Prince_Harry| . Dianas activism and glamour made her an international icon and earned her an enduring popularity as well as an unprecedented public scrutiny, exacerbated by her tumultuous private life.     Diana was born into the  |Spencer_family|Spencer_Family| , among the most prominent of the  |British_nobility|British_Nobility| , and grew up close to the royal family on their  |Sandringham_estate|Sandringham_Estate| . The youngest daughter of the  |8th_Earl_Spencer|John_Spencer,_8Th_Earl_Spencer|  and  |Frances_Shand_Kydd|Frances_Shand_Kydd| , she was strongly affected by their divorce in 1967. She did not distinguish herself academically, but was talented in music, dance, and sports. In 1978, she moved to London, where she lived with flatmates and took on various low-paying jobs.     Diana came to prominence in 1981 upon her engagement to Prince Charles, the eldest son of  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Queen_Elizabeth_Ii| , after a brief courtship.  |Their_wedding|Wedding_Of_Prince_Charles_And_Lady_Diana_Spencer|  took place at  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|St_Pauls_Cathedral|  in 1981 and made her  |Princess_of_Wales|Princess_Of_Wales| , a role in which she was enthusiastically received by the public. The couple had two sons, the princes William and Harry, who were then second and third in the  |line_of_succession_to_the_British_throne|Line_Of_Succession_To_The_British_Throne| . Dianas marriage to Charles, however, suffered due to their incompatibility and extramarital affairs. The couple separated in 1992, soon after the breakdown of their relationship became public knowledge. The details of their marital difficulties became increasingly publicised, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1996.     As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions across the  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realms| . She was celebrated in the media for her unconventional approach to charity work. Her patronages initially centered on children and youth but she later became known for her involvement with  |AIDS|Aids|  patients and campaign for the removal of landmines. She also raised awareness and advocated ways to help people affected with cancer and mental illness. As princess, Diana was initially noted for her shyness, but her charisma and friendliness endeared her to the public and helped her reputation survive the acrimonious collapse of her marriage. Considered to be very photogenic, she was a leader of fashion in the 1980s and 1990s. Media attention and public mourning were extensive after  |her_death_in_a_car_crash|Death_Of_Diana,_Princess_Of_Wales|  in a Paris tunnel in 1997 and subsequent  |televised_funeral|Funeral_Of_Diana,_Princess_Of_Wales| . Her legacy has had a deep impact on the royal family and British society.       Diana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, in Park House,  |Sandringham,_Norfolk|Sandringham,_Norfolk| . She was the fourth of five children of  |John_Spencer,_Viscount_Althorp|John_Spencer,_8Th_Earl_Spencer|  , and  |Frances_Spencer,_Viscountess_Althorp|Frances_Spencer,_Viscountess_Althorp|  . The  |Spencer_family|Spencer_Family|  has been closely allied with the  |British_royal_family|British_Royal_Family|  for several generations; Dianas grandmothers had served as  |ladies-in-waiting|Ladies-In-Waiting|  to  |Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother|Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother| . The Spencers were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her mother and after  |Lady_Diana_Spencer|Diana_Russell,_Duchess_Of_Bedford| , a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales.     On 30 August 1961,  Diana was baptised at  |St._Mary_Magdalene_Church,_Sandringham|St._Mary_Magdalene_Church,_Sandringham| . She grew up with three siblings:  |Sarah|Lady_Sarah_Mccorquodale| ,  |Jane|Jane_Fellowes,_Baroness_Fellowes| , and  |Charles|Charles_Spencer,_9Th_Earl_Spencer| . Her infant brother, John, died shortly after his birth one year before Diana was born. The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to  |Harley_Street|Harley_Street|  clinics in London to determine the cause of the problem . The experience was described as humiliating by Dianas younger brother, Charles: It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I dont think they ever got over it.  Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the  |Sandringham_estate|Sandringham_Estate| . The Spencers leased the house from its owner,  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Queen_Elizabeth_Ii| . The royal family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with the Queens sons  |Prince_Andrew|Prince_Andrew|  and  |Prince_Edward|Prince_Edward,_Earl_Of_Wessex| .     Diana was seven years old when her parents divorced. Her mother later began a relationship with  |Peter_Shand_Kydd|Peter_Shand_Kydd|  and married him in 1969. Diana lived with her mother in London during her parents separation in 1967, but during that years Christmas holidays, Lord Althorp refused to let Diana return to London with Lady Althorp. Shortly afterwards he won custody of Diana with support from his former mother-in-law,  |Ruth_Roche,_Baroness_Fermoy|Ruth_Roche,_Baroness_Fermoy| . In 1976, Lord Althorp married  |Raine,_Countess_of_Dartmouth|Raine,_Countess_Of_Dartmouth| . Dianas relationship with her stepmother was particularly bad.  She resented Raine, whom she called a bully , and on one occasion Diana pushed her down the stairs . She later described her childhood as very unhappy and very unstable, the whole thing .  Diana became known as Lady Diana after her father later inherited the title of  |Earl_Spencer|Earl_Spencer|  in 1975, at which point her father moved the entire family from Park House to  |Althorp|Althorp| , the Spencer seat in  |Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire| .       Diana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her  |governess|Governess| , Gertrude Allen. She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in  |Gayton,_Norfolk|Gayton,_Norfolk| , and moved to  |Riddlesworth_Hall_School|Riddlesworth_Hall_School| , an all-girls boarding school near  |Thetford|Thetford| , when she was nine. She joined her sisters at  |West_Heath_Girls_School|The_New_School_At_West_Heath|  in  |Sevenoaks|Sevenoaks| ,  |Kent|Kent| , in 1973. She did not shine academically, failing her  |O-levels|Gce_Ordinary_Level|  twice. Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath.  She left West Heath when she was sixteen. Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time. She showed a talent for music as an accomplished pianist. Diana also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and  |tap_dance|Tap_Dance| .     After attending  |Institut_Alpin_Videmanette|Institut_Alpin_Videmanette|   for one term, and leaving after the Easter term of 1978,  Diana returned to London, where she shared her mothers flat with two school friends. In London, she took an advanced cooking course, but seldom cooked for her roommates. She took a series of low-paying jobs; she worked as a dance instructor for youth until a skiing accident caused her to miss three months of work. She then found employment as a playgroup pre-school assistant, did some cleaning work for her sister Sarah and several of her friends, and acted as a hostess at parties. Diana spent time working as a nanny for the Robertsons, an American family living in London, and worked as a nursery teachers assistant at the Young England School in  |Pimlico|Pimlico| . In July 1979, her mother bought her a flat at Coleherne Court in  |Earls_Court|Earls_Court|  as an 18th birthday present. She lived there with three flatmates until 25 February 1981.       Lady Diana first met  |Charles,_Prince_of_Wales|Charles,_Prince_Of_Wales| , the Queens eldest son and  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent| , when she was 16 in November 1977. He was then dating her older sister, Lady Sarah.  They were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 when she watched him play  |polo|Polo|  and he took a serious interest in Diana as a potential bride. The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht  Britannia  for a sailing weekend to  |Cowes|Cowes| . This was followed by an invitation to  |Balmoral|Balmoral_Castle|  to meet his family one weekend in November 1980.   Lady Diana was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the  |Duke_of_Edinburgh|Prince_Philip,_Duke_Of_Edinburgh| . Prince Charles subsequently courted Diana in London. The Prince proposed on 6 February 1981, and Lady Diana accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for the next few weeks.               Their engagement became official on 24 February 1981.  Diana selected a large  |engagement_ring|Engagement_Ring_Of_Lady_Diana_Spencer|  that consisted of 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire set in 18-carat white gold, which was similar to her mothers engagement ring. The ring was made by the Crown jewellers  |Garrard|Garrard_&_Co| . In 2010, it became the engagement ring of  |Catherine,_Duchess_of_Cambridge|Catherine,_Duchess_Of_Cambridge| .  The Queen Mother gave Diana a sapphire and diamond brooch as an engagement present.      Following the engagement, Diana left her occupation as a kindergarten assistant and lived for a short period at  |Clarence_House|Clarence_House| , which was the home of the Queen Mother.  She then lived at Buckingham Palace until the wedding. Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since  |Anne_Hyde|Anne_Hyde|  over 300 years earlier, and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement. She made her first public appearance with Prince Charles in a charity ball in March 1981 at  |Goldsmiths_Hall|Worshipful_Company_Of_Goldsmiths| , where she met  |Grace_Kelly|Grace_Kelly| , who was the Princess of Monaco.     Twenty-year-old Diana became Princess of Wales when she married the Prince of Wales on 29 July 1981 at  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|St_Pauls_Cathedral| , which offered more seating than  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey| , a church that was generally used for royal nuptials. The service was widely described as a fairytale wedding and was watched by a global television audience of 750million people while 600,000 spectators lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the couple en route to the ceremony.  At the altar, Diana inadvertently reversed the order of Charless first two names, saying Philip Charles Arthur George instead. She did not say she would obey him; that traditional vow was left out at the couples request, which caused some comment at the time.  Diana  |wore_a_dress|Wedding_Dress_Of_Lady_Diana_Spencer|  valued at £9,000 with a 25-foot train.      After she became Princess of Wales, Diana automatically acquired rank as the third-highest female in the  |United_Kingdom_Order_of_Precedence|United_Kingdom_Order_Of_Precedence|  , and was fifth or sixth in the  |orders_of_precedence|Order_Of_Precedence|  of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant  |viceroy|Viceroy| , the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother, and the Prince of Wales. Within a few years of the wedding, the Queen extended Diana visible tokens of membership in the royal family; she lent the Princess the  |Cambridge_Lovers_Knot_Tiara|Elizabeth_Iis_Jewelscambridge_Lovers_Knot_Tiara| ,   and granted her the  |badge|Badge|  of the  |Royal_Family_Order_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II|Royal_Family_Order_Of_Queen_Elizabeth_Ii| .        The couple had residences at  |Kensington_Palace|Kensington_Palace|  and  |Highgrove_House|Highgrove_House| , near  |Tetbury|Tetbury| . On 5 November 1981, the Princesss pregnancy was officially announced. In January 1982—twelve weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, and the royal  |gynaecologist|Gynaecologist| |Sir_George_Pinker|George_Pinker|  was summoned from London. He found that although she had suffered severe bruising, the  |foetus|Foetus|  was uninjured.  Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling so inadequate .  In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying was published in the media. The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it the blackest day in the history of British journalism.  On 21 June 1982, the Princess gave birth to the couples first son,  |Prince_William|Prince_William| .  Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded. By her own admission, the Princess of Wales had not initially intended to take William until  |Malcolm_Fraser|Malcolm_Fraser| , the  |Australian_prime_minister|Australian_Prime_Minister| , made the suggestion.     A second son,  |Prince_Harry|Prince_Harry| , was born on 15 September 1984. The Princess said she and the Prince were closest during her pregnancy with Harry. She was aware their second child was a boy, but did not share the knowledge with anyone else, including the Prince of Wales.      Diana gave her sons wider experiences than was usual for royal children.   She rarely deferred to the Prince or to the royal family, and was often intransigent when it came to the children. She chose their first given names, dismissed a royal family nanny and engaged one of her own choosing, selected their schools and clothing, planned their outings, and took them to school herself as often as her schedule permitted. She also organised her public duties around their timetables.            Five years into the marriage, the couples incompatibility and age difference of almost 13 years became visible and damaging. Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend  |Camilla_Parker_Bowles|Camilla_Parker_Bowles| , and Diana later began an affair with Major  |James_Hewitt|James_Hewitt| , the familys former riding instructor. The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harrys father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this. Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair.  In 1989, Diana was at a birthday party for Camillas sister,  |Annabel_Elliot|Annabel_Elliot| , when she confronted Camilla about her and Charless extramarital affair.   These affairs were later exposed in May 1992 with the publication of  |Andrew_Mortons|Andrew_Morton|  book, Diana: Her True Story.   The book, which also revealed the Princesss allegedly suicidal unhappiness, caused a media storm. Morton later revealed that in 1991 he had also conducted a secret interview with Diana in which she had talked about her marital issues and difficulties.  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana and unsuccessfully tried to effect a reconciliation. Philip wrote to Diana and expressed his disappointment at the extramarital affairs of both her and Charles; he asked her to examine their behaviour from the others point of view. The Duke was direct and Diana was sensitive. She found the letters hard to take, but nevertheless, she appreciated that he was acting with good intent.     During 1992 and 1993, leaked tapes of telephone conversations reflected negatively on both the Prince and Princess of Wales. Tape recordings of the Princess and James Gilbey were made public in August 1992,  and transcripts were published the same month. The article,  |Squidgygate|Squidgygate|  , was followed in November 1992 by the leaked  |Camillagate|Camillagate|  tapes, intimate exchanges between the Prince and Camilla, published in the  |tabloids|Tabloid_Journalism| .  In December 1992, Prime Minister  |John_Major|John_Major|  announced the couples amicable separation to the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons| .     Between 1992 and 1993, Diana hired voice coach  |Peter_Settelen|Peter_Settelen|  to help her develop her public speaking voice.  In a videotape recorded by Settelen in 1992, Diana admitted that in 1984 through to 1986, she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.   It is thought she was referring to  |Barry_Mannakee|Barry_Mannakee| ,  who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate.  Diana said in the tape that Mannakee had been chucked out from his role as her bodyguard following suspicion that the two were having an affair.  |Penny_Junor|Penny_Junor|  suggested in her 1998 book that the Princess was in a romantic relationship with Mannakee.  Dianas friends dismissed the claim as absurd. However, in the subsequently released tapes Diana said she had feelings for that someone , saying I was quite happy to give all this up just to go off and live with him . She described him as the greatest friend ever had , though she denied any sexual relationship with him.  She also spoke bitterly of her husband saying that made me feel so inadequate in every possible way, that each time I came up for air he pushed me down again.  Charless aunt,  |Princess_Margaret|Princess_Margaret| , burned highly personal letters that Diana had written to the Queen Mother in 1993. Biographer  |William_Shawcross|William_Shawcross|  considered Margarets action to be understandable as she was protecting her mother and other members of the family , but regrettable from a historical viewpoint .      Although she blamed Camilla Parker Bowles for her marital troubles, Diana began to believe her husband had also been involved in other affairs. In October 1993, the Princess wrote to her butler  |Paul_Burrell|Paul_Burrell| , telling him that she believed her husband was now in love with his personal assistant  |Tiggy_Legge-Bourke|Tiggy_Legge-Bourke| —who was also his sons former nanny—and was planning to have her killed to make the path clear for him to marry Tiggy .   Legge-Bourke had been hired by the Prince as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care, and the Princess was resentful of Legge-Bourke and her relationship with the young princes.  Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with  |Jonathan_Dimbleby|Jonathan_Dimbleby|  on 29 June 1994. In the interview, he said he had rekindled his relationship with Camilla in 1986 only after his marriage to the Princess had irretrievably broken down .        In the same year, the  News of the World  claimed that Diana had made over 300 phone calls to the married art dealer  |Oliver_Hoare|Oliver_Hoare| .   These calls were proven to have been made both from her Kensington Palace apartment and from the phone box just outside the palace. According to Hoares obituary, there was little doubt she had been in a relationship with him.  However, the Princess denied any romantic relationship with Hoare, whom she described as a friend, and said that a young boy was the source of the nuisance calls made to Hoare.   She was also linked by the press to rugby union player  |Will_Carling|Will_Carling|    and private equity investor  |Theodore_J._Forstmann|Theodore_J._Forstmann| ,   yet these claims were neither confirmed nor proven.         Journalist  |Martin_Bashir|Martin_Bashir|  interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show  Panorama . The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. The Princess discussed her and her husbands extramarital affairs.  Referring to Charless relationship with Camilla, she said: Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded. She also expressed doubt about her husbands suitability for kingship.   Authors  |Tina_Brown|Tina_Brown| ,  |Sally_Bedell_Smith|Sally_Bedell_Smith|  and  |Sarah_Bradford|Sarah_Bradford|  support Dianas admission in the interview that she had suffered from  |depression|Major_Depressive_Disorder| ,  |rampant_bulimia|Bulimia_Nervosa|  and had engaged numerous times in the act of  |self_mutilation|Self_Mutilation| ; the shows transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems, including that she had hurt arms and legs .  The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had a  |borderline_personality_disorder|Borderline_Personality_Disorder| .      The interview proved to be the tipping point. On 20 December, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had sent letters to the Prince and Princess of Wales, advising them to divorce.   The Queens move was backed by the Prime Minister and by senior  |Privy_Counsellors|Privy_Council_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , and, according to the BBC, was decided after two weeks of talks.  Charles formally agreed to the divorce in a written statement soon after. In February 1996, the Princess announced her agreement after negotiations with the Prince and representatives of the Queen,  irritating Buckingham Palace by issuing her own announcement of the divorce agreement and its terms. In July 1996, the couple agreed on the terms of their divorce. This followed shortly after the Princesss accusation that the Princes personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke had aborted the Princes child, after which Legge-Bourke instructed her attorney  |Peter_Carter-Ruck|Peter_Carter-Ruck|  to demand an apology.   Dianas secretary Patrick Jephson resigned shortly before the story broke, later writing that the Princess had exulted in accusing Legge-Bourke of having had an abortion .       The divorce was finalised on 28 August 1996.  Diana received a lump sum settlement of £17million as well as £400,000 per year. The couple signed a confidentiality agreement that prohibited them from discussing the details of the divorce or of their married life. Days before,  |letters_patent|Letters_Patent|  were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style  |Her_Royal_Highness|Her_Royal_Highness|  and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she continued to be regarded as a member of the royal family and was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage.  The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style of Royal Highness after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: Dont worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am King.  Almost a year before, according to  |Tina_Brown|Tina_Brown| , the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: If you dont behave, my girl, well take your title away. She is said to have replied: My title is a lot older than yours, Philip.  Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after her mother told  Hello!  magazine that Diana was happy to lose the royal style. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Dianas death.  By contrast, Dianas relationship with her estranged stepmother reportedly improved in the years before her death in 1997.                Following her engagement to Prince Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at  |Goldsmiths_Hall|Goldsmiths_Hall| .   In October 1981, the Prince and Princess visited Wales.  Diana attended the  |State_Opening_of_Parliament|State_Opening_Of_Parliament|  for the first time on 4 November 1981.  Her first solo engagement was a visit to  |Regent_Street|Regent_Street|  on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights.  She attended the  |Trooping_the_Colour|Trooping_The_Colour|  for the first time in June 1982, making her appearance on the balcony of  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  afterwards. The Princess made her  |inaugural|Inaugural|  overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the state funeral of  |Grace,_Princess_of_Monaco|Grace,_Princess_Of_Monaco| . Also in 1982, Diana accompanied the Prince of Wales to the Netherlands and was created a Grand Cross of the  |Order_of_the_Crown|Order_Of_The_Crown|  by  |Queen_Beatrix|Queen_Beatrix| . In 1983, she accompanied the Prince on a tour of Australia and New Zealand with Prince William, where they met with representatives of the  |Māori_people|Māori_People| .

In her desire to play an encouraging role during the  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , the Princess of Wales visited Germany in December 1990 to meet with the families of soldiers. She subsequently travelled to Germany in January 1991 to visit  |RAF_Bruggen|Raf_Bruggen| , and later wrote an encouraging letter which was published in  Soldier ,  Navy News  and  RAF News . In 1991, the Prince and Princess of Wales visited  |Queens_University|Queens_University|  in  |Kingston,_Ontario|Kingston,_Ontario| , where they presented the university with a replica of their royal charter.  In September 1991, the Princess visited Pakistan on a solo trip, and went to Brazil with Charles.  During the Brazilian tour, Diana paid visits to organisations that battled homelessness among street children. Her final trips with Charles were to India and South Korea in 1992. She visited  |Mother_Teresas|Mother_Teresa|  hospice in  |Kolkata|Kolkata| , India, in 1992. The two women met each other again that year  and developed a personal relationship. It was also during the Indian tour that pictures of Diana alone in front of the  |Taj_Mahal|Taj_Mahal|  made headlines.       In December 1993, she announced that she would withdraw from public life, but in November 1994 she said she wished to make a partial return . In her capacity as the vice-president of  |British_Red_Cross|British_Red_Cross| , she was interested in playing an important role for its 125th anniversary celebrations.

The Princess visited many other countries, including Belgium, Nepal, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe, alongside numerous others. During her separation from Charles which lasted for almost four years, she participated in major national occasions as a senior member of the royal family, notably including the commemorations of the 50th anniversaries of  |Victory_in_Europe_Day|Victory_In_Europe_Day|  and  |Victory_over_Japan_Day|Victory_Over_Japan_Day|  in 1995. The Princesss 36th and final birthday celebration was held at  |Tate_Gallery|Tate_Gallery| , which was also a commemorative event for the gallerys 100th anniversary.       In 1983, she confided in the then- |Premier_of_Newfoundland|Premier_Of_Newfoundland| ,  |Brian_Peckford|Brian_Peckford| , I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it.  As Princess of Wales, she was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage. From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities. She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988  and 397 in 1991.  The Princess developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and  |leprosy|Leprosy| . In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other persons in the 20th century.        Dianas extensive charity work also included campaigning for  |animal_protection|Animal_Rights|  and fighting against the use of  |landmines|Landmine| .  She was the  |patroness|Patron|  of charities and organisations who worked with the homeless, youth, drug addicts, and the elderly. From 1989, she was president of  |Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital|Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital|  for Children. She was patron of the  |Natural_History_Museum|Natural_History_Museum,_London|   and president of the  |Royal_Academy_of_Music|Royal_Academy_Of_Music| . From 1984 to 1996, she was president of  |Barnardos|Barnardos| , a charity founded by Dr.  |Thomas_John_Barnardo|Thomas_John_Barnardo|  in 1866 to care for vulnerable children and young people.  In 1988, she became patron of the  |British_Red_Cross|British_Red_Cross|  and supported its organisations in other countries such as Australia and Canada. She made several lengthy visits each week to  |Royal_Brompton_Hospital|Royal_Brompton_Hospital| , where she worked to comfort seriously ill or dying patients. From 1991 to 1996, she was a patron of Headway, a brain injury association.  In 1992, she became the first patron of Chester Childbirth Appeal, a charity she had supported since 1984.  The charity, which is named after one of Dianas royal titles, could raise over £1 million with her help. In 1994, she helped her friend  |Julia_Samuel|Julia_Samuel|  launch the charity Child Bereavement UK which supports children of military families, those of suicide victims, terminally-ill parents, and became its patron.  Prince William later replaced his mother as the charitys royal patron.      Her patronages also included  |Landmine_Survivors_Network|Survivor_Corps| ,   |Help_the_Aged|Help_The_Aged| ,  the  |National_Hospital_for_Neurology_and_Neurosurgery|National_Hospital_For_Neurology_And_Neurosurgery| , the  |British_Lung_Foundation|British_Lung_Foundation| ,  |Eureka!|Eureka!|  , the  |National_Childrens_Orchestra|National_Childrens_Orchestra| ,  |British_Red_Cross|British_Red_Cross|  Youth,  the  |Guinness_Trust|Guinness_Trust| ,  |Meningitis_Trust|Meningitis_Trust| , the  |Malcolm_Sargent_Cancer_Fund_for_Children|Malcolm_Sargent| , the  |Royal_School_for_the_Blind|Seeability| ,  |Welsh_National_Opera|Welsh_National_Opera| , the  |Variety_Club_of_New_Zealand|Variety_Club| ,   |Birthright|Wellbeing_Of_Women| ,  the  |British_Deaf_Association|British_Deaf_Association|  ,   |All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club|All_England_Lawn_Tennis_And_Croquet_Club| ,  |Anglo-European_College_of_Chiropractic|Anglo-European_College_Of_Chiropractic| ,  |Royal_Anthropological_Institute_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland|Royal_Anthropological_Institute_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland| ,  |Royal_National_Orthopaedic_Hospital|Royal_National_Orthopaedic_Hospital| ,  |British_Sports_Association_for_the_Disabled|British_Sports_Association_For_The_Disabled| ,  |British_Youth_Opera|British_Youth_Opera| , Faculty of Dental Surgery of the  |Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England|Royal_College_Of_Surgeons_Of_England| ,  |London_City_Ballet|London_City_Ballet| ,  |London_Symphony_Orchestra|London_Symphony_Orchestra| ,  |Pre-School_Playgroups_Association|Pre-School_Playgroups_Association| , as well as president or patron of other charities.        In 1987, Diana was awarded the Honorary  |Freedom_of_the_City_of_London|Freedom_Of_The_City_Of_London| , the highest honour which is in the power of the City of London to bestow on someone.   In June 1995, the Princess travelled to Moscow. She paid a visit to a childrens hospital she had previously supported when she provided them with medical equipment. In Moscow, she received the International Leonardo Prize, which is given to the most distinguished patrons and people in the arts, medicine, and sports . In December 1995, Diana received the United Cerebral Palsy Humanitarian of the Year Award in New York City for her philanthropic efforts.    In October 1996, for her works on the elderly, the Princess was awarded a gold medal at a health care conference organised by the  |Pio_Manzù_Centre|Pio_Manzù_Centre|  in  |Rimini|Rimini| , Italy.      The day after her divorce, she announced her resignation from over 100 charities and retained patronages of only six:  |Centrepoint|Centrepoint| ,  |English_National_Ballet|English_National_Ballet| ,  |Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital|Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital| ,  |The_Leprosy_Mission|The_Leprosy_Mission| ,  |National_AIDS_Trust|National_Aids_Trust| , and the  |Royal_Marsden_Hospital|The_Royal_Marsden_Nhs_Foundation_Trust| .  , The Independent, 17 July 1996. She continued her work with the British Red Cross Anti-Personnel Land Mines Campaign, but was no longer listed as patron.       In May 1997, the Princess opened the Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts in Leicester, after being asked by her friend  |Richard_Attenborough|Richard_Attenborough| .  In June 1997, her dresses and suits were sold at Christies auction houses in London and New York, and the proceeds that were earned from these events were donated to charities. Her final official engagement was a visit to  |Northwick_Park_Hospital|Northwick_Park_Hospital| , London, on 21 July 1997.           The Princess began her work with AIDS victims in the 1980s.  In 1989, she opened  |Landmark_Aids_Centre|Landmark_Aids_Centre|  in South London.   She was not averse to making physical contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way.    Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition.   Diana noted: HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it. Whats more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys.   To Dianas disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in something more pleasant . In October 1990, Diana opened Grandmas House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C.  She was also a patron of the  |National_AIDS_Trust|National_Aids_Trust| . In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the  |Middlesex_Hospital|Middlesex_Hospital| , which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK.  As the patron of  |Turning_Point|Turning_Point| , a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992.  She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research.     In March 1997, Diana visited South Africa, where she met with President  |Nelson_Mandela|Nelson_Mandela| .   On 2 November 2002, Mandela announced that the  |Nelson_Mandela_Childrens_Fund|Nelson_Mandela_Childrens_Fund|  would be teaming up with the  |Diana,_Princess_of_Wales_Memorial_Fund|Diana,_Princess_Of_Wales_Memorial_Fund|  to help victims of AIDS.  They had planned the combination of the two charities a few months before her death. Mandela later praised Diana for her efforts surrounding the issue of HIV/AIDS: When she stroked the limbs of someone with leprosy or sat on the bed of a man with HIV/AIDS and held his hand, she transformed public attitudes and improved the life chances of such people .  Diana had used her celebrity status to fight stigma attached to people living with HIV/AIDS , Mandela said. In 2009, a panel including Sir  |Ian_McKellen|Ian_Mckellen|  and  |Alan_Hollinghurst|Alan_Hollinghurst|  chose Dianas portrait to be shown in the Gay Icons exhibition at the  |National_Portrait_Gallery,_London|National_Portrait_Gallery,_London| .  In October 2017, the  Attitude  magazine honoured Diana with its Legacy Award for her HIV/AIDS work. Prince Harry accepted the award on behalf of his mother.           Diana was the patron of  |HALO_Trust|Halo_Trust| , an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war.   In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and  |flak_jacket|Flak_Jacket|  were seen worldwide. During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a loose cannon by the  |Earl_Howe|Frederick_Curzon,_7Th_Earl_Howe| , an official in the  |British_Ministry_of_Defence|British_Ministry_Of_Defence| .  Despite the criticism, HALO states that Dianas efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them. In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the  |Royal_Geographical_Society|Royal_Geographical_Society| , and travelled to  |Washington,_D.C.|Washington,_D.C.|  to help promote the  |American_Red_Cross|American_Red_Cross|  landmines campaign. From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina|  with  |Jerry_White|Jerry_White|  and  |Ken_Rutherford|Ken_Rutherford|  of the  |Landmine_Survivors_Network|Landmine_Survivors_Network| .        Her work on the landmines issue has been described as influential in the signing of the  |Ottawa_Treaty|Ottawa_Treaty| , which created an international ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines.  Introducing the  |Second_Reading|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdomlegislative_Functions|  of the Landmines  |Bill|Bill|  1998 to the  |British_House_of_Commons|British_House_Of_Commons| , the  |Foreign_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_And_Commonwealth_Affairs| ,  |Robin_Cook|Robin_Cook| , paid tribute to Dianas work on landmines: All Honourable Members will be aware from their postbags of the immense contribution made by Diana, Princess of Wales to bringing home to many of our constituents the human costs of landmines. The best way in which to record our appreciation of her work, and the work of NGOs that have campaigned against landmines, is to pass the Bill, and to pave the way towards a global ban on landmines.    A few months after Dianas death in 1997, the  |International_Campaign_to_Ban_Landmines|International_Campaign_To_Ban_Landmines|  won the  |Nobel_Peace_Prize|Nobel_Peace_Prize| .        For her first solo official trip, Diana visited  |The_Royal_Marsden_NHS_Foundation_Trust|The_Royal_Marsden_Nhs_Foundation_Trust| , a cancer treatment hospital in London. She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York. The trusts communications manager said, The Princess had done much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy. Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989.    The Wolfson Childrens Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993. In February 1996, the Princess who had been informed about a  |newly_opened_cancer_hospital|Shaukat_Khanum_Memorial_Cancer_Hospital_&_Research_Centre|  built by  |Imran_Khan|Imran_Khan| , travelled to Pakistan to visit its childrens cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in  |Lahore|Lahore| .  She later visited the hospital again in May 1997.  In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event and raised more than £1 million for cancer research. In September 1996, after being asked by  |Katharine_Graham|Katharine_Graham| , the Princess went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research.  She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by  The Washington Post  at the same centre.      In 1988, the Princess of Wales opened Children with Leukaemia in memory of two young cancer victims.    In November 1987, a few days after the death of Jean OGorman from cancer, Diana met her family. The deaths of Jean and her brother affected the Princess, and she assisted their family to establish the charity. It was opened by her on 12 January 1988 at Mill Hill Secondary School, and she supported it until her death in 1997.       In November 1989, the Princess visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia.  Following her visit, she became patron of  |the_Leprosy_Mission|The_Leprosy_Mission| , an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease. She remained the patron of this charity and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997.  She famously touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact. It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed, she commented. The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability.     Diana was a long-standing and active supporter of  |Centrepoint|Centrepoint| , a charity which provides accommodation and support to homeless people, and became patron in 1992.   She supported organisations that battle poverty and homelessness. The Princess was a supporter of young homeless people and spoke out on behalf of them by saying that they deserve a decent start in life .  We, as a part of society, must ensure that young people – who are our future – are given the chance they deserve, she said. Diana used to take young William and Harry for private visits to Centrepoint services and homeless shelters.  The young people at Centrepoint were always really touched by her visits and by her genuine feelings for them, said one of the charitys staff members. Prince William later became the patron of this charity.        Diana was a staunch and longtime supporter of charities and organisations that focused on social and mental issues, including  |Relate|Relate|  and  |Turning_Point|Turning_Point| . Relate was relaunched in 1987 as a renewed version to its predecessor, the National Marriage Guidance Council. Diana became its patron in 1989. Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, was founded in 1964 to help and support those affected by drug and alcohol misuse and mental health problems. She became the charitys patron in 1987 and visited the charity on a regular basis, meeting the sufferers at its centres or institutions including Rampton and Broadmoor. In 1990 during a speech for Turning Point she said, It takes professionalism to convince a doubting public that it should accept back into its midst many of those diagnosed as psychotics, neurotics and other sufferers who Victorian communities decided should be kept out of sight in the safety of mental institutions. Despite the protocol problems of travelling to a Muslim country, she made a trip to Pakistan later that year in order to visit a rehabilitation centre in  |Lahore|Lahore|  as a sign of her commitment to working against drug abuse .       In 1993,  |Mirror_Group_Newspapers|Trinity_Mirror|  published photographs of the Princess that were taken by gym owner Bryce Taylor. The photos showed her exercising in the gym  |LA_Fitness|La_Fitness|  wearing a leotard and cycling shorts .   The Princesss lawyers immediately filed a criminal complaint that sought a permanent ban on the sale and publication of the photographs around the world. However, some newspapers outside the UK published the pictures. The courts granted an injunction against Taylor and MGN that prohibited further publication of the pictures . MGN later issued an apology after facing much criticism from the public. It is said that MGN gave the Princess £1 million as a payment for her legal costs and donated £200,000 to her charities. Taylor apologised as well and paid Diana £300,000, although it was alleged that a member of the royal family had helped him financially.          After her 1996 divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of  |Kensington_Palace|Kensington_Palace|  that she had shared with the Prince of Wales since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year. She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted to use the state apartments at St Jamess Palace .   Furthermore, she continued to have access to the jewellery that she had received during her marriage, and was allowed to use the  |air_transport_of_the_British_royal_family_and_government|Air_Transport_Of_The_British_Royal_Family_And_Government| . In a book published in 2003,  |Paul_Burrell|Paul_Burrell|  claimed the Princesss private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at  |Althorp|Althorp| , despite her request.     Diana dated the British-Pakistani heart surgeon  |Hasnat_Khan|Hasnat_Khan| , who was called the love of her life by many of her closest friends after her death,    and she is said to have described him as Mr Wonderful .     In May 1996, Diana visited Lahore upon invitation of  |Imran_Khan|Imran_Khan| , a relative of Hasnat Khan, and visited the latters family in secret.  Khan was intensely private and the relationship was conducted in secrecy, with Diana lying to members of the press who questioned her about it. Their relationship lasted almost two years with differing accounts of who ended it.   She is said to have spoken of her distress when he ended their relationship. However, according to Khans testimonial at the inquest for her death, it was Diana who ended their relationship in the summer of 1997.  Burrell also said the relationship was ended by the Princess in July 1997.  Burrell also claimed that Dianas mother, Frances Shand Kydd, disapproved of her daughters relationship with a Muslim man.      Within a month, Diana began a relationship with  |Dodi_Fayed|Dodi_Fayed| , the son of her summer host,  |Mohamed_Al-Fayed|Mohamed_Al-Fayed| .  That summer, Diana had considered taking her sons on a holiday to  |the_Hamptons|The_Hamptons|  on  |Long_Island,_New_York|Long_Island,_New_York| , but security officials had prevented it. After deciding against a trip to Thailand, she accepted Fayeds invitation to join his family in the south of France, where his compound and large security detail would not cause concern to the Royal Protection squad. Mohamed Al-Fayed bought the  Jonikal , a 60-metre multimillion-pound yacht on which to entertain Diana and her sons.               On 31 August 1997, Diana died in a car crash in the  |Pont_de_lAlma|Pont_De_Lalma|  tunnel in Paris while the driver was fleeing the  |paparazzi|Paparazzi| .  The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion  |Dodi_Fayed|Dodi_Fayed|  and the driver,  |Henri_Paul|Henri_Paul| , who was the acting security manager of the  |Hôtel_Ritz_Paris|Hôtel_Ritz_Paris| . Dianas bodyguard,  |Trevor_Rees-Jones|Trevor_Rees-Jones| , survived the crash. The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.10million, which was one of the United Kingdoms  |highest_viewing_figures_ever|List_Of_Most-Watched_Television_Broadcastsmost_Watched_Special_Events| . Millions more watched the event around the world.  . BBC. Retrieved 21 June 2015                 The sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public.    People left public offerings of flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months. Her coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Prince Charles and Dianas two sisters on 31 August 1997.   The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal,  |St_Jamess_Palace|St_Jamess_Palace| .          On 5 September, Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to her in a live television broadcast. Dianas funeral took place in Westminster Abbey on 6 September. Her sons walked in the funeral procession behind her coffin, along with her ex-husband the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, Dianas brother Lord Spencer, and representatives of some of her charities. Lord Spencer said of his sister, She proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic.  Re-written in tribute to Diana,  |Candle_in_the_Wind_1997|Candle_In_The_Wind_1997|  was performed by  |Elton_John|Elton_John|  at the funeral service . Released as a single in 1997, the global proceeds from the song have gone to Dianas charities.        The burial took place privately later the same day. Dianas former husband, sons, mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Dianas body was clothed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by  |Catherine_Walker|Catherine_Walker| , which she had chosen some weeks before. A set of  |rosary|Rosary|  beads that she had received from  |Mother_Teresa|Mother_Teresa|  was placed in her hands. Mother Teresa had died the same week as Diana. Dianas grave is on an island  within the grounds of  |Althorp|Althorp|  Park, the Spencer family home for centuries.      The burial party was provided by the 2nd Battalion  |The_Princess_of_Waless_Royal_Regiment|The_Princess_Of_Waless_Royal_Regiment| , who were given the honour of carrying the Princess across to the island and laying her to rest. Diana was the Regiments  |Colonel-in-Chief|Colonel-In-Chief|  from 1992 to 1996. The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby  |Great_Brington|Great_Brington| , but Lord Spencer said he was concerned about public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided Diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by William, Harry, and other Spencer relatives.           The initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Pauls  |intoxication|Driving_Under_The_Influence| , reckless driving, speeding , and effects of prescription drugs.  In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, owner of the Paris Ritz where Paul had worked, publicly said the crash had been planned  and accused  |MI6|Secret_Intelligence_Service|  and the Duke of Edinburgh.  An inquest that started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007–08  attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing  |paparazzi|Paparazzi| , who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel.  On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing . On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder rather than an accident; he said he did so for the sake of the Princesss children.          Following her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, netting £17 million after estate taxes , which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister, Lady Sarah.   The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have her sister Sarah replace him.  Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate. Each of them received £10 million upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively.  Many of Dianas possessions were initially left in the care of her brother who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to the princes. They were also put on display in American museums and  raised two million dollars for charities. Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings, jewels and two diamond tiaras. Dianas engagement ring was given to William, who later passed it to his wife,  |Catherine_Middleton|Catherine_Middleton| , while her wedding dress was given to Harry.      In addition to her will, Diana had also written a letter of wishes in which she had asked for three-fourths of her personal property to be given to her sons, and dividing the remaining one-fourth between her 17 godchildren. Despite Dianas wishes, the executors petitioned the probate court for a variance of the will , and the letter of wishes was ignored because it did not contain certain language required by British law . Eventually, one item from Dianas estate was given to each of her godchildren, while they would have received £100,000 each, had one-fourth of her estate been divided between them. The variance also prevented the estate from being distributed between her sons at the age of 25 but postponed it until they were 30. Diana also left her butler Paul Burrell around $80,000 in cash.       In 1999, after the submission of a  |Freedom_of_Information_Act|Freedom_Of_Information_Act|  request filed by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the  |National_Security_Agency|National_Security_Agency|  until her death, and the organisation kept a  |top_secret|Top_Secret|  file on her containing more than 1,000 pages.   The contents of Dianas NSA file cannot be disclosed because of  |national_security|National_Security|  concerns. The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a target of massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure. Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by  |Mohamed_Al-Fayed|Mohamed_Al-Fayed| —the NSA has refused to release the documents.     In 2008, Ken Wharfe, a former bodyguard of the Princess, claimed that her scandalous conversations with  |James_Gilbey|James_Gilbey|   were in fact recorded by the  |GCHQ|Gchq| , which intentionally released them on a loop .  People close to the Princess believed the action was intended to defame her. Wharfe said Diana herself believed that members of the royal family were all being monitored, though he also stated that the main reason of it could be due to the potential threats of the  |IRA|Irish_Republican_Army| .       The  |Diana,_Princess_of_Wales_Memorial_Fund|Diana,_Princess_Of_Wales_Memorial_Fund|  was established after her death and was granted intellectual property rights over her image.  In 1998, the fund sued the  |Franklin_Mint|Franklin_Mint| , accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates, and jewellery after having been refused a license to do so.   In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the right of publicity may be filed on behalf of a dead person, but only if that person is a Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit on behalf of the estate and, upon losing the case, was required to pay the Franklin Mints legal costs of £3million which, combined with other fees, caused the Memorial Fund to freeze its grants to charities. In 2003, the Franklin Mint counter-sued. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million to charitable causes on which both sides agreed.  In addition to this, the Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.          On the first anniversary of Dianas death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey.   The royal family and the Prime Minister and his family went to  |Crathie_Kirk|Crathie_Kirk|  for private prayers, while Dianas family held a private memorial service at Althorp.   All  |flags_at_Buckingham_Palace|Flags_At_Buckingham_Palace|  and other royal residences were flown at  |half-mast|Half-Mast|  on the Queens orders.  The  |Union_Jack|Union_Jack|  was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Dianas funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace even on the death of a monarch . Since 1997, however, the flag has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning.      The  |Concert_for_Diana|Concert_For_Diana|  at  |Wembley_Stadium|Wembley_Stadium|  was held on 1 July 2007. The event, organised by the Princes William and Harry, celebrated the 46th anniversary of their mothers birth and occurred a few weeks before the 10th anniversary of her death on 31 August.   The proceeds from this event were donated to Dianas charities.  On 31 August 2007, a memorial service for Diana took place in the  |Guards_Chapel|Guards_Chapel,_Wellington_Barracks| .  Guests included members of the royal family and their relatives, members of the Spencer family, members of Dianas wedding party, Dianas close friends and aides, representatives from many of her charities, British politicians  |Gordon_Brown|Gordon_Brown| ,  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair| , and  |John_Major|John_Major| , and friends from the entertainment world such as  |David_Frost|David_Frost| ,  |Elton_John|Elton_John| , and  |Cliff_Richard|Cliff_Richard| .

Some have said it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew that they were the source of her power, thus she had overburdened herself with public duties and destroyed the border between private and public life. Diana was famously criticised by philosophy professor Anthony OHear who, in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was self-indulgent in her philanthropic efforts. Following his remarks, charity organisations that were supported by her defended the Princess, and Peter Luff called OHears comments distasteful and inappropriate . Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in turn demeaned her royal office .

It was later sold to Juliens Auctions for over £80,000.     Diana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world.

Every look was right. She was gangsta with her clothes. She had these crazy hats. She got oversize jackets. I loved everything she wore!

She was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, it was something that really mattered to her, according to Anna Harvey , a former  |Vogue|Vogue|  editor and the Princesss fashion mentor. David Sassoon , one of the designers who worked with Diana, believed she had broken the rules trying new styles. Diana chose not to practice some of the royal clothing traditions such as putting aside the tradition of wearing gloves as she believed it would prevent a direct connection with the people she met, such as those affected by serious diseases like AIDS patients. She used to wear certain types of clothes at charity events which were appropriate for the people she would meet, such as wearing colourful dresses and jangling jewels so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who worked closely with the Princess alongside her brother, Dianas interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles. Versace also points out that think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what Diana did .     Catherine Walker was among Dianas favorite designers with whom she worked to create her royal uniform .

Eleri Lynn, curator of the exhibition Diana: Her Fashion Story, also believes that didnt want to be known as a clothes horse, and mentions that the style created together was a very slender, fluid silhouette which did away with the frills and ruffles of the early 80s and created a sleek silhouette that really flattered the princesss frame and became a timeless look for her.

Her habit of wearing wide-shouldered gowns and lavish fabrics earned her the nickname Dynasty Di . In the years after her marriage and then her divorce, Diana grew more confident in her choices, and her style underwent a change, with her new choices consisting of blazers, one-shoulder and off-shoulder dresses, two-tone themed suits, military-styled suits, and nude-colored outfits. White shirt and jeans, plaid dresses, jumpsuits and sheath dresses were among the other fashion trends she tried. Her way of dressing began to be influenced by other celebrities including Cindy Crawford , Madonna , Elizabeth Taylor , as well as many others.     The Princesss influential short hairstyle was created by Sam McKnight after a Vogue shoot in 1990, which, in McKnight and Donatella Versaces opinion, brought her more liberty as it always looked great . The Princess reportedly did her own make up and would always have a hairstylist by her side before an event. She told McKnight: Its not for me, Sam. It is for the people I visit or who come to see me. They dont want me in off-duty mode, they want a princess. Lets give them what they want.
