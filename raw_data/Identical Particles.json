Let n denote a complete set of quantum numbers for specifying single-particle states  For simplicity, consider a system composed of two particles that are not interacting with each other.

Two states are physically equivalent only if they differ by a complex phase factor. For two indistinguishable particles, a state before the particle exchange must be physically equivalent to the state after the exchange, so these two state differ only by a complex phase factor. This fact suggests that a state for two indistinguishable particles is given by following two possibilities:        : |n1  |n2    |n2  |n1      States where it is a sum are known as symmetric, while states involving the difference are called antisymmetric.
