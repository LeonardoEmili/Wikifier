   A proton is a  |subatomic_particle|Subatomic_Particle| , symbol  or , with a positive  |electric_charge|Electric_Charge|  of +1e  |elementary_charge|Elementary_Charge|  and a mass slightly less than that of a  |neutron|Neutron| . Protons and  |neutrons|Neutron| , each with masses of approximately one  |atomic_mass_unit|Atomic_Mass_Unit| , are collectively referred to as  |nucleons|Nucleon|  .     One or more protons are present in the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  of every  |atom|Atom| ; they are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  . Since each  |element|Chemical_Element|  has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number.     The word proton is Greek for first , and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford|  in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  nucleus could be extracted from the nuclei of  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a  |fundamental_particle|Fundamental_Particle| , and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.     Although protons were originally considered fundamental or  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle| , in the modern  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  of  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics| , protons are classified as  |hadrons|Hadron| , like  |neutrons|Neutron| , the other  |nucleon|Nucleon|  , composite particles composed of three  |valence_quarks|Valence_Quark| : two  |up_quarks|Up_Quark|  of charge +e and one  |down_quark|Down_Quark|  of charge –e. The  |rest_mass|Rest_Mass| es of quarks contribute only about 1% of a protons mass. The remainder of a protons mass is due to  |quantum_chromodynamics_binding_energy|Quantum_Chromodynamics_Binding_Energy| , which includes the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of the quarks and the energy of the  |gluon|Gluon|  fields that bind the quarks together. Because protons are not fundamental particles, they possess a measurable size; the root mean square  |charge_radius|Charge_Radius|  of a proton is about 0.84–0.87  |fm|Femtometre|  or  to . In 2019, two different studies, using different techniques, have found the radius of the proton to be 0.833 femtometers , with an uncertainty of ±0.010 femtometers.       At sufficiently low temperatures, free protons will bind to  |electrons|Electron| . However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the  |electron_cloud|Electron_Cloud|  of an atom. The result is a protonated atom, which is a  |chemical_compound|Chemical_Compound|  of hydrogen. In vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral  |hydrogen_atom|Hydrogen_Atom| , which is chemically a  |free_radical|Free_Radical| . Such free hydrogen atoms tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules , which are the most common molecular component of  |molecular_clouds|Molecular_Clouds|  in  |interstellar_space|Interstellar_Medium| .             Protons are  |spin-½|Spin-½| |fermions|Fermion|  and are composed of three valence quarks, making them  |baryons|Baryon|  . The two  |up_quarks|Up_Quark|  and one  |down_quark|Down_Quark|  of a proton are held together by the  |strong_force|Strong_Interaction| , mediated by  |gluons|Gluon| .  A modern perspective has a proton composed of the valence quarks , the gluons, and transitory pairs of  |sea_quarks|Sea_Quark| . Protons have a positive charge distribution which decays approximately exponentially, with a mean square  |radius|Radius|  of about 0.8 fm.     Protons and  |neutrons|Neutron|  are both  |nucleons|Nucleon| , which may be bound together by the  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force|  to form  |atomic_nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus| . The nucleus of the most common  |isotope|Isotope|  of the  |hydrogen_atom|Hydrogen_Atom|   is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes  |deuterium|Deuterium|  and  |tritium|Tritium|  contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons.       The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period. As early as 1815,  |William_Prout|William_Prout|  proposed that all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms , based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of  |atomic_weights|Atomic_Weight|  , which was disproved when more accurate values were measured.          In 1886,  |Eugen_Goldstein|Eugen_Goldstein|  discovered  |canal_rays|Canal_Rays|  and showed that they were positively charged particles produced from gases. However, since particles from different gases had different values of  |charge-to-mass_ratio|Charge-To-Mass_Ratio|  , they could not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative  |electrons|Electron|  discovered by  |J._J._Thomson|J._J._Thomson| .  |Wilhelm_Wien|Wilhelm_Wien|  in 1898 identified the hydrogen ion as particle with highest charge-to-mass ratio in ionized gases.     Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford|  in 1911,  |Antonius_van_den_Broek|Antonius_Van_Den_Broek|  proposed that the place of each element in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  is equal to its nuclear charge. This was confirmed experimentally by  |Henry_Moseley|Henry_Moseley|  in 1913 using  |X-ray_spectra|X-Ray_Spectroscopy| .     In 1917 , Rutherford proved that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery of protons. These experiments began after Rutherford had noticed that, when  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particles|  were shot into air , his scintillation detectors showed the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as a product. After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air and found that when alpha particles were introduced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. In 1919 Rutherford assumed that the alpha particle knocked a proton out of nitrogen, turning it into carbon. After observing Blacketts cloud chamber images in 1925, Rutherford realized that the opposite was the case: after capture of the alpha particle, a proton is ejected, so that heavy oxygen, not carbon, is the end result i.e. Z is not decremented but incremented. This was the first reported  |nuclear_reaction|Nuclear_Reaction| , 14 N + α → 17 O + p. Depending on ones perspective, either 1919 or 1925 may be regarded as the moment when the proton was discovered.     Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by  |Prouts_hypothesis|Prouts_Hypothesis|  that hydrogen was the building block of all elements. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in all other nuclei as an elementary particle led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus a special name as a particle, since he suspected that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He named this new fundamental building block of the nucleus the proton, after the neuter singular of the Greek word for first , πρῶτον. However, Rutherford also had in mind the word protyle as used by Prout. Rutherford spoke at the  |British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science|British_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Science|  at its  |Cardiff|Cardiff|  meeting beginning 24 August 1920. Rutherford was asked by  |Oliver_Lodge|Oliver_Lodge|  for a new name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom. He initially suggested both proton and prouton . Rutherford later reported that the meeting had accepted his suggestion that the hydrogen nucleus be named the proton , following Prouts word protyle . The first use of the word proton in the scientific literature appeared in 1920.     Recent research has shown that thunderstorms can produce protons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.     Protons are routinely used for accelerators for  |proton_therapy|Proton_Therapy|  or various  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  experiments, with the most powerful example being the  |Large_Hadron_Collider|Large_Hadron_Collider| .     In a July 2017 paper, researchers measured the mass of a proton to be  , which is lower than measurements from the  |CODATA_2014|Codata_2014|  value by three standard deviations.             The free proton is a stable particle that has not been observed to break down spontaneously to other particles. Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from electrons, for which they have some affinity. Free protons exist in  |plasmas|Plasma|  in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with  |electrons|Electron| . Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of  |cosmic_rays|Cosmic_Ray| , which propagate in vacuum for interstellar distances. Free protons are  |emitted_directly|Proton_Emission|  from  |atomic_nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus|  in some rare types of  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| . Protons also result  from the  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay|  of free neutrons, which are unstable.     The spontaneous decay of free protons has never been observed, and protons are therefore considered stable particles according to the Standard Model. However, some  |grand_unified_theories|Grand_Unified_Theory|  of particle physics predict that  |proton_decay|Proton_Decay|  should take place with lifetimes between 10 31 to 10 36 years and experimental searches have established lower bounds on the  |mean_lifetime|Mean_Lifetime|  of a proton for various assumed decay products.     Experiments at the  |Super-Kamiokande|Super-Kamiokande|  detector in Japan gave lower limits for proton  |mean_lifetime|Mean_Lifetime|  of  for decay to an  |antimuon|Antimuon|  and a neutral  |pion|Pion| , and  for decay to a  |positron|Positron|  and a neutral pion.   Another experiment at the  |Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory|Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory|  in Canada searched for  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray|  resulting from residual nuclei resulting from the decay of a proton from oxygen-16. This experiment was designed to detect decay to any product, and established a lower limit to a proton lifetime of .     However, protons are known to transform into  |neutrons|Neutron|  through the process of  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  . For free protons, this process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied. The equation is:     : +  →  +      The process is reversible; neutrons can convert back to protons through  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| , a common form of  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| . In fact, a  |free_neutron|Free_Neutron|  decays this way, with a  |mean_lifetime|Mean_Lifetime|  of about 15 minutes.       In  |quantum_chromodynamics|Quantum_Chromodynamics| , the modern theory of the nuclear force, most of the mass of protons and  |neutrons|Neutron|  is explained by  |special_relativity|Special_Relativity| . The mass of a proton is about 80–100 times greater than the sum of the rest masses of the  |quarks|Quark|  that make it up, while the  |gluons|Gluon|  have zero rest mass. The extra energy of the  |quarks|Quark|  and  |gluons|Gluon|  in a region within a proton, as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the  |QCD_vacuum|Qcd_Vacuum| , accounts for almost 99% of the mass. The rest mass of a proton is, thus, the  |invariant_mass|Invariant_Mass|  of the system of moving quarks and gluons that make up the particle, and, in such systems, even the energy of massless particles is  |still_measured|Mass-Energy_Equivalencefast-Moving_Objects_And_Systems_Of_Objects|  as part of the rest mass of the system.     Two terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up protons:  current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while  constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the  |gluon|Gluon| |particle_field|Quantum_Field_Theory|  surrounding the quark.   These masses typically have very different values. As noted, most of a protons mass comes from the gluons that bind the current quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy—to be more specific,  |quantum_chromodynamics_binding_energy|Quantum_Chromodynamics_Binding_Energy|  —and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of protons . A proton has a mass of approximately 938   |MeV/c_2|Electron_Voltas_A_Unit_Of_Mass| , of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks contributes only about 9.4  MeV/c 2 ; much of the remainder can be attributed to the gluons  |QCBE|Quantum_Chromodynamics_Binding_Energy| .     The constituent quark model wavefunction for the proton is   :  p        The internal dynamics of protons are complicated, because they are determined by the quarks exchanging gluons, and interacting with various vacuum condensates.  |Lattice_QCD|Lattice_Qcd|  provides a way of calculating the mass of a proton directly from the theory to any accuracy, in principle. The most recent calculations claim that the mass is determined to better than 4% accuracy, even to 1% accuracy . These claims are still controversial, because the calculations cannot yet be done with quarks as light as they are in the real world. This means that the predictions are found by a process of  |extrapolation|Extrapolation| , which can introduce systematic errors. It is hard to tell whether these errors are controlled properly, because the quantities that are compared to experiment are the masses of the  |hadrons|Hadron| , which are known in advance.     These recent calculations are performed by massive supercomputers, and, as noted by Boffi and Pasquini: a detailed description of the nucleon structure is still missing because ... long-distance behavior requires a nonperturbative and/or numerical treatment...   More conceptual approaches to the structure of protons are: the  |topological_soliton|Skyrmion|  approach originally due to  |Tony_Skyrme|Tony_Skyrme|  and the more accurate  |AdS/QCD_approach|Ads/Qcd|  that extends it to include a  |string_theory|String_Theory|  of gluons, various QCD-inspired models like the  |bag_model|Bag_Model|  and the  |constituent_quark|Constituent_Quark|  model, which were popular in the 1980s, and the  |SVZ_sum_rules|Svz_Sum_Rules| , which allow for rough approximate mass calculations. These methods do not have the same accuracy as the more brute-force lattice QCD methods, at least not yet.             The problem of defining a radius for an atomic nucleus is similar to the problem of  |atomic_radius|Atomic_Radius| , in that neither atoms nor their nuclei have definite boundaries. However, the nucleus can be modeled as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of  |electron_scattering|Electron_Scattering|  experiments: because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus, the electrons see a range of cross-sections, for which a mean can be taken. The qualification of rms  arises because it is the nuclear cross-section, proportional to the square of the radius, which is determining for electron scattering.     The internationally accepted value of a protons  |charge_radius|Charge_Radius|  is  . This value is based on measurements involving a proton and an electron , and studies of the atomic  |energy_levels|Energy_Level|  of hydrogen and deuterium.     However, in 2010 an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the  |Lamb_shift|Lamb_Shift|  in muonic hydrogen . As a muon is 200 times heavier than an electron, its  |de_Broglie_wavelength|De_Broglie_Wavelength|  is correspondingly shorter. This smaller  |atomic_orbital|Atomic_Orbital|  is much more sensitive to the protons charge radius, so allows more precise measurement. Their measurement of the  |root-mean-square|Root_Mean_Square|  charge radius of a proton is , which differs by 5.0  |standard_deviations|Standard_Deviation|  from the  |CODATA|Codata|  value of  . In January 2013, an updated value for the charge radius of a proton——was published. The precision was improved by 1.7 times, increasing the significance of the discrepancy to 7σ.   The 2014 CODATA adjustment slightly reduced the recommended value for the proton radius to , but this leaves the discrepancy at σ.     The international research team that obtained this result at the  |Paul_Scherrer_Institut|Paul_Scherrer_Institut|  in  |Villigen|Villigen|  includes scientists from the  |Max_Planck_Institute_of_Quantum_Optics|Max_Planck_Institute_Of_Quantum_Optics| ,  |Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität| , the  |Institut_für_Strahlwerkzeuge|Institut_Für_Strahlwerkzeuge|  of  |Universität_Stuttgart|Universität_Stuttgart| , and the  |University_of_Coimbra|University_Of_Coimbra| , Portugal. The team is now attempting to explain the discrepancy, and re-examining the results of both previous high-precision measurements and complex calculations involving  |scattering|Scattering| |cross_section|Cross_Section| . If no errors are found in the measurements or calculations, it could be necessary to re-examine the worlds most precise and best-tested fundamental theory:  |quantum_electrodynamics|Quantum_Electrodynamics| . The proton radius remains a puzzle as of 2017. Perhaps the discrepancy is due to new physics, or the explanation may be an ordinary physics effect that has been missed.     The radius is linked to the form factor and  |momentum_transfer_cross_section|Momentum_Transfer_Cross_Section| . The atomic form factor G modifies the cross section corresponding to point-like proton.     :     Re2 & -6       &   G2         The  |atomic_form_factor|Atomic_Form_Factor|  is related to the wave function density of the target:     : G   e   2   dr3     The form factor can be split in electric and magnetic form factors. These can be further written as linear combinations of Dirac and Pauli form factors.   :     Gm & FD + FP     Ge & FD -   FP       &             Since the proton is composed of quarks confined by gluons, an equivalent  |pressure|Pressure|  which acts on the quarks can be defined. This allows calculation of their distribution as a function of distance from the centre using  |Compton_scattering|Compton_Scattering|  of high-energy electrons . The pressure is maximum at the centre, about 10 35 Pa which is greater than the pressure inside a  |neutron_star|Neutron_Star| . It is positive to a radial distance of about 0.6 fm, negative at greater distances, and very weak beyond about 2 fm.       The radius of hydrated proton appears in the  |Born_equation|Born_Equation|  for calculating the hydration enthalpy of  |hydronium|Hydronium| .         Although protons have affinity for oppositely charged electrons, this is a relatively low-energy interaction and so free protons must lose sufficient velocity  in order to become closely associated and bound to electrons. High energy protons, in traversing ordinary matter, lose energy by collisions with  |atomic_nuclei|Atomic_Nuclei| , and by  |ionization|Ionization|  of atoms until they are slowed sufficiently to be captured by the  |electron_cloud|Electron_Cloud|  in a normal atom.     However, in such an association with an electron, the character of the bound proton is not changed, and it remains a proton. The attraction of low-energy free protons to any electrons present in normal matter causes free protons to stop and to form a new chemical bond with an atom. Such a bond happens at any sufficiently cold temperature and with any type of atom. Thus, in interaction with any type of normal matter, low-velocity free protons are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come in contact, causing the proton and molecule to combine. Such molecules are then said to be  |protonated|Protonated|  , and chemically they often, as a result, become so-called  |Brønsted_acids|Brønsted_Acid| .           In  |chemistry|Chemistry| , the number of protons in the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  of an atom is known as the  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number| , which determines the  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  to which the atom belongs. For example, the atomic number of  |chlorine|Chlorine|  is 17; this means that each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are chlorine atoms. The chemical properties of each atom are determined by the number of  |electrons|Electron| , which for neutral atoms is equal to the number of protons so that the total charge is zero. For example, a neutral chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons, whereas a Cl −  |anion|Anion|  has 17 protons and 18 electrons for a total charge of −1.     All atoms of a given element are not necessarily identical, however. The  |number_of_neutrons|Number_Of_Neutrons|  may vary to form different  |isotopes|Isotope| , and energy levels may differ, resulting in different  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer| . For example, there are two stable  |isotopes_of_chlorine|Isotopes_Of_Chlorine|  with 35 − 17 18 neutrons and  with 37 − 17 20 neutrons.                  In chemistry, the term proton refers to the hydrogen ion, . Since the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, a hydrogen ion has no electrons and corresponds to a bare nucleus, consisting of a proton . The proton is a bare charge with only about 1/64,000 of the radius of a hydrogen atom, and so is extremely reactive chemically. The free proton, thus, has an extremely short lifetime in chemical systems such as liquids and it reacts immediately with the  |electron_cloud|Electron_Cloud|  of any available molecule. In aqueous solution, it forms the  |hydronium_ion|Hydronium_Ion| , H 3 O + , which in turn is further  |solvated|Solvation|  by water molecules in  |clusters|Hydrogen_Ioncation|  such as + and + .     The transfer of  in an  |acid–base_reaction|Brønsted–Lowry_Acid–Base_Theory|  is usually referred to as proton transfer . The  |acid|Acid|  is referred to as a proton donor and the  |base|Base|  as a proton acceptor. Likewise,  |biochemical|Biochemistry|  terms such as  |proton_pump|Proton_Pump|  and  |proton_channel|Proton_Channel|  refer to the movement of hydrated  ions.     The ion produced by removing the electron from a  |deuterium|Deuterium|  atom is known as a deuteron, not a proton. Likewise, removing an electron from a  |tritium|Tritium|  atom produces a triton.       Also in chemistry, the term  |proton_NMR|Proton_Nmr|  refers to the observation of hydrogen-1 nuclei in  molecules by  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance| . This method uses the  |spin|Spin|  of the proton, which has the value one-half. The name refers to examination of protons as they occur in  |protium|Hydrogen-1|  in compounds, and does not imply that free protons exist in the compound being studied.               The  |Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Packages|Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package|  determined that more than 95% of the particles in the  |solar_wind|Solar_Wind|  are electrons and protons, in approximately equal numbers.          Protons also have extrasolar origin from galactic  |cosmic_rays|Cosmic_Ray| , where they make up about 90% of the total particle flux. These protons often have higher energy than solar wind protons, and their intensity is far more uniform and less variable than protons coming from the Sun, the production of which is heavily affected by  |solar_proton_events|Solar_Proton_Event|  such as  |coronal_mass_ejections|Coronal_Mass_Ejection| .     Research has been performed on the dose-rate effects of protons, as typically found in  |space_travel|Human_Spaceflight| , on human health. To be more specific, there are hopes to identify what specific chromosomes are damaged, and to define the damage, during  |cancer|Cancer|  development from proton exposure. Another study looks into determining the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including  |dopaminergic|Dopaminergic|  functioning,  |amphetamine|Amphetamine| -induced conditioned taste aversion learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the  |Morris_water_maze|Morris_Water_Maze| . Electrical charging of a spacecraft due to interplanetary proton bombardment has also been proposed for study. There are many more studies that pertain to space travel, including  |galactic_cosmic_rays|Galactic_Cosmic_Rays|  and their  |possible_health_effects|Health_Threat_From_Cosmic_Rays| , and  |solar_proton_event|Solar_Proton_Event|  exposure.     The  |American_Biostack_and_Soviet_Biorack|Sts-65Mission_Parameters|  space travel experiments have demonstrated the severity of molecular damage induced by heavy ions on  |microorganisms|Microorganism|  including  |Artemia|Artemia|  cysts.           |CPT-symmetry|Cpt-Symmetry|  puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and  |antiparticles|Antiparticle|  and, therefore, is open to stringent tests. For example, the charges of a proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero. This equality has been tested to one part in . The equality of their masses has also been tested to better than one part in . By holding antiprotons in a  |Penning_trap|Penning_Trap| , the equality of the charge-to-mass ratio of protons and antiprotons has been tested to one part in . The  |magnetic_moment|Magnetic_Moment|  of antiprotons has been measured with error of  nuclear  |Bohr_magneton|Bohr_Magneton|.
