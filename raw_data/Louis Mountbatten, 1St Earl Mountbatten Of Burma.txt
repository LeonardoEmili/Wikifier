|Admiral_of_the_Fleet|Admiral_Of_The_Fleet|  Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma , was a British  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  officer and statesman, an uncle of  |Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh|Prince_Philip,_Duke_Of_Edinburgh| , and second cousin once removed of  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Queen_Elizabeth_Ii| . During the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , he was  |Supreme_Allied_Commander|Supreme_Allied_Commander| ,  |South_East_Asia_Command|South_East_Asia_Command|  . He was the last  |Viceroy_of_India|Viceroy_Of_India|  and the first Governor-General of independent  |India|Dominion_Of_India|  .     From 1954 to 1959, Mountbatten was  |First_Sea_Lord|First_Sea_Lord| , a position that had been held by his father,  |Prince_Louis_of_Battenberg|Prince_Louis_Of_Battenberg| , some forty years earlier. Thereafter he served as  |Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff|Chief_Of_The_Defence_Staff|  until 1965, making him the longest-serving professional head of the British Armed Forces to date. During this period Mountbatten also served as  |Chairman_of_the_NATO_Military_Committee|Chairman_Of_The_Nato_Military_Committee|  for a year.     In 1979, Mountbatten, his grandson Nicholas, and two others were killed by a bomb set by members of the  |Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army|Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army| , hidden aboard his fishing boat in  |Mullaghmore,_County_Sligo|Mullaghmore,_County_Sligo| ,  |Ireland|Ireland| .          Mountbatten was known as  |His_Serene_Highness|His_Serene_Highness|  Prince Louis of  |Battenberg|Battenberg_Family|  from the time of his birth at  |Frogmore_House|Frogmore_House|  in the  |Home_Park|Home_Park,_Windsor| ,  |Windsor|Windsor,_Berkshire| ,  |Berkshire|Berkshire|  until 1917, when he and several other relations of  |King_George_V|King_George_V|  dropped their  |German|German_Empire| |styles_and_titles|Royal_And_Noble_Styles| . He was the youngest child and the second son of  |Prince_Louis_of_Battenberg|Prince_Louis_Of_Battenberg|  and his wife  |Princess_Victoria_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine|Princess_Victoria_Of_Hesse_And_By_Rhine| . His maternal grandparents were  |Louis_IV,_Grand_Duke_of_Hesse|Louis_Iv,_Grand_Duke_Of_Hesse| , and  |Princess_Alice_of_the_United_Kingdom|Princess_Alice_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , who was a daughter of  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria|  and  |Prince_Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha|Prince_Albert_Of_Saxe-Coburg_And_Gotha| . His paternal grandparents were  |Prince_Alexander_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine|Prince_Alexander_Of_Hesse_And_By_Rhine|  and  |Julia,_Princess_of_Battenberg|Julia,_Princess_Of_Battenberg| .      Mountbattens paternal grandparents marriage was  |morganatic|Morganatic|  because his grandmother was not of royal lineage; as a result, he and his father were styled Serene Highness rather than Grand Ducal Highness , were not eligible to be titled Princes of Hesse and were given the less exalted Battenberg title. His siblings were  |Princess_Alice_of_Battenberg|Princess_Alice_Of_Battenberg|  ,  |Queen_Louise_of_Sweden|Louise_Mountbatten| , and  |George_Mountbatten,_2nd_Marquess_of_Milford_Haven|George_Mountbatten,_2Nd_Marquess_Of_Milford_Haven| .     Young Mountbattens nickname among family and friends was Dickie , although Richard was not among his given names. This was because his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had suggested the nickname of Nicky , but to avoid confusion with the many Nickys of the Russian Imperial Family , Nicky was changed to Dickie .     He was baptised in the large drawing room of Frogmore House on 17 July 1900 by the  |Dean_of_Windsor|Dean_Of_Windsor| ,  |Philip_Eliot|Philip_Eliot| . His godparents were Queen Victoria, Nicholas II of Russia and  |Prince_Francis_Joseph_of_Battenberg|Prince_Francis_Joseph_Of_Battenberg|  .  He wore the original 1841  |royal_christening_gown|Royal_Christening_Gown|  at the ceremony.     Mountbatten was educated at home for the first 10 years of his life: he was then sent to  |Lockers_Park_School|Lockers_Park_School|  in  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire|  . and on to the  |Royal_Naval_College,_Osborne|Royal_Naval_College,_Osborne|  in May 1913. . His mothers younger sister was  |Russian|Russian_Empire|  Empress  |Alexandra_Feodorovna|Alexandra_Feodorovna| . In childhood he visited the Imperial Court of Russia at  |St_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg|  and became intimate with the doomed  |Russian_Imperial_Family|House_Of_Romanov| , harbouring romantic feelings towards his maternal first cousin  |Grand_Duchess_Maria_Nikolaevna|Grand_Duchess_Maria_Nikolaevna_Of_Russia| , whose photograph he kept at his bedside for the rest of his life. .         Mountbatten was posted as  |midshipman|Midshipman|  to the  |battlecruiser|Battlecruiser|   in July 1916 and, after seeing action in August 1916, transferred to the battleship  during the closing phases of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . In June 1917, when the royal family stopped using their German names and titles and adopted the more British-sounding Windsor ,  |Prince_Louis_of_Battenberg|Prince_Louis_Of_Battenberg|  became Louis Mountbatten, and was created  |Marquess_of_Milford_Haven|Marquess_Of_Milford_Haven| . His second son acquired the  |courtesy_title|Courtesy_Titles_In_The_United_Kingdom|  Lord Louis Mountbatten and was known as Lord Louis until he was created a peer in 1946. . He paid a visit of ten days to the Western Front, in July 1918. Ziegler 1986, p46        He was appointed  |executive_officer|Executive_Officer|  of the  |small_warship|P-Class_Sloop|  HMS  P.  31 on 13 October 1918 and was promoted  |sub-lieutenant|Sub-Lieutenant|  on 15 January 1919. HMS  P.  31 took part in the Peace River Pageant on 4 April 1919. Mountbatten attended  |Christs_College,_Cambridge|Christs_College,_Cambridge|  for two terms, starting in October 1919, where he studied English literature  in a programme that was specially designed for ex-servicemen. Heathcote 2002 p.  184 states that he studied engineering which does not tally with more detailed biographies Ziegler 1986, p  47–49 Smith 2010, p66 He was elected for a term to the Standing Committee of the  |Cambridge_Union_Society|Cambridge_Union_Society| , and was suspected of sympathy for the Labour Party, then emerging as a potential party of government for the first time. Ziegler 1985, p  49     He was posted to the battlecruiser  in March 1920 and accompanied  |Edward,_Prince_of_Wales|Edward_Viii| , on a royal tour of Australia in her. He was promoted  |lieutenant|Lieutenant|  on 15 April 1920.  HMS  Renown returned to Portsmouth on 11 October 1920. Ziegler 1986, p59 Early in 1921 Royal Navy personnel were used for civil defence duties as  |serious_industrial_unrest|Triple_Alliance_The_Post-War_Triple_Alliance|  seemed imminent. Mountbatten had to command a platoon of stokers, many of whom had never handled a rifle before, in northern England. He transferred to the battlecruiser  in March 1921 and accompanied the Prince of Wales on a Royal tour of India and Japan. Ziegler 1986, p.  60 states that he actually joined HMS Repulse on 25 June 1921 Edward and Mountbatten formed a close friendship during the trip. Mountbatten survived the deep defence cuts known as the  |Geddes_Axe|Geddes_Axe| . Fifty-two percent of the officers of his year had had to leave the Royal Navy by the end of 1923; although he was highly regarded by his superiors, it was rumoured that wealthy and well-connected officers were more likely to be retained. Ziegler 1986, p  73 He was posted to the battleship  in the  |Mediterranean_Fleet|Mediterranean_Fleet|  in January 1923.     Pursuing his interests in technological development and gadgetry, Mountbatten joined the Portsmouth Signals School in August 1924 and then went on briefly to study electronics at the  |Royal_Naval_College,_Greenwich|Royal_Naval_College,_Greenwich| . Mountbatten became a Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , now the Institution of Engineering and Technology , which annually awards the Mountbatten Medal for an outstanding contribution, or contributions over a period, to the promotion of electronics or information technology and their application.  He was posted to the battleship  in the  |Reserve_Fleet|Reserve_Fleet|  in 1926 and became Assistant Fleet Wireless and Signals Officer of the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Admiral  |Sir_Roger_Keyes|Roger_Keyes,_1St_Baron_Keyes|  in January 1927. Promoted  |lieutenant-commander|Lieutenant-Commander|  on 15 April 1928,  he returned to the Signals School in July 1929 as Senior Wireless Instructor. He was appointed Fleet Wireless Officer to the  |Mediterranean_Fleet|Mediterranean_Fleet|  in August 1931, and having been promoted  |commander|Commander|  on 31 December 1932,  was posted to the battleship .     In 1934, Mountbatten was appointed to his first command – the destroyer . His ship was a new destroyer, which he was to sail to  |Singapore|Singapore|  and exchange for an older ship, . He successfully brought Wishart back to port in  |Malta|Malta|  and then attended the funeral of  |King_George_V|King_George_V|  in January 1936.  Mountbatten was appointed a Personal Naval  |Aide-de-Camp|Aide-De-Camp|  to  |King_Edward_VIII|King_Edward_Viii|  on 23 June 1936,  and, having joined the Naval Air Division of the  |Admiralty|Admiralty|  in July 1936,  he attended the  |coronation_of_King_George_VI_and_Queen_Elizabeth|Coronation_Of_King_George_Vi_And_Queen_Elizabeth|  in May 1937.  He was promoted  |captain|Captain|  on 30 June 1937  and was then given command of the destroyer  in June 1939. .     In July 1939, Mountbatten was granted a patent for a system for maintaining a warship in a fixed position relative to another ship.           When war broke out in September 1939, Mountbatten became Captain of the  |5th_Destroyer_Flotilla|5Th_Destroyer_Flotilla|  aboard HMS Kelly, which became famous for its exploits. In late 1939 he brought  |the_Duke_of_Windsor|Edward_Viii|  back from exile in France and in early May 1940, Mountbatten led a British convoy in through the fog to evacuate the Allied forces participating in the  |Namsos_Campaign|Namsos_Campaign|  during the  |Norwegian_Campaign|Norwegian_Campaign| .     On the night of 9–10 May 1940, Kelly was torpedoed amidships by a German  |E-boat|E-Boat|  S  31 off the Dutch coast, and Mountbatten thereafter commanded the 5th Destroyer Flotilla from the destroyer . On 29 November 1940 the 5th Flotilla engaged three German destroyers off the Lizard. Mountbatten turned to port to match a German course change. This was a rather disastrous move as the  |directors|Director_For_Warships|  swung off and lost target. March, p. 353 It also resulted in Javelin being struck by two torpedoes. He rejoined Kelly in December 1940, by which time the torpedo damage had been repaired.     Kelly was sunk by German  |dive_bombers|Dive_Bomber|  on 23 May 1941 during the  |Battle_of_Crete|Battle_Of_Crete| ; . the incident serving as the basis for  |Noël_Cowards|Noël_Coward|  film  In Which We Serve . . Coward was a personal friend of Mountbatten and copied some of his speeches into the film. Mountbatten was  |mentioned_in_despatches|Mentioned_In_Despatches|  on 9 August 1940  and 21 March 1941  and awarded the  |Distinguished_Service_Order|Distinguished_Service_Order|  in January 1941.          In August 1941, Mountbatten was appointed captain of the  |aircraft_carrier|Aircraft_Carrier|   which lay in  |Norfolk,_Virginia|Norfolk,_Virginia| , for repairs following  |action|Operation_Pedestal|  at  |Malta|Malta|  in the Mediterranean in January. During this period of relative inactivity, he paid a flying visit to  |Pearl_Harbor|Pearl_Harbor| , three months before the  |Japanese_attack|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor|  on the US naval base there. Mountbatten, appalled at the bases lack of preparedness, drawing on Japans history of launching wars with surprise attacks as well as the successful British surprise attack at the  |Battle_of_Taranto|Battle_Of_Taranto|  which had effectively knocked Italys fleet out of the war, and the sheer effectiveness of aircraft against warships, accurately predicted that the US entry into the war would begin with a Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.      Mountbatten was a favourite of  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| .  On 27 October 1941 Mountbatten replaced  |Roger_Keyes|Roger_Keyes,_1St_Baron_Keyes|  as Chief of  |Combined_Operations|Combined_Operations_Headquarters|  and was promoted to  |commodore|Commodore| .          His duties in this role included inventing new technical aids to assist with opposed landings. Noteworthy technical achievements of Mountbatten and his staff include the construction of PLUTO , an  |underwater_oil_pipeline_from_the_English_coast_to_Normandy|Operation_Pluto| , an artificial harbour  |constructed_of_concrete_caissons_and_sunken_ships|Mulberry_Harbour| , and the development of amphibious  |tank-landing_ships|Landing_Ship,_Tank| . Another project that Mountbatten proposed to Churchill was  |Project_Habakkuk|Project_Habakkuk| . It was to be a massive and impregnable 600-metre aircraft carrier made from reinforced ice    As commander of Combined Operations, Mountbatten and his staff planned the highly successful  |Bruneval_raid|Operation_Biting| , which gained important information and also captured part of a German Würzburg radar installation and one of the machines technicians on 27 February 1942. It was Mountbatten who recognised that surprise and speed were essential to ensure the radar was captured, and saw that an airborne assault was the only viable method.     In March 1942, he was promoted to the  |acting_rank|Acting_Rank|  of  |vice_admiral|Vice_Admiral|  and given the  |honorary_ranks|Honorary_Rank|  of  |lieutenant_general|Lieutenant-General|  and  |air_marshal|Air_Marshal|  in order to have the required authority to carryout his duties in Combined Operations; and was placed in the  |Chiefs_of_Staff_Committee|Chiefs_Of_Staff_Committee| .  He was in large part responsible for the planning and organisation of  |The_Raid_at_St._Nazaire|St_Nazaire_Raid|  in mid-1942, an operation which put out of action one of the most heavily defended docks in Nazi-occupied France until well after wars end, the ramifications of which contributed to allied supremacy in the  |Battle_of_the_Atlantic|Battle_Of_The_Atlantic| . After these two successes came the  |Dieppe_Raid|Dieppe_Raid|  of 19 August 1942. He was central in the planning and promotion of the raid on the port of Dieppe. The raid was a marked failure, with casualties of almost 60%, the great majority of them Canadians. Following the Dieppe raid Mountbatten became a controversial figure in Canada, with the  |Royal_Canadian_Legion|Royal_Canadian_Legion|  distancing itself from him during his visits there during his later career. . His relations with Canadian veterans, who blamed him for the losses, remained frosty after the war.         Mountbatten claimed that the lessons learned from the Dieppe Raid were necessary for planning the Normandy invasion on  |D-Day|D-Day|  nearly two years later. However, military historians such as former Royal Marine  |Julian_Thompson|Julian_Thompson|  have written that these lessons should not have needed a debacle such as Dieppe to be recognised. . Nevertheless, as a direct result of the failings of the Dieppe raid, the British made several innovations, most notably  |Hobarts_Funnies|Hobarts_Funnies|  – specialised armoured vehicles which, in the course of the  |Normandy_Landings|Normandy_Landings| , undoubtedly saved many lives on those three beachheads upon which Commonwealth soldiers were landing .           In August 1943, Churchill appointed Mountbatten the Supreme Allied Commander  |South_East_Asia_Command|South_East_Asia_Command|  with promotion to acting full  |admiral|Admiral| . His less practical ideas were sidelined by an experienced planning staff led by Lieutenant-Colonel  |James_Allason|James_Allason| , though some, such as a proposal to launch an amphibious assault near  |Rangoon|Rangoon| , got as far as Churchill before being quashed.      British interpreter  |Hugh_Lunghi|Hugh_Lunghi|  recounted an embarrassing episode which occurred during the  |Potsdam_Conference|Potsdam_Conference| , when Mountbatten, desiring to receive an invitation to visit the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , repeatedly attempted to impress  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  with his former connections to the  |Russian_imperial_family|House_Of_Romanov| . The attempt fell predictably flat, with Stalin dryly inquiring whether it was some time ago that he had been there . Says Lunghi, The meeting was embarrassing because Stalin was so unimpressed. He offered no invitation. Mountbatten left with his tail between his legs. .     During his time as Supreme Allied Commander of the Southeast Asia Theatre, his command oversaw the  |recapture_of_Burma|Burma_Campaign_1944–45|  from the Japanese by General  |William_Slim|William_Slim| .  A personal high point was the receipt of the Japanese surrender in  |Singapore|Singapore|  when British troops returned to the island to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region led by General  |Itagaki_Seishiro|Itagaki_Seishiro|  on 12 September 1945, codenamed  |Operation_Tiderace|Operation_Tiderace| . . South East Asia Command was disbanded in May 1946 and Mountbatten returned home with the substantive rank of  |rear-admiral|Rear-Admiral| . . That year, he was made a  |Knight_of_the_Garter|Knight_Of_The_Garter|  and created Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, of Romsey in the County of Southampton as a  |victory_title|Victory_Titlebritish_Empire|  for war service.      Following the war, Mountbatten was known to have largely shunned the Japanese for the rest of his life out of respect for his men killed during the war, and as per his will, Japan was not invited to send diplomatic representatives to his funeral in 1979, though he did meet Emperor  |Hirohito|Hirohito|  during a state visit to Britain in 1971, reportedly at the urging of the Queen.        His experience in the region and in particular his perceived  |Labour|Labour_Party|  sympathies at that time led to  |Clement_Attlee|Clement_Attlee|  appointing him  |Viceroy_of_India|Viceroy_Of_India|  on 20 February 1947 .  charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948. Mountbattens instructions were to avoid partition and preserve a united India as a result of the transference of power but authorised him to adapt to a changing situation in order to get Britain out promptly with minimal reputational damage. .  Soon after he arrived, Mountbatten concluded that the situation was too volatile to wait even a year before granting independence to India. Although his advisers favoured a gradual transfer of independence, Mountbatten decided the only way forward was a quick and orderly transfer of independence before 1947 was out. In his view, any longer would mean civil war. . The Viceroy also hurried so he could return to his senior technical Navy courses.  .        Mountbatten was fond of  |Congress|Indian_National_Congress|  leader  |Jawaharlal_Nehru|Jawaharlal_Nehru|  and his liberal outlook for the country. He felt differently about the Muslim leader  |Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah|Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah| , but was aware of his power, stating If it could be said that any single man held the future of India in the palm of his hand in 1947, that man was Mohammad Ali Jinnah. During his meeting with Jinnah on 5 April 1947, . Mountbatten tried to persuade Jinnah of a united India, citing the difficult task of dividing the mixed states of  |Punjab|Punjab_Region|  and  |Bengal|Bengal| , but the Muslim leader was unyielding in his goal of establishing a separate Muslim state called  |Pakistan|Pakistan| .      Given the British governments recommendations to grant independence quickly, Mountbatten concluded that a united India was an unachievable goal and resigned himself to a plan for partition, creating the independent nations of India and Pakistan. Mountbatten set a date for the transfer of power from the British to the Indians, arguing that a fixed timeline would convince Indians of his and the British governments sincerity in working towards a swift and efficient independence, excluding all possibilities of stalling the process. .     Among the Indian leaders,  |Mahatma_Gandhi|Mahatma_Gandhi|  emphatically insisted on maintaining a united India and for a while successfully rallied people to this goal. During his meeting with Mountbatten, Gandhi asked Mountbatten to invite Jinnah to form a new Central government, but Mountbatten never uttered a word of Gandhis ideas to Jinnah. . And when Mountbattens timeline offered the prospect of attaining independence soon, sentiments took a different turn. Given Mountbattens determination, Nehru and Patels inability to deal with the Muslim League and lastly Jinnahs obstinacy, all Indian party leaders acquiesced to Jinnahs plan to divide India, . which in turn eased Mountbattens task. Mountbatten also developed a strong relationship with the Indian princes, who ruled those portions of India not directly under British rule. His intervention was decisive in persuading the vast majority of them to see advantages in opting to join the Indian Union.  On one hand, the integration of the princely states can be viewed as one of the positive aspects of his legacy. . But on the other, the refusal of  |Hyderabad|Hyderabad_State| ,  |Jammu_and_Kashmir|Jammu_And_Kashmir| , and  |Junagadh|Junagadh_State|  to join one of the dominions led to future tension between Pakistan and India. .     Mountbatten brought forward the date of the partition from June 1948 to 15 August 1947. . The uncertainty of the borders caused Muslims and Hindus to move into the direction where they felt they would get the majority. Hindus and Muslims were thoroughly terrified, and the Muslim movement from the East was balanced by the similar movement of Hindus from the West. . A boundary committee chaired by  |Sir_Cyril_Radcliffe|Cyril_Radcliffe,_1St_Viscount_Radcliffe|  was charged with drawing boundaries for the new nations. With a mandate to leave as many Hindus and Sikhs in India and as many Muslims in Pakistan as possible, Radcliffe came up with a map that split the two countries along the Punjab and Bengal borders. This left 14  million people on the wrong side of the border, and very many of them fled to safety on the other side when the new lines were announced.        When India and Pakistan attained independence at midnight on the night of 14–15 August 1947, Mountbatten remained in  |New_Delhi|New_Delhi|  for 10  months, serving as Indias first governor general until June 1948. . On Mountbattens advice, India took the issue of Kashmir to the newly formed United Nations in January 1948. The issue of Kashmir would become a lasting thorn in his legacy, one that is not resolved to this day. . Accounts differ on the future Mountbatten desired for Kashmir. Pakistani accounts suggest that Mountbatten favored the accession of Kashmir to India citing his close relationship to Nehru. Mountbattens own account says that he simply wanted the maharaja  |Hari_Singh|Hari_Singh|  to make up his mind. The viceroy made several attempts to mediate between the Congress leaders, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Hari Singh on issues relating to the accession of Kashmir though he was largely unsuccessful in resolving the conflict. . After the tribal invasion of Kashmir, it was on his suggestion that India moved to secure the accession of Kashmir from Hari Singh before sending in military forces for his defence. .     Notwithstanding the self-promotion of his own part in Indian independence  – notably in the television series The Life and Times of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten of Burma, produced by his son-in-law  |Lord_Brabourne|John_Knatchbull,_7Th_&_Nbsp;Baron_Brabourne| , and  Freedom at Midnight  by  |Dominique_Lapierre|Dominique_Lapierre|  and  |Larry_Collins|Larry_Collins|   – his record is seen as very mixed; one common view is that he hastened the independence process unduly and recklessly, foreseeing vast disruption and loss of life and not wanting this to occur on the British watch, but thereby actually helping it to occur, especially in Punjab and Bengal. See, e.g., .  |John_Kenneth_Galbraith|John_Kenneth_Galbraith| , the Canadian-American  |Harvard_University|Harvard_University|  economist, who advised governments of India during the 1950s, an intimate of Nehru who served as the American ambassador from 1961 to 1963, was a particularly harsh critic of Mountbatten in this regard.      The creation of  |Pakistan|Pakistan|  was never emotionally accepted by many British leaders, among them Mountbatten.  Mountbatten clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the  |Muslim_Leagues|All-India_Muslim_League|  idea of  |Pakistan|Pakistan| .   |Jinnah|Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah|  refused Mountbattens offer to serve as  |Governor-General_of_Pakistan|Governor-General_Of_Pakistan| .  When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| , he replied, Most probably.                After India, Mountbatten served as commander of the  |1st_Cruiser_Squadron|1St_Cruiser_Squadron|  in the  |Mediterranean_Fleet|Mediterranean_Fleet|  and, having been granted the substantive rank of  |vice-admiral|Vice_Admiral|  on 22 June 1949,  he became Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1950. He became  |Fourth_Sea_Lord|Fourth_Sea_Lord|  at the Admiralty in June 1950. He then returned to the Mediterranean to serve as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and  |NATO|Nato|  Commander  |Allied_Forces_Mediterranean|Allied_Forces_Mediterranean|  from June 1952. He was promoted to the substantive rank of full admiral on 27 February 1953.  In March 1953, he was appointed Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Queen.      Mountbatten served his final posting at the Admiralty as  |First_Sea_Lord|First_Sea_Lord|  and Chief of the Naval Staff from April 1955 to July 1959, the position which his father had held some forty years prior. This was the first time in Royal Naval history that a father and son had both attained such high rank.  He was promoted to  |Admiral_of_the_Fleet|Admiral_Of_The_Fleet|  on 22 October 1956.      While serving as First Sea Lord, his primary concerns dealt with devising plans on how the Royal Navy would keep shipping lanes open if Britain fell victim to a nuclear attack. Today, this seems of minor importance but at the time few people comprehended the potentially limitless destruction nuclear weapons possess and the ongoing dangers posed by the  |fallout|Nuclear_Fallout| . Military commanders did not understand the physics involved in a nuclear explosion. This became evident when Mountbatten had to be reassured that the fission reactions from the  |Bikini_Atoll_tests|Bikini_Atoll_Tests|  would not spread through the oceans and blow up the planet.  As Mountbatten became more familiar with this new form of weaponry, he increasingly grew opposed to its use in combat yet at the same time he realised the potential nuclear energy had, especially with regards to submarines. Mountbatten expressed his feelings towards the use of nuclear weapons in combat in his article A Military Commander Surveys The Nuclear Arms Race , which was published shortly after his death in International Security in the Winter of 1979–1980.      After leaving the Admiralty, Lord Mountbatten took the position of  |Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff|Chief_Of_The_Defence_Staff| . He served in this post for six years during which he was able to consolidate the three service departments of the military branch into a single  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence| . .  |Ian_Jacob|Ian_Jacob| , co-author of the 1963 Report on the Central Organisation of Defence that served as the basis of these reforms, described Mountbatten as universally mistrusted in spite of his great qualities . On their  |election_in_October_1964|1964_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , the  |Wilson_ministry|Labour_Government,_1964-1970|  had to decide whether to renew his appointment the following July. The  |Defence_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Defence| ,  |Denis_Healey|Denis_Healey| , interviewed the forty most senior officials in the  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence| ; only one,  |Sir_Kenneth_Strong|Kenneth_Strong| , a personal friend of Mountbatten, recommended his reappointment. When I told Dickie of my decision not to reappoint him, recalls Healey, he slapped his thigh and roared with delight; but his eyes told a different story.     Mountbatten was appointed  |colonel|Colonel_Of_The_Regiment|  of the  |Life_Guards|Life_Guards|  and  |Gold_Stick_in_Waiting|Gold_Stick_In_Waiting|  on 29 January 1965,  and Life Colonel Commandant of the  |Royal_Marines|Royal_Marines|  the same year.  He was  |Governor_of_the_Isle_of_Wight|List_Of_Governors_Of_The_Isle_Of_Wight|  from 20 July 1965  and then the first  |Lord_Lieutenant|Lord_Lieutenant|  of the  |Isle_of_Wight|Isle_Of_Wight|  from 1 April 1974.         Mountbatten was elected a  |Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society|Fellow_Of_The_Royal_Society|  and had received an  |honorary_doctorate|Honorary_Doctorate|  from  |Heriot-Watt_University|Heriot-Watt_University|  in 1968.      In 1969, Mountbatten tried unsuccessfully to persuade his cousin, the Spanish pretender  |Infante_Juan,_Count_of_Barcelona|Infante_Juan,_Count_Of_Barcelona| , to ease the eventual accession of his son,  |Juan_Carlos|Juan_Carlos| , to the Spanish throne by signing a declaration of abdication while in exile. . The next year Mountbatten attended an official White House dinner during which he took the opportunity to have a 20-minute conversation with  |Richard_Nixon|Richard_Nixon|  and Secretary of State  |William_P._Rogers|William_P._Rogers| , about which he later wrote, I was able to talk to the President a bit about both Tino and Juanito to try and put over their respective points of view about Greece and Spain, and how I felt the US could help them. In January 1971, Nixon hosted Juan Carlos and his wife  |Sofia|Queen_Sofia_Of_Spain|  during a visit to Washington and later that year  The Washington Post  published an article alleging that Nixons administration was seeking to persuade Franco to retire in favour of the young Bourbon prince.     From 1967 until 1978, Mountbatten was president of the  |United_World_Colleges|United_World_Colleges|  Organisation, then represented by a single college: that of  |Atlantic_College|Atlantic_College|  in South Wales. Mountbatten supported the United World Colleges and encouraged heads of state, politicians and personalities throughout the world to share his interest. Under Mountbattens presidency and personal involvement, the United World College of South East Asia was established in  |Singapore|Singapore|  in 1971, followed by the  |United_World_College_of_the_Pacific|United_World_College_Of_The_Pacific|  in  |Victoria,_British_Columbia|Victoria,_British_Columbia| , in 1974. In 1978, Mountbatten passed the presidency of the college to his great-nephew, the  |Prince_of_Wales|Charles,_Prince_Of_Wales| .            |Peter_Wright|Peter_Wright| , in his book  Spycatcher , claimed that in May 1968 Mountbatten attended a private meeting with press baron  |Cecil_King|Cecil_Harmsworth_King| , and the Governments Chief Scientific Adviser,  |Solly_Zuckerman|Solly_Zuckerman| . Wright alleged that up to thirty  |MI5|Mi5|  officers had joined a secret campaign to undermine the crisis-stricken Labour government of  |Harold_Wilson|Harold_Wilson|  and that King was an MI5 agent. In the meeting, King allegedly urged Mountbatten to become the leader of a government of national salvation. Solly Zuckerman pointed out that it was rank treachery , and the idea came to nothing because of Mountbattens reluctance to act.  In contrast,  |Andrew_Lownie|Andrew_Lownie|  has suggested that it took the intervention of the Queen to dissuade him from plotting against Wilson.      In 2006, the BBC documentary The Plot Against Harold Wilson alleged that there had been another plot involving Mountbatten to oust Wilson during his second term in office . The period was characterised by high inflation, increasing unemployment and widespread industrial unrest. The alleged plot revolved around  |right-wing|Right-Wing|  former military figures who were supposedly building private armies to counter the perceived threat from  |trade_unions|Trade_Union|  and the Soviet Union. They believed that the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party| , which was  partly funded by  |affiliated_trade_unions|Affiliated_Trade_Union| , was unable and unwilling to counter these developments and that Wilson was either a Soviet agent or at the very least a  |Communist|Communism|  sympathiser  – claims Wilson strongly denied. The documentary alleged that a coup was planned to overthrow Wilson and replace him with Mountbatten using the private armies and sympathisers in the military and MI5.      The first official history of MI5,  The Defence of the Realm  , implied that there was a plot against Wilson and that MI5 did have a file on him. Yet it also made clear that the plot was in no way official and that any activity centred on a small group of discontented officers. This much had already been confirmed by former  |cabinet_secretary|Cabinet_Secretary| |Lord_Hunt|John_Hunt,_Baron_Hunt_Of_Tanworth| , who concluded in a secret inquiry conducted in 1996 that there is absolutely no doubt at all that a few, a very few, malcontents in MI5 ... a lot of them like Peter Wright who were right-wing, malicious and had serious personal grudges – gave vent to these and spread damaging malicious stories about that Labour government.               Mountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to  |Edwina_Cynthia_Annette_Ashley|Edwina_Mountbatten,_Countess_Mountbatten_Of_Burma| , daughter of  |Wilfred_William_Ashley|Wilfrid_Ashley,_1St_Baron_Mount_Temple| , later 1st   |Baron_Mount_Temple|Baron_Mount_Temple| , himself a grandson of the  |7th_Earl_of_Shaftesbury|Anthony_Ashley-Cooper,_7Th_Earl_Of_Shaftesbury| . She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate  |Sir_Ernest_Cassel|Ernest_Cassel|  and the principal heir to his fortune. There followed a honeymoon tour of European royal courts and America which included a visit to  |Niagara_Falls|Niagara_Falls|  .      Mountbatten admitted Edwina and I spent all our married lives getting into other peoples beds. . He maintained an affair for several years with  |Yola_Letellier|Yola_Letellier| ,  the wife of Henri Letellier, publisher of  Le Journal  and mayor of  |Deauville|Deauville|  .  Yola Letelliers life story was the inspiration for  |Colettes|Colette|  novel  Gigi . Edwina and  |Jawaharlal_Nehru|Jawaharlal_Nehru|  became intimate friends after Indian Independence. During the summers, she would frequent the prime ministers house so she could lounge about on his veranda during the hot Delhi days. Personal correspondence between the two reveals a satisfying yet frustrating relationship. Edwina states in one of her letters. Nothing that we did or felt would ever be allowed to come between you and your work or me and mine  – because that would spoil everything.      Mountbatten was involved in relationships with young women after Edwinas death according to his daughter Patricia, his secretary John Barratt, his  |valet|Valet|  Bill Evans and William Stadiem, an employee of  |Madame_Claude|Madame_Claude| .       Ron Perks, Mountbattens driver in Malta in 1948, alleged that he used to visit the Red House, a gay brothel in  |Rabat|Rabat,_Malta| .  Anthony Daly, a male prostitute in a relationship with  |Tom_Driberg|Tom_Driberg| , claimed that the latter told him Mountbatten was attracted to young men in military uniforms and boys in school uniforms.   |Andrew_Lownie|Andrew_Lownie| , a  |Royal_Historical_Society|Royal_Historical_Society|  fellow, wrote that the  |Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation|Federal_Bureau_Of_Investigation|  maintained files regarding Mountbattens alleged sexuality. He also interviewed several young men who claimed to have been in a relationship with him. Barratt has denied Mountbatten was a homosexual, claiming it would be impossible for that to be hidden from him.         The FBI files contain a claim by  |Elizabeth_Wharton_Drexel|Elizabeth_Wharton_Drexel|  that he had a perversion for young boys . Norman Nield, his driver from 1942–43, told the tabloid  New Zealand Truth  that he transported young boys aged 8 to 12 and was paid to keep quiet.  |Robin_Bryans|Robin_Bryans|  had also claimed to the Irish magazine Now that he and  |Anthony_Blunt|Anthony_Blunt| , along with others, were part of a ring that engaged in homosexual orgies and procured boys in their first year at public schools such as the  |Portora_Royal_School|Portora_Royal_School| . These claims were dismissed at that time.  Chris Moore, The Kincora Scandal, Marino Press, 1996; p90-91       Lord and Lady Mountbatten had two daughters:  |Patricia_Knatchbull,_2nd_Countess_Mountbatten_of_Burma|Patricia_Knatchbull,_2Nd_Countess_Mountbatten_Of_Burma|  ,  sometime lady-in-waiting to  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Queen_Elizabeth_Ii| , and  |Lady_Pamela_Hicks|Lady_Pamela_Hicks|  , who accompanied them to India in 1947–1948 and was also sometime lady-in-waiting to the Queen.     Since Mountbatten had no sons, when he was created Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, of Romsey in the County of Southampton on 27 August 1946  and then Earl Mountbatten of Burma and Baron Romsey, in the County of Southampton on 28 October 1947,  the  |Letters_Patent|Letters_Patent|  were drafted such that in the event he left no sons or issue in the male line, the titles could pass to his daughters, in order of seniority of birth, and to their male heirs respectively.        Like many members of the royal family, Mountbatten was an aficionado of polo. He received U.S. patent 1,993,334 in 1931 for a polo stick.  Mountbatten introduced the sport to the Royal Navy in the 1920s, and wrote a book on the subject.   He also served as Commodore of Emsworth Sailing Club in  |Hampshire|Hampshire|  from 1931.  He was a long-serving Patron of the  |Society_for_Nautical_Research|Society_For_Nautical_Research|  . Hugh Murphy & Derek J. Oddy The Mirror of the Seas: A Centenary History of the Society for Nautical Research, London, Society for Nautical Research, p.191.        Mountbatten was a strong influence in the upbringing of his grand-nephew,  |Charles,_Prince_of_Wales|Charles,_Prince_Of_Wales| , and later as a mentor – Honorary Grandfather and Honorary Grandson , they fondly called each other according to the  |Jonathan_Dimbleby|Jonathan_Dimbleby|  biography of the Prince – though according to both the Ziegler biography of Mountbatten and the Dimbleby biography of the Prince, the results may have been mixed. He from time to time strongly upbraided the Prince for showing tendencies towards the idle pleasure-seeking dilettantism of his predecessor as Prince of Wales,  |King_Edward_VIII|Edward_Viii| , whom Mountbatten had known well in their youth. Yet he also encouraged the Prince to enjoy the bachelor life while he could and then to marry a young and inexperienced girl so as to ensure a stable married life. .     Mountbattens qualification for offering advice to this particular heir to the throne was unique; it was he who had arranged the visit of  |King_George_VI|King_George_Vi|  and  |Queen_Elizabeth|Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother|  to  |Dartmouth_Royal_Naval_College|Britannia_Royal_Naval_College|  on 22 July 1939, taking care to include the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in the invitation, but assigning his nephew,  |Cadet|Cadet| |Prince_Philip_of_Greece|Prince_Philip,_Duke_Of_Edinburgh| , to keep them amused while their parents toured the facility. This was the first recorded meeting of Charless future parents.  But a few months later, Mountbattens efforts nearly came to naught when he received a letter from his sister Alice in  |Athens|Athens|  informing him that Philip was visiting her and had agreed to permanently  |repatriate|Repatriation|  to Greece. Within days, Philip received a command from his cousin and sovereign, King  |George_II_of_Greece|George_Ii_Of_Greece| , to resume his naval career in Britain which, though given without explanation, the young prince obeyed. .     In 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to his granddaughter,  |Hon._Amanda_Knatchbull|Amanda_Ellingworth| . . It was about this time he also recommended that the 25  year-old prince get on with sowing some wild oats . Charles dutifully wrote to Amandas mother ,  |Lady_Brabourne|Patricia_Knatchbull,_2Nd_Countess_Mountbatten_Of_Burma| , about his interest. Her answer was supportive, but advised him that she thought her daughter still rather young to be  |courted|Courtship| . .     In February 1975, Charles visited  |New_Delhi|New_Delhi|  to play  |polo|Polo|  and was shown around  |Rashtrapati_Bhavan|Rashtrapati_Bhavan| , the former Viceroys House, by Mountbatten.      Four years later Mountbatten secured an invitation for himself and Amanda to accompany Charles on his planned 1980 tour of India. Their fathers promptly objected. Prince Philip thought that the Indian publics reception would more likely reflect response to the uncle than to the nephew.  |Lord_Brabourne|John_Knatchbull,_7Th_Baron_Brabourne|  counselled that the intense scrutiny of the press would be more likely to drive Mountbattens godson and granddaughter apart than together.     Charles was rescheduled to tour India alone, but Mountbatten did not live to the planned date of departure. When Charles finally did propose marriage to Amanda later in 1979, the circumstances were changed, and she refused him.       On 27 April 1977, shortly before his 77th  birthday, Mountbatten became the first member of the Royal Family to appear on the TV guest show  This Is Your Life .               Mountbatten usually holidayed at his summer home,  |Classiebawn_Castle|Classiebawn_Castle| , in  |Mullaghmore|Mullaghmore,_County_Sligo| , a small seaside village in  |County_Sligo|County_Sligo| , Ireland. The village was only  from the border with Northern Ireland and near an area known to be used as a cross-border refuge by IRA members.  In 1978, the  |IRA|Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army|  had allegedly attempted to shoot Mountbatten as he was aboard his boat, but poor weather had prevented the sniper taking his shot.      On 27 August 1979, Mountbatten went  |lobster-potting|Lobster_Trap|  and tuna fishing in his  wooden boat, Shadow  V, which had been moored in the harbour at Mullaghmore. IRA member  |Thomas_McMahon|Thomas_Mcmahon|  had slipped onto the unguarded boat that night and attached a radio-controlled bomb weighing . When Mountbatten was aboard, just a few hundred yards from the shore, the bomb was detonated. The boat was destroyed by the force of the blast, and Mountbattens legs were almost blown off. Mountbatten, then aged  79, was pulled alive from the water by nearby fishermen, but died from his injuries before being brought to shore.   . Also aboard the boat were his elder daughter  |Patricia|Patricia_Knatchbull,_2Nd_Countess_Mountbatten_Of_Burma|  , her husband  |John|John_Knatchbull,_7Th_Baron_Brabourne|  , their twin sons Nicholas and Timothy Knatchbull, Johns mother  |Doreen,_Lady_Brabourne|Doreen_Knatchbull,_Baroness_Brabourne| , and Paul Maxwell, a young crew member from  |County_Fermanagh|County_Fermanagh| .  Nicholas and Paul were killed by the blast and the others were seriously injured.  Doreen, Lady Brabourne died from her injuries the following day.      The attack triggered outrage and condemnation around the world.  The Queen received messages of condolence from leaders including President  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  and  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii| .  Carter expressed his profound sadness at the death.      Prime Minister  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  said: His death leaves a gap that can never be filled. The British people give thanks for his life and grieve at his passing.       |Tánaiste|Tánaiste|  of Ireland,  |George_Colley|George_Colley|  said: No effort will be spared to bring those responsible to justice. It is understood that subversives have claimed responsibility for the explosion. Assuming that police investigations substantiate the claim, I know that the Irish people will join me in condemning this heartless and terrible outrage.     The IRA issued a statement afterward, saying: The IRA claim responsibility for the execution of Lord Louis Mountbatten. This operation is one of the discriminate ways we can bring to the attention of the English people the continuing occupation of our country. ... The death of Mountbatten and the tributes paid to him will be seen in sharp contrast to the apathy of the British Government and the English people to the deaths of over three hundred British soldiers, and the deaths of Irish men, women, and children at the hands of their forces.      Six weeks later,  |Sinn_Féin|Sinn_Féin|  vice-president  |Gerry_Adams|Gerry_Adams|  said of Mountbattens death: The IRA gave clear reasons for the execution. I think it is unfortunate that anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbattens death showed up the hypocritical attitude of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I dont think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.      In May 2015, during a meeting with Prince Charles, Adams did not apologise. He later said in an interview, I stand over what I said then. Im not one of those people that engages in revisionism. Thankfully the war is over .      On the day of the bombing, the IRA also ambushed and killed eighteen  |British_soldiers|British_Army|  in Northern Ireland, sixteen of them from the  |Parachute_Regiment|Parachute_Regiment| , in what became known as the  |Warrenpoint_ambush|Warrenpoint_Ambush| .  It was the deadliest attack on the British Army during  |the_Troubles|The_Troubles| .          On 5 September 1979 Mountbatten received a  |ceremonial_funeral|State_Funerals_In_The_United_Kingdom|  at  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey| , which was attended by the Queen, the  |Royal_Family|Royal_Family|  and members of the European royal houses. Watched by thousands of people, the funeral procession, which started at  |Wellington_Barracks|Wellington_Barracks| , included representatives of all three  |British_Armed_Services|British_Armed_Services| , and military contingents from Burma, India, the United States, France and Canada. His coffin was drawn on a gun carriage by 118 Royal Navy ratings. During the televised service, the Prince of Wales read the lesson from  |Psalm|Psalm|  107.  In an address, the  |Archbishop_of_Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury| ,  |Donald_Coggan|Donald_Coggan| , highlighted his various achievements and his lifelong devotion to the Royal Navy .  After the public ceremonies, which he had planned himself, Mountbatten was buried in  |Romsey_Abbey|Romsey_Abbey| .  Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 . McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. As part of the funeral arrangements, his body had been embalmed by  |Desmond_Henley|Desmond_Henley| .        Two hours before the bomb detonated, Thomas McMahon had been arrested at a Garda checkpoint between  |Longford|Longford|  and  |Granard|Granard|  on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle. He was tried for the assassinations in Ireland and convicted on 23 November 1979 based on forensic evidence supplied by  |James_ODonovan|James_Odonovan|  that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of nitroglycerine on his clothes.  He was released in 1998 under the terms of the  |Good_Friday_Agreement|Good_Friday_Agreement| . .     On hearing of Mountbattens death, the then  |Master_of_the_Queens_Music|Master_Of_The_Queens_Music| ,  |Malcolm_Williamson|Malcolm_Williamson| , wrote the Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma for violin and string orchestra. The 11-minute work was given its first performance on 5 May 1980 by the Scottish Baroque Ensemble, conducted by Leonard Friedman.        Mountbatten took pride in enhancing intercultural understanding and in 1984, with his elder daughter as the patron, the  |Mountbatten_Institute|Mountbatten_Institute|  was developed to allow young adults the opportunity to enhance their intercultural appreciation and experience by spending time abroad.      Canadas capital city of  |Ottawa,_Ontario|Ottawa,_Ontario| , erected Mountbatten Avenue in his memory. The avenue runs from Blossom Drive to Fairbanks Avenue.
