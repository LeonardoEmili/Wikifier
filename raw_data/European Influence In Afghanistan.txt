      The European influence in Afghanistan refers to political, social, and mostly  |imperialistic|Imperialism|  influence several European nations and colonial powers have had on the historical development of  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| .             After the decline of the  |Durrani_dynasty|Durrani_Dynasty|  in 1823,  |Dost_Mohammad_Khan|Dost_Mohammad_Khan|  established the  |Barakzai_dynasty|Barakzai_Dynasty|  after becoming the next  |Emir|List_Of_Monarchs_Of_Afghanistan|  of Afghanistan. It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in  |Kabul|Kabul| , where he proclaimed himself the  |Shah|Shah| .     Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mothers  |Qizilbash|Qizilbash|  tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother,  |Fateh_Khan|Fateh_Khan| . Among the many problems he faced was repelling  |Sikh|Sikh_Empire|  encroachment on the  |Pashtun|Pashtun_People|  areas east of the  |Khyber_Pass|Khyber_Pass| . After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the warring Sikhs.     In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler,  |Shuja_Shah_Durrani|Shuja_Shah_Durrani| , but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward.  |Ranjit_Singhs|Ranjit_Singh|  forces occupied  |Peshawar|Peshawar| , moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammads forces, under the command of his son  |Akbar_Khan|Wazir_Akbar_Khan| , defeated the Sikhs at the  |Battle_of_Jamrud|Battle_Of_Jamrud| , a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a  |pyrrhic_victory|Pyrrhic_Victory|  and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted  |Lord_Auckland|George_Eden_1St_Earl_Of_Auckland| , the new  |British|British_Empire|  governor general in  |British_India|British_India| , for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the  |Great_Game|The_Great_Game|  lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India.               The  |British|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland|  became the major power in the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent|  after the  |Treaty_of_Paris_|Treaty_Of_Paris|  and began to show interest in Afghanistan as early as their 1809 treaty with  |Shuja_Shah_Durrani|Shah_Shujah_Durrani| . It was the threat of the expanding  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the Great Game . The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires, whose  |spheres_of_influence|Sphere_Of_Influence|  moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britains repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the 19th century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistans fate played out globally.     The débâcle of the Afghan civil war left a vacuum in the  |Hindu_Kush|Hindu_Kush|  area that concerned the British, who were well aware of the many times in history it had been employed as the invasion route to South Asia. In the early decades of the 19th century, it became clear to the British that the major threat to their interests in India would not come from the fragmented Afghan empire, the  |Iran|Iran| ians, or the French, but from the Russians, who had already begun a steady advance southward from the  |Caucasus|Caucasus|  winning decisive wars against the  |Ottoman_Turks|Ottoman_Turks|  and  |Qajar_Persians|Qajar_Dynasty| .     At the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in Central Asia as the British encroached northward, taking the  |Punjab|Punjab_Region| ,  |Sindh|Sindh| , and  |Kashmir|Kashmir| ; later to become Pakistan. The British viewed Russias absorption of the Caucasus, the  |Kyrgyz|Kyrgyz_People|  and  |Turkmen|Turkmen_People|  lands, the  |Khanate_of_Khiva|Khanate_Of_Khiva| , and the  |Emirate_of_Bukhara|Emirate_Of_Bukhara|  with equal suspicion as a threat to their interests in the Asian subcontinent.        In addition to this rivalry between Britain and Russia, there were two specific reasons for British concern over Russias intentions. First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take  |Herat|Herat| , historically the western gateway to Afghanistan and northern India. In 1837 Iran advanced on Herat with the support and advice of Russian officers. The second immediate reason was the presence in Kabul in 1837 of a Russian agent,  |Yan_Vitkevich|Yan_Vitkevich| , who was ostensibly there, as was the British agent  |Alexander_Burnes|Alexander_Burnes| , for commercial discussions.     The British demanded that Dost Mohammad sever all contact with the Iranians and Russians, remove Vitkevich from Kabul, surrender all claims to Peshawar, and respect Peshawars independence as well as that of Kandahar, which was under the control of his brothers at the time. In return, the British government intimated that it would ask Ranjit Singh to reconcile with the Afghans. When Auckland refused to put the agreement in writing, Dost Mohammad turned his back on the British and began negotiations with Vitkevich.     In 1838 Auckland, Ranjit Singh, and Shuja signed an agreement stating that Shuja would regain control of Kabul and Kandahar with the help of the British and Sikhs; he would accept Sikh rule of the former Afghan provinces already controlled by Ranjit Singh, and that Herat would remain independent. In practice, the plan replaced Dost Mohammad with a British figurehead whose autonomy would be as limited as that of other Indian princes.     It soon became apparent to the British that Sikh participation, advancing toward Kabul through the Khyber Pass while Shuja and the British advanced through Kandahar, would not be forthcoming. Aucklands plan in the spring of 1838 was for the Sikhs to place Shuja on the Afghan throne, with British support. By the end of the summer however, the plan had changed; now the British alone would impose the pliant Shuja Shah.             To justify his plan, the  |Governor_General_of_India|Governor_General_Of_India|  Lord Auckland issued the  |Simla_Manifesto|Simla_Manifesto|  in October 1838, setting forth the necessary reasons for British intervention in Afghanistan. The manifesto stated that in order to ensure the welfare of India, the British must have a trustworthy ally on Indias western frontier. The British pretense that their troops were merely supporting  |Shah_Shujahs|Shah_Shujah_Durrani|  small army in retaking what was once his throne fooled no one. Although the Simla Manifesto stated that British troops would be withdrawn as soon as Shuja was installed in Kabul, Shujas rule depended entirely on British arms to suppress rebellion and on British funds to buy the support of tribal chiefs. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, instead claiming they were merely supporting its legitimate Shuja government against foreign interference and factious opposition .      In November 1841 insurrection and massacre flared up in Kabul. The British vacillated and disagreed and were beleaguered in their inadequate  |cantonments|Cantonments| . The British negotiated with the most influential sirdars, cut off as they were by winter and insurgent tribes from any hope of relief. Mohammad Akbar Khan, son of the captive Dost Mohammad, arrived in Kabul and became effective leader of the sirdars. At a conference with them Sir William MacNaghten was killed, but in spite of this, the sirdars demands were agreed to by the British and they withdrew. During the withdrawal they were attacked by  |Ghilzai|Ghilzai|  tribesmen and in running battles through the snowbound passes nearly the entire column of  |4_500_troops_and_12_000_camp_followers_were_killed|Massacre_Of_Elphinstones_Army| . Of the British only one, Dr.  |William_Brydon|William_Brydon| , reached Jalalabad, while a few others were captured.     Afghan forces loyal to Akbar Khan besieged the remaining British contingents at Kandahar, Ghazni and Jalalabad. Ghazni fell, but the other garrisons held out, and with the help of reinforcements from India their besiegers were defeated. While preparations were under way for a renewed advance on Kabul, the new Governor-General  |Lord_Ellenborough|Edward_Law_1St_Earl_Of_Ellenborough|  ordered British forces to leave Afghanistan after securing the release of the prisoners from Kabul and taking reprisals. The forces from Kandahar and Jalalabad again defeated Akbar Khan, retook Ghazni and Kabul, inflicted widespread devastation and rescued the prisoners before withdrawing through the Khyber Pass.            After months of chaos in Kabul, Mohammad Akbar Khan secured local control and in April 1843 his father Dost Mohammad, who had been released by the British, returned to the throne in Afghanistan. In the following decade, Dost Mohammad concentrated his efforts on reconquering Mazari Sharif, Konduz, Badakhshan, and Kandahar. Mohammad Akbar Khan died in 1845. During the  |Second_Anglo_Sikh_War|Second_Anglo_Sikh_War|  , Dost Mohammads last effort to take Peshawar failed.     By 1854 the British wanted to resume relations with Dost Mohammad, whom they had essentially ignored in the intervening twelve years. The 1855  |Treaty_of_Peshawar|Treaty_Of_Peshawar|  reopened diplomatic relations, proclaimed respect for each sides territorial integrity, and pledged both sides as friends of each others friends and enemies of each others enemies.     In 1857 an addendum to the 1855 treaty permitted a British military mission to become a presence in Kandahar during a conflict with the  |Persians|Qajar_Dynasty| , who had attacked Herat in 1856. During the  |Indian_Rebellion_of_1857|Indian_Rebellion_Of_1857| , some British officials suggested restoring Peshawar to Dost Mohammad, in return for his support against the rebellious  |sepoys|Sepoy|  of the Bengal Army, but this view was rejected by British political officers on the North West frontier, who believed that Dost Mohammad would see this as a sign of weakness and turn against the British.      In 1863 Dost Mohammad retook Herat with British acquiescence. A few months later, he died.  |Sher_Ali_Khan|Sher_Ali_Khan| , his third son, and proclaimed successor, failed to recapture Kabul from his older brother,  |Mohammad_Afzal|Mohammad_Afzal_Khan|   until 1868, after which Abdur Rahman retreated across the  |Amu_Darya|Amu_Darya|  and bided his time.     In the years immediately following the First Anglo-Afghan War, and especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British in India,  |Liberal_Party|The_Liberal_Party|  governments in London took a political view of Afghanistan as a  |buffer_state|Buffer_State| . By the time Sher Ali had established control in Kabul in 1868, he found the British ready to support his regime with arms and funds, but nothing more. Over the next ten years, relations between the Afghan ruler and Britain deteriorated steadily. The Afghan ruler was worried about the southward encroachment of Russia, which by 1873 had taken over the lands of the khan, or ruler, of  |Khiva|Khiva| . Sher Ali sent an envoy seeking British advice and support. The previous year the British had signed an agreement with the Russians in which the latter agreed to respect the northern boundaries of Afghanistan and to view the territories of the Afghan Emir as outside their sphere of influence. The British, however, refused to give any assurances to the disappointed Sher Ali.               After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878  |Congress_of_Berlin|Congress_Of_Berlin| , Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali tried, but failed, to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878 and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.         The amir not only refused to receive a British mission but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched.  |Lord_Lytton|Robert_Bulwer_Lytton_1St_Earl_Of_Lytton| , the viceroy, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo-Afghan War. A British force of about 40,000 fighting men was distributed into military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the tsar for assistance, but unable to do so, he returned to  |Mazari_Sharif|Mazari_Sharif| , where he died on 21 February 1879.     With British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Alis son and successor,  |Mohammad_Yaqub_Khan|Mohammad_Yaqub_Khan| , signed the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to the British. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the Khyber and  |Michni_Pass|Michni_Pass| es, and Afghanistan ceded various  |frontier|Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa| |_areas|Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas|  and Quetta to Britain. The British army then withdrew. Soon afterwards, an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of Britains Resident in Kabul,  |Sir_Pierre_Cavagnari|Pierre_Louis_Napoleon_Cavagnari|  and his guards and staff on 3 September 1879, provoking the second phase of the Second Afghan War. Major General Sir  |Frederick_Roberts|Frederick_Roberts_1St_Earl_Roberts|  led the  |Kabul_Field_Force|Kabul_Field_Force|  over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan, defeated the  |Afghan_Army|Afghan_Army|  at  |Char_Asiab|Char_Asiab_District|  on 6 October 1879 and occupied Kabul.  |Ghazi|Ghazi_Warriors|  Mohammad Jan Khan Wardak staged an uprising and attacked British forces near Kabul in the  |Siege_of_the_Sherpur_Cantonment|Siege_Of_The_Sherpur_Cantonment|  in December 1879, but his defeat there resulted in the collapse of this rebellion.        Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqubs brother  |Ayub_Khan|Mohammad_Ayub_Khan|  on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the  |Battle_of_Maiwand|Battle_Of_Maiwand|  in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan in September at the  |Battle_of_Kandahar|Battle_Of_Kandahar| , bringing his rebellion to an end. Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistans foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew.          As far as British interests were concerned,  |Abdur_Rahman|Abdur_Rahman_Khan|  answered their prayers: a forceful, intelligent leader capable of welding his divided people into a state; and he was willing to accept limitations to his power imposed by British control of his countrys foreign affairs and the British buffer state policy. His twenty-one-year reign was marked by efforts to modernize and establish control of the kingdom, whose boundaries were delineated by the two empires bordering it. Abdur Rahman turned his considerable energies to what evolved into the creation of the modern state of Afghanistan.     He achieved this consolidation of Afghanistan in three ways. He suppressed various rebellions and followed up his victories with harsh punishment, execution, and deportation. He broke the stronghold of Pashtun tribes by forcibly transplanting them. He transplanted his most powerful Pashtun enemies, the  |Ghilzai|Ghilzai| , and other tribes from southern and south-central Afghanistan to areas north of the Hindu Kush with predominantly non-Pashtun populations. The last non-Muslim Afghans of  |Kafiristan|Kafiristan|  north of Kabul were forcefully converted to Islam. Finally, he created a system of provincial governorates different from old tribal boundaries. Provincial governors had a great deal of power in local matters, and an army was placed at their disposal to enforce tax collection and suppress dissent. Abdur Rahman kept a close eye on these governors, however, by creating an effective intelligence system. During his reign, tribal organization began to be eroded as provincial government officials allowed land to change hands outside the traditional clan and tribal limits.     The Pashtuns battled and conquered the Uzbeks and forced them into the status of ruled people who were discriminated against.  Out of anti-Russian strategic interests, the British assisted the Afghan conquest of the Uzbek Khanates, giving weapons to the Afghans and backing the  |Pashtun_colonization_of_northern_Afghanistan|Pashtun_Colonization_Of_Northern_Afghanistan| , which involved sending massive amounts of Pashtun colonists onto Uzbek land; British literature from the period demonized the Uzbeks.      In addition to forging a nation from the splintered regions making up Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman tried to modernize his kingdom by forging a regular army and the first institutionalized  |bureaucracy|Bureaucracy| . Despite his distinctly  |authoritarian_personality|Authoritarian_Personality| , Abdur Rahman called for a  |loya_jirga|Loya_Jirga| , an assemblage of royal princes, important notables, and religious leaders. According to his autobiography, Abdur Rahman had three goals: subjugating the tribes, extending government control through a strong, visible army, and reinforcing the power of the ruler and the royal family.        During his visit to Rawalpindi in 1885, the Amir requested the Viceroy of India to depute a Muslim Envoy to Kabul who was noble birth and of ruling family background. Mirza Atta Ullah Khan, Sardar Bahadur s/o Khan Bahadur Mirza Fakir Ullah Khan , a direct descendant of Jarral Rajput Rajas of Rajauri, was selected and approved by the Amir to be the British Envoy to Kabul.     Abdur Rahman also paid attention to technological advance. He brought foreign physicians, engineers , geologists, and printers to Afghanistan. He imported European machinery and encouraged the establishment of small factories to manufacture soap, candles, and leather goods. He sought European technical advice on communications, transport, and irrigation. Local Afghan tribes strongly resisted this modernization. Workmen making roads had to be protected by the army against local warriors. Nonetheless, despite these sweeping internal policies, Abdur Rahmans foreign policy was completely in foreign hands.     The first important frontier dispute was the  |Panjdeh|Panjdeh|  crisis of 1885, precipitated by Russian encroachment into Central Asia. Having seized the  |Merv|Merv|  Oasis by 1884, Russian forces were directly adjacent to Afghanistan. Claims to the  |Panjdeh_Oasis|Panjdeh_Oasis|  were in debate, with the Russians keen to take over all the regions Turkoman domains. After battling Afghan forces in the spring of 1885, the Russians seized the oasis. Russian and British troops were quickly alerted, but the two powers reached a compromise; Russia was in possession of the oasis, and Britain believed it could keep the Russians from advancing any farther. Without an Afghan say in the matter, the  |Joint_Anglo_Russian_Boundary_Commission|Afghan_Boundary_Commission|  agreed that the Russians would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance but retain Panjdeh. This agreement on these border sections delineated for Afghanistan a permanent northern frontier at the Amu Darya, but also involved the loss of much territory, especially around Panjdeh.     The second section of Afghan border demarcated during Abdur Rahmans reign was in the  |Wakhan|Wakhan| . The British insisted that Abdur Rahman accept sovereignty over this remote region, where unruly Kyrgyz held sway; he had no choice but to accept Britains compromise. In 1895 and 1896, another Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed on the frontier boundary to the far northeast of Afghanistan, which bordered Chinese territory     For Abdur Rahman, delineating the boundary with India was far more significant, and it was during his reign that the Durand Line was drawn. Under pressure, Abdur Rahman agreed in 1893 to accept a mission headed by the British Indian foreign secretary, Sir  |Mortimer_Durand|Mortimer_Durand| , to define the limits of British and Afghan control in the Pashtun territories. Boundary limits were agreed on by Durand and Abdur Rahman before the end of 1893, but there is some question about the degree to which Abdur Rahman willingly ceded certain regions. There were indications that he regarded the Durand Line as a delimitation of separate areas of political responsibility, not a permanent international frontier, and that he did not explicitly cede control over certain parts  that were already in British control under the Treaty of Gandamak.     The Durand Line cut through tribes and bore little relation to the realities of  |demography|Demography|  or military strategy. The line laid the foundation not for peace between the border regions, but for heated disagreement between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, and later, Afghanistan and Pakistan over what came to be known as the issue of  |Pashtunistan|Pashtunistan|  or Land of the Pashtuns. .     The clearest manifestation that Abdur Rahman had established control in Afghanistan was the peaceful succession of his eldest son,  |Habibullah_Khan|Habibullah_Khan| , to the throne on his fathers death in October 1901. Although Abdur Rahman had fathered many children, he groomed Habibullah to succeed him, and he made it difficult for his other sons to contest the succession by keeping power from them and sequestering them in Kabul under his control.          Habibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman Khans eldest son and child of a slave mother, kept a close watch on the palace intrigues revolving around his fathers more distinguished wife , who sought the throne for her own son. Although made secure in his position as ruler by virtue of support from the army which was created by his father, Habibullah was not as domineering as Abdur Rahman. Consequently, the influence of religious leaders as well as that of  |Mahmud_Tarzi|Mahmud_Tarzi| , a cousin of the king, increased during his reign.      Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet and journalist, founded an Afghan nationalist newspaper with Habibullahs agreement, and until 1919 he used the newspaper as a platform for rebutting clerical criticism of Western-influenced changes in government and society, for espousing full Afghan independence, and for other reforms. Tarzis passionate Afghan nationalism influenced a future generation of Asian reformers.     The boundary with Iran was firmly delineated in 1904, replacing the ambiguous line made by a British commission in 1872. Agreement could not be reached, however, on sharing the waters of the  |Helmand_River|Helmand_River| .     Like all foreign policy developments of this period affecting Afghanistan, the conclusion of the Great Game between Russia and Britain occurred without the Afghan rulers participation. The 1907  |Anglo_Russian_Convention|Anglo_Russian_Convention|  not only divided the region into separate areas of Russian and British influence but also established foundations for Afghan neutrality. The convention provided for Russian acquiescence that Afghanistan was now outside this sphere of influence, and for Russia to consult directly with Britain on matters relating to Russian-Afghan relations. Britain, for its part, would not occupy or annex Afghan territory, or interfere in Afghanistans internal affairs.     During World War I, Afghanistan remained neutral despite pressure to support  |Turkey|Turkey|  when its sultan proclaimed his nations participation in what it considered a holy war. Habibullah did, however, entertain an  |Indo_German–Turkish_mission|Niedermayer–Hentig_Expedition|  in Kabul in 1915 that had as its titular head the Indian nationalist  |Mahendra_Pratap|Mahendra_Pratap|  and was led by  |Oskar_Niedermayer|Oskar_Niedermayer|  and the German legate  |Werner_Otto_von_Hentig|Werner_Otto_Von_Hentig| . After much procrastination, he won an agreement from the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  for a huge payment and arms provision in exchange for attacking British India. But the crafty Afghan ruler clearly viewed the war as an opportunity to play one side off against the other, for he also offered the British to resist a Central Powers attack on India in exchange for an end to British control of Afghan foreign policy.             Amanullahs ten years of reign initiated a period of dramatic change in Afghanistan in both foreign and domestic politics. Amanullah declared full independence and sparked the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah altered foreign policy in his new relations with external powers and transformed domestic politics with his social, political, and economic reforms. Although his reign ended abruptly, he achieved some notable successes, and his efforts failed as much due to the centrifugal forces of tribal Afghanistan and the machinations of Russia and Britain as to any political folly on his part.     Amanullah came to power just as the entente between Russia and Britain broke down following the  |Russian_Revolution_of_1917|Russian_Revolution_Of_1917| . Once again Afghanistan provided a stage on which the great powers played out their schemes against one another. Keen to modernise his country and free it from foreign domination, Amanullah, sought to shore up his powerbase. Amidst intrigue in the Afghan court, and political and civil unrest in India, he sought to divert attention from the internal divisions of Afghanistan and unite all faction behind him by attacking the British. Barthorp, p. 151     Using the civil unrest in India as an excuse to move troops to the Durand Line, Afghan troops crossed the border at the western end of the Khyber Pass on 3 May 1919 and occupied the village of Bagh, the scene of an earlier uprising in April. Wilkinson-Latham & McBride, p. 23 In response, the Indian government ordered a full mobilisation and on 6 May 1919 declared war. For the British it had come at a time when they were still recovering from the First World War. The troops that were stationed in India were mainly reserves and Territorials, who were awaiting demobilisation and keen to return to Britain, whilst the few regular regiments that were available were tired and depleted from five years of fighting.     Afghan forces achieved success in the initial days of the war, taking the British and Indians by surprise in two main thrusts as the Afghan regular army was joined by large numbers of Pashtun tribesmen from both sides of the border. A series of skirmishes then followed as the British and Indians recovered from their initial surprise. As a counterbalance to deficiencies in manpower and morale, the British had a considerable advantage in terms of equipment, possessing machine guns, armoured cars, motor transport, wireless communications and aircraft and it was the latter that would prove decisive. Barthorp, p. 152     British forces used airpower to shock the Afghans, and the Kings home was directly attacked in what is the first case of aerial bombardment in Afghanistans history. The attacks played a key role in forcing an armistice but brought an angry rebuke from King Amanullah. He wrote: It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation. While we now see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent among all civilized people of the west Singer, pp. 192–193     The fighting concluded in August 1919 and Britain virtually dictated the terms of the  |Anglo_Afghan_Treaty_of_1919|Anglo_Afghan_Treaty_Of_1919| , a temporary armistice that provided, on one somewhat ambiguous interpretation, for Afghan self-determination in foreign affairs. Balthorp, p. 157 Before final negotiations were concluded in 1921, however, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy without repercussions anyway, including diplomatic relations with the new government in the Soviet Union in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries.               On 20 February 1919, Habibullah Khan was assassinated on a hunting trip. He had not declared a succession, but left his third son,  |Amanullah_Khan|Amanullah_Khan| , in charge in Kabul. Amanullah did have an older brother,  |Nasrullah_Khan|Nasrullah_Khan| . But, because Amanullah controlled both the national treasury and the army, Amanullah was well situated to seize power. The armys support allowed Amanullah to suppress other claims and imprison those relatives who would not swear loyalty to him. Within a few months, the new amir had gained the allegiance of most tribal leaders and established control over the cities.         Amanullah Khans reforms were heavily influenced by Europe. This came through the influence of Mahmud Tarzi, who was both Amanullah Khans father-in-law and Foreign Minister. Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet, journalist, and diplomat, was a key figure that brought Western dress and etiquette to Afghanistan. He also fought for progressive reforms such as womans rights, educational rights, and freedom of press. All of these influences, brought by Tarzi and others, were welcomed by Amanullah Khan.     In 1926, Amanullah ended the Emirate of Afghanistan and proclaimed the  |Kingdom_of_Afghanistan|Kingdom_Of_Afghanistan|  with himself as king. In 1927 and 1928, King Amanullah Khan and his wife  |Soraya_Tarzi|Soraya_Tarzi|  visited Europe. On this trip they were honored and feted. In fact, in 1928 the King and Queen of Afghanistan received honorary degrees from  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University| . This was an era when other Muslim nations, like Turkey and Egypt were also on the path to modernization. King Amanullah was so impressed with the social progress of Europe that he tried to implement them right away, this met with heavy resistance from the conservative sect and eventually led to his demise.     Amanullah enjoyed early popularity within Afghanistan and he used his power to modernize the country. Amanullah created new cosmopolitan schools for both boys and girls in the region and overturned centuries-old traditions such as strict dress codes for women. He created a new capital city and increased trade with Europe and Asia. He also advanced a modernist constitution that incorporated equal rights and individual freedoms. This rapid modernization though, created a backlash, and a reactionary uprising known as the Khost rebellion which was suppressed in 1924.     After Amanullah travelled to Europe in late 1927, opposition to his rule increased. An uprising in  |Jalalabad|Jalalabad|  culminated in a march to the capital, and much of the army deserted rather than resist. On 14 January 1929, Amanullah abdicated in favor of his brother, King  |Inayatullah_Khan|Inayatullah_Khan| . On 17 January, Inayatullah abdicated and  |Habibullah_Kalakani|Habibullah_Kalakani|  became the next ruler of Afghanistan and restored the emirate. However, his rule was short lived and, on 17 October 1929, Habibullah Kalakani was overthrown and replaced by King  |Nadir_Khan|Nadir_Khan| .     After his abdication in 1929, Amanullah went into temporary exile in India. When he attempted to return to Afghanistan, he had little support from the people. From India, the ex-king traveled to Europe and settled in Italy, and later in  |Switzerland|Switzerland| . Meanwhile, Nadir Khan made sure his return to Afghanistan was impossible by engaging in a propaganda war. Nadir Khan accused Amanullah Khan of  |kufr|Kufr|  with his pro western policies.          In 1933, after the assassination of Nadir Khan,  |Mohammed_Zahir_Shah|Mohammed_Zahir_Shah|  became king.    In 1940, the Afghan legation in Berlin asked that if Germany won the Second World War would the Reich give all of British India up to the Indus river to Afghanistan. Ernst von Weizsacker, the State Secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt wrote to the German minister in Kabul on 3 October 1940: The Afghan minister called on me on September 30 and conveyed greetings from his minister president, as well as their good wishes for a favourable outcome of the war. He inquired whether German aims in Asia coincided with Afghan hopes; he alluded to the oppression of Arab countries and referred to the 15m Afghans who were forced to suffer on Indian territory. My statement that Germanys goal was the liberation of the peoples of the region referred to, who were under the British yoke was received with satisfaction by the Afghan minister. He stated that justice for Afghanistan would be created only when the countrys frontier had been extended to the Indus; this would also apply if India should secede from Britain. The Afghan remarked that Afghanistan had given proof of her loyal attitude by vigorously resisting English pressure to break off relations with Germany.  No Afghan government ever accepted the  |Durand_Line|Durand_Line|  which divided the ethnically Pashtun population into the North-West Province of the  |British_Indian_Empire|British_Indian_Empire|  and Afghanistan, and it was the hope of Kabul that if Germany won the war, than all of the Pashtun people might be united into one realm.
