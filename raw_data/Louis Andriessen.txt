He is a lecturer at the  |Royal_Conservatory_of_The_Hague|Royal_Conservatory_Of_The_Hague| . He was recipient of the  |Gaudeamus_International_Composers_Award|Gaudeamus_International_Composers_Award|  in 1959.       Andriessen was born in  |Utrecht|Utrecht|  into a musical family, the son of the composer  |Hendrik_Andriessen|Hendrik_Andriessen|  , brother of composers  |Jurriaan_Andriessen|Jurriaan_Andriessen|  and  |Caecilia_Andriessen|Caecilia_Andriessen|  and nephew of  |Willem_Andriessen|Willem_Andriessen|  .     Andriessen originally studied with his father and  |Kees_van_Baaren|Kees_Van_Baaren|  at the  |Royal_Conservatory_of_The_Hague|Royal_Conservatory_Of_The_Hague| , before embarking upon two years of study with Italian composer  |Luciano_Berio|Luciano_Berio|  in  |Milan|Milan|  and  |Berlin|Berlin| . He later joined the faculty of the Royal Conservatory.     In 1969 Andriessen co-founded  |STEIM|Steim|  in Amsterdam. He also helped found the instrumental groups  |Orkest_de_Volharding|Orkest_De_Volharding|  and  |Hoketus|Hoketus| , both of which performed compositions of the same names. He later became closely involved in the ongoing Schonberg and Asko ensembles and inspired the formation of the British ensemble  |Icebreaker|Icebreaker| .     Andriessen, a widower, was married to guitarist  |Jeanette_Yanikian|Jeanette_Yanikian|  . They were a couple for over 40 years and were married in 1996. OMahony, John . Arts.guardian.co.uk.       Andriessens early works show experimentation with various contemporary trends: post war  |serialism|Serialism|  ,  |pastiche|Pastiche|  , and tape . His reaction to what he perceived as the  |conservatism|Conservatism|  of much of the Dutch contemporary music scene quickly moved him to form a radically alternative musical aesthetic of his own. Since the early 1970s he has refused to write for conventional symphony  |orchestras|Orchestra|  and has instead opted to write for his own  |idiosyncratic|Idiosyncrasy|  instrumental combinations, which often retain some traditional orchestral instruments alongside  |electric_guitars|Electric_Guitar| ,  |electric_bass|Bass_Guitar| es, and  |congas|Conga| .     Andriessens mature music combines the influences of jazz, American  |minimalism|Minimalism| ,  |Igor_Stravinsky|Igor_Stravinsky|  and  |Claude_Vivier|Claude_Vivier| . Pay, David  . musiconmain.ca His harmonic writing eschews the consonant modality of much minimalism, preferring post war European  |dissonance|Consonance_And_Dissonance| , often crystallised into large blocks of sound. Large scale pieces such as De Staat , for example, are influenced by the energy of the big band music of  |Count_Basie|Count_Basie|  and  |Stan_Kenton|Stan_Kenton|  and the repetitive procedures of  |Steve_Reich|Steve_Reich| , both combined with bright, clashing dissonances. Andriessens music is thus anti-Germanic and anti- |Romantic|Romanticism| , and marks a departure from post war European serialism and its offshoots. He has also played a role in providing alternatives to traditional performance practice techniques, often specifying forceful, rhythmic  |articulations|Articulation| , and amplified, non- |vibrato|Vibrato| , singing.     Other notable works include  Workers Union  , a melodically  |indeterminate|Indeterminacy|  piece for any loud sounding group of instruments ; Mausoleum for 2 baritones and large ensemble; De Tijd for female singers and ensemble; De Snelheid , for 3 amplified ensembles;  De Materie  , a large four-part work for voices and ensemble; collaborations with filmmaker and  |librettist|Libretto| |Peter_Greenaway|Peter_Greenaway|  on the film M is for Man, Music, Mozart and the operas  Rosa: A Horse Drama  and  Writing to Vermeer  ; and La Passione for female voice, violin and ensemble.       1959  |Gaudeamus_International_Composers_Award|Gaudeamus_International_Composers_Award|     1977  |Matthijs_Vermeulen_Award|Matthijs_Vermeulen_Award|  for De Staat    1977 UNESCO  |International_Rostrum_of_Composers|International_Rostrum_Of_Composers|  in Paris   1992  |Matthijs_Vermeulen_Award|Matthijs_Vermeulen_Award|  for M. is for Man, Music and Mozart; Facing Death, Dances, Hout en Lacrimosa   1993  |Edison_Award|Edison_Award|    2011  |Grawemeyer_Award_for_Music_Composition|Grawemeyer_Award|  for the multimedia opera La Commedia .
