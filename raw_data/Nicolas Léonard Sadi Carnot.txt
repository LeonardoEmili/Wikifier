        Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot  was a French  |military_scientist|Military_Scientist|  and  |physicist|Physics| , often described as the father of  |thermodynamics|Thermodynamics|  . Like Copernicus, he published only one book, the  Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire  , in which he expressed, at the age of 27 years, the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of  |heat_engines|Heat_Engine| . In this work he laid the foundations of an entirely new discipline, thermodynamics. Carnots work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by  |Rudolf_Clausius|Rudolf_Clausius|  and  |Lord_Kelvin|William_Thomson_1St_Baron_Kelvin|  to formalize the  |second_law_of_thermodynamics|Second_Law_Of_Thermodynamics|  and define the concept of  |entropy|Entropy| .       Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot was born in Paris into a family that was distinguished in both science and politics. He was the first son of  |Lazare_Carnot|Lazare_Nicholas_Marguerite_Carnot| , an eminent mathematician, military engineer and leader of the  |French_Revolutionary_Army|French_Revolutionary_Army| . Lazare chose his sons third given name after the Persian poet  |Sadi_of_Shiraz|Saadi_Shirazi| . Sadi was the elder brother of statesman  |Hippolyte_Carnot|Hippolyte_Carnot|  and the uncle of  |Marie_François_Sadi_Carnot|Marie_François_Sadi_Carnot| , who would serve as  |President_of_France|President_Of_France|  from 1887 to 1894.     At the age of 16, Sadi Carnot became a cadet in the  |École_Polytechnique|École_Polytechnique|  in Paris, where his classmates included  |Michel_Chasles|Michel_Chasles|  and  |Gaspard_Gustave_Coriolis|Gaspard_Gustave_Coriolis| . The École Polytechnique was intended to train engineers for military service, but its professors included such eminent scientists as  |André_Marie_Ampère|André_Marie_Ampère| ,  |François_Arago|François_Arago| ,  |Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac| ,  |Louis_Jacques_Thénard|Louis_Jacques_Thénard|  and  |Siméon_Denis_Poisson|Siméon_Denis_Poisson| , and the school had become renowned for its mathematical instruction. After graduating in 1814, Sadi became an officer in the  |French_armys|French_Army|  corps of engineers. His father Lazare had served as  |Napoleons|Napoleon|  minister of the interior during the  |Hundred_Days|Hundred_Days|  , and after Napoleons final defeat in 1815 Lazare was forced into exile. Sadis position in the army, under the  |restored|Bourbon_Restoration|  Bourbon monarchy of  |Louis_XVIII|Louis_Xviii_Of_France| , became increasingly difficult. Sadi Carnot et l’essor de la thermodynamique, CNRS Éditions     Sadi Carnot was posted to different locations, he inspected  |fortifications|Fortification| , tracked plans and wrote many reports. It appears his recommendations were ignored and his career was stagnating.  On 15 September 1818 he took a six-month leave to prepare for the entrance examination of Royal Corps of Staff and School of Application for the Service of the General Staff.     In 1819, Sadi transferred to the newly formed General Staff, in Paris. He remained on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits and received only two-thirds pay. Carnot befriended the scientist  |Nicolas_Clément|Nicolas_Clément|  and attended lectures on physics and chemistry. He became interested in understanding the limitation to improving the performance of  |steam_engines|Steam_Engine| , which led him to the investigations that became his Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, published in 1824.     Carnot retired from the army in 1828, without a pension. He was interned in a private asylum in 1832 as suffering from mania and general delirum , and he died of  |cholera|Cholera|  shortly thereafter, aged 36, at the hospital in  |Ivry_sur_Seine|Ivry_Sur_Seine| .     Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire |steam_engines|Steam_Engine|  had achieved widely recognized economic and industrial importance, but there had been no real scientific study of them.  |Newcomen|Thomas_Newcomen|  had invented the first piston-operated steam engine over a century before, in 1712; some 50 years after that,  |James_Watt|James_Watt|  made his celebrated improvements, which were responsible for greatly increasing the efficiency and practicality of steam engines. Compound engines had already been invented, and there was even  |a_crude_form_of_internal_combustion_engine|Pyréolophore| , with which Carnot was familiar and which he described in some detail in his book. Although there existed some intuitive understanding of the workings of engines, scientific theory for their operation was almost nonexistent. In 1824 the principle of  |conservation_of_energy|Conservation_Of_Energy|  was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the  |first_law_of_thermodynamics|First_Law_Of_Thermodynamics|  was still more than a decade away; the  |mechanical_equivalence_of_heat|Mechanical_Equivalence_Of_Heat|  would not be formulated for another two decades. The prevalent theory of heat was the  |caloric_theory|Caloric_Theory| , which regarded heat as a sort of weightless and invisible  |fluid|Fluid|  that flowed when out of  |equilibrium|Thermodynamic_Equilibrium| .      |Engineers|Engineer|  in Carnots time had tried, by means such as highly pressurized  |steam|Steam|  and the use of fluids, to improve the  |efficiency|Thermodynamic_Efficiency|  of engines. In these early stages of engine development, the efficiency of a typical engine  the useful work it was able to do when a given quantity of  |fuel|Fuel|  was burned  was only 3%.          Carnot wanted to answer two questions about the operation of heat engines: Is the work available from a heat source potentially unbounded? and Can heat engines in principle be improved by replacing the steam with some other working fluid or gas? He attempted to answer these in a memoir, published as a popular work in 1824 when he was only 28 years old. It was entitled Réflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu . The book was plainly intended to cover a rather wide range of topics about heat engines in a rather popular fashion; equations were kept to a minimum and called for little more than simple algebra and arithmetic, except occasionally in the footnotes, where he indulged in a few arguments involving some calculus. He discussed the relative merits of air and steam as working fluids, the merits of various aspects of steam engine design, and even included some ideas of his own regarding possible improvements of the practical nature. The most important part of the book was devoted to an abstract presentation of an idealized engine that could be used to understand and clarify the fundamental principles that are generally applied to all heat engines, independent of their design.     Perhaps the most important contribution Carnot made to thermodynamics was his abstraction of the essential features of the steam engine, as they were known in his day, into a more general and idealized  |heat_engine|Heat_Engine| . This resulted in a model  |thermodynamic_system|Thermodynamic_System|  upon which exact calculations could be made, and avoided the complications introduced by many of the crude features of the contemporary steam engine. By idealizing the engine, he could arrive at clear and indisputable answers to his original two questions.     He showed that the efficiency of this idealized engine is a function only of the two temperatures of the reservoirs between which it operates. He did not, however, give the exact form of the function, which was later shown to be / T 1 , where T 1 is the absolute temperature of the hotter reservoir.  No thermal engine operating any other cycle can be more efficient, given the same  |operating_temperatures|Operating_Temperature| .     The Carnot cycle is the most efficient possible engine, not only because of the absence of friction and other incidental wasteful processes; the main reason is that it assumes no conduction of heat between parts of the engine at different temperatures. Carnot knew that the conduction of heat between bodies at different temperatures is a wasteful and irreversible process, which must be eliminated if the heat engine is to achieve maximum efficiency.     Regarding the second point, he also was quite certain that the maximum efficiency attainable did not depend upon the exact nature of the  |working_fluid|Working_Fluid| . He stated this for emphasis as a general proposition:          For his motive power of heat , we would today say the efficiency of a reversible heat engine , and rather than transfer of caloric we would say the reversible transfer of entropy ∆S or the reversible transfer of heat at a given temperature Q/T . He knew intuitively that his engine would have the maximum efficiency, but was unable to state what that efficiency would be.     He concluded:            and        In an idealized model, the caloric transported from a hot to a cold body by a frictionless  |heat_engine|Heat_Engine|  that lacks of conductive heat flow, driven by a difference of temperature, yielding work, could also be used to transport the caloric back to the hot body by reversing the motion of the engine consuming the same amount of work, a concept subsequently known as  |thermodynamic_reversibility|Thermodynamic_Reversibility| . Carnot further postulated that no caloric is lost during the operation of his idealized engine. The process being completely reversible, executed by this kind of  |heat_engine|Heat_Engine|  is the most efficient possible process. The assumption that heat conduction driven by a temperature difference cannot exist, so that no caloric is lost by the engine, guided him to design the Carnot-cycle to be operated by his idealized engine. The cycle is consequently composed of  |adiabatic_process|Adiabatic_Process| es where no heat/caloric ∆S 0 flows and  |isothermal_process|Isothermal_Process| es where heat is transferred ∆S var /var var /var var  .
