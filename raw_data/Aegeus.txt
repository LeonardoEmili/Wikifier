   In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Aegeus  was an archaic figure in the  |founding_myth|Founding_Myth|  of  |Athens|Athens| .

Aegeus was the son of  |Pandion_II|Pandion_Ii| , king of Athens and Pylia, daughter of King Pylas of  |Megara|Megara|  and thus, brother to  |Pallas|Pallas| ,  |Nysus|Nisos|  and  |Lykos|Lycus| . But, in some accounts, he was regarded as the son of Scyrius or Phemius and was not of the stock of the  |Erechtheids|Erechtheus| , since he was only an adopted son of Pandion.

According to  |Pausanias|Pausanias| , Aegeus ascribed this misfortune to the anger of Aphrodite and in order to conciliate her introduced her worship as Aphrodite Urania in Athens. Pausanias. Description of Greece, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D7 1.14.7     The cryptic words of the oracle were  Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.  Plutarch, Vita of Theseus; Pseudo-Apollodorus,  Bibliotheke  3,15.6. Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed. This puzzling oracle forced Aegeus to visit  |Pittheus|Pittheus| , king of  |Troezen|Troezen| , who was famous for his wisdom and skill at expounding oracles. Pittheus understood the prophecy and introduced Aegeus to his daughter,  |Aethra|Aethra| , when Aegeus was drunk.  |Scholion|Scholium|  on Euripides Hippolytus, noted by Karl Kerenyi, The Heroes of the Greeks p 218 note 407. They lay with each other, and then in some versions, Aethra waded to the island of  |Sphairia|Sphairia|  and bedded  |Poseidon|Poseidon| . When Aethra became pregnant, Aegeus decided to return to Athens. Before leaving, he buried his sandal, shield, and sword under a huge rock and told her that, when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons to his father, who would acknowledge him. Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married  |Medea|Medea| , who had fled from  |Corinth|Ancient_Corinth|  and the wrath of  |Jason|Jason| . Aegeus and Medea had one son named  |Medus|Medus| .     When  |Theseus|Theseus|  grew up, he found his father’s belongings left for him and went to Athens to claim his birthright. Aegeus recornized him as a son by his sword. Medea, Aegeus’ wife perceived Theseus to be a threat for her children’s inheritance and first tried to discredit and then to poison Theseus. When Aegeus discovered these schemes, he drove Medea out of Athens. Roman, L., & Roman, M. .        While visiting in Athens, King  |Minos|Minos|  son,  |Androgeus|Androgeus|  managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during the  |Panathenaic_Games|Panathenaic_Games| . Out of envy, Aegeus sent him to conquer the  |Marathonian_Bull|Marathonian_Bull| , which killed him. Pseudo-Apollodorus,  Bibliotheke  3.15.7. The identification of the festival as the  |Panathenaia|Panathenaia|  is an interpolated anachronism. Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send  |seven_young_men_and_seven_young_women|Sacrificial_Victims_Of_Minotaur|  every nine years to  |Crete|Crete|  to be fed to the  |Minotaur|Minotaur| , a vicious monster. This continued until  |Theseus|Theseus|  killed the  |Minotaur|Minotaur|  with the help of  |Ariadne|Ariadne| , Minos daughter.     After his adventures in Crete, Theseus returned by ship to Athens. His father, Aegeus previously had asked him to hang a while sail as a sign that Theseus is alive, but Theseus neglected this request. When Aegeus saw Theseus’ ships without a white sail, he assumed the worst and threw himself in his grief into the sea, named after him the Aegean Sea.          In Troezen, Theseus grew up and became a brave young man. He managed to move the rock and took his fathers weapons. His mother then told him the identity of his father and that he should take the weapons back to him at Athens and be acknowledged. Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way, or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way. Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land.     When Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity. He was welcomed by Aegeus, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens. Medea tried to have Theseus killed by encouraging Aegeus to ask him to capture the  |Marathonian_Bull|Marathonian_Bull| , but Theseus succeeded. She tried to poison him, but at the last second, Aegeus recognized his son and knocked the poisoned cup out of Theseus hand. Father and son were thus reunited, and Medea was sent away to  |Asia|Asia| . Pseudo-Apollodorus, Epitome of the  Bibliotheke , 1.5–7;  |First_Vatican_Mythographer|First_Vatican_Mythographer| , 48.     Theseus departed for Crete. Upon his departure, Aegeus told him to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the Minotaur. However, when Theseus returned, he forgot these instructions. When Aegeus saw the black sails coming into Athens, mistaken in his belief that his son had been slain, he killed himself by jumping from a height : according to some, from the Acropolis or another unnamed rock Diodorus Siculus 4.61.4; Plutarch, Vita of Theseus 17 and 22; Pausanias 1.22.5; Catullus 64.215–245 ; according to some Latin authors, into the sea which was therefore known as the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea| .
