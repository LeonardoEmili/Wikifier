In 1995, the main means of transportation in  |Moldova|Moldova|  were railways  and a highway system . The major railway junctions are  |Chișinău|Chișinău| ,  |Bender|Bender_Moldova| ,  |Ungheni|Ungheni| ,  |Ocnița|Ocnița|  ,  |Bălți|Bălți| , and  |Basarabeasca|Basarabeasca|  . Primary external rail links connect the republics network with  |Odessa|Odessa|   on the Black Sea and with the  |Romania|Romania| n cities of  |Iași|Iași|  and  |Galați|Galați| ; they also lead northward into  |Ukraine|Ukraine| . Highways link Moldovas main cities and provide the chief means of transportation within the country, but roads are in poor repair. The countrys major airport is in  |Chișinău|Chișinău| .     Shipping is possible on the lower  |Prut|Prut|  and  |Nistru|Nistru|  rivers, but water transportation plays only a modest role in the countrys transportation system. In 1990 a total of 317 million tonkilometers of freight were carried on inland waterways as compared with 15,007 million ton-kilometers on railways and 1,673 million ton-kilometers on roads.     The movement of manufactured goods and of passengers on all means of transportation started to decline in 1989. From 1993 to 1994, for example, the total amount of transported goods fell by 31 percent, passenger traffic decreased by 28 percent, and the number of passengers declined by 24 percent. The main causes for these declines are the high cost of transportation, a lack of fuels, and the poor state of Moldovas transportation infrastructure: approximately 20 percent of Moldovas roads are considered in a critical technical state.

Much of the railway infrastructure is still in a poor state, all of the rolling stock being inherited from the former Soviet Union. Average commercial speed for passenger trains is  .     However, substantial investments have been made in building new railway lines since 2003, with the goal of connecting  |Chișinău|Chișinău|  to southern Moldova and eventually to the  |Giurgiulești|Giurgiulești|  oil terminal. The first such segment was the   |Revaca|Revaca| |_Căinari|Căinari|  line, opened in 2006.     Connections exist to  |Ukraine|Ukraine|  at  |Kuchurhan|Kuchurhan_Rozdilna_Raion| ,  |Mohilyv_Podilsky|Mohilyv_Podilsky| ,  |Ocnița|Ocnița| . The track between  |Basarabeasca|Basarabeasca|  and  |Reni|Reni_Ukraine|  crosses the border back and forth. The Kuchurhan crossing as well as the  |Tighina|Tighina| |_Tiraspol|Tiraspol|   Kuchurhan segment are under the control of the  |Transnistrian|Transnistrian|  separatist authorities, the circulation of trains on the route depending on the level of political tensions between the separatists and the Government of Moldova.     Between Moldova and Romania there is a  |break_of_gauge|Break_Of_Gauge|  . The most important crossing  is  |Ungheni|Ungheni| – |Iași|Iași| , another two are  |Cantemir|Cantemir_Moldova| – |Fălciu|Fălciu|  and  |Giurgiulești|Giurgiulești| – |Galați|Galați| .
