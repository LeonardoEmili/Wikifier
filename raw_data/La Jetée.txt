   La Jetée  is a 1962 French  |Left_Bank|French_New_Waveleft_Bank|  science fiction  |featurette|Featurette|  by  |Chris_Marker|Chris_Marker| . Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the story of a  |post_nuclear_war|Post_Apocalyptic_Science_Fiction|  experiment in time travel. It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white.     It won the  |Prix_Jean_Vigo|Prix_Jean_Vigo|  for short film. The 1995 science fiction film  12 Monkeys  was inspired by and borrows several concepts directly from La Jetée, as does the 2015  |12_Monkeys_television_series|12_Monkeys|  developed from the film.       A man is a prisoner in the aftermath of  |World_War_III|World_War_Iii|  in post-apocalyptic Paris, where survivors live underground in the  Palais de Chaillot  galleries. Scientists research  |time_travel|Time_Travel| , hoping to send test subjects to different time periods to call past and future to the rescue of the present . They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the prisoner; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory from his pre-war childhood of a woman  he had seen on the observation platform  at  |Orly_Airport|Orly_Airport|  shortly before witnessing a startling incident there. He did not understand exactly what happened, but knew he had seen a man die.     After several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.     Upon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently; but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned to the past, placed on the jetty at the airport, and it occurs to him that the child version of himself is probably also there at the same time. He is more concerned with locating the woman, and quickly spots her. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him ever since, was his own death.        |Jean_Négroni|Jean_Négroni|  as narrator    |Hélène_Chatelain|Hélène_Chatelain|  as the Woman   Davos Hanich as the Man    |Jacques_Ledoux|Jacques_Ledoux|  as The Experimenter   Ligia Branice as a woman from the future   Janine Kleina as a woman from the future    |William_Klein|William_Klein|  as a man from the future       La Jetée is constructed almost entirely from  |optically_printed|Optical_Printer|  photographs playing out as a  |photomontage|Photomontage|  of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a  |Pentax_Spotmatic|Pentax_Spotmatic|   and the motion-picture segment was shot with a  |35_mm|35Mm_Movie_Film| |_Arriflex|Arriflex| .  The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a  |voice_over|Voice_Over|  narrator.  The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to  |Alfred_Hitchcocks|Alfred_Hitchcock|  1958 film  Vertigo  which Marker also references in his 1983 film  Sans soleil . On Vertigo , special feature on the  |Criterion_Collection|Criterion_Collection|  DVD of La Jetée and Sans soleil. The same scene also appears in Terry Gilliams  |12_Monkeys|12_Monkeys| .     The editing of La Jetée, adds to the intensity of the film. With the use of cut-ins and  |fade_outs|Fade| , it produces the eerie and unsettling nature adding to the theme of the apocalyptic destruction of World World III. Director of  |12_Monkeys|12_Monkeys| ,  |Terry_Gilliam|Terry_Gilliam| , describes the editing as simply poetic  in the combination of editing and soundtrack that is used in the short film.     As the film plays out as a photomontage, the only continuous variable is the sound. The sound used in this production is minimal, showing up in the form of narration,  |Orchestral_score|Orchestral_Score|  and  |sound_effect|Sound_Effect| . The rhythmic patterns of the soundtrack act as a framework to add to the intensity of the film. This is seen as The dissolve is synchronized with the sound. As the story moves from the past to the present, La Jetee creates mental continuity.  The soundtrack adds to the  |Illusion|Illusion|  of movement within the film and the change of time.       In Black and Blue, her study of postwar French fiction,  |Carol_Mavor|Carol_Mavor|  describes La Jetée as taking place in a no-place in no-time  which she connects to the time and place of the  |fairy_tale|Fairy_Tale| . She goes on to say even the sound of the title resonates with the fairy-tale surprise of finding oneself in another world: La Jetée evokes là jétais . By u-topia , Mavor does not refer to  |utopia|Utopia|  as the word is commonly used; she also describes an ambiguity of  |dystopia|Dystopia| /utopia in the film: It is dystopia with the hope of utopia, or is it utopia cut by the threat of dystopia.       |Tor_Books|Tor_Books|  blogger Jake Hinkson summed up his interpretation in the title of an essay about the film, Theres No Escape Out of Time . He elaborated:     Hinkson also addresses the  |symbolic|Symbolism|  use of imagery: The Man is blindfolded with some kind of padded device and he sees images. The Man is chosen for this assignment because ... he has maintained a sharp mind because of his attachment to certain images. Thus a film told through the use of still photos becomes about looking at images. He further observes that Marker himself did not refer to La Jetée as a film, but as  |photo_novel|Photo_Novel| .       |Time_loops|Time_Loop|  play a reoccurring role in the theme of La Jetée. In this film, the survivors of the WW3 in Paris create technology in the form of a  |psychoactive_drug|Psychoactive_Drug| , to receive resources from the past and future. From the image he was able to hold onto from his childhood, he acted as the perfect candidate and was able to hold his own in the past with the woman from his memory. While the two are at the park, he is approached by the jailers who send his into the future to complete his mission, which was to collect technology to help the human race to survive. However, when brought to his present reality, he is visited by beings from the future who offer him the opportunity to go back to the past to be with the woman; he gladly takes this offer. When the narrator is shot by one of the jailer that followed him back, the time loop is finally broken with the narrators realization that it was his own death that has been haunting him his whole life It was me all along enjoying this dark, perplexing story .      La Jetée brings up many questions relating to the relationship between memories and human life. As this film is based off the memories of the main character, it also plays off the memories of the audience. The combination of  |imagery|Imagery| , sound, editing, and the use of still images versus moving, suggest that the memories of the narrator are fragmented. This results in the audiences ability to reconstruct the images to become part of their own memory, It also becomes clear that the film is so powerful that one feels as though they have experienced the events of the film themselves.  which was the ultimate goal of  |Marker|Chris_Marker| . This seen seen throughout the film when the audience can hear the murmurs of the  |German|Germanic_Peoples|  scientist and the images of Paris in  |ruins|Ruins| , all of these aspects tend to make one think about  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . In the film, these times are supposed to be taking place in an era of World War 3, so with these images, the audience can make these correlations that make them believe that they are actually remembering World War 3.      Memory is the starting point for all  |time_travel|Time_Travel|  done by the narrator. The woman plays as a constant in the narrators past which allows him to understand his time travel as he would understand a memory. This creates a  |parallel|Parallel_Universes_In_Fiction|  between memory and time travel, this brings upon the suggestion that time is merely a function of our minds. During his travels to the past with the woman, he is able to recreate his reality through those memories.     There have also been some theories that La Jetée is based around the woman in the film. The whole film is just her dream of having a love affair with a man who has no past. They young boy in the film would be her fantasized son. Many believe this is backed up by the scene where the woman is shown opening her eyes while in bed.       In 2010,  Time  ranked La Jetée first in its list of Top 10 time-travel movies .  In 2012, in correspondence with the  Sight & Sound  Poll, the  |British_Film_Institute|British_Film_Institute|  deemed La Jetée as the 50th greatest film of all time.      Science fiction writer  |William_Gibson|William_Gibson|  considers the film one of his main influences.        The video for  |Sigue_Sigue_Sputniks|Sigue_Sigue_Sputnik|  1989 single Dancerama is also an homage to La Jetée.

The 2003 short film La puppé is both an homage to and a parody of La Jetée.      The 2007 Mexican film  Year of the Nail , which is told entirely through still photographs, was inspired by La Jetée.      |Kode9|Kode9|  in collaboration with Ms. Haptic, Marcel Weber , and Lucy Benson created an homage to La Jetée in 2011, for the  |Unsound_Festival|Unsound_Festival| .
