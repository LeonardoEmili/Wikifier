This article is about the  |demographic|Demographics|  features of the  |population|Population|  of  |Malawi|Malawi| , including  |population_density|Population_Density| ,  |ethnicity|Ethnic_Group| , education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.      |Malawi|Malawi|  derives its name from the  |Maravi|Maravi| , a  |Bantu|Bantu_Peoples|  people who came from the southern  |Congo|Democratic_Republic_Of_The_Congo|  about 600 years ago. On reaching the area north of  |Lake_Malawi|Lake_Malawi| , the Maravi divided. One branch, the ancestors of the present-day  |Chewas|Chewa_People| , moved south to the west bank of the lake. The other, the ancestors of the  |Nyanjas|Nyanja| , moved down the east bank to the southern part of the country.     By AD 1500, the two divisions of the tribe had established a kingdom stretching from north of the present-day city of  |Nkhotakota|Nkhotakota|  to the  |Zambezi_River|Zambezi_River|  in the south, and from  |Lake_Malawi|Lake_Malawi|  in the east, to the  |Luangwa_River|Luangwa_River|  in  |Zambia|Zambia|  in the west.     Migrations and tribal conflicts precluded the formation of a cohesive Malawian society until the turn of the 20th century. In more recent years, ethnic and tribal distinctions have diminished. Regional distinctions and rivalries, however, persist. Despite some clear differences, no significant friction currently exists between tribal groups, and the concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to take hold. Predominantly a rural people, Malawians are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent.     The  |Chewas|Chewa_People|  constitute 90% of the population of the central region; the  |Nyanja|Nyanja|  tribe predominates in the south and the  |Tumbuka|Tumbuka_People|  in the north. In addition, significant numbers of the  |Tongas|Tonga_People_Of_Malawi|  live in the north;  |Ngonis|Ngoni_People| —an offshoot of the  |Zulus|Zulu_People|  who came from  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  in the early 19th century—live in the lower northern and lower central regions; and the  |Yao|Wayao| , who are mostly  |Muslim|Muslim| , predominate in the Southern Region of the country and live in a wide band from  |Blantyre|Blantyre_Malawi|  and  |Zomba|Zomba_Malawi|  north to Lake Malawi and east to the border with  |Mozambique|Mozambique| . Bantus of other tribes came from  |Mozambique|Mozambique|  as refugees.          According to  the total population was  in , compared to only 2 881 000 in 1950.
