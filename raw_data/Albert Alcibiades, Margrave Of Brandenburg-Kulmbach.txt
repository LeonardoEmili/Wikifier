   Albert II  was the  |Margrave|Margrave|  of  |Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Principality_Of_Bayreuth|  from 1527 to 1553.   He was a member of the  |Franconia|Franconia| n branch of the  |House_of_Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern| .   Because of his bellicose nature, Albert during his lifetime was given the cognomen Bellator .   Posthumously, he became known as  Alcibiades .       Albert was born in  |Ansbach|Ansbach|  and, losing his father  |Casimir|Casimir,_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg-Bayreuth|  in 1527, he came under the guardianship of his uncle  |George,_Margrave_of_Brandenburg-Ansbach|George,_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg-Ansbach| , a strong adherent of  |Protestantism|Protestantism| .   In 1541, he received  |Bayreuth|Bayreuth|  as his share of the family lands, but as the chief town of his principality was  |Kulmbach|Kulmbach| , he is sometimes referred to as the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.   His restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected a small band of soldiers, he assisted Emperor  |Charles_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in his  |war_with_France|Italian_War_Of_1542–1546|  in 1543.     The  |Peace_of_Crépy|Peace_Of_Crépy|  in September 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he won a considerable reputation, and when Charles was preparing to attack the  |Schmalkaldic_League|Schmalkaldic_League| , he took pains to win Alberts assistance.     Sharing in the attack on the  |Electorate_of_Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony| , Albert was taken prisoner at  |Rochlitz|Rochlitz|  in March 1547 by Elector  |John_Frederick|John_Frederick,_Elector_Of_Saxony|  of Saxony, but was released as a result of the Emperors victory at the  |Battle_of_Mühlberg|Battle_Of_Mühlberg|  in the succeeding April.     He then followed the fortunes of his friend Elector  |Maurice|Maurice,_Elector_Of_Saxony|  of Saxony, deserted Charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the Emperor by an alliance with King  |Henry_II_of_France|Henry_Ii_Of_France| .     He took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the  |Peace_of_Passau|Peace_Of_Passau|  was signed in August 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in  |Franconia|Franconia| , which led to the  |Second_Margrave_War|Second_Margrave_War| .     Having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg| , he quarrelled with his supporter, the French King, and offered his services to the Emperor.   Charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to Alberts demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of  |Würzburg|Bishopric_Of_Würzburg|  and  |Bamberg|Bishopric_Of_Bamberg| ; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the Emperor on the retreat from the  |Siege_of_Metz|Siege_Of_Metz|  in January 1553.     When Charles left Germany a few weeks later, Albert renewed his depredations in Franconia. These soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and Maurice of Saxony led an army against his former comrade.   The rival forces met at  |Sievershausen|Battle_Of_Sievershausen|  on 9 July 1553, and after a combat of unusual ferocity Albert was put to flight.  |Henry,_Duke_of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Henry_V,_Duke_Of_Brunswick-Lüneburg| , then took command of the troops of the league, and after Albert had been placed under the imperial ban in December 1553 he was defeated by Duke Henry, and compelled to flee to France.   He there entered the service of Henry II of France and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at  |Pforzheim|Pforzheim|  on 8 January 1557.     He is defined by  |Thomas_Carlyle|Thomas_Carlyle|  as a failure of a  |Fritz|Fritz| , with features of a  |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_Ii_Of_Prussia|  in him, but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an Alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent . He had early two children:  |Frederick|Friedrich_Of_Brandenburg-Bayreuth|  and  |Anna|Anna_Of_Brandenburg-Bayreuth| . He was to be buried Heilsbronn Münster.
