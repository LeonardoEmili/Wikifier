                 In  |computer_graphics|Computer_Graphics| , ray tracing is a  |rendering|Rendering|  technique for generating an  |image|Digital_Image|  by tracing the path of  |light|Light|  as  |pixels|Pixel|  in an  |image_plane|Image_Plane|  and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, quite higher than that of typical  |scanline_rendering|Scanline_Rendering|  methods, but at a greater  |computational_cost|Computation_Time| . This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where taking a relatively long time to render a frame can be tolerated, such as in still images and film and television  |visual_effects|Visual_Effects| , and more poorly suited for  |real-time|Real-Time_Computer_Graphics|  applications such as  |video_games|Video_Game|  where speed is critical. Ray tracing is capable of simulating a wide variety of optical effects, such as  |reflection|Reflection|  and  |refraction|Refraction| ,  |scattering|Light_Scattering| , and  |dispersion|Dispersion|  phenomena .             The idea of ray tracing comes from as early as 16 th century when it was described by  |Albrecht_Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer| , who is credited for its invention. . In 1982, Scott Roth used the term  |ray_casting|Ray_Casting|  in the context of computer graphics.                Optical ray tracing describes a method for producing visual images constructed in  |3D_computer_graphics|3D_Computer_Graphics|  environments, with more photorealism than either  |ray_casting|Ray_Casting|  or  |scanline_rendering|Scanline_Rendering|  techniques. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each  |pixel|Pixel|  in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it.     Scenes in ray tracing are described mathematically by a programmer or by a visual artist . Scenes may also incorporate data from images and models captured by means such as digital photography.     Typically, each ray must be tested for intersection with some subset of all the objects in the scene. Once the nearest object has been identified, the algorithm will estimate the incoming  |light|Computer_Graphics_Lighting|  at the point of intersection, examine the material properties of the object, and combine this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. Certain illumination algorithms and reflective or translucent materials may require more rays to be re-cast into the scene.     It may at first seem counterintuitive or backward to send rays away from the camera, rather than into it , but doing so is many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since the overwhelming majority of light rays from a given light source do not make it directly into the viewers eye, a forward simulation could potentially waste a tremendous amount of computation on light paths that are never recorded.     Therefore, the shortcut taken in ray tracing is to presuppose that a given ray intersects the view frame. After either a maximum number of reflections or a ray traveling a certain distance without intersection, the ray ceases to travel and the pixels value is updated.            On input we have  |field_of_view|Field_Of_View|  - for human we can assume       90    m,k     numbers of square pixels on viewport vertical and horizontal direction   i,j     1  i  k   1  j  m numbers of actual pixel     w     vertical vector which indicates where is up and down, usually   w -  |roll|:Simple:Pitch,_Yaw,_And_Roll|  component which determine viewport rotation around point C          The idea is to find the position of each viewport pixel center P which allows us to find the line going from eye E through that pixel and finally get the ray described by point E and vector   R P -E . First we need to find the coordinates of the bottom left viewport pixel P and find the next pixel by making a shift along directions parallel to viewport multiplied by the size of the pixel. Below we introduce formulas which include distance d between the eye and the viewport. However, this value will be reduced during ray normalization   r .     Pre-calculations: lets find and normalise vector   t and vectors   b,   v which are parallel to the viewport     :     t T-E,     b   w    t       :     tn         bn         vn   tn    bn       note that viewport center CE+  tnd , next we calculate viewport sizes hx, hy divided by 2 including  |aspect_ratio|Aspect_Ratio|        :   gx  d       gy   gx         and then we calculate next-pixel shifting vectors qx, qy along directions parallel to viewport , and left bottom pixel center p     :     qx   bn,       qy   vn,       p   tn d - gx  bn - gy  vn       Calculations: note P E +   p and ray   R P -E   p so     :     p   p +   qx +   qy     :     r           Above formula was tested in this  .              In nature, a light source emits a ray of light which travels, eventually, to a surface that interrupts its progress. One can think of this ray as a stream of  |photons|Photon|  traveling along the same path. In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line . Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray:  |absorption|Absorption| ,  |reflection|Reflection| ,  |refraction|Refraction|  and  |fluorescence|Fluorescence| . A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. It might also reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any  |transparent|Transparency|  or  |translucent|Transparency|  properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some of the  |spectrum|Visible_Spectrum|  . Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of the incoming rays. Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.            The first ray tracing algorithm used for rendering was presented by  |Arthur_Appel|Arthur_Appel|  in 1968. Appel A. http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf Some techniques for shading machine renderings of solids. AFIPS Conference Proc. 32 pp.37-45 This algorithm has since been termed  |ray_casting|Ray_Casting|  . The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray. Think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel. Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the  |shading|Shading|  of this object. The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow. The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models. One important advantage ray casting offered over older  |scanline_algorithms|Scanline_Rendering|  was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as  |cones|Cone|  and  |spheres|Sphere| . If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using  |solid_modeling|Solid_Modeling|  techniques and easily rendered.                     The next important research breakthrough came from  |Turner_Whitted|Turner_Whitted|  in 1979. Whitted T. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi10.1.1.156.1534 An improved illumination model for shaded display. Proceedings of the 6th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques Previous algorithms traced rays from the eye into the scene until they hit an object, but determined the ray color without recursively tracing more rays. Whitted continued the process. When a ray hits a surface, it can generate up to three new types of rays: reflection, refraction, and shadow.  A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. The closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection. Refraction rays traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material. A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it. This recursive ray tracing added more realism to ray traced images.       Ray tracing-based renderings popularity stems from its basis in a realistic simulation of  |light_transport|Computer_Graphics_Lighting| , as compared to other rendering methods, such as  |rasterization|Rasterisation| , which focuses more on the realistic simulation of geometry. Effects such as reflections and  |shadows|Shadow| , which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to a basic level of  |parallelization|Parallelization| , J.-C. Nebel. A New Parallel Algorithm Provided by a Computation Time Model, Eurographics Workshop on Parallel Graphics and Visualisation, 24–25 September 1998, Rennes, France. A. Chalmers, T. Davis, and E. Reinhard. Practical parallel rendering, . AK Peters, Ltd., 2002. but the divergence of ray paths makes high utilization under parallelism quite difficult to achieve in practice. Aila, Timo and Samulii Laine, Understanding the Efficiency of Ray Traversal on GPUs, High Performance Graphics 2009, New Orleans, LA.       A serious disadvantage of ray tracing is performance . Scanline algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, such as the ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform  |spatial_anti-aliasing|Spatial_Anti-Aliasing|  and improve image quality where needed.     Although it does handle interreflection and optical effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing is also not necessarily  |photorealistic|Photorealistic_Rendering| . True photorealism occurs when the  |rendering_equation|Rendering_Equation|  is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required.     The realism of all rendering methods can be evaluated as an approximation to the equation. Ray tracing, if it is limited to Whitteds algorithm, is not necessarily the most realistic. Methods that trace rays, but include additional techniques , give a far more accurate simulation of real-world lighting.       The process of shooting rays from the eye to the light source to render an image is sometimes called backwards ray tracing, since it is the opposite direction photons actually travel. However, there is confusion with this terminology. Early ray tracing was always done from the eye, and early researchers such as  |James_Arvo|James_Arvo|  used the term backwards ray tracing to mean shooting rays from the lights and gathering the results. Therefore, it is clearer to distinguish eye-based versus light-based ray tracing.     While the direct illumination is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects can benefit from rays generated from the lights.  |Caustics|Caustic|  are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of diffuse surface. An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.        |Photon_mapping|Photon_Mapping|  is another method that uses both light-based and eye-based ray tracing; in an initial pass, energetic photons are traced along rays from the light source so as to compute an estimate of radiant flux as a function of 3-dimensional space . In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points.    The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.     An additional problem occurs when light must pass through a very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene , or a scene in which most points do not have direct line-of-sight to any light source . In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy;  |Metropolis_light_transport|Metropolis_Light_Transport|  is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.         To the right is an image showing a simple example of a path of rays recursively generated from the camera to the light source using the above algorithm. A diffuse surface reflects light in all directions.     First, a ray is created at an eyepoint and traced through a pixel and into the scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where it hits the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on the colors of the first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.            As a demonstration of the principles involved in ray tracing, consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere. This is merely the math behind the  |line–sphere_intersection|Line–Sphere_Intersection|  and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of ray tracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.     In  |vector_notation|Vector_Notation| , the equation of a sphere with center   c and radius r is     :     x -   c       Any point on a ray starting from point   s with direction   d  can be written as     :   x  s+t  d,     where t is its distance between   x and   s . In our problem, we know   c , r ,   s and   d , and we need to find t . Therefore, we substitute for   x :     :       Let       for simplicity; then     :       :   t      : t2+t+0.     Knowing that d is a unit vector allows us this minor simplification:     : t2+t+0.     This  |quadratic_equation|Quadratic_Equation|  has solutions   : t      The two values of t found by solving this equation are the two ones such that   s+t  d are the points where the ray intersects the sphere.     Any value which is negative does not lie on the ray, but rather in the opposite  |half-line|Line|  .     If the quantity under the square root  is negative, then the ray does not intersect the sphere.     Let us suppose now that there is at least a positive solution, and let t be the minimal one. In addition, let us suppose that the sphere is the nearest object on our scene intersecting our ray, and that it is made of a reflective material. We need to find in which direction the light ray is reflected. The laws of  |reflection|Reflection|  state that the angle of reflection is equal and opposite to the angle of incidence between the incident ray and the  |normal|Surface_Normal|  to the sphere.     The normal to the sphere is simply     :   n      where   y  s+t  d is the intersection point found before. The reflection direction can be found by a  |reflection|Reflection|  of   d with respect to   n , that is     :   r   d - 2   n.     Thus the reflected ray has equation     :   x   y + u   r.       Now we only need to compute the intersection of the latter ray with our  |field_of_view|Field_Of_View| , to get the pixel which our reflected light ray will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.       Adaptive depth control means that the renderer stops generating reflected/transmitted rays when the computed intensity becomes less than a certain threshold. There must always be a set maximum depth or else the program would generate an infinite number of rays. But it is not always necessary to go to the maximum depth if the surfaces are not highly reflective. To test for this the ray tracer must compute and keep the product of the global and reflection coefficients as the rays are traced.     Example: let Kr 0.5 for a set of surfaces. Then from the first surface the maximum contribution is 0.5, for the reflection from the second: 0.5 0.5 0.25, the third: 0.25 0.5 0.125, the fourth: 0.125 0.5 0.0625, the fifth: 0.0625 0.5 0.03125, etc. In addition we might implement a distance attenuation factor such as 1/D2, which would also decrease the intensity contribution.     For a transmitted ray we could do something similar but in that case the distance traveled through the object would cause even faster intensity decrease. As an example of this, Hall & Greenberg found that even for a very reflective scene, using this with a maximum depth of 15 resulted in an average ray tree depth of 1.7.        We enclose groups of objects in sets of  |hierarchical_bounding_volumes|Bounding_Volume_Hierarchy|  and first test for intersection with the  |bounding_volume|Bounding_Volume| , and then only if there is an intersection, against the objects enclosed by the volume.     Bounding volumes should be easy to test for intersection, for example a sphere or box . The best bounding volume will be determined by the shape of the underlying object or objects. For example, if the objects are long and thin then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space and a box is much better. Boxes are also easier for hierarchical bounding volumes.     Note that using a hierarchical system like this changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence on the number of objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and we would have a binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this.     Kay & Kajiya give a list of desired properties for hierarchical bounding volumes:     Subtrees should contain objects that are near each other and the further down the tree the closer should be the objects.   The volume of each node should be minimal.   The sum of the volumes of all bounding volumes should be minimal.   Greater attention should be placed on the nodes near the root since pruning a branch near the root will remove more potential objects than one farther down the tree.   The time spent constructing the hierarchy should be much less than the time saved by using it.          The first implementation of an interactive ray tracer was the  |LINKS-1_Computer_Graphics_System|Supercomputing_In_Japan|  built in 1982 at  |Osaka_Universitys|Osaka_University|  School of Engineering, by professors Ohmura Kouichi, Shirakawa Isao and Kawata Toru with 50 students. It was a  |massively_parallel|Massively_Parallel|  processing  |computer|Computer|  system with 514  |microprocessors|Microprocessor|  , used for rendering realistic  |3D|3D_Computer_Graphics| |computer_graphics|Computer_Graphics|  with high-speed ray tracing. According to the  |Information_Processing_Society_of_Japan|Information_Processing_Society_Of_Japan| |light_source|Computer_Graphics_Lighting| , and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using ray tracing. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create an early 3D  |planetarium|Planetarium| -like video of the  |heavens|Universe|  made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the  |Fujitsu|Fujitsu|  pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in  |Tsukuba|Tsukuba| .  It was the second system to do so after the  |Evans_&_Sutherland|Evans_&_Sutherland| |Digistar|Digistar|  in 1982. The LINKS-1 was reported to be the worlds most powerful computer in 1984.      The earliest public record of real-time ray tracing with interactive rendering was credited at the 2005  |SIGGRAPH|Siggraph|  computer graphics conference as being the REMRT/RT tools developed in 1986 by  |Mike_Muuss|Mike_Muuss|  for the  |BRL-CAD|Brl-Cad|  solid modeling system. Initially published in 1987 at  |USENIX|Usenix| , the BRL-CAD ray tracer was an early implementation of a parallel network distributed ray tracing system that achieved several frames per second in rendering performance. See Proceedings of 4th Computer Graphics Workshop, Cambridge, MA, USA, October 1987. Usenix Association, 1987. pp 86–98. This performance was attained by means of the highly optimized yet platform independent LIBRT ray tracing engine in BRL-CAD and by using solid implicit  |CSG|Constructive_Solid_Geometry|  geometry on several shared memory parallel machines over a commodity network. BRL-CADs ray tracer, including the REMRT/RT tools, continue to be available and developed today as  |Open_source|Open-Source_Software|  software.      Since then, there have been considerable efforts and research towards implementing ray tracing in real-time speeds for a variety of purposes on stand-alone desktop configurations. These purposes include interactive 3D graphics applications such as  |demoscene_productions|Demo| ,  |computer_and_video_games|Video_Game| , and image rendering. Some real-time software 3D engines based on ray tracing have been developed by hobbyist  |demo_programmers|Demoscene|  since the late 1990s.      In 1999 a team from the  |University_of_Utah|University_Of_Utah| , led by Steven Parker, demonstrated interactive ray tracing live at the 1999 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics. They rendered a 35 million sphere model at 512 by 512 pixels, running at approximately 15 frames per second on 60 CPUs.        The OpenRT project included a highly optimized software core for ray tracing along with an  |OpenGL|Opengl| -like API in order to offer an alternative to the current  |rasterisation|Rasterisation|  based approach for interactive 3D graphics.  |Ray_tracing_hardware|Ray-Tracing_Hardware| , such as the experimental  |Ray_Processing_Unit|Ray_Processing_Unit|  developed by Sven Woop at the  |Saarland_University|Saarland_University| , has been designed to accelerate some of the computationally intensive operations of ray tracing. On March 16, 2007, the University of Saarland revealed an implementation of a high-performance ray tracing engine that allowed computer games to be rendered via ray tracing without intensive resource usage.      On June 12, 2008 Intel demonstrated a special version of  Enemy Territory: Quake Wars , titled  Quake Wars: Ray Traced , using ray tracing for rendering, running in basic HD resolution. ETQW operated at 14-29 frames per second. The demonstration ran on a 16-core Xeon Tigerton system running at 2.93  GHz.      At SIGGRAPH 2009, Nvidia announced  |OptiX|Optix| , a free API for real-time ray tracing on Nvidia GPUs. The API exposes seven programmable entry points within the ray tracing pipeline, allowing for custom cameras, ray-primitive intersections, shaders, shadowing, etc. This flexibility enables bidirectional path tracing, Metropolis light transport, and many other rendering algorithms that cannot be implemented with tail recursion.  OptiX-based renderers are used in  |Adobe|Adobe_Systems| |AfterEffects|Aftereffects| , Bunkspeed Shot,  |Autodesk_Maya|Autodesk_Maya| ,  |3ds_max|3Ds_Max| , and many other renderers.      |Imagination_Technologies|Imagination_Technologies|  offers a free  |API|Api|  called  |OpenRL|Openrl|  which accelerates  |tail_recursive|Tail_Recursion|  ray tracing-based rendering algorithms and, together with their proprietary ray tracing hardware, works with  |Autodesk_Maya|Autodesk_Maya|  to provide what  |3D_World|3D_World|  calls real-time raytracing to the everyday artist . 3D World, April 2013     In 2014, a demo of the  |PlayStation_4|Playstation_4|  video game  The Tomorrow Children , developed by  |Q-Games|Q-Games|  and  |SIE_Japan_Studio|Sie_Japan_Studio| , demonstrated new  |lighting|Computer_Graphics|  techniques developed by Q-Games, notably cascaded  |voxel|Voxel| |cone|Cone_Tracing|  ray tracing, which simulates lighting in real-time and uses more realistic  |reflections|Reflection|  rather than  |screen_space|Screen_Space_Ambient_Occlusion|  reflections.      AMD offers interactive ray tracing on top of OpenCL on Vega graphics cards through  |Radeon_ProRender|Radeon_Proprorender| .  The company is reportedly planning to release the  |second_generation|Amd_Rdna_Architecture|  Navi GPUs with hardware accelerated ray tracing in 2020.      Nvidia offers hardware accelerated ray tracing in their  |GeForce_RTX|Geforce_20_Series|  and Quadro RTX GPUs, currently based on the  |Turing_architecture|Turing| . The Nvidia hardware uses a separate functional block, publicly called an RT core . This unit is somewhat comparable to a texture unit in size, latency, and interface to the processor core. The unit features BVH traversal, compressed BVH node decompression, ray-AABB intersection testing, and ray-triangle intersection testing.     The next generation consoles such as the  |Playstation_5|Playstationplaystation5|  and  |Xbox_Scarlett|Xboxfutureconsole|  will support dedicated  |ray_tracing_hardware_components|Ray-Tracing_Hardware|  in their GPUs for real-time ray tracing effects.       Aside from being implemented through RTX graphic cards, starting from October 2019, the ray tracing technology can also be enabled on computers whose graphic cards support  |DirectX_11|Directx_11|  and higher through software-based implementation.         Various complexity results have been proven for certain formulations of the ray tracing problem. In particular, if the decision version of the ray tracing problem is defined as follows Computability and Complexity of Ray Tracing .  – given a light rays initial position and direction and some fixed point, does the ray eventually reach that point, then the referenced paper proves the following results:   Ray tracing in 3D optical systems with a finite set of reflective or refractive objects represented by a system of rational quadratic inequalities is undecidable.   Ray tracing in 3D optical systems with a finite set of refractive objects represented by a system of rational linear inequalities is undecidable.   Ray tracing in 3D optical systems with a finite set of rectangular reflective or refractive objects is undecidable.   Ray tracing in 3D optical systems with a finite set of reflective or partially reflective objects represented by a system of linear inequalities, some of which can be irrational is undecidable.   Ray tracing in 3D optical systems with a finite set of reflective or partially reflective objects represented by a system of rational linear inequalities is  |PSPACE|Pspace| -hard.   For any dimension equal to or greater than 2, ray tracing with a finite set of parallel and perpendicular reflective surfaces represented by rational linear inequalities is in  |PSPACE|Pspace|.
