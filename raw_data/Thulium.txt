         Thulium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Tm and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  69. It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form  |coordination_complex|Coordination_Complex| es with nine water molecules.     In 1879, the Swedish chemist  |Per_Teodor_Cleve|Per_Teodor_Cleve|  separated from the rare earth oxide  |erbia|Erbium_Oxide|  another two previously unknown components, which he called  |holmia|Holmium_Oxide|  and  |thulia|Thulium_Oxide| ; these were the oxides of  |holmium|Holmium|  and thulium, respectively. A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911.     Thulium is the second-least abundant of the  |lanthanides|Lanthanide| , after radioactively unstable  |promethium|Promethium|  which is only found in  |trace_quantities|Trace_Radioisotope|  on Earth. It is an easily workable  |metal|Metal|  with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly  |tarnish|Tarnish| es in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable  |X-ray|X-Ray|  devices, and in some  |solid-state_lasers|Solid-State_Laser| . It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.           Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on exposure to air. The metal can be cut with a knife, as it has a  |Mohs_hardness|Mohs_Hardness|  of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  below 32K,  |antiferromagnetic|Antiferromagnetic|  between 32 and 56K, and  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  above 56K.      Thulium has two major  |allotropes|Allotrope| : the  |tetragonal|Tetragonal_Crystal_System|  α-Tm and the more stable  |hexagonal|Hexagonal_Crystal_System|  β-Tm.       Thulium tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150 |°C|Celsius|  to form  |thulium_oxide|Thulium_Oxide| |electropositive|Electropositive|  and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form thulium hydroxide:   :2 Tm + 6 H 2 O → 2 Tm 3 + 3 H 2     Thulium reacts with all the  |halogens|Halogen| . Reactions are slow at room temperature, but are vigorous above 200°C:   :2 Tm + 3 F 2 → 2 TmF 3   :2 Tm + 3 Cl 2 → 2 TmCl 3   :2 Tm + 3 Br 2 → 2 TmBr 3   :2 Tm + 3 I 2 → 2 TmI 3     Thulium dissolves readily in dilute  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  to form solutions containing the pale green Tm ions, which exist as 3+ complexes:    :2 Tm + 3 H 2 SO 4 → 2 Tm 3+ + 3  + 3 H 2     Thulium reacts with various metallic and non-metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds, including TmN, TmS, TmC 2 , Tm 2 C 3 , TmH 2 , TmH 3 , TmSi 2 , TmGe 3 , TmB 4 , TmB 6 and TmB 12 . In those compounds, thulium exhibits valence states +2 and +3, however, the +3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in thulium solutions.  Thulium exists as a Tm 3+ ion in  |solution|Solution| . In this state, the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water. Tm 3+ ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence.     Thuliums only known oxide is  |Tm_2_O_3|Thulium_Oxide| . This oxide is sometimes called thulia .  Reddish-purple thulium compounds can be made by the  |reduction|Chemical_Reduction|  of thulium compounds. Examples of thulium compounds include the halides . Some hydrated thulium compounds, such as TmCl 3 ·7H 2 O and Tm 2 3 ·6H 2 O are green or greenish-white.  Thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with  |water|Water| . This reaction results in  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  gas and  |Tm_3|Thulium_Hydroxide|  exhibiting a fading reddish color. Combination of thulium and  |chalcogens|Chalcogens|  results in thulium  |chalcogenides|Chalcogenide| .      Thulium reacts with  |hydrogen_chloride|Hydrogen_Chloride|  to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride. With  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  it yields thulium nitrate, or Tm 3 . . Chemicool.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-29.          The isotopes of thulium range from 145 Tm to 179 Tm. The primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  before the most abundant stable isotope, 169 Tm, is  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture| , and the primary mode after is  |beta_emission|Beta_Emission| . The primary  |decay_products|Decay_Product|  before 169 Tm are element 68  isotopes, and the primary products after are element 70  isotopes.        Thulium-169 is thuliums only  |primordial_isotope|Primordial_Isotope|  and is the only isotope of thulium that is thought to be stable; it is predicted to undergo  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay|  to  |holmium|Holmium| -165 with a very long half-life.  The longest-lived radioisotopes are thulium-171, which has a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 1.92 years, and thulium-170, which has a half-life of 128.6 days. Most other isotopes have half-lives of a few minutes or less.    Thirty-five isotopes and 26  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  of thulium have been detected. Most isotopes of thulium lighter than 169  |atomic_mass_units|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  decay via  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  or  |beta-plus_decay|Positron_Emission| , although some exhibit significant  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay|  or  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| . Heavier isotopes undergo  |beta-minus_decay|Beta-Minus_Decay| .       Thulium was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  by Swedish chemist  |Per_Teodor_Cleve|Per_Teodor_Cleve|  in 1879 by looking for impurities in the  |oxides|Oxide|  of other rare earth elements . See:    Cleve named thulium on p. 480:  Pour le radical de loxyde placé entre lytterbine et lerbine, qui est caractérisé par la bande x dans la partie rouge du spectre, je propose la nom de thulium, dérivé de Thulé, le plus ancien nom de la Scandinavie.       Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of  |erbia|Erbia|  . Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element  |holmium|Holmium|  and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide  |thulia|Thulia|  and its element thulium after  |Thule|Thule| , an  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  place name associated with Scandinavia or  |Iceland|Iceland| . Thuliums atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm.      Thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color; they had to be content with  |spectroscopically|Spectroscopy|  observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was  |Charles_James|Charles_James| , a British expatriate working on a large scale at  |New_Hampshire_College|University_Of_New_Hampshire|  in  |Durham|Durham,_New_Hampshire| . In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.      High-purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in the late 1950s, as a result of the adoption of  |ion-exchange|Ion_Exchange|  separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram oscillated between US $4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was the second highest for the lanthanides behind  |lutetium|Lutetium| .            The element is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in  |minerals|Mineral|  with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing  |yttrium|Yttrium|  and  |gadolinium|Gadolinium| . In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral  |gadolinite|Gadolinite| .  However, thulium also occurs in the minerals  |monazite|Monazite| ,  |xenotime|Xenotime| , and  |euxenite|Euxenite| . Thulium has not been found in prevalence over the other rare earths in any mineral yet.  Its abundance in the Earths crust is 0.5  mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by  |moles|Mole| . Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of  |soil|Soil| , although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of  |seawater|Seawater| .  In the  |solar_system|Solar_System| , thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1  part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in  |China|China| . However,  |Australia|Australia| ,  |Brazil|Brazil| ,  |Greenland|Greenland| ,  |India|India| ,  |Tanzania|Tanzania| , and the  |United_States|United_States|  also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000  |tonnes|Tonne| . Thulium is the least abundant  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  on earth except for the radioactive  |promethium|Promethium| .       Thulium is principally extracted from  |monazite|Monazite|  ores found in river sands, through  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange| . Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion  |adsorption|Adsorption|  clays of southern China. In these, where about two-thirds of the total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% . The metal can be isolated through  |reduction|Redox|  of its oxide with  |lanthanum|Lanthanum|  metal or by  |calcium|Calcium|  reduction in a closed container. None of thuliums natural  |compounds|Chemical_Compound|  are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.        Thulium has a few applications:        |Holmium|Holmium| - |chromium|Chromium| -thulium triple-doped  |yttrium_aluminum_garnet|Yttrium_Aluminum_Garnet|  is an active laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2080  nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG lasers operate at 2010  nm.  The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.        Despite its high cost, portable X-ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded in a  |nuclear_reactor|Nuclear_Reactor|  as a radiation source. These  |radioactive_sources|Radioactive_Source|  have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.      Thulium-170 is gaining popularity as an X-ray source for cancer treatment via  |brachytherapy|Brachytherapy|  .  This isotope has a half-life of 128.6 days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity . Ayoub, Amal Hwaree et al. , Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Thulium-170 is one of the four most popular radioisotopes for use in  |industrial_radiography|Industrial_Radiography| .        Thulium has been used in  |high-temperature_superconductors|High-Temperature_Superconductor|  similarly to  |yttrium|Yttrium| . Thulium potentially has use in  |ferrites|Ferrite| , ceramic magnetic materials that are used in  |microwave|Microwave|  equipment. Thulium is also similar to  |scandium|Scandium|  in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum, in this case, its green emission lines, which are not covered by other elements.  Because thulium  |fluoresces|Fluoresce|  with a blue color when exposed to  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet| , thulium is put into  |euro|Euro| |banknotes|Banknotes|  as a measure against  |counterfeit|Counterfeit| ing.  The blue fluorescence of Tm-doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation. Tm-doped halides in which Tm is in its 2+ valence state, are promising luminescent materials that can make efficient electricity generating windows based on the principle of a luminescent solar concentrator, possible.        Soluble thulium salts are mildly  |toxic|Toxicity| , but insoluble thulium salts are completely  |nontoxic|Nontoxic| . When injected, thulium can cause degeneration of the  |liver|Liver|  and  |spleen|Spleen|  and can also cause  |hemoglobin|Hemoglobin|  concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male  |mice|Mouse|  than female mice. Despite this, thulium has a low level of toxicity.  In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the  |liver|Liver| ,  |kidneys|Kidney| , and  |bones|Bone| . Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of  |plants|Plant|  do not take up thulium, and the  |dry_weight|Dry_Weight|  of vegetables usually contains one  |part_per_billion|Parts_Per_Billion|  of thulium. Thulium  |dust|Dust|  and  |powder|Powder|  are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause  |explosion|Explosion|.
