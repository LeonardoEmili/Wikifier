                In  |group_theory|Group_Theory| , the symmetry group of a geometric object is the  |group|Group|  of all  |transformations|Transformation|  under which the object is  |invariant|Invariant| , endowed with the group operation of  |composition|Function_Composition| . Such a transformation is an invertible mapping of the  |ambient_space|Ambient_Space|  which takes the object to itself, and which preserves all the relevant structure of the object. A frequent notation for the symmetry group of an object X is G Sym.     For an object in a  |metric|Metric|  space, its symmetries form a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of the  |isometry_group|Isometry_Group|  of the ambient space. This article mainly considers  |symmetry|Symmetry|  groups in  |Euclidean_geometry|Euclidean_Geometry| , but the concept may also be studied for more general types of geometric structure.       We consider the objects possessing symmetry to be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a  |wallpaper_pattern|Wallpaper_Group| . For symmetry of physical objects, one may also take their physical composition as part of the pattern.  The group of isometries of space induces a  |group_action|Group_Action|  on objects in it, and the symmetry group Sym consists of those isometries which map X to itself . We say X is invariant under such a mapping, and the mapping is a symmetry of X.     The above is sometimes called the full symmetry group to emphasize that it includes orientation-reversing isometries . The  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of orientation-preserving symmetries is called its proper symmetry group. An object is  |chiral|Chirality|  when it has no  |orientation|Orientation| -reversing symmetries, so that its proper symmetry group is equal to its full symmetry group.     Any symmetry group whose elements have a common  |fixed_point|Fixed_Point| , which is true if the group is finite or the figure is bounded, can be represented as a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of the  |orthogonal_group|Orthogonal_Group|  O by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO, and is called the rotation group of the figure.     In a  discrete symmetry group , the points symmetric to a given point do not  |accumulate|Limit_Point|  toward a limit point. That is, every  |orbit|Orbit|  of the group forms a  |discrete_set|Discrete_Set| . All finite symmetry groups are discrete.     Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: finite  point groups , which include only rotations, reflections, inversions and rotoinversions – i.e., the finite subgroups of O; infinite  lattice groups, which include only translations; and infinite  space groups  containing elements of both previous types, and perhaps also extra transformations like  |screw_displacements|Screw_Displacement|  and  |glide_reflections|Glide_Reflection| . There are also  |continuous_symmetry|Continuous_Symmetry|  groups , which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances. An example is  |O|Orthogonal_Group| , the symmetry group of a sphere. Symmetry groups of Euclidean objects may be completely classified as the  |subgroups_of_the_Euclidean_group|Euclidean_Groupsubgroups|  E .     Two geometric figures have the same symmetry type when their symmetry groups are  conjugate  subgroups of the Euclidean group: that is, when the subgroups H 1 , H 2 are related by  for some g in E. For example:     two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes.   two 3D figures have 3-fold  |rotational_symmetry|Rotational_Symmetry| , but with respect to different axes.   two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction.     In the following sections, we only consider isometry groups whose  |orbits|Orbit|  are  |topologically_closed|Closed| , including all discrete and continuous isometry groups. However, this excludes for example the 1D group of translations by a  |rational_number|Rational_Number| ; such a non-closed figure cannot be drawn with reasonable accuracy due to its arbitrarily fine detail.       The isometry groups in one dimension are:     the trivial group C 1   the groups of two elements generated by a reflection; they are isomorphic with C 2   the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with Z, the additive group of the integers   the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection; they are isomorphic with the  |generalized_dihedral_group|Dihedral_Groupgeneralizations|  of Z, Dih, also denoted by D ∞ .   the group generated by all translations ; this group cannot be the symmetry group of a Euclidean figure, even endowed with a pattern: such a pattern would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a constant one-dimensional vector field has this symmetry group.   the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the  |generalized_dihedral_group|Dihedral_Groupgeneralizations|  Dih.     See also  |symmetry_groups_in_one_dimension|Symmetry_Groups_In_One_Dimension| .        |Up_to|Up_To|  conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:      |cyclic_groups|Cyclic_Group|  C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , ... where C n consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/n  |dihedral_groups|Dihedral_Group|  D 1 , D 2 ,  |D_3|Dihedral_Group_Of_Order_6| ,  |D_4|Examples_Of_Groupsa_Symmetry_Group| , ..., where D n  consists of the rotations in C n together with reflections in n axes that pass through the fixed point.     C 1 is the  |trivial_group|Trivial_Group|  containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure is asymmetric, for example the letter F . C 2 is the symmetry group of the letter Z , C 3 that of a  |triskelion|Triskelion| , C 4 of a  |swastika|Swastika| , and C 5 , C 6 , etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.     D 1 is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of  |bilateral_symmetry|Reflection_Symmetry| , for example the letter A .     D 2 , which is isomorphic to the  |Klein_four-group|Klein_Four-Group| , is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.     D 3 , D 4 etc. are the symmetry groups of the  |regular_polygons|Regular_Polygon| .     Within each of these symmetry types, there are two  |degrees_of_freedom|Degrees_Of_Freedom|  for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.     The remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point are:   the special  |orthogonal_group|Orthogonal_Group|  SO consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called the  |circle_group|Circle_Group|  S 1 , the multiplicative group of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number|  of  |absolute_value|Absolute_Value|  1. It is the proper symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C n . There is no geometric figure that has as full symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply .   the orthogonal group O consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called Dih as it is the  |generalized_dihedral_group|Dihedral_Group|  of S 1 .     Non-bounded figures may have isometry groups including translations; these are:   the 7  |frieze_groups|Frieze_Group|    the 17  |wallpaper_groups|Wallpaper_Group|    for each of the symmetry groups in one dimension, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction   ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction.                |Up_to|Up_To|  conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 other individual groups. In crystallography, only those point groups are considered which preserve some crystal lattice . This  |crystallographic_restriction|Crystallographic_Restriction_Theorem|  of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups .     The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:   cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis, this applies for example for a beer  |bottle|Bottle| |scalar_field|Scalar_Field|  patterns, the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical reflection symmetry as well. However, this is not true for  |vector_field|Vector_Field|  patters: for example, in  |cylindrical_coordinates|Cylindrical_Coordinates|  with respect to some axis, the vector field     A  + A  + Az  has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis whenever A  A  and Az have this symmetry ; and it has reflectional symmetry only when A  0 .     For spherical symmetry, there is no such distinction: any patterned object has planes of reflection symmetry.     The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a  |screw_axis|Screw_Axis| , such as an infinite  |helix|Helix| . See also  |subgroups_of_the_Euclidean_group|Euclidean_Groupsubgroups| .          In wider contexts, a symmetry group may be any kind of transformation group, or  |automorphism|Automorphism|  group. Each type of  |mathematical_structure|Mathematical_Structure|  has  |invertible_mappings|Bijection|  which preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry group can define the structure, or at least clarify the meaning of geometric congruence or invariance; this is one way of looking at the  |Erlangen_programme|Erlangen_Programme| .     For example, objects in a hyperbolic  |non-Euclidean_geometry|Non-Euclidean_Geometry|  have  |Fuchsian_symmetry_groups|Fuchsian_Group| , which are the discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane, preserving hyperbolic rather than Euclidean distance.  Similarly, automorphism groups of  |finite_geometries|Finite_Geometry|  preserve families of point-sets rather than Euclidean subspaces, distances, or inner products. Just as for Euclidean figures, objects in any geometric space have symmetry groups which are subgroups of the symmetries of the ambient space.     Another example of a symmetry group is that of a  |combinatorial_graph|Graph| |finitely_presented_group|Presentation_Of_A_Group|  is the symmetry group of its  |Cayley_graph|Cayley_Graph| ; the  |free_group|Free_Group|  is the symmetry group of an infinite  |tree_graph|Tree| .        |Cayleys_theorem|Cayleys_Theorem|  states that any abstract group is a subgroup of the permutations of some set X, and so can be considered as the symmetry group of X with some extra structure. In addition, many abstract features of the group can be interpreted in terms of symmetries.     For example, let G Sym be the finite symmetry group of a figure X in a Euclidean space, and let H & sub; G be a subgroup. Then H can be interpreted as the symmetry group of X + , a decorated version of X. Such a decoration may be constructed as follows. Add some patterns such as arrows or colors to X so as to break all symmetry, obtaining a figure X with Sym , the trivial subgroup; that is, gX & ne; X for all non-trivial g & isin; G. Now we get:   :   X+       hX     H          |Normal_subgroups|Normal_Subgroup|  may also be characterized in this framework.   The symmetry group of the translation gX + is the conjugate subgroup gHg & minus;1 . Thus H is normal whenver:   :               g  G;     that is, whenever the decoration of X + may be drawn in any orientation, with respect to any side or feature of X, and still yield the same symmetry group gHg & minus;1 H.     As an example, consider the dihedral group G D 3 Sym, where X is an equilateral triangle. We may decorate this with an arrow on one edge, obtaining an asymmetric figure X . Letting & tau; & isin; G be the reflection of the arrowed edge, the composite figure X + X & cup; & tau;X has a bidirectional arrow on that edge, and its symmetry group is H . This subgroup is not normal, since gX + may have the bi-arrow on a different edge, giving a different reflection symmetry group.     However, letting H & sub; D 3 be the cyclic subgroup generated by a rotation, the decorated figure X + consists of a 3-cycle of arrows with consistent orientation. Then H is normal, since drawing such a cycle with either orientation yields the same symmetry group H.
