      This article lists dukes, electors, and kings ruling over different territories named  |Saxony|Saxony|  from the beginning of the Saxon Duchy in the 9th century to the end of the German monarchies in 1918.     The electors of Saxony from  |John_the_Steadfast|John_Elector_Of_Saxony|   onwards have been  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  until  |Augustus_II_of_Saxony|Augustus_Ii_The_Strong|  converted to  |Roman_Catholicism|Roman_Catholicism|  in order to be elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. His descendants have since been  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| .             The original Duchy of Saxony comprised lands of the  |Saxon_people|Saxon_People|  in the north-western part of present-day Germany, namely, the contemporary German state of  |Lower_Saxony|Lower_Saxony|  as well as  |Westphalia|Westphalia|  and Western  |Saxony_Anhalt|Saxony_Anhalt| , not corresponding to the modern German state of  |Saxony|Saxony| .        |Hadugato|Hadugato| |_Berthoald|Berthoald_Duke_Of_Saxony| |_Theoderic|Theoderic_Duke_Of_Saxony| |_Widukind|Widukind| |_Abo|Abo_Duke_Of_Saxony|                  With the removal of the  |Welfs|Welfs|  in 1180, the Duchy of Saxony was sharply reduced in territory. Westphalia fell to the Archbishop of Cologne, while the  |Duchy_of_Brunswick|Duke_Of_Brunswick|  remained with the Welfs. The  |Ascanian|Ascanian|  Dukes had their base further east, near the  |Elbe|Elbe| , in what is sometimes called the younger Duchy of Saxony, resulting in the name Saxony moving towards the east.     In the 10th century the  |Emperor_Otto_I|Otto_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  had created the  |County_Palatine_of_Saxony|County_Palatine_Of_Saxony|  in the  |Saale_Unstrut|Saale_Unstrut|  area of southern Saxony. The honour was initially held by a Count of  |Hessengau|Hessengau| , then from the early 11th century by the Counts of  |Goseck|Goseck| , later by the Counts of Sommerschenburg, and still later by the Landgraves of  |Thuringia|Thuringia| . When the Wettin landgraves succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony, the two positions merged.     Younger Saxony: The Duchy and the Electorate     The new dukes replaced the Saxon horse emblem  and introduced their Ascanian family colours and emblem  added by a bendwise crancelin, symbolising the Saxon ducal crown, as new coat-of-arms of Saxony . The later rulers of the  |House_of_Wettin|House_Of_Wettin|  adopted the Ascanian coat-of-arms.     After the division, the counting of the dukes started anew. Though the first Ascanian duke is counted either as Bernard III or as Bernard I, his successor,  |Albert_I|Albert_I_Duke_Of_Saxony|  is counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name,  |Albert_the_Bear|Albert_The_Bear| .      |House_of_Ascania|House_Of_Ascania|  Partitions of Saxony under Ascanian rule                The male line of the Saxe-Lauenburgish Ascanians was extinguished in 1689, after Julius Francis death. In spite of having left two daughters to inherit the rights to the duchy, the  |House_of_Welf|House_Of_Welf|  usurped the duchy, preventing the succession of the legitimate heiress,  |Anna_Maria_Franziska_of_Saxe_Lauenburg|Anna_Maria_Franziska_Of_Saxe_Lauenburg| , and resucceeded with its Brunswick and Lunenburg- |Celle|Principality_Of_Lüneburg|  line. In fact,  |George_William_Duke_of_Brunswick_Lüneburg|George_William_Duke_Of_Brunswick_Lüneburg|  was a great-great-grandson of  |Magnus_I|Magnus_I_Duke_Of_Saxe_Lauenburg|  through his great-grandmother  |Dorothea_of_Saxe_Lauenburg|Dorothea_Of_Saxe_Lauenburg| . His descendants became  |Monarchs_of_Great_Britain|List_Of_British_Monarchs|  from 1714 on. In 1814, after being deposed by various occupations in the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , George IIIs son,  |Regent_George|George_Iv_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  agreed to pass Saxe-Lauenburg to his Danish cousin in a general territorial realignment at the  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna| . This cousin was  |Frederick_VI_of_Denmark|Frederick_Vi_Of_Denmark| , who changed the official colours of Saxe-Lauenburg to red and gold. The duchy changed hands again when, in 1865,  |Christian_IX_of_Denmark|Christian_Ix_Of_Denmark|  was deposed in  |Second_Schleswig_War|Second_Schleswig_War|  and resigned by  |Treaty_of_Vienna|Treaty_Of_Vienna| ; Saxe-Lauenburg passed to  |William_I_of_Prussia|William_I_Of_Prussia| , to whom the  |Estates|Estates_Of_The_Realm|  of Saxe-Lauenburg offered the ducal throne. The coat-of-arms of Saxe-Lauenburg was changed to the colours red and silver, with a border in the Prussian colours of black and white. Both duke and estates decided to merge Saxe-Lauenburg into Prussia, as  |district_Duchy_of_Lauenburg|Herzogtum_Lauenburg| , with effect from 1 July 1876.           |House_of_Wettin|House_Of_Wettin| |Albert_III|Albert_Iii_Duke_Of_Saxe_Wittenberg|  in 1422, whereafter Emperor  |Sigismund|Sigismund_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  bestowed the country and electoral dignity upon Margrave  |Frederick_IV_of_Meissen|Frederick_I_Elector_Of_Saxony| , who had been a loyal supporter in the  |Hussite_Wars|Hussite_Wars| . Late Alberts Ascanian relative Duke  |Eric_V_of_Saxe_Lauenburg|Eric_V_Duke_Of_Saxe_Lauenburg|  protested in vain. Frederick, now one of the seven Prince-electors, was a member of the  |House_of_Wettin|House_Of_Wettin| , which since 1089 had ruled over the adjacent  |Margraviate_of_Meissen|Margraviate_Of_Meissen|  up the Elbe river, established under Emperor  |Otto_I|Otto_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 965, and since 1242 also over the Landgraviate of  |Thuringia|Thuringia| . Thus, in 1423, Saxe-Wittenberg, the Margraviate of Meissen and Thuringia were  |united_under_one_ruler|Personal_Union| , and the unified territory .   gradually received the name of Saxony .
