In  |geometry|Geometry| , an icosidodecahedron is a  |polyhedron|Polyhedron|  with twenty triangular faces and twelve pentagonal faces. An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. As such it is one of the  |Archimedean_solids|Archimedean_Solid|  and more particularly, a  |quasiregular_polyhedron|Quasiregular_Polyhedron| .       An icosidodecahedron has icosahedral symmetry, and its first  |stellation|Stellation|  is the compound of a  |dodecahedron|Dodecahedron|  and its dual  |icosahedron|Icosahedron| , with the vertices of the icosidodecahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.     Its  |dual_polyhedron|Dual_Polyhedron|  is the  |rhombic_triacontahedron|Rhombic_Triacontahedron| . An icosidodecahedron can be split along any of six planes to form a pair of  |pentagonal_rotundae|Pentagonal_Rotunda| , which belong among the  |Johnson_solids|Johnson_Solid| .     The icosidodecahedron can be considered a  |pentagonal_gyrobirotunda|Pentagonal_Gyrobirotunda| , as a combination of two  |rotundae|Pentagonal_Rotunda|  . In this form its symmetry is  |D_5d_|Dihedral_Symmetry| , , order 20.     The  |wire_frame_figure|Wire_Frame_Figure|  of the icosidodecahedron consists of six  |flat_regular_decagons|Decagon| , meeting in pairs at each of the 30 vertices.     The icosidodecahedron has 6 central  |decagons|Decagon| . Projected into a sphere, they define 6  |great_circles|Great_Circle| .  |Buckminster_Fuller|Buckminster_Fuller|  used these 6 great circles, along with 15 and 10 others in two other polyhedra to define his  |31_great_circles_of_the_spherical_icosahedron|31_Great_Circles_Of_The_Spherical_Icosahedron| .       Convenient  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinates|  for the vertices of an icosidodecahedron with unit edges are given by the  |even_permutations|Even_Permutation|  of:          where Ï† is the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio| , .       The icosidodecahedron has four special  |orthogonal_projections|Orthogonal_Projection| , centered on a vertex, an edge, a triangular face, and a pentagonal face. The last two correspond to the A 2 and H 2  |Coxeter_planes|Coxeter_Plane| .          The surface area A and the volume V of the icosidodecahedron of edge length a are:   :     A &   a2 & &   a2 & &   29.3059828a2     V &   a3 & &   a3 & &   13.8355259a3.                The icosidodecahedron can also be represented as a  |spherical_tiling|Spherical_Tiling| , and projected onto the plane via a  |stereographic_projection|Stereographic_Projection| . This projection is  |conformal|Conformal_Map| , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.               The icosidodecahedron is a  |rectified|Rectification| |_dodecahedron|Dodecahedron|  and also a rectified  |icosahedron|Icosahedron| , existing as the full-edge truncation between these regular solids.     The icosidodecahedron contains 12 pentagons of the  |dodecahedron|Dodecahedron|  and 20 triangles of the  |icosahedron|Icosahedron|      The icosidodecahedron exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with  |vertex_configurations|Vertex_Configuration|   2 , progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane. With  |orbifold_notation|Orbifold_Notation|  symmetry of n32 all of these tilings are  |wythoff_construction|Wythoff_Construction|  within a  |fundamental_domain|Fundamental_Domain|  of symmetry, with generator points at the right angle corner of the domain.  |Coxeter|Harold_Scott_Macdonald_Coxeter|   Regular Polytopes , Third edition, , Dover edition,                 The icosidodecahedron is related to the  |Johnson_solid|Johnson_Solid|  called a  |pentagonal_orthobirotunda|Pentagonal_Orthobirotunda|  created by two  |pentagonal_rotunda|Pentagonal_Rotunda|  connected as mirror images. The icosidodecahedron can therefore be called a pentagonal gyrobirotunda with the gyration between top and bottom halves.               The  |truncated_cube|Truncated_Cube|  can be turned into an icosidodecahedron by dividing the octagons into two pentagons and two triangles. It has  |pyritohedral_symmetry|Pyritohedral_Symmetry| .     Eight  |uniform_star_polyhedra|Uniform_Star_Polyhedron|  share the same  |vertex_arrangement|Vertex_Arrangement| . Of these, two also share the same  |edge_arrangement|Edge_Arrangement| |small_icosihemidodecahedron|Small_Icosihemidodecahedron|  , and the  |small_dodecahemidodecahedron|Small_Dodecahemidodecahedron|  . The vertex arrangement is also shared with the  |compounds|Uniform_Polyhedron_Compound|  of  |five_octahedra|Compound_Of_Five_Octahedra|  and of  |five_tetrahemihexahedra|Compound_Of_Five_Tetrahemihexahedra| .            In four-dimensional geometry the icosidodecahedron appears in the  |regular|Regular_Polytopes| |_600_cell|600_Cell|  as the equatorial slice that belongs to the vertex-first passage of the 600-cell through 3D space. In other words: the 30 vertices of the 600-cell which lie at arc distances of 90 degrees on its circumscribed  |hypersphere|Hypersphere|  from a pair of opposite vertices, are the vertices of an icosidodecahedron. The wire frame figure of the 600-cell consists of 72 flat regular decagons. Six of these are the equatorial decagons to a pair of opposite vertices. They are precisely the six decagons which form the wire frame figure of the icosidodecahedron.          In the  |mathematical|Mathematics|  field of  |graph_theory|Graph_Theory| , a icosidodecahedral graph is the  |graph_of_vertices_and_edges|1_Skeleton|  of the icosidodecahedron, one of the  |Archimedean_solids|Archimedean_Solid| . It has 30  |vertices|Vertex|  and 60 edges, and is a  |quartic_graph|Quartic_Graph| |_Archimedean_graph|Archimedean_Graph| .
