        Jerome Klapka Jerome was an  |English|English_People|  writer and humorist, best known for the comic travelogue  Three Men in a Boat  .     Other works include the essay collections  Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow  and Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow;  Three Men on the Bummel , a sequel to Three Men in a Boat, and several other novels.         Jerome was born in  |Caldmore|Caldmore| ,  |Walsall|Walsall| , England. He was the fourth child of Marguerite Jones and Jerome Clapp , an ironmonger and lay preacher who dabbled in architecture. He had two sisters, Paulina and Blandina, and one brother, Milton, who died at an early age. Jerome was registered as Jerome Clapp Jerome, like his fathers amended name, and the Klapka appears to be a later variation . The family fell into poverty owing to bad investments in the local mining industry, and debt collectors visited often, an experience that Jerome described vividly in his autobiography My Life and Times .      The young Jerome attended  |St_Marylebone_Grammar_School|St_Marylebone_Grammar_School| . He wished to go into politics or be a  |man_of_letters|Man_Of_Letters| , but the death of his father when Jerome was 13 and of his mother when he was 15 forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself. He was employed at the  |London_and_North_Western_Railway|London_And_North_Western_Railway| , initially collecting coal that fell along the railway, and he remained there for four years.         Jerome was inspired by his older sister Blandinas love for the theatre, and he decided to try his hand at acting in 1877, under the stage name Harold Crichton. He joined a  |repertory|Repertory|  troupe that produced plays on a shoestring budget, often drawing on the actors own meagre resources – Jerome was penniless at the time – to purchase costumes and props. After three years on the road with no evident success, the 21-year-old Jerome decided that he had enough of stage life and sought other occupations. He tried to become a journalist, writing essays, satires, and short stories, but most of these were rejected. Over the next few years, he was a school teacher, a packer, and a solicitors clerk. Finally, in 1885, he had some success with  On the Stage – and Off  , a comic memoir of his experiences with the acting troupe, followed by  Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow  , a collection of humorous essays which had previously appeared in the newly founded magazine,  Home Chimes ,  at Google Books.

On 21 June 1888, Jerome married Georgina Elizabeth Henrietta Stanley Marris , nine days after she divorced her first husband. She had a daughter from her previous, five-year marriage nicknamed Elsie . The honeymoon took place on the  |Thames|River_Thames|  in a little boat,  a fact that was to have a significant influence on his next and most important work, Three Men in a Boat.     Three Men in a Boat and later career    Jerome sat down to write  Three Men in a Boat  as soon as the couple returned from their honeymoon. In the novel, his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave and Carl Hentschel . This allowed him to create comic situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region. The book, published in 1889, became an instant success and has never been out of print. Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty percent in the year following its publication, and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction. In its first twenty years alone, the book sold over a million copies worldwide. It has been adapted to films,  |TV|Three_Men_In_A_Boat|  and radio shows, stage plays, and a musical. Its writing style influenced many humorists and satirists in England and elsewhere.     With the financial security that the sales of the book provided, Jerome was able to dedicate all of his time to writing. He wrote a number of plays, essays, and novels, but was never able to recapture the success of Three Men in a Boat. In 1892, he was chosen by  |Robert_Barr|Robert_Barr|  to edit  The Idler  . The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen . In 1893, he founded To-Day, but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a  |libel|Libel|  suit.     In 1898, a short stay in Germany inspired  Three Men on the Bummel , the sequel to Three Men in a Boat, reintroducing the same characters in the setting of a foreign bicycle tour. The book was nonetheless unable to capture the life-force and historic roots of its predecessor, and it enjoyed only a mild success. In 1902, he published the novel  Paul Kelver , which is widely regarded as autobiographical. His 1908 play The Passing of the Third Floor Back introduced a more sombre and religious Jerome. The main character was played by one of the leading actors of the time,  |Johnston_Forbes-Robertson|Johnston_Forbes-Robertson| , and the play was a tremendous commercial success. It was twice made into film,  |in_1918|The_Passing_Of_The_Third_Floor_Back|  and  |in_1935|The_Passing_Of_The_Third_Floor_Back| .   However, the play was condemned by critics –  |Max_Beerbohm|Max_Beerbohm|  described it as vilely stupid and as written by a tenth-rate writer .           Jerome volunteered to serve his country at the outbreak of the war, but, being 56 years old, was rejected by the British Army. Eager to serve in some capacity, he volunteered as an ambulance driver for the French Army.     In 1926, Jerome published his autobiography, My Life and Times. Shortly afterwards, the Borough of Walsall conferred on him the title  |Freeman_of_the_Borough|Freedom_Of_The_City| . During these last years, Jerome spent more time at his farmhouse Goulds Grove southeast of  |Ewelme|Ewelme|  near  |Wallingford|Wallingford,_Oxfordshire| .
