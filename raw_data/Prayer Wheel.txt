The Mantra  |Om_Mani_Padme_Hum|Om_Mani_Padme_Hum|  is most commonly used, but other mantras may be used as well. According to the  |Tibetan_Buddhist|Tibetan_Buddhism|  tradition based on the lineage texts regarding prayer wheels, spinning such a wheel will have much the same meritorious effect as  |orally|Speech| |reciting|Recitation|  the prayers.       Prayer wheel or Mani wheel . The Tibetan term is a contraction: Mani itself is a contraction of Sanskrit  cintamani ; chos is Tibetan for  Dharma ; and khor or khorlo means  chakra no.       The first prayer wheels, which are driven by wind, have been used in  |Tibet|Tibet|  and  |China|China|  since the fourth century.  The concept of the prayer wheel is a physical manifestation of the phrase turning the wheel of  |Dharma|Dharma| , which describes the way in which the  |Buddha|Gautama_Buddha|  taught. Prayer Wheels originated from ‘The School of Shakyamuni sutra, volume 3 – pagoda and temple’ which states that, “those who set up the place for worship, use the knowledge to propagate the dharma to common people, should there be any man or woman who are illiterate and unable to read the sutra, they should then set up the prayer wheel to facilitate those illiterate to chant the sutra, and the effect is the same as reading the sutra”      According to the Tibetan tradition, the prayer wheel lineage traces back to the famous Indian master, Arya Nagarjuna. Tibetan texts also say that the practice was taught by the Indian Buddhist masters Tilopa and Naropa as well as the Tibetan masters Marpa and Milarepa. The Wheel of Great Compassion: The Practice of the Prayer Wheel in Tibetan Buddhism               According to the lineage texts on prayer wheels, prayer wheels are used to accumulate wisdom and merit and to purify negativities . In Buddhism, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have created a variety of skillful means to help bring practitioners ever closer to realizing enlightenment. The idea of spinning mantras relates to numerous Tantric practices whereby the Tantric practitioner visualizes mantras revolving around the nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown. Therefore, prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing ones capacity for these types of Tantric visualizations. The spiritual method for those practicing with a prayer wheel is very specific . The practitioner most often spins the wheel  |clockwise|Clockwise| , as the direction in which the mantras are written is that of the movement of the sun across the sky. On rare occasions, advanced Tantric practitioners such as Senge Dongma, the Lion-Faced Dakini, spin prayer wheels counterclockwise to manifest a more wrathful protective energy. As the practitioner turns the wheel, it is best to focus the mind and repeat the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra. Not only does this increase the merit earned by the wheels use, but it is a mind-stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion. Intoning the mani mantra with mindfulness and the Bodhicitta motivation dramatically enhances the effects of the prayer wheel. However, it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits, and it is stated in the lineage text that even insects that cross a prayer wheels shadow will get some benefit. Each revolution is as meritorious as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll, and this means that the more Om Mani Padme Hum mantras that are inside a prayer wheel, the more powerful it is. It is best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically. While turning smoothly, one keeps in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and bodhichitta .   The benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel are vast. Not only does it help wisdom, compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner, it also enhances siddhis . The practitioner can repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the wheel, stabilizing a calm, meditative mind. At the end of a practice session, there is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that one may have gathered during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings. Then Om Ah Hum 3 times. This is customary with Tibetans upon completing any Buddhist practice, including the practice of the prayer wheel.               |Thubten_Zopa_Rinpoche|Thubten_Zopa_Rinpoche|  has commented that installing a prayer wheel has the capacity to completely transform a place, which becomes ...peaceful, pleasant, and conducive to the mind.   Simply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations.           The mani wheel, or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, generally sheet-metal body mounted on a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of Turbinella shell. The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a metal weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist. The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case. The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras  rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan ‘khor-lo than is “wheel” since it is thought that the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit. The Tibetan name of this device is mani-chos-khor .       This type of prayer wheel is simply a prayer wheel that is turned by flowing water. The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into.       This wheel is turned by the heat of a candle or electric light. The light emitted from the prayer wheel then purifies the negative karmas of the living beings it touches.       This type of wheel is turned by wind. The wind that touches the prayer wheel helps alleviate the negative karma of those it touches.
