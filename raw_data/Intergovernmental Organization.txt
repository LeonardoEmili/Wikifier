An intergovernmental organization or international organization is an  |organization|Organization|  composed primarily of  |sovereign_states|Sovereign_State|  , or of other intergovernmental organizations. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a  |charter|Charter|  creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives of several states go through a  |ratification|Ratification|  process, providing the IGO with an international  |legal_personality|Legal_Person| . Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of public  |international_law|International_Law| .     Intergovernmental organizations in a legal sense should be distinguished from simple groupings or coalitions of states, such as the  |G7|Group_Of_Seven|  or the  |Quartet|Quartet_On_The_Middle_East| . Such groups or associations have not been founded by a constituent document and exist only as  |task_groups|Task_Force| . Intergovernmental organizations must also be distinguished from treaties. Many treaties  do not establish an organization and instead rely purely on the parties for their administration becoming legally recognized as an  ad hoc  commission. Other treaties have established an administrative apparatus which was not deemed to have been granted international legal personality.       Intergovernmental organizations differ in function, membership, and membership criteria. They have various goals and scopes, often outlined in the treaty or  |charter|Charter| . Some IGOs developed to fulfill a need for a neutral forum for debate or negotiation to resolve disputes. Others developed to carry out mutual interests with unified aims to preserve peace through  |conflict_resolution|Conflict_Resolution|  and better  |international_relations|International_Relations| , promote international cooperation on matters such as  |environmental_protection|List_Of_Supranational_Environmental_Agencies| , to promote  |human_rights|Human_Rights| , to promote  |social_development|Social_Change|  , to render  |humanitarian_aid|Humanitarian_Aid| , and to  |economic_development|Economic_Development| . Some are more general in scope while others may have subject-specific missions . Common types include:     Worldwide or global organizations — generally open to nations worldwide as long as certain criteria are met: This category includes the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  and its specialized agencies, the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization| , the  |International_Telecommunication_Union|International_Telecommunication_Union|  , the  |World_Bank|World_Bank| , and the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  . It also includes globally operating intergovernmental organizations that are not an agency of the UN, including for example the  |Hague_Conference_on_Private_International_Law|Hague_Conference_On_Private_International_Law| , a globally operating intergovernmental organization based in  |The_Hague|The_Hague|  that pursues the progressive unification of  |private_international_law|Conflict_Of_Laws| , and the  |CGIAR|Cgiar|  , a global partnership that unites intergovernmental organizations engaged in research for a food-secured future.     Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical organizations — open to members based on some cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical link: Examples include the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| ,  |Arab_League|Arab_League| ,  |Organisation_internationale_de_la_Francophonie|Organisation_Internationale_De_La_Francophonie| ,  |Community_of_Portuguese_Language_Countries|Community_Of_Portuguese_Language_Countries| ,  |Turkic_Council|Turkic_Council| ,  |International_Organization_of_Turkic_Culture|International_Organization_Of_Turkic_Culture| ,  |Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation|Organisation_Of_Islamic_Cooperation| , and  |Commonwealth_of_Independent_States|Commonwealth_Of_Independent_States|  .   Economic organizations — based on macro-economic policy goals: Some are dedicated to  |free_trade|Free_Trade|  and reduction of trade barriers, e.g.  |World_Trade_Organization|World_Trade_Organization| ,  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund| . Others are focused on  |international_development|International_Development_Research_Centre| . International  |cartels|Cartel| , such as  |OPEC|Opec| , also exist. The  |Organisation_for_Economic_Co_operation_and_Development|Organisation_For_Economic_Co_Operation_And_Development|  was founded as an economic-policy-focused organization. An example of a recently formed economic IGO is the  |Bank_of_the_South|Bank_Of_The_South| .   Educational organizations — centered around tertiary-level study.  |EUCLID_University|Euclid|  was chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries;  |United_Nations_University|United_Nations_University|  researches pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States.   Health and Population Organizations — based on common perceived health and population goals. These are formed to address those challenges collectively, for example the intergovernmental partnership for population and development Partners in Population and Development.    |Regional_organizations|Regional_Organization|  — open to members from a particular continent or other specific region of the world. This category includes the  |Community_of_Latin_American_and_Caribbean_States|Community_Of_Latin_American_And_Caribbean_States|  ,  |Council_of_Europe|Council_Of_Europe|  ,  |European_Union|European_Union|  ,  |Eurasian_Economic_Union|Eurasian_Economic_Union|  ,  |Energy_Community|Energy_Community| ,  |North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|  ,  |Economic_Community_of_West_African_States|Economic_Community_Of_West_African_States|  ,  |Organization_for_Security_and_Co_operation_in_Europe|Organization_For_Security_And_Co_Operation_In_Europe| ,  |African_Union|African_Union|  ,  |Organization_of_American_States|Organization_Of_American_States|  ,  |Association_of_Caribbean_States|Association_Of_Caribbean_States|  ,  |Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|Association_Of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|  ,  |Islamic_Development_Bank|Islamic_Development_Bank| ,  |Union_of_South_American_Nations|Union_Of_South_American_Nations| ,  |Asia_Cooperation_Dialogue|Asia_Cooperation_Dialogue|  ,  |Pacific_Islands_Forum|Pacific_Islands_Forum| , South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation   |Asian_African_Legal_Consultative_Organization|Asian_African_Legal_Consultative_Organization|  and the  |Organisation_of_Eastern_Caribbean_States|Organisation_Of_Eastern_Caribbean_States|  .                  1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace; 2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; 3. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and 4. To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.        open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.  Currently, the UN has 193 Member States, and 2 observer states.              The Parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments. They are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. They seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area. They are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security.        NATO is an Alliance that consists of 29 independent member countries.               End extreme poverty: the percentage of people living with less than $1.25 a day to fall to no more than 3 percent globally by 2030;   Promote shared prosperity: foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country.             The Islamic Development Bank is an international financial institution established at the city of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in 1974–75.        To promote comprehensive human development, with a focus on the priority areas of alleviating poverty, improving health, promoting education, improving governance and prospering the people.       The IDB has 57 member countries across various regions. The prime conditions for membership are that the prospective country should be a member of the Organization of the Islamic Co-operation , that it pays its first instalment of its minimum subscription to the Capital Stock of IDB, and that it accepts any terms and conditions that may be decided upon by the Board of Governors.       While treaties,  |alliances|Political_Alliance| , and  |multilateral|Multilateralism|  conferences had existed for centuries, IGOs only began to be established in the 19th century. The first regional international organization was the  |Central_Commission_for_Navigation_on_the_Rhine|Central_Commission_For_Navigation_On_The_Rhine| , initiated in the aftermath of the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| .     The first international organization of a global nature was the International Telegraph Union , which was founded by the signing of the International Telegraph Convention by 20 countries in May 1865. The ITU also served as a model for other international organizations such as the  |Universal_Postal_Union|Universal_Postal_Union|  , and the emergence of the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  following World War I, designed as an institution to foster collective security in order to sustain peace, and successor to this the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| .       Held and McGrew counted thousands of IGOs worldwide in 2002 Held and McGrew, 2002: Introduction, pp. 1–21 and this number continues to rise. This may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the co-operation among and within states and which has also provided easier means for IGO growth as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.  Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats. Lastly, the formation has encouraged autocratic states to develop into democracies in order to form an effective and internal government. Shannon, Megan. The Expansion of International Organizations Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hilton Chicago and the Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, IL, Sep 02, 2004 . 2009-05-26         There are several different reasons a state may choose membership in an intergovernmental organization. But there are also reasons membership may be rejected.     Reasons for participation:     Economic rewards: In the case of the  |North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|  , membership in the free trade agreement benefits the parties’ economies. For example, Mexican companies are given better access to  |U_S_|United_States|  markets due to their membership.   Political influence: Smaller countries, such as  |Portugal|Portugal|  and  |Belgium|Belgium| , who do not carry much political clout on the international stage, are given a substantial increase in influence through membership in IGOs such as the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Also for countries with more influence such as  |France|France|  and  |Germany|Germany| , IGOs are beneficial as the nation increases influence in the smaller countries’ internal affairs and expanding other nations dependence on themselves, so to preserve allegiance.   Security: Membership in an IGO such as  |NATO|Nato|  gives security benefits to member countries. This provides an arena where political differences can be resolved.   Democracy: It has been noted that member countries experience a greater degree of democracy and those democracies survive longer.     Reasons for rejecting membership:     Loss of  |sovereignty|Sovereignty| , which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations . The organizations are thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.     Rather than by national jurisdiction, legal  |accountability|Accountability|  is intended to be ensured by legal mechanisms that are internal to the intergovernmental organization itself  and access to administrative tribunals. In the course of many court cases where private parties tried to pursue claims against international organizations, there has been a gradual realization that alternative means of dispute settlement are required as states have  |fundamental_human_rights|Fundamental_Human_Rights|  obligations to provide plaintiffs with access to court in view of their  |right_to_a_fair_trial|Right_To_A_Fair_Trial| .      Otherwise, the organizations’ immunities may be put in question in national and international courts.  Some organizations hold proceedings before tribunals relating to their organization to be confidential, and in some instances have threatened disciplinary action should an employee disclose any of the relevant information. Such confidentiality has been criticized as a lack of  |transparency|Transparency| .  , brettonwoodlaw.com, 11 September 2013     The immunities also extend to  |employment_law|Employment_Law| .   In this regard, immunity from national jurisdiction necessitates that reasonable alternative means are available to effectively protect employees’ rights;   in this context, a first instance Dutch court considered an estimated duration of proceedings before the  |Administrative_Tribunal_of_the_International_Labour_Organization|Administrative_Tribunal_Of_The_International_Labour_Organization|  of 15 years to be too long.  , dvdw.nl, 27 August 2013   :          These are some of the strengths and weaknesses of IGOs.     Strengths:     They hold state authority.   Their institutions are permanent.   They provide a forum for discussion.   They are issue-specific.   They provide information.   They allow multilateral co-operation.     Weaknesses:     Membership is limited. IGOs’ legal basis prohibit membership of private citizens, making them undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal state membership.   IGOs often overlap, resulting in an overly complex network.   States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the states’ ability to assert authority.   Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.     They can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.
