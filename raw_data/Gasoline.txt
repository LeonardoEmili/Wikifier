                 Gasoline , or petrol , is a colorless  |petroleum|Petroleum| -derived flammable liquid that is used primarily as a  |fuel|Fuel|  in  |spark_ignited|Spark_Ignition_Engine| |internal_combustion_engines|Internal_Combustion_Engine| . It consists mostly of  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound|  obtained by the  |fractional_distillation|Fractional_Distillation|  of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of  |additives|Gasoline_Additive| . On average, a   |barrel|Oil_Barrel|  of  |crude_oil|Petroleum|  yields about  of gasoline after processing in an  |oil_refinery|Oil_Refinery| , though this varies based on the  |crude_oil_assay|Crude_Oil_Assay| .     The characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early  is measured by its  |octane_rating|Octane_Rating|  which is produced in several grades.  |Tetraethyl_lead|Tetraethyl_Lead|  and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to increase octane rating . Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system cleaning. Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as  |ethanol|Ethanol| ,  |MTBE|Mtbe|  or  |ETBE|Etbe|  to improve combustion.     Gasoline used in internal combustion engines can have significant effects on the local environment, and is also a contributor to global human carbon dioxide emissions. Gasoline can also enter the environment uncombusted, both as liquid and as vapor, from leakage and handling during production, transport and delivery . As an example of efforts to control such leakage, many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks.  Gasoline contains  |benzene|Benzene|  and other known  |carcinogens|Carcinogen| .            Gasoline is an English word that refers to fuel for  |automobiles|Automobile| . The Oxford English Dictionary dates its first recorded use to 1863 when it was spelled gasolene . The term gasoline was first used in North America in 1864. See:    And provided, also, That naphtha of specific gravity exceeding eighty degrees, according to Baumes hydrometer, and of the kind usually known as gasoline, shall be subject to a tax of five per centum ad valorem. See   U.S. Patent no. 45,568 . From p. 2 of the text: One of the products obtained from the distillation of petroleum is a colorless liquid having an ethereal odor and being the lightest in specific gravity of all known liquids. This material is known now in commerce by the term gasoline. The word is a derivation from the word gas and the chemical suffixes -ol and -ine or -ene . gasoline, n., and gasoline, n., Oxford English Dictionary online edition     However, the term may also have been influenced by the trademark Cazeline or Gazeline . On 27 November 1862, the British publisher, coffee merchant and social campaigner  |John_Cassell|John_Cassell|  placed an advertisement in  The Times  of London:    This is the earliest occurrence of the word to have been found. Cassell discovered that a shopkeeper in Dublin named Samuel Boyd was selling counterfeit cazeline and wrote to him to ask him to stop. Boyd did not reply and changed every ‘C’ into a ‘G’, thus coining the word gazeline .      In most  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  countries, the product is called petrol , rather than gasoline . Petrol was first used in about 1870, as the name of a refined petroleum product sold by British wholesaler  |Carless_Capel_Leonard|Carless_Refining_And_Marketing_Ltd| , which marketed it as a  |solvent|Solvent| .  , vintagegarage.co.uk, accessed 5 August 2012 When the product later found a new use as a motor fuel,  |Frederick_Simms|Frederick_Richard_Simms| , an associate of  |Gottlieb_Daimler|Gottlieb_Daimler| , suggested to Carless that they register the trademark petrol ,   , The National Archives, accessed 5 August 2012 but by that time the word was already in general use, possibly inspired by the French pétrole, and the registration was not allowed. Carless registered a number of alternative names for the product, but petrol nonetheless became the common term for the fuel in the British Commonwealth.       British refiners originally used motor spirit as a generic name for the automotive fuel and aviation spirit for  |aviation_gasoline|Avgas| . When Carless was denied a trademark on petrol in the 1930s, its competitors switched to the more popular name petrol . However, motor spirit had already made its way into laws and regulations, so the term remains in use as a formal name for petrol.   The term is used most widely in Nigeria, where the largest petroleum companies call their product premium motor spirit .  Although petrol has made inroads into Nigerian English, premium motor spirit remains the formal name that is used in scientific publications, government reports, and newspapers.      The use of the word gasoline instead of petrol is uncommon outside North America, particularly given the usual shortening of gasoline to gas, because various forms of  |gas|Gas| eous products are also used as automotive fuel, such as  |compressed_natural_gas_|Compressed_Natural_Gas| ,  |liquefied_natural_gas_|Liquefied_Natural_Gas|  and  |liquefied_petroleum_gas_|Liquefied_Petroleum_Gas| . In many languages, the name of the product is derived from  |benzene|Benzene| , such as Benzin in German or benzina in Italian. Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay use the colloquial name nafta derived from that of the chemical  |naphtha|Naphtha| .        The first internal combustion engines suitable for use in transportation applications, so-called  |Otto_engines|Otto_Engine| , were developed in Germany during the last quarter of the 19th century. The fuel for these early engines was a relatively volatile  |hydrocarbon|Hydrocarbon|  obtained from  |coal_gas|Coal_Gas| . With a  |boiling_point|Boiling_Point|  near  , it was well-suited for early  |carburetors|Carburetor|  . The development of a spray nozzle carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels. Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher  |compression_ratios|Compression_Ratio| , but early attempts were blocked by the premature explosion of fuel, known as  |knocking|Engine_Knocking| .     In 1891, the  |Shukhov_cracking_process|Shukhov_Cracking_Process|  became the worlds first commercial method to break down heavier hydrocarbons in crude oil to increase the percentage of lighter products compared to simple distillation.         The evolution of gasoline followed the evolution of oil as the dominant source of energy in the industrializing world. Prior to World War One, Britain was the worlds greatest industrial power and depended on its navy to protect the shipping of raw materials from its colonies. Germany was also industrializing and, like Britain, lacked many natural resources which had to be shipped to the home country. By the 1890s, Germany began to pursue a policy of global prominence and began building a navy to compete with Britains. Coal was the fuel that powered their navies. Though both Britain and Germany had natural coal reserves, new developments in oil as a fuel for ships changed the situation. Coal-powered ships were a tactical weakness because the process of  |loading_coal|Coaling|  was extremely slow and dirty and left the ship completely vulnerable to attack, and unreliable supplies of coal at international ports made long-distance voyages impractical. The advantages of petroleum oil soon found the navies of the world converting to oil, but Britain and Germany had very few domestic oil reserves. Daniel Yergen, The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power, Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 150–63. Britain eventually solved its naval oil dependence by securing oil from  |Royal_Dutch_Shell|Royal_Dutch_Shell|  and the  |Anglo_Persian_Oil_Company|Anglo_Persian_Oil_Company|  and this determined from where and of what quality its gasoline would come.     During the early period of gasoline engine development, aircraft were forced to use motor vehicle gasoline since aviation gasoline did not yet exist. These early fuels were termed straight-run gasolines and were byproducts from the distillation of a single crude oil to produce  |kerosene|Kerosene| , which was the principal product sought for burning in  |kerosene_lamps|Kerosene_Lamp| . Gasoline production would not surpass kerosene production until 1916. The earliest straight-run gasolines were the result of distilling eastern crude oils and there was no mixing of distillates from different crudes. The composition of these early fuels was unknown and the quality varied greatly as crude oils from different oil fields emerged in different mixtures of hydrocarbons in different ratios. The engine effects produced by abnormal combustion  due to inferior fuels had not yet been identified, and as a result there was no rating of gasoline in terms of its resistance to abnormal combustion. The general specification by which early gasolines were measured was that of  |specific_gravity|Specific_Gravity|  via the  |Baumé_scale|Baumé_Scale|  and later the  |volatility|Volatility|  specified in terms of boiling points, which became the primary focuses for gasoline producers. These early eastern crude oil gasolines had relatively high Baumé test results and were called Pennsylvania High-Test or simply High-Test gasolines. These would often be used in aircraft engines.     By 1910, increased automobile production and the resultant increase in gasoline consumption produced a greater demand for gasoline. Also, the growing electrification of lighting produced a drop in kerosene demand, creating a supply problem. It appeared that the burgeoning oil industry would be trapped into over-producing kerosene and under-producing gasoline since simple distillation could not alter the ratio of the two products from any given crude. The solution appeared in 1911 when the development of the  |Burton_process|Burton_Process|  allowed  |thermal_cracking|Thermal_Cracking|  of crude oils, which increased the percent yield of gasoline from the heavier hydrocarbons. This was combined with expansion of foreign markets for the export of surplus kerosene which domestic markets no longer needed. These new thermally cracked gasolines were believed to have no harmful effects and would be added to straight-run gasolines. There also was the practice of mixing heavy and light distillates to achieve a desired Baumé reading and collectively these were called blended gasolines. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 1–4.     Gradually, volatility gained favor over the Baumé test, though both would continue to be used in combination to specify a gasoline. As late as June 1917,  |Standard_Oil|Standard_Oil|  stated that the most important property of a gasoline was its volatility.  It is estimated that the rating equivalent of these straight-run gasolines varied from 40 to 60 octane and that the High-Test , sometimes referred to as fighting grade , probably averaged 50 to 65 octane. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 10.       Prior to the  |American_entry_into_World_War_I|American_Entry_Into_World_War_I| , the European Allies used fuels derived from crude oils from Borneo, Java and Sumatra, which gave satisfactory performance in their military aircraft. When the United States entered the war in April 1917, the U.S. became the principal supplier of aviation gasoline to the Allies and a decrease in engine performance was noted.  Soon it was realized that motor vehicle fuels were unsatisfactory for aviation, and after the loss of a number of combat aircraft, attention turned to the quality of the gasolines being used. Later flight tests conducted in 1937 showed that an octane reduction of 13 points decreased engine performance by 20 percent and increased take-off distance by 45 percent. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 252 If abnormal combustion were to occur, the engine could lose enough power to make getting airborne impossible and a take-off roll became a threat to the pilot and aircraft.     On 2 August 1917, the  |United_States_Bureau_of_Mines|United_States_Bureau_Of_Mines|  arranged to study fuels for aircraft in cooperation with the Aviation Section of the  |U_S_Army_Signal_Corps|U_S_Army_Signal_Corps|  and a general survey concluded that no reliable data existed for the proper fuels for aircraft. As a result, flight tests began at Langley, McCook and Wright fields to determine how different gasolines performed under different conditions. These tests showed that in certain aircraft, motor vehicle gasolines performed as well as High-Test but in other types resulted in hot-running engines. It was also found that gasolines from aromatic and naphthenic base crude oils from California, South Texas and Venezuela resulted in smooth-running engines. These tests resulted in the first government specifications for motor gasolines in late 1917. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 3.         Engine designers knew that, according to the  |Otto_cycle|Otto_Cycle| , power and efficiency increased with compression ratio, but experience with early gasolines during World War I showed that higher compression ratios increased the risk of abnormal combustion, producing lower power, lower efficiency, hot-running engines and potentially severe engine damage. To compensate for these poor fuels, early engines used low compression ratios, which required relatively large, heavy engines to produce limited power and efficiency. The  |Wright_brothers|Wright_Brothers|  first gasoline engine used a compression ratio as low as 4.7-to-1, developed only  from  and weighed .   This was a major concern for aircraft designers and the needs of the aviation industry provoked the search for fuels that could be used in higher-compression engines.     Between 1917 and 1919, the amount of thermally cracked gasoline utilized almost doubled. Also, the use of  |natural_gasoline|Natural_Gasoline|  increased greatly. During this period, many U.S. states established specifications for motor gasoline but none of these agreed and were unsatisfactory from one standpoint or another. Larger oil refiners began to specify  |unsaturated|Saturated_And_Unsaturated_Compounds|  material percentage . In 1922, the U.S. government published the first specifications for aviation gasolines along with one Motor grade for automobiles. The gum test essentially eliminated thermally cracked gasoline from aviation usage and thus aviation gasolines reverted to fractionating straight-run naphthas or blending straight-run and highly treated thermally cracked naphthas. This situation persisted until 1929. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 6–9.     The automobile industry reacted to the increase in thermally cracked gasoline with alarm. Thermal cracking produced large amounts of both  |mono_|Olefin|  and  |diolefins|Diolefin|  , which increased the risk of gumming. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 74. Also the volatility was decreasing to the point that fuel did not vaporize and was sticking to  |spark_plugs|Spark_Plug|  and fouling them, creating hard starting and rough running in winter and sticking to cylinder walls, bypassing the pistons and rings and going into the crankcase oil.  One journal stated, ...on a multi-cylinder engine in a high-priced car we are diluting the oil in the crankcase as much as 40 percent in a 200-mile run, as the analysis of the oil in the oil-pan shows. Joseph E. Pogue, The Engine-Fuel Problem, The Journal of the Society of Automotive Engineers, September 1919, p. 232.  & rdidbook-Gcg6AQAAMAAJ & rdot1     Being very unhappy with the consequent reduction in overall gasoline quality, automobile manufacturers suggested imposing a quality standard on the oil suppliers. The oil industry in turn accused the automakers of not doing enough to improve vehicle economy, and the dispute became known within the two industries as The Fuel Problem . Animosity grew between the industries, each accusing the other of not doing anything to resolve matters, and relationships deteriorated. The situation was only resolved when the  |American_Petroleum_Institute|American_Petroleum_Institute|  initiated a conference to address The Fuel Problem and a Cooperative Fuel Research Committee was established in 1920 to oversee joint investigative programs and solutions. Apart from representatives of the two industries, the  |Society_of_Automotive_Engineers|Society_Of_Automotive_Engineers|  also played an instrumental role, with the  |U_S_Bureau_of_Standards|U_S_Bureau_Of_Standards|  being chosen as an impartial research organization to carry out many of the studies. Initially, all the programs were related to volatility and fuel consumption, ease of starting, crankcase oil dilution and acceleration.   p. 227.         With the increased use of thermally cracked gasolines came an increased concern regarding its effects on abnormal combustion, and this led to research for antiknock additives. In the late 1910s, researchers such as A.H. Gibson,  |Harry_Ricardo|Harry_Ricardo| ,  |Thomas_Midgley_Jr_|Thomas_Midgley_Jr_|  and Thomas Boyd began to investigate abnormal combustion. Beginning in 1916,  |Charles_F_Kettering|Charles_F_Kettering|  began investigating additives based on two paths, the high percentage solution  and the low percentage solution . The low percentage solution ultimately led to the discovery of  |tetraethyllead|Tetraethyllead|  in December 1921, a product of the research of Midgley and Boyd. This innovation started a cycle of improvements in  |fuel_efficiency|Fuel_Efficiency|  that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline. Ethanol could not be patented but TEL could, so Kettering secured a patent for TEL and began promoting it instead of other options.     The dangers of compounds containing  |lead|Lead|  were well-established by then and Kettering was directly warned by Robert Wilson of MIT, Reid Hunt of Harvard, Yandell Henderson of Yale, and Charles Kraus of the University of Potsdam in Germany about its use. Kraus had worked on tetraethyllead for many years and called it a creeping and malicious poison that had killed a member of his dissertation committee.   On 27 October 1924, newspaper articles around the nation told of the workers at the Standard Oil refinery near  |Elizabeth_New_Jersey|Elizabeth_New_Jersey|  who were producing TEL and were suffering from  |lead_poisoning|Lead_Poisoning| . By 30 October, the death toll had reached five. In November, the New Jersey Labor Commission closed the Bayway refinery and a grand jury investigation was started which had resulted in no charges by February 1925. Leaded gasoline sales were banned in New York City, Philadelphia and New Jersey.  |General_Motors|General_Motors| ,  |DuPont|Dupont| , and Standard Oil, who were partners in  |Ethyl_Corporation|Ethyl_Corporation| , the company created to produce TEL, began to argue that there were no alternatives to leaded gasoline that would maintain fuel efficiency and still prevent engine knocking. After flawed studies determined that TEL-treated gasoline was not a public health issue, the controversy subsided.         In the five-year period prior to 1929, a great amount of experimentation was conducted on different testing methods for determining fuel resistance to abnormal combustion. It appeared engine knocking was dependent on a wide variety of parameters including compression, cylinder temperature, air-cooled or water-cooled engines, chamber shapes, intake temperatures, lean or rich mixtures and others. This led to a confusing variety of test engines that gave conflicting results, and no standard rating scale existed. By 1929, it was recognized by most aviation gasoline manufacturers and users that some kind of antiknock rating must be included in government specifications. In 1929, the  |octane_rating|Octane_Rating|  scale was adopted, and in 1930 the first octane specification for aviation fuels was established. In the same year, the  |U_S_Army_Air_Force|U_S_Army_Air_Force|  specified fuels rated at 87 octane for its aircraft as a result of studies it conducted. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 22.     During this period, research showed that hydrocarbon structure was extremely important to the antiknocking properties of fuel. Straight-chain  |paraffins|Alkane|  in the boiling range of gasoline had low antiknock qualities while ring-shaped molecules such as  |aromatic_hydrocarbons|Aromatic_Hydrocarbon|   had higher resistance to knocking. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 20. This development led to the search for processes that would produce more of these compounds from crude oils than achieved under straight distillation or thermal cracking. Research by the major refiners into conversion processes yielded isomerization, dehydration, and alkylation that could change the cheap and abundant  |butane|Butane|  into  |isooctane|Isooctane| , which became an important component in aviation fuel blending. To further complicate the situation, as engine performance increased, the altitude that aircraft could reach also increased, which resulted in concerns about the fuel freezing. The average temperature decrease is  per  increase in altitude, and at , the temperature can approach . Additives like benzene, with a freezing point of , would freeze in the gasoline and plug fuel lines. Substitute aromatics such as  |toluene|Toluene| ,  |xylene|Xylene|  and  |cumene|Cumene|  combined with limited benzene solved the problem. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 34.     By 1935, there were seven different aviation grades based on octane rating, two Army grades, four Navy grades and three commercial grades including the introduction of 100-octane aviation gasoline. By 1937 the Army established 100-octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and to add to the confusion, the government now recognized 14 different grades, in addition to 11 others in foreign countries. With some companies required to stock 14 grades of aviation fuel, none of which could be interchanged, the effect on the refiners was negative. The refining industry could not concentrate on large capacity conversion processes for so many different grades and a solution had to be found. By 1941, principally through the efforts of the Cooperative Fuel Research Committee, the number of grades for aviation fuels was reduced to three: 73, 91 and 100 octane. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 12–19.     In 1937,  |Eugene_Houdry|Eugene_Houdry|  developed the Houdry process of  |catalytic_cracking|Catalytic_Cracking| , which produced a high-octane base stock of gasoline which was superior to the thermally cracked product since it did not contain the high concentration of olefins. In 1940, there were only 14 Houdry units in operation in the U.S.; by 1943, this had increased to 77, either of the Houdry process or of the Thermofor Catalytic or Fluid Catalyst type. Matthew Van Winkle, Aviation Gasoline Manufacture, McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 94–95.     The search for fuels with octane ratings above 100 led to the extension of the scale by comparing power output. A fuel designated grade 130 would produce 130 percent as much power in an engine as it would running on pure iso-octane. During WW II, fuels above 100-octane were given two ratings, a rich and lean mixture and these would be called performance numbers . 100-octane aviation gasoline would be referred to as 130/100 grade. Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, Aviation Gasoline Production and Control, Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September, 1947, p. 2              Oil and its byproducts, especially high-octane aviation gasoline, would prove to be a driving concern for how Germany conducted the war. As a result of the lessons of World War I, Germany had stockpiled oil and gasoline for its  |blitzkrieg|Blitzkrieg|  offensive and had annexed Austria, adding 18,000 barrels per day of oil production, but this was not sufficient to sustain the planned conquest of Europe. Because captured supplies and oil fields would be necessary to fuel the campaign, the German high command created a special squad of oil-field experts drawn from the ranks of domestic oil industries. They were sent in to put out oil-field fires and get production going again as soon as possible. But capturing oil fields remained an obstacle throughout the war. During the  |Invasion_of_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland| , German estimates of gasoline consumption turned out to be vastly underestimated.  |Heinz_Guderian|Heinz_Guderian|  and his  |Panzer_divisions|Panzer_Division|  consumed nearly  of gasoline per mile on the drive to  |Vienna|Vienna| . When they were engaged in combat across open country, gasoline consumption almost doubled. On the second day of battle, a unit of the XIX Corps was forced to halt when it ran out of gasoline. Robert W. Czeschin, The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s, Agora Inc., 1988, pp. 13–14. One of the major objectives of the Polish invasion was their oil fields but the Soviets invaded and captured 70 percent of the Polish production before the Germans could reach it. Through the  |German_Soviet_Commercial_Agreement_|German_Soviet_Commercial_Agreement| , Stalin agreed in vague terms to supply Germany with additional oil equal to that produced by now Soviet-occupied Polish oil fields at Drohobych and Boryslav in exchange for hard coal and steel tubing.     Even after the Nazis conquered the vast territories of Europe, this did not help the gasoline shortage. This area had never been self-sufficient in oil before the war. In 1938, the area that would become Nazi-occupied would produce 575,000 barrels per day. In 1940, total production under German control amounted to only 234,550 barrels—a shortfall of 59 percent. Robert W. Czeschin, The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s, Agora Inc., 1988, p. 17. By the spring of 1941 and the depletion of German gasoline reserves,  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  saw the invasion of Russia to seize the Polish oil fields and the Russian oil in the Caucasus as the solution to the German gasoline shortage. As early as July 1941, following the 22 June start of  |Operation_Barbarossa|Operation_Barbarossa| , certain Luftwaffe squadrons were forced to curtail ground support missions due to shortages of aviation gasoline. On 9 October, the German quartermaster general estimated that army vehicles were 24,000 barrels short of gasoline requirements. Robert W. Czeschin, The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s, Agora Inc., 1988, p. 19.     Virtually all of Germanys aviation gasoline came from synthetic oil plants that hydrogenated coals and coal tars. These processes had been developed during the 1930s as an effort to achieve fuel independence. There were two grades of aviation gasoline produced in volume in Germany, the B-4 or blue grade and the C-3 or green grade, which accounted for about two-thirds of all production. B-4 was equivalent to 89-octane and the C-3 was roughly equal to the U.S. 100-octane, though lean mixture was rated around 95-octane and was poorer than the U.S. Maximum output achieved in 1943 reached 52,200 barrels a day before the Allies decided to target the synthetic fuel plants. Through captured enemy aircraft and analysis of the gasoline found in them, both the Allies and the Axis powers were aware of the quality of the aviation gasoline being produced and this prompted an octane race to achieve the advantage in aircraft performance. Later in the war the C-3 grade was improved to where it was equivalent to the U.S. 150 grade .          Japan, like Germany, had almost no domestic oil supply and by the late 1930s produced only 7% of its own oil while importing the rest – 80% from the United States. As Japanese aggression grew in China  and news reached the American public of Japanese bombing of civilian centers, especially the bombing of Chungking, public opinion began to support a U.S. embargo. A Gallup poll in June 1939 found that 72 percent of the American public supported an embargo on war materials to Japan. This increased tensions between the U.S. and Japan led to the U.S. placing restrictions on exports and in July 1940 the U.S. issued a proclamation that banned the export of 87 octane or higher aviation gasoline to Japan. This ban did not hinder the Japanese as their aircraft could operate with fuels below 87 octane and if needed they could add  |TEL|Tetraethyllead|  to increase the octane. As it turned out, Japan bought 550 percent more sub-87 octane aviation gasoline in the five months after the July 1940 ban on higher octane sales. Daniel Yergin, The Prize, Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 310–12 The possibility of a complete ban of gasoline from America created friction in the Japanese government as to what action to take to secure more supplies from the Dutch East Indies and demanded greater oil exports from the exiled Dutch government after the  |Battle_of_the_Netherlands|Battle_Of_The_Netherlands| . This action prompted the U.S. to move its Pacific fleet from Southern California to Pearl Harbor to help stiffen British resolve to stay in Indochina. With the  |Japanese_invasion_of_French_Indochina|Japanese_Invasion_Of_French_Indochina|  in September 1940 came great concerns about the possible Japanese invasion of the Dutch Indies to secure their oil. After the U.S. banned all exports of steel and iron scrap, the next day Japan signed the  |Tripartite_Pact|Tripartite_Pact|  and this led Washington to fear that a complete U.S. oil embargo would prompt the Japanese to invade the Dutch East Indies. On 16 June 1941 Harold Ickes, who was appointed Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, stopped a shipment of oil from Philadelphia to Japan in light of the oil shortage on the East coast due to increased exports to Allies. He also telegrammed all oil suppliers on the East coast not to ship any oil to Japan without his permission. President Roosevelt countermanded Ickes orders telling Ickes that the ... I simply have not got enough Navy to go around and every little episode in the Pacific means fewer ships in the Atlantic . Daniel Yergin, The Prize, Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 316–17 On 25 July 1941 the U.S. froze all Japanese financial assets and licenses would be required for each use of the frozen funds including oil purchases that could produce aviation gasoline. On 28 July 1941 Japan invaded southern Indochina.     The debate inside the Japanese government as to its oil and gasoline situation was leading to invasion of the Dutch East Indies but this would mean war with the U.S. whose Pacific fleet was a threat to their flank. This situation led to the decision to attack the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor before proceeding with the Dutch East Indies invasion. On 7 December 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the next day the Netherlands declared war on Japan which initiated the  |Dutch_East_Indies_campaign|Dutch_East_Indies_Campaign| . But the Japanese missed a golden opportunity at Pearl Harbor. All of the oil for the fleet was in surface tanks at the time of Pearl Harbor, Admiral Chester Nimitz, who became Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, was later to say. We had about 4 1/2 million barrels of oil out there and all of it was vulnerable to .50 caliber bullets. Had the Japanese destroyed the oil, he added, it would have prolonged the war another two years. Daniel Yergen, The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power, Simon & Schuster, 1992, p. 327         Early in 1944, William Boyd, president of the American Petroleum Institute and chairman of the Petroleum Industry War Council said: The Allies may have floated to victory on a wave of oil in World War I, but in this infinitely greater World War II, we are flying to victory on the wings of petroleum . In December, 1941 the United States had 385,000 oil wells producing 1.4 billion barrels of oil a year and 100-octane aviation gasoline capacity was at 40,000 barrels a day. By 1944 the U.S. was producing over 1.5 billion barrels a year and the petroleum industry had built 122 new plants for the production of 100-octane aviation gasoline and capacity was over 400,000 barrels a day – an increase of more than ten-fold. It was estimated that the U.S. was producing enough 100-octane aviation gasoline to permit the dropping of 20,000 tons of bombs on the enemy every day of the year. The record of gasoline consumption by the Army prior to June, 1943 was uncoordinated as each supply service of the Army purchased its own petroleum products and no centralized system of control nor records existed. On 1 June 1943 the Army created the Fuels and Lubricants Division of the Quartermaster Corps and from their records they tabulated that the Army purchased over 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline for delivery to overseas theaters between 1 June 1943 through August, 1945. That figure does not include gasoline used by the Army inside the United States. Erna Risch and Chester L. Kieffer, United States Army in World War II, The Technical Services, The Quartermaster Corps: Organization, Supply, and Services, Office of the CHief of Military History, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., 1955, p. 128-129 Motor fuel production had declined from 701,000,000 barrels in 1941 down to 608,000,000 barrels in 1943. Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, The American Year Book – 1946, Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, p. 499 World War II marked the first time in U.S. history that gasoline was rationed and the government imposed price controls to prevent inflation. Gasoline consumption per automobile declined from 755 gallons per year in 1941 down to 540 gallons in 1943 with the goal of preserving rubber for tires since the Japanese had cut the U.S. off from over 90 percent of its rubber supply which had come from the Dutch East Indies and the U.S. synthetic rubber industry was in its infancy. Average gasoline prices went from an all-time record low of $0.1275 per gallon in 1940 to $0.1448 per gallon in 1945. Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, The American Year Book – 1946, Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, pp. 512–18     Even with the worlds largest aviation gasoline production, the U.S. military still found that more was needed. Throughout the duration of the war, aviation gasoline supply was always behind requirements and this impacted training and operations. The reason for this shortage developed before the war even began. The free market did not support the expense of producing 100-octane aviation fuel in large volume, especially during the Great Depression. Iso-octane in the early development stage cost $30 a gallon and even by 1934 it was still $2 a gallon compared to $0.18 for motor gasoline when the Army decided to experiment with 100-octane for its combat aircraft. Though only 3 percent of U.S. combat aircraft in 1935 could take full advantage of the higher octane due to low compression ratios, the Army saw the need for increasing performance warranted the expense and purchased 100,000 gallons. By 1937 the Army established 100-octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and by 1939 production was only 20,000 barrels a day. In effect, the U.S. military was the only market for 100-octane aviation gasoline and as war broke out in Europe this created a supply problem that persisted throughout the duration.

Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, The American Year Book – 1944, Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1945, p. 509     With the war in Europe in 1939 a reality, all predictions of 100-octane consumption were outrunning all possible production. Neither the Army nor the Navy could contract more than six months in advance for fuel and they could not supply the funds for plant expansion. Without a long term guaranteed market the petroleum industry would not risk its capital to expand production for a product that only the government would buy. The solution to the expansion of storage, transportation, finances and production was the creation of the Defense Supplies Corporation on 19 September 1940. The Defense Supplies Corporation would buy, transport and store all aviation gasoline for the Army and Navy at cost plus a carrying fee. Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, Aviation Gasoline Production and Control, Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September 1947, p. 4      When the Allied breakout after D-Day found their armies stretching their supply lines to a dangerous point, the makeshift solution was the  |Red_Ball_Express|Red_Ball_Express| . But even this soon was inadequate. The trucks in the convoys had to drive longer distances as the armies advanced and they were consuming a greater percentage of the same gasoline they were trying to deliver. In 1944, General George Pattons Third Army finally stalled just short of the German border after running out of gasoline. The general was so upset at the arrival of a truckload of rations instead of gasoline he was reported to have shouted: Hell, they send us food, when they know we can fight without food but not without oil. Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, The American Year Book – 1946, Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, p. 498 The solution had to wait for the repairing of the railroad lines and bridges so that the more efficient trains could replace the gasoline consuming truck convoys.       The development of jet engines burning kerosene-based fuels during WW II for aircraft produced a superior performing propulsion system than internal combustion engines could offer and the U.S. military forces gradually replaced their piston combat aircraft with jet powered planes. This development would essentially remove the military need for ever increasing octane fuels and eliminated government support for the refining industry to pursue the research and production of such exotic and expensive fuels. Commercial aviation was slower to adapt to jet propulsion and until 1958 when the  |Boeing_707|Boeing_707|  first entered commercial service, piston powered airliners still relied on aviation gasoline. But commercial aviation had greater economic concerns than the maximum performance that the military could afford. As octane numbers increased so did the cost of gasoline but the incremental increase in efficiency becomes less as compression ratio goes up. This reality set a practical limit to how high compression ratios could increase relative to how expensive the gasoline would become.  Last produced in 1955, the  |Pratt_Whitney_R_4360_Wasp_Major|Pratt_Whitney_R_4360_Wasp_Major|  was using 115/145 Aviation gasoline and producing 1 horsepower per cubic inch at 6.7 compression ratio and 1 pound of engine weight to produce 1.1 horsepower. This compares to the Wright Brothers engine needing almost 17 pounds of engine weight to produce 1 horsepower.     The US automobile industry after WWII could not take advantage of the high octane fuels then available. Automobile compression ratios increased from an average of 5.3-to-1 in 1931 to just 6.7-to-1 in 1946. The average octane number of regular grade motor gasoline increased from 58 to 70 during the same time. Military aircraft were using expensive turbo-supercharged engines that cost at least 10 times as much per horsepower as automobile engines and had to be overhauled every 700 to 1,000 hours. The automobile market could not support such expensive engines.  It would not be until 1957 that the first US automobile manufacturer could mass-produce an engine that would produce one horsepower per cubic inch, the Chevrolet 283  hp/283 cubic inch V-8 engine option in the Corvette. At $485 this was an expensive option that few consumers could afford and would only appeal to the performance oriented consumer market willing to pay for the premium fuel required.  This engine had an advertised compression ratio of 10.5-to-1 and the 1958 AMA Specifications stated the octane requirement was 96-100 RON.  At  , it took  of engine weight to make .      In the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels, and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors. The 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline. These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other antiknock compounds. Subsequently, low-sulfur gasoline was introduced, in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems.                  Gasoline is produced in  |oil_refineries|Oil_Refinery| . Roughly  of gasoline is derived from a  barrel of  |crude_oil|Crude_Oil| .  Material separated from crude oil via  |distillation|Distillation| , called virgin or straight-run gasoline, does not meet specifications for modern engines , but can be pooled to the gasoline blend.     The bulk of a typical gasoline consists of a homogeneous mixture of small, relatively lightweight  |hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon|  with between 4 and 12  |carbon|Carbon|  atoms per molecule . Werner Dabelstein, Arno Reglitzky, Andrea Schütze and Klaus Reders Automotive Fuels in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  It is a mixture of paraffins , olefins  and  |cycloalkanes|Cycloalkane|  . The usage of the terms paraffin and olefin in place of the standard chemical nomenclature alkane and alkene, respectively, is particular to the oil industry. The actual ratio of molecules in any gasoline depends upon:   the oil refinery that makes the gasoline, as not all refineries have the same set of processing units;   the  |crude_oil|Crude_Oil|  feed used by the refinery;   the grade of gasoline .     The various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics. Some important streams include:   straight-run gasoline, commonly referred to as naphtha, which is distilled directly from crude oil. Once the leading source of fuel, its low octane rating required lead additives. It is low in aromatics and contains some cycloalkanes and no olefins . Between 0 and 20 percent of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline, because the supply of this fraction is insufficient and its  |RON|Octane_Ratingresearch_Octane_Number|  is too low. The chemical properties  of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through  |reforming|Catalytic_Reforming|  and  |isomerisation|Isomerisation| . However, before feeding those units, the naphtha needs to be split into light and heavy naphtha. Straight-run gasoline can also be used as a feedstock for steam-crackers to produce olefins.   reformate, produced in a  |catalytic_reformer|Catalytic_Reformer| , has a high octane rating with high aromatic content and relatively low olefin content. Most of the  |benzene|Benzene| ,  |toluene|Toluene|  and  |xylene|Xylene|   are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent.   catalytic cracked gasoline, or catalytic cracked  |naphtha|Petroleum_Naphtha| , produced with a  |catalytic_cracker|Fluid_Catalytic_Cracking| , has a moderate octane rating, high olefin content and moderate aromatic content.   hydrocrackate , produced with a  |hydrocracker|Hydrocracker| , has a medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels.   alkylate is produced in an  |alkylation|Alkylation|  unit, using  |isobutane|Isobutane|  and olefins as feedstocks. Finished alkylate contains no aromatics or olefins and has a high MON.   isomerate is obtained by isomerizing low-octane straight-run gasoline into iso-paraffins . Isomerate has a medium RON and MON, but no aromatics or olefins.   butane is usually blended in the gasoline pool, although the quantity of this stream is limited by the RVP specification.     The terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies.     Currently, many countries set limits on gasoline  |aromatics|Aromatic|  in general, benzene in particular, and olefin content. Such regulations have led to an increasing preference for high-octane pure paraffin components, such as alkylate, and are forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content. In the European Union, the benzene limit is set at 1% by volume for all grades of automotive gasoline.     Gasoline can also contain other  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound| , such as  |organic_ethers|Organic_Ether|  , plus small levels of contaminants, in particular  |organosulfur|Organosulfur|  compounds .                  The  |specific_gravity|Specific_Gravity|  of gasoline is from 0.71 to 0.77,  with higher densities having a greater volume of aromatics. Finished marketable gasoline is traded with a standard reference of , and its price is escalated or de-escalated according to its actual density. Because of its low density, gasoline floats on water, and so water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless applied in a fine mist.         Quality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly, but as gasoline is a mixture rather than a single compound, it will break down slowly over time due to the separation of the components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long-term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a  |fuel_injection|Fuel_Injection|  system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate . Gasoline should ideally be stored in an airtight container  that can withstand the  |vapor_pressure|Vapor_Pressure|  of the gasoline without venting at a stable cool temperature . When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may result, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called stale fuel . Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids or two phases .     The presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank or fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly, though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long-term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing  |mineral_spirits|Mineral_Spirits| ,  |isopropyl_alcohol|Isopropyl_Alcohol| ,  |1_2_4_trimethylbenzene|1_2_4_Trimethylbenzene|  or  |other_additives|Gasoline_Additive| . Fuel stabilizers are commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is sporadic or seasonal . Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.     Gasoline stability requirements are set by the standard  |ASTM|Astm_International|  D4814. This standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines.         A gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine obtains energy from the combustion of gasolines various hydrocarbons with oxygen from the ambient air, yielding  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and  |water|Water|  as exhaust. The combustion of octane, a representative species, performs the chemical reaction:     2 C8H18 + 25 O2 - /chem  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Magazines1936  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  !-- This section is linked from  |Lead|Lead|  --  ref name WashingtonPostCrime  /ref ref name BusinessDayCrime  /ref ref name Reyes  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref nameUllmann/  ref  /ref !---See  if template link fails---  ref /ref  ref nameUllmann/  ref  /ref  ref name Government to take a call on ethanol price soon  /ref ref name India to raise ethanol blending in gasoline to 10%  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref name US Energy Information Administration  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref name gasoline Sniffing Fact File  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  .
