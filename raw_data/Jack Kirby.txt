The Lee–Kirby titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, largely in the realm of authorship credit and creators rights, Kirby left the company for rival DC.     At DC, Kirby created his  |Fourth_World|Fourth_World|  saga which spanned several comics titles. While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled, the Fourth Worlds  |New_Gods|New_Gods|  have continued as a significant part of the  |DC_Universe|Dc_Universe| .

In his later years, Kirby, who has been called the  |William_Blake|William_Blake|  of comics ,  began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments, and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the  |Will_Eisner_Comic_Book_Hall_of_Fame|The_Will_Eisner_Award_Hall_Of_Fame| . In 2017, Kirby was posthumously named a  |Disney_Legend|Disney_Legend|  with Lee for their co-creations not only in the field of publishing, but also because those creations formed the basis for  |The_Walt_Disney_Companys|The_Walt_Disney_Company|  financially and critically successful media franchise, the  |Marvel_Cinematic_Universe|Marvel_Cinematic_Universe| .     Kirby was married to Rosalind Goldstein in 1942. They had four children and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994, at the age of 76.

Jack Kirby. ABDO Group, 2006. , p. 4 In his youth, Kirby desired to escape his neighborhood. He liked to draw, and sought out places he could learn more about art.  Essentially self-taught,  Kirby cited among his influences the  |comic_strip|Comic_Strip|  artists  |Milton_Caniff|Milton_Caniff| ,  |Hal_Foster|Hal_Foster| , and  |Alex_Raymond|Alex_Raymond| , as well as such editorial cartoonists as  |C.H._Sykes|Charles_Henry_Sykes| ,  |Ding_Darling|Jay_Norwood_Darling| , and  |Rollin_Kirby|Rollin_Kirby| . He was rejected by  |the_Educational_Alliance|The_Educational_Alliance|  because he drew too fast with charcoal , according to Kirby. He later found an outlet for his skills by drawing cartoons for the newspaper of the Boys Brotherhood Republic, a miniature city on East 3rd Street where street kids ran their own government. Jones, p. 196     At age 14, Kirby enrolled at the  |Pratt_Institute|Pratt_Institute|  in  |Brooklyn|Brooklyn| , leaving after a week. I wasnt the kind of student that Pratt was looking for. They wanted people who would work on something forever. I didnt want to work on any project forever. I intended to get things done .  Reprinted in           Kirby joined the Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936, working there on newspaper comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First!!! . He remained until late 1939, when he began working for the movie  |animation|Animation|  company  |Fleischer_Studios|Fleischer_Studios|  as an  |inbetweener|Inbetweening|  on  Popeye  cartoons at the same time in 1935. He left the Studio before the Fleischer strike in 1937.  at Cartoon Research.com. I went from Lincoln to Fleischer, he recalled. From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldnt take that kind of thing, describing it as a factory in a sense, like my fathers factory. They were manufacturing pictures. Interview, The Comics Journal 134, reprinted in George, p. 24     Around that time, the American comic book industry was booming. Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic-book packager  |Eisner_&_Iger|Eisner_&_Iger| , one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers. Through that company, Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work, for Wild Boy Magazine. Interview, The Nostalgia Journal 30, November 1976, reprinted in George, p. 3 This included such strips as the science fiction adventure The Diary of Dr. Hayward , the  |Western|Western_Comics|  crimefighter feature Wilton of the West , the  |swashbuckler|Swashbuckler|  adventure The Count of Monte Cristo , and the humor features Abdul Jones  and Socko the Seadog , all variously for  Jumbo Comics  and other Eisner-Iger clients.  at the Grand Comics Database. He first used the surname Kirby as the pseudonymous Lance Kirby in two Lone Rider Western stories in  |Eastern_Color_Printings|Eastern_Color_Printing|   Famous Funnies  63–64 . He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor  |James_Cagney|James_Cagney| . However, he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage. Jones, p. 197       Kirby moved on to comic-book publisher and newspaper syndicator  |Fox_Feature_Syndicate|Fox_Feature_Syndicate| , earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle , published from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous  |Charles_Nicholas|Charles_Nicholas| , a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor  |Joe_Simon|Joe_Simon| , who in addition to his staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, I loved Jacks work and the first time I saw it I couldnt believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of  |Blue_Bolt|Blue_Bolt|  through ... about 25 years.      After leaving Fox and collaborating on the premiere issue of  |Fawcett_Comics|Fawcett_Comics|   Captain Marvel Adventures ,  at the  |Grand_Comics_Database|Grand_Comics_Database| . the first solo title for the previously introduced superhero, and for which Kirby was told to mimic creator  |C.C._Becks|C.C._Beck|  drawing style,  the duo were hired on staff at  |pulp_magazine|Pulp_Magazine|  publisher  |Martin_Goodmans|Martin_Goodman| |Timely_Comics|Timely_Comics|  . There Simon and Kirby created the patriotic superhero  |Captain_America|Captain_America|  in late 1940.  Simon, who became the companys editor, with Kirby as art director, said he negotiated with Goodman to give the duo 25 percent of the profits from the feature.  The first issue of Captain America Comics, released in early 1941,  sold out in days, and the second issues print run was set at over a million copies. The titles success established the team as a notable creative force in the industry. Jones, p. 200 After the first issue was published, Simon asked Kirby to join the Timely staff as the companys art director. Ro, p. 21     With the success of the Captain America character, Simon said he felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised percentage of profits, and so sought work for the two of them at  |National_Comics_Publications|National_Comics_Publications|  . Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week, as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely. Ro, p. 25-26 The pair feared Goodman would not pay them if he found they were moving to National, but many people knew of their plan, including Timely editorial assistant  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee| . Ro, p. 27 When Goodman eventually discovered it, he told Simon and Kirby to leave after finishing work on Captain America Comics 10.     Kirby and Simon spent their first weeks at National trying to devise new characters while the company sought how best to utilize the pair. Ro, p. 28 After a few failed editor-assigned ghosting assignments, Nationals  |Jack_Liebowitz|Jack_Liebowitz|  told them to just do what you want . The pair then revamped the  |Sandman|Sandman|  feature in  Adventure Comics  and created the superhero  |Manhunter|Manhunter| . Ro, p. 30  In July 1942 they began the  Boy Commandos  feature. The ongoing kid gang series of the same name, launched later that same year, was the creative teams first National feature to graduate into its own title.

Wallace 1940s in Dolan, p. 41 Joe Simon and Jack Kirby took their talents to a second title with Star-Spangled Comics, tackling both the Guardian and the Newsboy Legion in issue 7. In 2010, DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that Like  |Jerry_Siegel|Jerry_Siegel|  and  |Joe_Shuster|Joe_Shuster| , the creative team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby was a mark of quality and a proven track record.        With World War II underway, Liebowitz expected that Simon and Kirby would be  |drafted|Conscription_In_The_United_States| , so he asked the artists to create an inventory of material to be published in their absence. The pair hired writers, inkers, letterers, and colorists in order to create a years worth of material. Kirby was drafted into the  |U.S._Army|United_States_Army|  on June 7, 1943. Ro, p. 33 After basic training at  |Camp_Stewart|Camp_Stewart| , near Savannah, Georgia, he was assigned to Company F of the  |11th_Infantry_Regiment|11Th_Infantry_Regiment| . Evanier, p. 67 He landed on  |Omaha_Beach|Omaha_Beach|  in  |Normandy|Normandy|  on August 23, 1944, two-and-a-half months after  |D-Day|D-Day| , although Kirbys reminiscences would place his arrival just 10 days after. Kirby recalled that a lieutenant, learning that comics artist Kirby was in his command, made him a scout who would advance into towns and draw  |reconnaissance|Reconnaissance|  maps and pictures, an extremely dangerous duty. Ro, p. 35          After the war, Simon arranged work for Kirby and himself at  |Harvey_Comics|Harvey_Comics| , Ro, p. 45 where, through the early 1950s, the duo created such titles as the kid-gang adventure Boy Explorers Comics, the kid-gang  |Western|Western_Comics|   Boys Ranch , the superhero comic Stuntman, and, in vogue with the fad for  |3-D_movies|3D_Film| ,  Captain 3-D . Simon and Kirby additionally freelanced for  |Hillman_Periodicals|Hillman_Periodicals|   and for  |Crestwood_Publications|Crestwood_Publications|  .     The team found its greatest success in the postwar period by creating  |romance_comics|Romance_Comics| . Simon, inspired by  |Macfadden_Publications|Macfadden_Publications|  romantic-confession magazine True Story, transplanted the idea to comic books and with Kirby created a first-issue mock-up of  Young Romance . Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. The Comic Book Makers ; reissued , pp. 123-125 Showing it to Crestwood general manager Maurice Rosenfeld, Simon asked for 50% of the comics profits. Crestwood publishers Teddy Epstein and Mike Bleier agreed, stipulating that the creators would take no money up front. Evanier, King of Comics. p. 72 Young Romance 1 became Jack and Joes biggest hit in years . Ro, p. 46 The pioneering title sold a staggering 92% of its print run, inspiring Crestwood to increase the print run by the third issue to triple the initial number of copies.  Initially published bimonthly, Young Romance quickly became a monthly title and produced the spin-off  Young Love —together the two titles sold two million copies per month, according to Simon Simon, p. 125 —later joined by Young Brides and In Love, the latter featuring full-length romance stories . Young Romance spawned dozens of imitators from publishers such as Timely,  |Fawcett|Fawcett_Comics| ,  |Quality|Quality_Comics| , and  |Fox_Feature_Syndicate|Fox_Feature_Syndicate| . Despite the glut, the Simon and Kirby romance titles continued to sell millions of copies a month.     Bitter that  |Timely_Comics|Timely_Comics|  1950s iteration,  |Atlas_Comics|Atlas_Comics| , had relaunched Captain America in a new series in 1954, Kirby and Simon created  Fighting American . Simon recalled, We thought wed show them how to do Captain America . Ro, p.  While the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an  |anti-Communist|Anti-Communism|  dramatic hero, Simon and Kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue, in the aftermath of the  |Army-McCarthy_hearings|Army-Mccarthy_Hearings|  and the public backlash against the Red-baiting U.S. Senator  |Joseph_McCarthy|Joseph_Mccarthy| . Ro,        At the urging of a Crestwood salesman, Kirby and Simon launched their own comics company,  |Mainline_Publications|Mainline_Publications| ,  securing a distribution deal with Leader News  in late 1953 or early 1954, subletting space from their friend  |Al_Harveys|Al_Harvey| |Harvey_Publications|Harvey_Publications|  at 1860 Broadway.

Upon review, the pairs attorneys stated the company owed them $130,000 for work done over the past seven years. Crestwood paid them $10,000 in addition to their recent delayed payments. The partnership between Kirby and Simon had become strained. Ro, p. 56 Simon left the industry for a career in advertising, while Kirby continued to freelance. He wanted to do other things and I stuck with comics, Kirby recalled in 1971. It was fine. There was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends.  Transcribed in  The Nostalgia Journal  August 1976. Reprinted in George, p. 16     At this point in the mid-1950s, Kirby made a temporary return to the former  |Timely_Comics|Timely_Comics| , now known as Atlas Comics, the direct predecessor of  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics| . Inker  |Frank_Giacoia|Frank_Giacoia|  had approached editor-in-chief Stan Lee for work and suggested he could get Kirby back here to pencil some stuff. Ro, p. 60 While freelancing for National Comics Publications, the future  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| , Kirby drew 20 stories for Atlas from 1956 to 1957: Beginning with the five-page Mine Field in Battleground 14 , Kirby penciled and in some cases inked  and wrote stories of the  |Western|Western_Comics|  hero  |Black_Rider|Black_Rider| , the  |Fu_Manchu|Fu_Manchu| -like  |Yellow_Claw|Yellow_Claw| , and more. Kirbys 1956-57 Atlas work appeared in nine issues, plus three more published later after being held in inventory, per  In roughly chronological order: Battleground 14 , Astonishing 56 , Strange Tales of the Unusual 7 , Quick-Trigger Western 16 ,  Yellow Claw  2-4 , Black Rider Rides Again 1, a.k.a. Black Rider vol. 2, 1 , and Two Gun Western 12 , plus the inventoried  Gunsmoke Western  47 and 51 and  Kid Colt Outlaw  86 But in 1957, distribution troubles caused the Atlas implosion that resulted in several series being dropped and no new material being assigned for many months. It would be the following year before Kirby returned to the nascent Marvel.     For DC around this time, Kirby co-created with writers Dick and Dave Wood the non-superpowered adventuring quartet the  |Challengers_of_the_Unknown|Challengers_Of_The_Unknown|  in  Showcase  6 ,  |Irvine,_Alex|Alexander_C._Irvine|  1950s in Dolan, p. 84: Kirbys first solo project was a test run of a non-super hero adventure team called Challengers of the Unknown. Appearing for the first time in Showcase 6, the team would make a few more Showcase appearances before springing into their own title in May 1958. while contributing to such anthologies as  House of Mystery . During 30 months freelancing for DC, Kirby drew slightly more than 600 pages, which included 11 six-page  |Green_Arrow|Green_Arrow|  stories in  Worlds Finest Comics  and  Adventure Comics  that, in a rarity, Kirby inked himself.  Kirby recast the archer as a science-fiction hero, moving him away from his Batman-formula roots, but in the process alienating Green Arrow co-creator  |Mort_Weisinger|Mort_Weisinger| . Ro, p. 61     He began drawing  Sky Masters of the Space Force , a newspaper comic strip, written by the Wood brothers and initially inked by the unrelated  |Wally_Wood|Wally_Wood| . Evanier, King of Comics, pp. 103-106: The artwork was exquisite, in no small part because Dave Wood had the idea to hire Wally Wood to handle the inking. Kirby left National Comics Publications due largely to a contractual dispute in which editor  |Jack_Schiff|Jack_Schiff| , who had been involved in getting Kirby and the Wood brothers the Sky Masters contract, claimed he was due royalties from Kirbys share of the strips profits. Schiff successfully sued Kirby. Evanier, King of Comics, p. 109 Some DC editors had criticized him over art details, such as not drawing the shoelaces on a cavalrymans boots and showing a Native American mounting his horse from the wrong side. Ro, p. 91          Several months later, after his split with DC, Kirby began freelancing regularly for Atlas despite harboring negative sentiments about Lee , whom Kirby believed had disclosed to Timely back in the 1940s that he and Simon were secretly working on a project for National.  Because of the poor page rates, Kirby would spend 12 to 14 hours daily at his drawing table at home, producing four to five pages of artwork a day. Jones, p. 282 His first published work at Atlas was the cover of and the seven-page story I Discovered the Secret of the Flying Saucers in  Strange Worlds  1 . Initially with  |Christopher_Rule|Christopher_Rule|  as his regular inker, and later  |Dick_Ayers|Dick_Ayers| , Kirby drew across all genres, from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to Western comics, but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural-fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant,  |drive-in_movie|Drive-In_Movie| -style monsters with names like  |Groot|Groot| , the Thing from Planet X;  Grottu, King of the Insects;  and  |Fin_Fang_Foom|Fin_Fang_Foom|  for the companys many anthology series, such as  Amazing Adventures ,  Strange Tales ,  Tales to Astonish ,  Tales of Suspense , and  World of Fantasy . His bizarre designs of powerful, unearthly creatures proved a hit with readers. Additionally, he freelanced for  |Archie_Comics|Archie_Comics|  around this time, reuniting briefly with Joe Simon to help develop the series  The Fly   and  The Double Life of Private Strong .  Additionally, Kirby drew some issues of  Classics Illustrated .     It was at Marvel, in collaborating with writer and editor-in-chief Lee that Kirby hit his stride once again in superhero comics, beginning with  The Fantastic Four  1 .  |DeFalco,_Tom|Tom_Defalco|  1960s in Gilbert , p. 84: It did not take long for editor Stan Lee to realize that The Fantastic Four was a hit ... the flurry of fan letters all pointed to the FFs explosive popularity. The landmark series became a hit that revolutionized the industry with its comparative  |naturalism|Naturalism|  and, eventually, a cosmic purview informed by Kirbys seemingly boundless imaginationone well-matched with the consciousness-expanding  |youth_culture|Youth_Culture|  of the 1960s.   For almost a decade, Kirby provided Marvels house style, co-creating with Stan Lee many of the Marvel characters and designing their visual motifs. At Lees request, he often provided new-to-Marvel artists breakdown layouts, over which they would pencil in order to become acquainted with the Marvel look. As artist  |Gil_Kane|Gil_Kane|  described:          Highlights of Lee and Kirbys collaboration also include the  |Hulk|Hulk| , DeFalco 1960s in Gilbert , p. 85: Based on their collaboration on The Fantastic Four, Lee worked with Jack Kirby.

DeFalco 1960s in Gilbert , p. 117: Stan Lee wanted to do his part by creating the first black super hero. Lee discussed his ideas with Jack Kirby and the result was seen in Fantastic Four 52. Kirby initially was assigned to pencil the first  |Spider-Man|Spider-Man|  story, but when he showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasnt the character I wanted; it was too heroic .   Lee then turned to  |Steve_Ditko|Steve_Ditko|  to draw the story that would appear in  Amazing Fantasy  15, for which Kirby nonetheless penciled the cover.  Lee and Kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title  The Avengers  DeFalco 1960s in Gilbert , p. 94: Filled with some wonderful visual action, The Avengers 1 has a very simple story: the Norse god Loki tricked the Hulk into going on a rampage ... The heroes eventually learned about Lokis involvement and united with the Hulk to form the Avengers.  and would bring back old characters from the 1940s such as the  |Sub-Mariner|Namor|  DeFalco 1960s in Gilbert , p. 86: Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced one of Marvels most popular Golden Age heroes – Namor, the Sub-Mariner. and Captain America. DeFalco 1960s in Gilbert , p. 99: Captain America lives again! announced the cover of The Avengers 4 ... Cap was back. In later years, Lee and Kirby would contest who deserved credit for such creations as The Fantastic Four.       The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirbys finest achievement   is  |The_Galactus_Trilogy|The_Galactus_Trilogy|  in Fantastic Four 48-50 , chronicling the arrival of  |Galactus|Galactus| , a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the  |Silver_Surfer|Silver_Surfer| .  DeFalco 1960s in Gilbert , p. 115: Stan Lee may have started the creative discussion that culminated in Galactus, but the inclusion of the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four 48 was pure Jack Kirby. Kirby realized that a being like Galactus required an equally impressive herald. Fantastic Four 48 was chosen as 24 in the  |100_Greatest_Marvels_of_All_Time|100_Greatest_Marvels_Of_All_Time|  poll of Marvels readers in 2001. Editor  |Robert_Greenberger|Robert_Greenberger|  wrote in his introduction to the story that As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age.  Comics historian  |Les_Daniels|Les_Daniels|  noted that e mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s , and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses.  Kirby continued to expand the mediums boundaries, devising photo-collage covers and interiors, developing new drawing techniques such as the method for depicting energy fields now known as  |Kirby_Krackle|Kirby_Krackle|  , and other experiments.      In 1968 and 1969, Joe Simon was involved in litigation with Marvel Comics over the ownership of Captain America, initiated by Marvel after Simon registered the copyright renewal for Captain America in his own name. According to Simon, Kirby agreed to support the company in the litigation and, as part of a deal Kirby made with publisher Martin Goodman, signed over to Marvel any rights he might have had to the character. Simon, p. 205     At this same time, Kirby grew increasingly dissatisfied with working at Marvel, for reasons Kirby biographer Mark Evanier has suggested include resentment over Lees media prominence, a lack of full creative control, anger over breaches of perceived promises by publisher Martin Goodman, and frustration over Marvels failure to credit him specifically for his story plotting and for his character creations and co-creations. Evanier, King of Comics, p. 126-163 He began to both write and draw some secondary features for Marvel, such as The Inhumans in  |Amazing_Adventures_volume_two|Amazing_Adventures1970_Series| , Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 146: As Marvel was expanding its line of comics, the company decided to introduce two new split books ... Amazing Adventures and Astonishing Tales. Amazing Adventures contained a series about the genetically enhanced Inhumans and a series about intelligence agent the Black Widow. as well as horror stories for the anthology title  Chamber of Darkness , and received full credit for doing so; but in 1970, Kirby was presented with a contract that included such unfavorable terms as a prohibition against legal retaliation. When Kirby objected, the management refused to negotiate any contract changes. Evanier, King of Comics, p. 163 Kirby, although he was earning $35,000 a year freelancing for the company,  subsequently left Marvel in 1970 for rival DC Comics, under editorial director  |Carmine_Infantino|Carmine_Infantino| . Van Lente and Dunlavey, p. 115            Kirby spent nearly two years negotiating a deal to move to DC Comics, Ro, p.139 where in late 1970 he signed a three-year contract with an option for two additional years. Ro, p. 143 He produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket  |sobriquet|Sobriquet| |The_Fourth_World|Fourth_World|  , which included a trilogy of new titles  —  New Gods ,  Mister Miracle , and  The Forever People   — as well as the extant  Supermans Pal Jimmy Olsen . McAvennie, Michael 1970s in Dolan, p. 145 As the writer, artist, and editor of the Fourth World family of interlocking titles, each of which possessed its own distinct tone and theme, Jack Kirby cemented his legacy as a pioneer of grand-scale storytelling. Kirby picked the latter book because the series was without a stable creative team and he did not want to cost anyone a job. Evanier, Mark. Afterword. Jack Kirbys Fourth World Omnibus; Volume 1, New York: DC Comics, 2007. McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 141 Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to Supermans Pal, Jimmy Olsen, King of Comics Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point, and the writer/artists indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic.     The three books Kirby originated dealt with aspects of mythology hed previously touched upon in Thor. The New Gods would establish this new mythos, while in The Forever People Kirby would attempt to mythologise the lives of the young people he observed around him. The third book, Mister Miracle was more of a personal myth. The title character was an escape artist, which Mark Evanier suggests Kirby channeled his feelings of constraint into. Mister Miracles wife was based in character on Kirbys wife Roz, and he even caricatured Stan Lee within the pages of the book as  |Funky_Flashman|Funky_Flashman| .  Evanier, pp172-7     The central villain of the Fourth World series,  |Darkseid|Darkseid| , and some of the Fourth World concepts, appeared in Jimmy Olsen before the launch of the other Fourth World books, giving the new titles greater exposure to potential buyers. The Superman figures and Jimmy Olsen faces drawn by Kirby were redrawn by  |Al_Plastino|Al_Plastino| , and later by  |Murphy_Anderson|Murphy_Anderson| .  Les Daniels observed in 1995 that Kirbys mix of slang and myth, science fiction and the Bible, made for a heady brew, but the scope of his vision has endured.  In 2007, comics writer  |Grant_Morrison|Grant_Morrison|  commented that Kirbys dramas were staged across Jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm ... The Fourth World saga crackles with the voltage of Jack Kirbys boundless imagination let loose onto paper.      In addition to his artistic efforts, Kirby proposed a variety of new formats for comics such as planning to collect his published Fourth World stories into square-bound books, a format that would later be called the  |trade_paperback|Trade_Paperback| , which would eventually become standard practice in the industry. However, Infantino and company were not receptive and Kirbys proposals only went as far as producing the one-shot black-and-white magazines Spirit World and In the Days of the Mob in 1971. McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 147: Believing that new formats were necessary for the comics medium to continue evolving, Kirby oversaw the production of what was labeled his Speak-Out Series of magazines: Spirit World and In the Days of the Mob ... Sadly, these unique magazines never found their desired audience.     Kirby later produced other DC series such as  OMAC , McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 161 In OMACs first issue, editor/writer/artist Jack Kirby warned readers of The World Thats Coming! , a future world containing wild concepts that are almost frighteningly real today.  Kamandi , McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 153 Kirby had already introduced a similar concept and characters in Alarming Tales 1 ... Coupling the premise with his unpublished Kamandi of the Caves newspaper strip, Kirbys Last Boy on Earth roamed a world that had been ravaged by the Great Disaster and taken over by talking animals.  The Demon , McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 152 While his Fourth World opus was winding down, Jack Kirby was busy conjuring his next creation, which emerged not from the furthest reaches of the galaxy but from the deepest pits of Hell. Etrigan was hardly the usual Kirby protagonist. and  Kobra ,  and worked on such extant features as  |The_Losers|Losers|  in  Our Fighting Forces . McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 161 Jack Kirby also took on a group of established DC characters that had nothing to lose. The result was a year-long run of Our Fighting Forces tales that were action-packed, personal, and among the most beloved of World War II comics ever produced. Together with former partner Joe Simon for one last time, he worked on a new incarnation of the  |Sandman|Sandman| . McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 158 The legendary tandem of writer Joe Simon and artist/editor Jack Kirby reunited for a one-shot starring the Sandman ... Despite the issues popularity, it would be Simon and Kirbys last collaboration. Kirby produced three issues of the  1st Issue Special  anthology series and created  |Atlas_The_Great|Atlas| , McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 162: Debuting with Atlas the Great, writer and artist Jack Kirby didnt shrug at the chance to put his spin on the well-known hero. a new  |Manhunter|Manhunter| , McAvennie 1970s in Dolan, p. 164: Though 1st Issue Special was primarily DCs forum to introduce new characters and storylines, editor Jack Kirby used the series as an opportunity to revamp the Manhunter, whom he and writer Joe Simon had made famous in the 1940s. and the  |Dingbats_of_Danger_Street|Dingbats_Of_Danger_Street| .      Kirbys production assistant of the time,  |Mark_Evanier|Mark_Evanier| , recounted that DCs policies of the era were not in synch with Kirbys creative impulses, and that he was often forced to work on characters and projects he did not like.  Meanwhile, some artists at DC did not want Kirby there, as he threatened their positions in the company; they also had bad blood from previous competition with Marvel and legal problems with him. Since he was working from California, they were able to undermine his work through redesigns in the New York office. Ro, chapters 12-13.       At the  |comic_book_convention|Comic_Book_Convention|  Marvelcon 75, in 1975, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Kirby was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for DC Comics. Lee wrote in his monthly column, Stan Lees Soapbox , I mentioned that I had a special announcement to make. As I started telling about Jacks return, to a totally incredulous audience, everyones head started to snap around as Kirby himself came waltzin down the aisle to join us on the rostrum! You can imagine how it felt clownin around with the co-creator of most of Marvels greatest strips once more.  |Bullpen_Bulletins|Bullpen_Bulletins| Fantastic Four 163     Back at Marvel, Kirby both wrote and drew the monthly Captain America series Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 175: After an absence of half a decade, Jack Kirby returned to Marvel Comics as writer, penciller, and editor of the series he and Joe Simon created back in 1941. as well as the Captain Americas Bicentennial Battles  |one-shot|One-Shot|  in the oversized  |treasury_format|Marvel_Treasury_Edition| .  He created the series  The Eternals , Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 175: Jack Kirbys most important creation for Marvel during his return in the 1970s was his epic series The Eternals which featured a race of inscrutable alien giants, the  |Celestials|Celestial| , whose behind-the-scenes intervention in primordial humanity would eventually become a core element of  |Marvel_Universe|Marvel_Universe|  continuity. He produced an adaptation and expansion of the film  2001: A Space Odyssey , Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 180: Marvel published its adaptation of director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarkes classic science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey as an oversize Marvel Treasury Special. as well as an abortive attempt to do the same for the classic television series  The Prisoner .  He wrote and drew Black Panther and drew numerous covers across the line.     Kirbys other Marvel creations in this period include  |Machine_Man|Machine_Man|  Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 185: In 2001: A Space Odyssey issue 8, cover dated July 1977, Kirby introduced a robot whom he originally dubbed Mister Machine. Marvels 2001 series eventually came to an end but Kirbys robot protagonist went on to star in his own comic book series as Machine Man. and  |Devil_Dinosaur|Devil_Dinosaur| . Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 185: Jack Kirbys final major creation for Marvel Comics was perhaps his most unusual hero: an intelligent dinosaur resembling a Tyrannosaurus rex. Kirbys final comics collaboration with Stan Lee, The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience, was published in 1978 as part of the  |Marvel_Fireside_Books|Marvel_Fireside_Books|  series and is considered Marvels first  |graphic_novel|Graphic_Novel| . Sanderson 1970s in Gilbert , p. 187: Simon & Schusters Fireside Books published a paperback book titled The Silver Surfer by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby ... This book was later recognized as Marvels first true graphic novel.       Still dissatisfied with Marvels treatment of him, Ploog & Kirby Quit Marvel over Contract Dispute , The Comics Journal 44, January 1979, p. 11. and with an offer of employment from  |Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera| , Evanier, King of Comics, p. 189: In 1978, an idea found him. It was an offer from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon studio in Hollywood. Kirby left Marvel to work in animation. In that field, he did designs for  Turbo Teen ,  Thundarr the Barbarian  and other animated series for television. He worked on  The New Fantastic Four  animated series, reuniting him with scriptwriter Stan Lee.  He illustrated an adaptation of the Walt Disney movie  The Black Hole  for  Walt Disneys Treasury of Classic Tales  syndicated comic strip in 1979-80.      In 1979, Kirby drew concept art for film producer Barry Gellers script treatment adapting  |Roger_Zelaznys|Roger_Zelazny|  science fiction novel,  Lord of Light , for which Geller had purchased the rights. In collaboration, Geller commissioned Kirby to draw set designs that would be used as architectural renderings for a Colorado  |theme_park|Theme_Park|  to be called Science Fiction Land; Geller announced his plans at a November press conference attended by Kirby, former American football star  |Rosey_Grier|Rosey_Grier| , writer  |Ray_Bradbury|Ray_Bradbury| , and others. While the film did not come to fruition, Kirbys drawings were used for the  |CIAs|Central_Intelligence_Agency| |Canadian_Caper|Canadian_Caper|  , in which some members of the  |U.S._embassy_in_Tehran|Embassy_Of_The_United_States,_Tehran| , Iran, who had avoided capture in the  |Iran_hostage_crisis|Iran_Hostage_Crisis| , were able to escape the country posing as members of a movie location-scouting crew.           In the early 1980s, Kirby and  |Pacific_Comics|Pacific_Comics| , a new, non-newsstand comic-book publisher, made one of the industrys earliest deals for  |creator-owned|Creator-Owned|  series, resulting in  Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers ,   and the six-issue miniseries  Silver Star  .    This, together with similar actions by other  |independent_comics|Independent_Comics|  publishers as  |Eclipse_Comics|Eclipse_Comics|  ,  helped establish a precedent to end the monopoly of the work-for-hire system, wherein comics creators, even freelancers, had owned no rights to characters they created. George, p. 73     In 1983 Richard Kyle commissioned Kirby to create a 10-page autobiographical strip,  |Street_Code|Street_Code|  , which became one of the last works published in Kirbys lifetime. It was published in 1990, in the second issue of Kyles revival of  Argosy .  Kirby continued to do periodic work for DC Comics during the 1980s, including a brief revival of his Fourth World saga in the 1984 and 1985  Super Powers  miniseries Manning, Matthew K. 1980s in Dolan, p. 208: In association with the toy company Kenner, DC released a line of toys called Super Powers ... DC soon debuted a five-issue Super Powers miniseries plotted by comic book legend Jack King Kirby, scripted by Joey Cavalieri, and with pencils by Adrian Gonzales. and the 1985 graphic novel The Hunger Dogs. DC executives  |Jenette_Kahn|Jenette_Kahn|  and  |Paul_Levitz|Paul_Levitz|  had Kirby re-design the Fourth World characters for the Super Powers toyline as a way of entitling him to royalties for several of his DC creations.  In 1985, Kirby and  |Gil_Kane|Gil_Kane|  helped to create the concept and designs for the  |Ruby-Spears|Ruby-Spears|  animated television series  The Centurions . A comic-book series based on the show was published by DC and a toy line produced by  |Kenner|Kenner_Products| .     In the twilight of his life, Kirby spent a great deal of time sparring with Marvel executives over the ownership rights of his original page boards. At Marvel, many of these pages owned by the company were given away as promotional gifts to Marvel clients or simply stolen from company warehouses.  After the passage of the  |Copyright_Act_of_1976|Copyright_Act_Of_1976| , which greatly expanded artist copyright capabilities, comics publishers began to return original art to creators, but in Marvels case only if they signed a release reaffirming Marvels ownership of the copyright. In 1985, Marvel issued a release that demanded Kirby affirm that his art was created for hire, allowing Marvel to retain copyright in perpetuity, in addition to demanding that Kirby forego all future royalties. Marvel offered him 88 pages of his art if he signed the agreement, but reserved the right to reclaim the art if Kirby violated the deal. After Kirby publicly slammed Marvel, calling the company thugs and claiming they were arbitrarily holding his creations, Marvel finally returned approximately 1,900  or 2,100 pages of the estimated 10,000 to 13,000 Kirby drew for the company.       For the producer  |Charles_Band|Charles_Band| , Jack Kirby made concept art for the films  Doctor Mortalis  and  Mindmaster , which would later be released as  Doctor Mordrid  and  |Mandroid|Mandroid|  , respectively.  Initially, Doctor Modrid would be an adaptation of a Marvel Comics character, the  |Dr._Strange|Dr._Strange| .       For  |Topps_Comics|Topps_Comics| , founded in 1993, Kirby retained ownership of characters used in multiple series of what the company dubbed  |The_Kirbyverse|Kirbyverse|  . Evanier, p. 207 These titles were derived mainly from designs and concepts Kirby had kept in his files, some intended initially for the by-then-defunct Pacific Comics, and then licensed to Topps for what became the  |Jack_Kirbys_Secret_City_Saga|Secret_City_Saga|  mythos.  Phantom Force was the last comic book Kirby worked on before his death. The story was co-written by Kirby with Michael Thibodeaux and Richard French, based on an eight-page pitch for an unused  |Bruce_Lee|Bruce_Lee|  comic in 1978.  Issues 1 and 2 were published by  |Image_Comics|Image_Comics|  with various Image artists inking over Kirbys pencils. Issue 0 and issues 3-8 were published by Genesis West, with Kirby providing pencils for issues 0 and 4. Thibodeaux provided the art for the remaining issues of the series after Kirby died.        In the early 1940s, Kirby and his family moved to Brooklyn. There, Kirby met Rosalind Roz Goldstein, who lived in the same apartment building. The pair began dating soon afterward. Ro, p. 14. Kirby proposed to Goldstein on her 18th birthday, and the two became engaged. Ro, p. 16 They married on May 23, 1942. Evanier, King of Comics, p. 57 The couple had four children together: Susan ,  Neal , Barbara ,  and Lisa .     After being  |drafted|Conscription|  into the  |U.S._Army|U.S._Army|  and serving in the  |European_Theater|European_Theater_Of_Operations,_United_States_Army|  in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Ronin Ro, Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution , chapter 3.  Kirby corresponded with his wife regularly by  |v-mail|V-Mail| , with Roz sending daily letters while she worked in a lingerie shop and lived with her mother Ro, p. 40 at 2820 Brighton 7th Street in Brooklyn.  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| |V-mail|V-Mail|  letter from Kirby to Rosalind, in George, p. 117 During the winter of 1944, Kirby suffered severe  |frostbite|Frostbite|  and was taken to a hospital in London for recovery. Doctors considered amputating Kirbys legs, which had turned black, but he eventually recovered and was able to walk again. Ro, p. 40-41 He returned to the United States in January 1945, assigned to  |Camp_Butner|Camp_Butner|  in North Carolina, where he spent the last six months of his service as part of the motor pool. Kirby was  |honorably_discharged|Honorable_Discharge|  as a  |Private_First_Class|Private_First_Class|  on July 20, 1945, having received a  |Combat_Infantryman_Badge|Combat_Infantryman_Badge| , a  |European/African/Middle_Eastern_Campaign_Medal|European-African-Middle_Eastern_Campaign_Medal|  and a  |Bronze_Star_Medal|Bronze_Star_Medal| . Evanier, p. 69 Ro, p. 42     In 1949, Kirby bought a house for his family in  |Mineola,_New_York|Mineola,_New_York| , on  |Long_Island|Long_Island| , This would be the familys home for the next 20 years, with Kirby working out of a basement studio just  wide, which the family referred to jocularly as The Dungeon .  He moved the family to Southern California in early 1969, both to live in a drier climate for the sake of daughter Lisas health, and to be closer to the Hollywood studios Kirby believed might provide work. Evanier, King of Comics, pp. 157, 160 : ... drove Jack to distraction, and from there to Southern California. In early 1969, the Kirbys moved west. The main reason was daughter Lisas  |asthma|Asthma|  and her need to live in a drier climate But Jack had another reason. ... Kirby had hopes that being close to Hollywood might bring hm entry to the movie business. ... Film seemed like the next logical outlet for his creativity. ...     In an interview, Kirbys granddaughter Jillian Kirby said Kirby was a liberal Democrat .      On February 6, 1994, Kirby died at age 76 of heart failure in his  |Thousand_Oaks,_California|Thousand_Oaks,_California|  home.  He was buried at the Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park,  |Westlake_Village,_California|Westlake_Village,_California| .       Brent Staples wrote in the New York Times     Jack Kirby has been referred to as the superhero of style , his artwork described by John Carlin in Masters of American Comics as deliberately primitive and bombastic ,  and elsewhere has been compared to  |Cubist|Cubism| ,   |Futurist|Futurism| ,  |Primitivist|Primitivism|  and  |outsider_art|Outsider_Art| . Hatfield 7 Saunders, p. 11   His contributions to the  |comic_book|Comic_Book|  form, including the many characters he created or co-created and the many  |genres|Genre|  he worked on have led to him being referred to as the definitive comic book artist. Carlin, p. 261 Given the number of places Kirbys artwork can now be found, the toys based on his designs and the success of the  |movies|List_Of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_Films|  based upon his work,  |Charles_Hatfield|Charles_Hatfield|  and Ben Saunders declare him one of the chief architects of the American imagination. Hatfield & Saunders, p. 9 He was regarded as a hard working artist, and it has been calculated that he drew at least 20,318 pages of published art and a further 1,385 covers in his career. He published 1,158 pages in 1962 alone.  Kirby defined comics in two periods. His work in the early 1940s with  |Joe_Simon|Joe_Simon|  on the  |Captain_America|Captain_America|  strip, and then his superhero comics of the 1960s with  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  at  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics|  and on his own at  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| .  Reprinted in George, p. 61-73 Kirby has also created stories in almost every genre of comics, from the autobiographical  |Street_Code|Street_Code|  to the apocalyptic science fiction fantasy of  |Kamandi|Kamandi| .        Like many of his contemporaries, Kirby was hugely indebted to  |Milton_Caniff|Milton_Caniff| ,  |Hal_Foster|Hal_Foster|  and  |Alex_Raymond|Alex_Raymond| , who codified many of the tropes of narrative art in adventure  |comic_strips|Comic_Strip| . It has also been suggested that Kirby also drew from  |Burne_Hogarth|Burne_Hogarth| , whose dynamic figure work may have informed the way Kirby drew figures; his ferocious bounding, and grotesquely articulated figures seem directly descended from Hogarths dynamically contorted forms. Hatfield , p. 61 His style drew on these influences, all major artists at the time Kirby was learning his craft, with Caniff, Foster and Raymond between them imparting to the sequential adventure comic strip a highly illustrative approach based on realising the setting to a very high degree. Where Kirby diverged from these influences, and where his style impacted on the formation of comic book art, was in his move away from an illustrated approach to one that was more dynamic. Kirbys artistic style was one that captured energy and motion within the image, synergising with the text and helping to serve the narrative. In contrast, successors to the illustrative approach, such as  |Gil_Kane|Gil_Kane| , found their work eventually reach an impasse. The art would illustrate, but in lacking movement caused the reader to contemplate the art as much as the written word. Later artists such as  |Bryan_Hitch|Bryan_Hitch|  and  |Alex_Ross|Alex_Ross|  combined the Kirby and Kane approaches, using highly realistic backgrounds contrasted with dynamic characters to create what became known as a widescreen approach to comics. Hatfield , p. 63-65     Kirbys dynamism and energy served to push the reader through the story where an illustrative, detailed approach would cause the eye to linger. Hatfield , p. 65-67 His reduction of the presentation of a given scene down to one that represents the semblance of movement has led Kirby to be described as cinematic in his style.  Having worked at the  |Fleischer_Studios|Fleischer_Studio|  before coming to comics, Kirby had a grounding in animation techniques for producing motion. He also realised that comic books werent subject to the same constraints as the newspaper strip. While other comic book artists recreated the layouts that format used, Kirby swiftly utilised the space a whole comic book page created. As Ron Goulart describes, e broke up the pages in new ways and introduced splash panels that stretched across two pages.  Kirby himself described the creation of his dynamic style as a reaction both to the cinema and to the urge to create and compete: I found myself competing with the movie camera. I had to compete with the camera. I felt like  |John_Henry|John_Henry|  ... I tore my characters out of the panels. I made them jump all over the page. I tried to make that cohesive so that it would be easier to read ... I had to get my characters in extreme positions, and in doing so I created an extreme style which was recognizable by everybody.           In the early 1940s Kirby would at times disregard  |panel|Glossary_Of_Comics_Terminologypanel|  borders. A character would be drawn in one panel, but their shoulder and arm would extend outside the border, into the  |gutter|Glossary_Of_Comics_Terminologygutter|  and sometimes on top of a nearby panel. A character may be punched out of one panel, feet being in the original panel and body in the next. Panels themselves would overlap, and Kirby would find new ways to arrange panels on a comic book page. His figures were depicted as lithe and graceful, although Kirby would place them thrusting from the page towards the reader. Hatfield , p. 24-5 & 69-73 Hatfield & Saunders, p. 11  The late 1940s and 1950s saw Kirby move away from superhero comics and, working with Joe Simon, try his hand at a number of genres. Kirby and Simon created the  |romance_comics|Romance_Comics|  genre, and working in this as well as the war, Western and crime genres saw Kirbys style change. He left behind the diverse panel framing and layouts. The nature of these genres enabled him to channel the energy into the posing and blocking of characters, forcing the drama into the constraints of the panel.     When Kirby and  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  came together at  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics| , his art developed again. His characters and representations became more abstract, less anatomically correct. He would place figures across three planes of a panels depth to suggest three dimensions. Hatfield , p. 54-55 His backgrounds would be less detailed where he did not want the eye to be drawn.  His figures would move actively along diagonals, and he utilised  |foreshortening|Foreshortening|  to make a character appear to recede more deeply into the panel, so that they appeared to move towards the reader, off the page.   During the 1960s Kirby also developed a talent for collages, initially utilising them within the pages of  The Fantastic Four . He introduced the  |Negative_Zone|Negative_Zone|  as a place within the Marvel Universe that would only be illustrated via collage. However the reproduction within the published comics of the collages, coupled with the low page rate he was being paid and the time they took to develop saw their use discarded.  Kirby would later return to the use of collage in his Fourth World work at  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| . Here he used them most often in the pages of  Supermans Pal, Jimmy Olsen . Hatfield & Saunders, p. 89-99     Kirbys style in the late 1960s was regarded so highly by Stan Lee that he instituted it as Marvels house style. Lee would instruct other artists to draw more like Jack, and would also assign them books to work on using Kirbys breakdowns of the story so that they could more closely hew to Kirbys style. Hartfield , p. 9 Over time, Kirbys style has become so well known that imitations, homages and pastiche are referred to as Kirbyesque.     Originally published in The Comics Journal 175      |Kirby_Krackle|Kirby_Krackle| , also referred to as Kirby Dots  is Kirbys artistic convention of depicting the effect of energy. Within the drawing, a field of black, pseudo- |fractal|Fractal|  images is used to represent  |negative_space|Negative_Space|  around unspecified kinds of  |energy|Energy| .   Kirby Krackles are typically used in illustrations of  |explosions|Explosion| , smoke, the blasts from  |ray_guns|Raygun| , cosmic energy, and outer space phenomena.  The advanced technology Kirby drew, from the  |Afrofuturistic|Afrofuturistic|  state of  |Wakanda|Wakanda|  through the  |Mother_Box|Mother_Box| es of the  |New_Gods|New_Gods|  to the spaceships and design of  |the_Celestials|Celestial|  is gathered together under the collective term Kirby Tech .    |John_Paul_Leon|John_Paul_Leon|  has described it as Its tech; its mechanical even if its alien, but its drawn in such an organic way that you dont question it. Its just an extension of his world. Im not sure who else you could say did that.  Kirbys depiction of technology is linked by Charles Hatfield to  |Leo_Marxs|Leo_Marx|  idea of the technological sublime, specifically utilising  |Edmund_Burkes|Edmund_Burke|  definition of the  |Sublime|Sublime_Edmund_Burke| . Using this definition, Kirbys view and depiction of technology is that of it as something to be feared. Hatfield p.144-71          Unlike many of his contemporaries, Kirby did not use preliminary sketches, rough work or layouts. He would instead start with the blank board and draw the story onto the page from top to bottom, start to finish. Many artists, including  |Carmine_Infantino|Carmine_Infantino| , Gil Kane and  |Jim_Steranko|Jim_Steranko|  have remarked on the unusual nature of his method. Kirby would rarely erase while working, the art, and therefore the story, would flow from him almost fully formed. Hatfield, p. 58 Kirbys pencils had a reputation for being detailed, to the point that they were difficult to ink.    |Will_Eisner|Will_Eisner|  remembers even in the early years that Kirbys pencils were tight . Eisner, p. 199 Working for Eisner, Kirby initially inked with a pen, not confident enough in his ability to use the Japanese brushes Lou Fine and Eisner preferred. Eisner, p. 213 By the time Kirby worked with  |Joe_Simon|Joe_Simon| , Kirby had taught himself to use a brush, and would on occasion ink over inked work where he felt it was needed. Eisner, p. 209     Due to the amount of work Kirby produced, it was rare for him to ink his own work. Instead the pencilled pages were sent on to an inker. Different inkers would therefore impact on the published version of Kirbys art, with Kirby himself noting that individual inkers were suited to different genres. Interview, The Nostalgia Journal 30–1, November 1976–December 1976, reprinted in George, p. 10 For a period during the 1950s, when work had dried up, its been suggested by Harry Mendryk that Kirby inked himself.  By the late 1960s, Kirby preferred to pencil, feeling that inking in itself is a separate kind of art.  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  recalls Kirby not really being too interested in who inked him: I cared much more about who inked Kirby than Kirby did ... Kirby never seemed to care who inked him ... I think Kirby felt his style was so strong that it just didnt matter who inked him .   |Chic_Stone|Chic_Stone| , an inker of Kirbys during the 1960s at Marvel, recalled he two best for Jack were  |Mike_Royer|Mike_Royer|  and  |Steve_Rude|Steve_Rude| . Both truly maintained the integrity of Jacks pencils. Morrow, p. 90     The size of the  |art_board|Bristol_Board|  made a difference to Kirbys style. During the late 1960s the industry shrunk the size of the art board artists used. Prior to 1967, art boards were around 14 x 21 inches, being reproduced at 7 x 10 inches. After 1967 the size of the board shrunk to 15 x 10. Hatfield & Saunders, p. 36-7 This affected the way Kirby drew. Gil Kane noted that the amount of space around the figures became less and less ... The figures became bigger and bigger, and they couldnt be contained by a single panel or even a single page . Hatfield & Saunders, p. 28 Professor Craig Fischer asserts Kirby at first hated the new size. Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37 Fischer argues that it took Kirby around 18 months to negotiate a way of working at the smaller size. Initially he retreated to a less detailed, close up style, as seen in  Fantastic Four  68. In adjusting to the new size, Kirby began utilising depth to bring the pages to life, increasing his use of foreshortening. By the time Kirby had moved to DC, he started to incorporate the use of two page spreads into his art more. These spreads helped define the mood of the story, and came to define Kirbys late era work. Hatfield & Saunders, p. 149-157       Kirbys art has been exhibited as part of the Masters of American Comics joint exhibition by  |The_Hammer_Museum|The_Hammer_Museum|  and  |The_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art|The_Museum_Of_Contemporary_Art|  from November 2005 to March 2016.  In 2015 Charles Hatfield curated the Comic Book Apocalypse exhibition at the  |California_State_University,_Northridge|California_State_University,_Northridge|  Art Galleries.
