     Henry Fielding was an English novelist and dramatist known for his rich, earthy humour and  |satirical|Satire|  prowess, and as the author of the  |comic_novel|Comic_Novel|   Tom Jones . Additionally, he holds a significant place in the history of law enforcement, having used his authority as a  |magistrate|Magistrate|  to found  what some have called  |Londons|London|  first police force, the  |Bow_Street_Runners|Bow_Street_Runners| . His younger sister,  |Sarah|Sarah_Fielding| , also became a successful writer.         Fielding was born at  |Sharpham|Sharpham| ,  |Somerset|Somerset| , and educated at  |Eton_College|Eton_College| , where he established a lifelong friendship with  |William_Pitt_the_Elder|William_Pitt_The_Elder| .  His mother died when he was 11. A suit for custody was brought by his grandmother against his charming but irresponsible father, Lt Gen.  |Edmund_Fielding|Edmund_Fielding| . The settlement placed Henry in his grandmothers care, although he continued to see his father in London.  In 1725, Henry tried to abduct his cousin, Sarah Andrews, while she was on her way to church. He fled to avoid prosecution.   In 1728, he travelled to  |Leiden|Leiden|  to study classics and law at the university. However, lack of money obliged him to return to London and he began writing for the theatre. Some of his work was savagely critical of the government of Prime Minister Sir  |Robert_Walpole|Robert_Walpole| .       The  |Theatrical_Licensing_Act|Licensing_Act_1737|  of 1737 is said to be a direct response to his activities in writing for the theatre. Although the play that triggered the act was the unproduced, anonymously authored  The Golden Rump , Fieldings dramatic satires had set the tone. Once it was passed, political satire on the stage became virtually impossible. Fielding retired from the theatre and resumed his career in law to support his wife Charlotte Craddock and two children by becoming a  |barrister|Barrister| .      Fieldings lack of financial acumen meant he and his family often endured periods of poverty, but he was helped by  |Ralph_Allen|Ralph_Allen| , a wealthy benefactor, on whom Squire Allworthy in  Tom Jones  would be based. Allen went on to provide for the education and support of Fieldings children after the writers death.        Fielding never stopped writing political satire and satires of current arts and letters.  The Tragedy of Tragedies   was, for example, quite successful as a printed play. Based on his earlier  Tom Thumb , this was another of Fieldings irregular plays published under the name of H. Scriblerus Secundus, a pseudonym intended to link himself ideally with the  |Scriblerus_Club|Scriblerus_Club|  of literary satirists founded by  |Jonathan_Swift|Jonathan_Swift| ,  |Alexander_Pope|Alexander_Pope|  and  |John_Gay|John_Gay| . He also contributed a number of works to journals of the time.     From 1734 until 1739 he wrote anonymously for the leading  |Tory|Tories|  periodical, The Craftsman, against the Prime Minister, Sir  |Robert_Walpole|Robert_Walpole| . , p. xvi Fieldings patron was the opposition Whig MP  |George_Lyttelton|George_Lyttelton,_1St_Baron_Lyttelton| , a boyhood friend from  |Eton|Eton_College| . Lyttelton followed his leader  |Lord_Cobham|Richard_Temple,_1St_Viscount_Cobham|  in forming a Whig opposition to Walpoles government called the  |Cobhamites|Cobhamites|  . Battestin , p. xx. In the Craftsman, Fielding voiced the opposition attack on bribery and corruption in British politics. Battestin , p. xiii. Although writing for the opposition to Walpole, which included Tories as well as Whigs, Fielding was unshakably a Whig and often praised Whig heroes such as the  |Duke_of_Marlborough|John_Churchill,_1St_Duke_Of_Marlborough|  and  |Gilbert_Burnet|Gilbert_Burnet| . Battestin , p. 61.     Fielding dedicated his play Don Quixote in England to the opposition Whig leader  |Lord_Chesterfield|Philip_Stanhope,_4Th_Earl_Of_Chesterfield| . It was published on 17 April 1734, the same day writs were issued for the  |general_election|1734_British_General_Election| . Battestin , p. xxiii. He dedicated his 1735 play The Universal Gallant to  |Charles_Spencer,_3rd_Duke_of_Marlborough|Charles_Spencer,_3Rd_Duke_Of_Marlborough| , a political follower of Chesterfield. Battestin , p. xxv. The other prominent opposition newspaper, Common Sense, founded by Chesterfield and Lyttelton, was named after a character in Fieldings Pasquin . Fielding wrote at least two articles for it in 1737 and 1738. Battestin , p. 299n. 62.     Fielding continued to air his political views in satirical articles and newspapers in the late 1730s and early 1740s. He was the main writer and editor from 1739 to 1740 for the satirical paper The Champion, which was heavily critical of Walpoles government and of pro-government literary and political writers. He sought to avoid charges of libel by making its political attacks so funny or embarrassing to the victim that a publicized court case would seem even worse. He later became chief writer for the Whig government of  |Henry_Pelham|Henry_Pelham| . Battestin , p. 4.     Fielding took to novel writing in 1741, angered by  |Samuel_Richardsons|Samuel_Richardson|  success with  Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded . His first success was an anonymous parody of that:  Shamela .  This follows the model of Tory satirists of the previous generation, notably Swift and Gay.     Fielding followed this with  Joseph Andrews  , an original work supposedly dealing with Pamelas brother, Joseph. His purpose, however, was more than parody, for as announced in the preface, he intended a kind of writing which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language. In what Fielding called a comic epic poem in prouse, he blended two classical traditions: that of the epic, which had been poetic, and that of the drama, but emphasizing the comic rather than the tragic. Another distinction of Joseph Andrews and of the novels to come was the use of everyday reality of character and action as opposed to the fables of the past. Although begun as a parody, it developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is considered to mark Fieldings debut as a serious novelist. In 1743, he published a novel in the Miscellanies volume III :  The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great , which is sometimes counted as his first, as he almost certainly began it before he wrote Shamela and Joseph Andrews. It is a satire of Walpole equating him and  |Jonathan_Wild|Jonathan_Wild| , the gang leader and highwayman. He implicitly compares the  |Whig|British_Whig_Party|  party in  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_Great_Britain|  with a gang of thieves run by Walpole, whose constant desire to be a Great Man ought to culminate in the antithesis of greatness: hanging.          His anonymous  The Female Husband  fictionalizes a case in which a female transvestite was tried for duping another woman into marriage; this was one of several small pamphlets costing sixpence.  Though a minor piece of Fieldings œuvre, it reflects his preoccupation with fraud, shamming and masks.     His greatest work was  Tom Jones  , a meticulously constructed comic novel with elements of the picaresque novel and the  |Bildungsroman|Bildungsroman| , telling the convoluted and hilarious tale of how a foundling came into a fortune. The plot of Tom Jones is too ingenious for simple summary; its basis is Toms alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. The triumph is its presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented, and through them every shade of moral behaviour. Fieldings varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel and his authorial comment before each chapter adds a marked dimension to a conventionally straightforward narrative.       Fielding married Charlotte Craddock in 1734 at the  |Church_of_St_Mary|Church_Of_St_Mary,_Charlcombe|  in  |Charlcombe|Charlcombe| ,  |Somerset|Somerset| .  She died in 1744, and he later modelled the heroines of Tom Jones and of Amelia on her. They had five children; their only daughter Henrietta died at the age of 23, having already been in deep decline when she married a military engineer,  |James_Gabriel_Montresor|James_Gabriel_Montresor| , some months before. Three years after Charlottes death, Fielding disregarded public opinion by marrying her former maid Mary Daniel, who was pregnant. Mary bore five children: three daughters who died young, and two sons, William and Allen.        Despite this scandal, Fieldings consistent anti-Jacobitism and support for the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England|  led to his being appointed a year later as Londons chief magistrate, while his literary career went from strength to strength. Most of his work concerned Londons criminal population of thieves, informers, gamblers and prostitutes. Though living in a corrupt and callous society, he became noted for impartial judgements, incorruptibility and compassion for those whom social inequities forced into crime. The income from his office dwindled as he refused to take money from the very poor. Joined by his younger half-brother  |John|John_Fielding| , he helped found what some call Londons first police force, the  |Bow_Street_Runners|Bow_Street_Runners| , in 1749.      According to the historian  |G._M._Trevelyan|G._M._Trevelyan| , the Fieldings were two of the best magistrates in 18th-century London, who did much to enhance judicial reform and improve prison conditions. Fieldings influential pamphlets and enquiries included a proposal for abolishing public hangings. This did not, however, imply opposition to capital punishment as such – as is evident, for example, in his presiding in 1751 over the trial of the notorious criminal  |James_Field|James_Field| , finding him guilty in a robbery and sentencing him to hang. John Fielding, despite being blind by then, succeeded his older brother as chief magistrate, becoming known as the Blind Beak of Bow Street for his ability to recognise criminals by their voices alone. .        In January 1752 Fielding started a fortnightly,  The Covent-Garden Journal , which he published under the pseudonym Sir Alexander Drawcansir, Knt., Censor of Great Britain until November of that year. Here Fielding challenged the armies of  |Grub_Street|Grub_Street|  and periodical writers of the day in a conflict that became the  |Paper_War_of_1752–1753|Paper_War_Of_1752–1753| .     Fielding then published Examples of the Interposition of Providence in the Detection and Punishment of Murder , a treatise rejecting deistic and materialistic visions of the world in favour of belief in Gods presence and divine judgement, Fielding, Henry. 1988. An Enquiry Into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers and Related Writings. Oxford: Clarendon, 1988. arguing that the murder rate was rising due to neglect of the Christian religion. Valier, Claire. 2005. Crime and Punishment in Contemporary Culture. Routledge. p. 20. In 1753 he wrote Proposals for Making an Effectual Provision for the Poor.     Fieldings humanitarian commitment to justice in the 1750s  coincided with rapid deterioration in his health.  |Gout|Gout| ,  |asthma|Asthma|  and  |cirrhosis|Cirrhosis|  of the liver left him on crutches, and with other afflictions sent him to Portugal in 1754 to seek a cure, only to die two months later in  |Lisbon|Lisbon| , reportedly in pain and mental distress.  His tomb there is in the English Cemetery , now the graveyard of  |St._Georges_Church,_Lisbon|St._Georges_Church,_Lisbon| .
