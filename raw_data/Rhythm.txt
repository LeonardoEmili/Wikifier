           Rhythm  generally means a  |movement|Motion|  marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a  |periodicity|Frequency|  or  |frequency|Frequency|  of anything from microseconds to several seconds ; to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.     Rhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats:        In the  |performance_arts|Performance_Arts| , rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of  |musical_sounds_and_silences|Music|  that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken  |language|Language|  and poetry. In some performing arts, such as  |hip_hop_music|Hip_Hop_Music| , the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as timed movement through space  and a common language of  |pattern|Pattern|  unites rhythm with geometry. In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. Recent work in these areas includes books by  |Maury|Maury_Yeston|  ,  |Fred_Lerdahl|Fred_Lerdahl|  and  |Ray_Jackendoff|Ray_Jackendoff|  ,  |Jonathan_Kramer|Jonathan_Kramer| , Christopher ,  |Godfried|Godfried_Toussaint|  , William , Joel Lester , and  |Guerino_Mazzola|Guerino_Mazzola| .            In his television series How Music Works,  |Howard_Goodall|Howard_Goodall|  presents theories that human rhythm recalls the regularity with which we walk and the heartbeat . Other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly, but rather the speed of emotional affect, which also influences heartbeat. Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots . Justin London writes that musical metre involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time . The perception and abstraction of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into tick-tock-tick-tock .           |Joseph_Jordania|Joseph_Jordania|  recently suggested that the sense of rhythm was developed in the early stages of  |hominid|Hominid|  evolution by the forces of  |natural_selection|Natural_Selection|  . Plenty of animals walk rhythmically and hear the sounds of the heartbeat in the womb, but only humans have the ability to be engaged  in rhythmically coordinated vocalizations and other activities. According to Jordania, development of the sense of rhythm was central for the achievement of the specific neurological state of the  |battle_trance|Battle_Trance| , crucial for the development of the effective  |defense|Defense|  system of early hominids. Rhythmic  |war_cry|Battle_Cry| , rhythmic drumming by  |shamans|Shaman| , rhythmic  |drilling|Drilling|  of the soldiers and contemporary professional combat forces listening to the heavy rhythmic rock music  all use the ability of rhythm to unite human individuals into a shared  |collective_identity|Collective_Identity|  where group members put the interests of the group above their individual interests and safety.     Some types of parrots can know rhythm . Neurologist  |Oliver_Sacks|Oliver_Sacks|  states that  |chimpanzees|Chimpanzee|  and other animals show no similar appreciation of rhythm yet posits that human affinity for rhythm is fundamental, so that a persons sense of rhythm cannot be lost . There is not a single report of an animal being trained to tap, peck, or move in synchrony with an auditory beat  Human rhythmic arts are possibly to some extent rooted in courtship ritual .          The establishment of a basic beat requires the perception of a regular sequence of distinct short-duration pulses and, as a subjective perception of loudness is relative to background noise levels, a pulse must decay to silence before the next occurs if it is to be really distinct. For this reason, the fast-transient sounds of percussion instruments lend themselves to the definition of rhythm. Musical cultures that rely upon such instruments may develop multi-layered  |polyrhythm|Polyrhythm|  and simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature, called  |polymeter|Polymeter| . Such are the  |cross-rhythms_of_Sub-Saharan_Africa|Rhythm_In_Sub-Saharan_Africacross-Rhythm|  and the  |interlocking_kotekan|Kotekan|  rhythms of the  gamelan .     For information on rhythm in  |Indian_music|Music_Of_India|  see  |Tala|Tala| . For other Asian approaches to rhythm see  |Rhythm_in_Persian_music|Rhythm_In_Persian_Music| ,  |Rhythm_in_Arabic_music|Rhythm_In_Arabic_Music|  and  |Usul—Rhythm_in_Turkish_music|Usul|  and  |Dumbek_rhythms|Dumbek_Rhythms| .                          Most music, dance and oral poetry establishes and maintains an underlying metric level , a basic unit of time that may be audible or implied, the  |pulse|Pulse|  or tactus of the  |mensural_level|Mensural_Level|  , or beat level, sometimes simply called the  |beat|Beat| . This consists of a series of identical yet distinct  |periodic|Frequency|  short-duration  |stimuli|Stimulus|  perceived as points in time . The beat pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as fundamental: it has a  |tempo|Tempo|  to which listeners  |entrain|Entrainment|  as they tap their foot or dance to a piece of music . It is currently most often designated as a crotchet or  |quarter_note|Quarter_Note|  in western notation . Faster levels are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels .  |Maury_Yeston|Maury_Yeston|  clarified Rhythms of recurrence arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups . Once a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present .            A  |durational_pattern|Duration|  that synchronises with a  |pulse|Pulse|  or pulses on the underlying  |metric_level|Metric_Level|  may be called a rhythmic unit. These may be classified as; metric—even patterns, such as steady  |eighth_notes|Eighth_Note|  or pulses—intrametric—confirming patterns, such as  |dotted|Dotted_Note| |eighth|Eighth_Note| - |sixteenth_note|Sixteenth_Note|  and  |swing|Swung_Note|  patterns—contrametric—non-confirming, or  |syncopated|Syncopated|  patterns and extrametric—irregular patterns, such as  |tuplets|Tuplet| .     A rhythmic gesture is any  |durational_pattern|Duration|  that, in contrast to the rhythmic unit, does not occupy a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level. It may be described according to its beginning and ending or by the rhythmic units it contains. Rhythms that begin on a strong pulse are thetic, those beginning on a weak pulse are anacrustic and those beginning after a rest or tied-over note are called initial rest. Endings on a strong pulse are strong, on a weak pulse, weak and those that end on a strong or weak upbeat are upbeat .       Rhythm is marked by the regulated succession of opposite elements, the  |dynamics|Dynamics|  of the  |strong_and_weak|Accent|  beat, the played beat and the inaudible but implied  |rest_beat|Rest| , the long and short note. As well as perceiving rhythm humans must be able to anticipate it. This depends on  |repetition|Repetition|  of a pattern that is short enough to memorize.     The alternation of the strong and weak beat is fundamental to the ancient language of poetry, dance and music. The common  |poetic_term_foot|Foot|  refers, as in dance, to the  |lifting_and_tapping|Arsis_And_Thesis|  of the foot in time. In a similar way musicians speak of an  |upbeat|Beat_Upbeat|  and a  |downbeat|Beat_Downbeat|  and of the  |on_and_off_beat|Beat_On-Beat_And_Off-Beat| . These contrasts naturally facilitate a dual hierarchy of rhythm and depend on repeating patterns of duration, accent and rest forming a pulse-group that corresponds to the  |poetic_foot|Foot| . Normally such pulse-groups are defined by taking the most accented beat as the first and  |counting|Counting|  the pulses until the next accent . A rhythm that accents another beat and de-emphasises the downbeat as established or assumed from the melody or from a preceding rhythm is called  |syncopated|Syncopation|  rhythm.     Normally, even the most complex of meters may be broken down into a chain of duple and triple pulses  either by  |addition_or_division|Additive_And_Divisive_Rhythm| . According to  |Pierre_Boulez|Pierre_Boulez| , beat structures beyond four, in western music, are simply not natural .            The tempo of the piece is the speed or frequency of the tactus, a measure of how quickly the beat flows. This is often measured in beats per minute  |rhythmic_unit|Unit_And_Gesture|  is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a pulse or several pulses . The duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo.     Musical sound may be analyzed on five different time scales, which Moravscik has arranged in order of increasing duration .   Supershort: a single cycle of an audible wave, approximately – second . These, though rhythmic in nature, are not perceived as separate events but as continuous  |musical_pitch|Pitch| .   Short: of the order of one second . Musical tempo is generally specified in the range 40 to 240 beats per minute. A continuous pulse cannot be perceived as a musical beat if it is faster than 8–10 per second or slower than 1 per 1.5–2 seconds . Too fast a beat becomes a  |drone|Drone| , too slow a succession of sounds seems unconnected . This time-frame roughly corresponds to the human  |heart_rate|Heart_Rate|  and to the duration of a single step, syllable or  |rhythmic_gesture|Unit_And_Gesture| .   Medium: ≥ few seconds, This median durational level defines rhythm in music  as it allows the definition of a rhythmic unit, the arrangement of an entire sequence of accented, unaccented and silent or  |rest|Rest|  pulses into the  |cells|Cell|  of a measure that may give rise to the briefest intelligible and self-existent musical unit , a  motif  or  figure . This may be further organized, by repetition and variation, into a definite phrase that may characterise an entire genre of music, dance or poetry and that may be regarded as the fundamental formal unit of music .   Long: ≥ many seconds or a minute, corresponding to a durational unit that consists of musical phrases —which may make up a melody, a formal section, a poetic  |stanza|Stanza|  or a characteristic  |sequence|Sequence_Dance|  of  |dance_moves_and_steps|Dance_Move| . Thus the temporal regularity of musical organisation includes the most elementary levels of  |musical_form|Form|  .   Very long: ≥ minutes or many hours, musical compositions or subdivisions of compositions.      |Curtis_Roads|Curtis_Roads|   takes a wider view by distinguishing nine-time scales, this time in order of decreasing duration. The first two, the  |infinite|Infinity|  and the supra musical, encompass natural periodicities of months, years, decades, centuries, and greater, while the last three, the  |sample|Sample|  and subsample, which take account of digital and electronic rates too brief to be properly recorded or perceived , measured in millionths of seconds , and finally the  |infinitesimal|Infinitesimal|  or infinitely brief, are again in the extra-musical domain. Roads Macro level, encompassing overall musical architecture or  |form|Musical_Form|  roughly corresponds to Moravcsiks very long division while his Meso level, the level of divisions of form including  |movements|Movement| ,  |sections|Section| ,  |phrases|Phrase|  taking seconds or minutes, is likewise similar to Moravcsiks long category. Roads  |Sound_object|Sound_Object| |note|Note|  ; fraction of a second to several seconds, and his  |Microsound|Microsound|   down to the threshold of audible perception; thousands to millionths of seconds, are similarly comparable to Moravcsiks short and supershort levels of duration.                 The study of rhythm, stress, and  |pitch|Pitch|  in  |speech|Speech|  is called  |prosody|Prosody| |linguistics|Linguistics|  and  |poetics|Poetics| , where it means the number of lines in a  |verse|Verse| , the number of syllables in each line and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented. Music inherited the term  |meter_or_metre|Meter|  from the terminology of poetry .     The metric structure of music includes meter, tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or  |durational_patterns|Duration|  of the music are projected . The terminology of western music is notoriously imprecise in this area .  preferred to speak of time and rhythmic shape ,  |Imogen_Holst|Imogen_Holst|   of measured rhythm .     Dance music has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and measure. The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing defines the  |tango|Tango_Music| , for example, as to be danced in  time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step forwards or backwards, lasting for one beat, is called a slow , so that a full right–left step is equal to one  measure  .          The general classifications of metrical rhythm, measured rhythm, and free rhythm may be distinguished . Metrical or divisive rhythm, by far the most common in Western music calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of the beat. Normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping . Measured rhythm  also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle. Free rhythm is where there is neither , such as in Christian  |chant|Chant| , which has a basic pulse but a freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse . See Free time .     Finally some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as  |Honkyoku|Honkyoku|  repertoire for  |shakuhachi|Shakuhachi| , may be considered ametric . Senza misura is an Italian musical term for without meter , meaning to play without a beat, using time to measure how long it will take to play the bar .               A composite rhythm is the  |durations|Duration|  and patterns produced by amalgamating all sounding  |parts|Part|  of a musical  |texture|Texture| . In music of the  |common_practice_period|Common_Practice_Period| , the composite rhythm usually confirms the  |meter|Meter| , often in metric or even-note patterns identical to the  |pulse|Pulse|  on a specific metric level. White defines composite rhythm as, the resultant overall rhythmic  |articulation|Articulation|  among all the voices of a  |contrapuntal|Counterpoint|  texture . This concept was concurrently defined as “attack point rhythm” by  |Maury_Yeston|Maury_Yeston|  in 1976 as “the extreme rhythmic foreground of a composition – the absolute surface of articulated movement” .          In the  |Griot|Griot|  tradition of Africa everything related to music has been passed on orally.  |Babatunde_Olatunji|Babatunde_Olatunji|  developed a simple series of spoken sounds for teaching the rhythms of the hand-drum, using six vocal sounds, Goon, Doon, Go, Do, Pa, Ta , for three basic sounds on the drum, each played with either the left or the right hand. The debate about the appropriateness of staff notation for African music is a subject of particular interest to outsiders while African scholars from Kyagambiddwa to Kongo have, for the most part, accepted the conventions and limitations of staff notation, and produced transcriptions to inform and enable discussion and debate .     John Miller  has argued that West African music is based on the tension between rhythms,  |polyrhythms|Polyrhythms|  created by the simultaneous sounding of two or more different rhythms, generally one dominant rhythm interacting with one or more independent competing rhythms. These often oppose or complement each other and the dominant rhythm. Moral values underpin a musical system based on repetition of relatively simple patterns that meet at distant  |cross-rhythmic|Cross-Beat|  intervals and on  |call-and-response_form|Call_And_Response| . Collective utterances such as proverbs or lineages appear either in phrases translated into drum talk or in the words of songs. People expect musicians to stimulate participation by reacting to people dancing. Appreciation of musicians is related to the effectiveness of their upholding community values .          Indian music has also been passed on orally. Tabla players would learn to speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting to play them.  |Sheila_Chandra|Sheila_Chandra| , an English pop singer of Indian descent, made performances based on her singing these patterns. In  |Indian_Classical_music|Indian_Classical_Music| , the  |Tala|Tala|  of a composition is the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece is structured.       In the 20th century, composers like  |Igor_Stravinsky|Igor_Stravinsky| ,  |Béla_Bartók|Béla_Bartók| ,  |Philip_Glass|Philip_Glass| , and  |Steve_Reich|Steve_Reich|  wrote more rhythmically complex music using  |odd_meters|List_Of_Works_In_Unusual_Time_Signatures| , and techniques such as  |phasing|Phasing|  and  |additive_rhythm|Additive_Rhythm| . At the same time, modernists such as  |Olivier_Messiaen|Olivier_Messiaen|  and his pupils used increased complexity to disrupt the sense of a regular beat, leading eventually to the widespread use of  |irrational_rhythms|Irrational_Rhythm|  in  |New_Complexity|New_Complexity| . This use may be explained by a comment of  |John_Cages|John_Cage|  where he notes that regular rhythms cause sounds to be heard as a group rather than individually; the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise be subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings .  |La_Monte_Young|La_Monte_Young|  also wrote music in which the sense of a regular beat is absent because the music consists only of long sustained tones . In the 1930s,  |Henry_Cowell|Henry_Cowell|  wrote music involving multiple simultaneous periodic rhythms and collaborated with  |Léon_Theremin|Léon_Theremin|  to invent the  |rhythmicon|Rhythmicon| , the first electronic  |rhythm_machine|Drum_Machine| , in order to perform them. Similarly,  |Conlon_Nancarrow|Conlon_Nancarrow|  wrote for the  |player_piano|Player_Piano| .          In  |linguistics|Linguistics| , rhythm or isochrony is one of the three aspects of  |prosody|Prosody| , along with  |stress|Stress|  and  |intonation|Intonation| . Languages can be categorized according to whether they are syllable-timed, mora-timed, or stress-timed. Speakers of syllable-timed languages such as Spanish and  |Cantonese|Cantonese|  put roughly equal time on each syllable; in contrast, speakers of stressed-timed languages such as English and  |Mandarin_Chinese|Mandarin_Chinese|  put roughly equal time lags between stressed syllables, with the timing of the unstressed syllables in between them being adjusted to accommodate the stress timing.       describes three categories of prosodic rules that create rhythmic successions that are additive , cumulative , or countercumulative . Cumulation is associated with closure or relaxation, countercumulation with openness or tension, while additive rhythms are open-ended and repetitive. Richard Middleton points out this method cannot account for  |syncopation|Syncopation|  and suggests the concept of  |transformation|Transformation|  .
