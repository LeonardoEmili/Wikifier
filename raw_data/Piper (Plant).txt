     Piper, the pepper plants or pepper vines, is an economically and ecologically important  |genus|Genus|  in the  |family|Family| |_Piperaceae|Piperaceae| .     It contains about 1,000-2,000  |species|Species|  of shrubs, herbs, and  |lianas|Liana| , many of which are dominant species in their native habitat. The diversification of this taxon is of interest to understanding the evolution of plants.     Pepper plants belong to the  |magnoliids|Magnoliids| , which are  |angiosperms|Angiosperm|  but neither  |monocots|Monocots|  nor  |eudicots|Eudicots| . Their  |family|Family| ,  |Piperaceae|Piperaceae| , is most closely related to the lizardtail family , which in fact generally look like smaller, more delicate and  |amphibious|Wikt_Special_Search_Amphibious|  pepper plants. Both families have characteristic tail-shaped  |inflorescences|Inflorescence|  covered in tiny flowers. A somewhat less close relative is the pipevine family . A well-known and very close relative – being also part of the Piperaceae – are the radiator plants of the genus  Peperomia .     The  |scientific_name|Scientific_Name|  Piper and the common name pepper are derived from the  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit|  term pippali, denoting the  |long_pepper|Long_Pepper|  .       Piper species have a  |pantropical|Tropical|  distribution, and are most commonly found in the understory of lowland  |tropical_rainforests|Tropical_Rainforest| , but can also occur in clearings and in higher elevation life zones such as  |cloud_forests|Cloud_Forest| ; one species  is subtropical and can tolerate light winter  |frost|Frost| . Peppers are often dominant species where they are found.     Most Piper species are either  |herbaceous|Herbaceous|  or  |vines|Vine| ; some grow as  |shrubs|Shrub|  or almost as small  |trees|Tree| . A few species, commonly called ant pipers , live in a  |mutualism|Mutualism|  with  |ants|Ant| . The fruit of the Piper plant, called a peppercorn when it is round and pea-sized, as is usual, is distributed in the wild mainly by  |birds|Bird| , but small fruit-eating  |mammals|Mammal|  – e.g.  |bats|Bat|  of the genus  Carollia  – are also important. Despite the high content of chemicals that are noxious to  |herbivores|Herbivore| , some have  |evolved|Evolved|  the ability to withstand the chemical defences of pepper plants, for example the  |sematurine|Sematurinae| |_moth|Moth|   Homidiana subpicta  or some  |flea_beetles|Flea_Beetle|  of the genus  Lanka . The latter can be significant  |pests|Pest|  to pepper growers.     Piper and humans |ornamentals|Ornamental_Plant|  for gardens in  |subtropical|Subtropical|  or warmer regions. Pepper vines can be used much as  |ivy|Ivy|  in  |temperate_climates|Temperate_Climate| , while other species, like lacquered pepper  grow as sizeable, compact and attractive shrubs with tough and shiny leaves. Smaller  |species|Species| , like Celebes pepper  with its finely patterned leaves, are also suitable as indoor  |pot_plants|Pot_Plant| .     Unsustainable  |logging|Logging|  of tropical  |primary_forests|Primary_Forest|  is threatening a number of peppers. The extent of the effect of such wholesale  |habitat_destruction|Habitat_Destruction|  on the genus is unknown, but it is to be noted that in the forests of  |Ecuador|Ecuador|  – the only larger region for which comprehensive data exists  |International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources|International_Union_For_The_Conservation_Of_Nature_And_Natural_Resources|  : http://www.iucnredlist.org 2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. IUCN, Gland. – more than a dozen species are known to be on the brink of  |extinction|Extinction| . On the other hand, other Piper species  have been widely distributed as a result of human activity and are a major  |invasive_species|Invasive_Species|  in certain areas.     The most significant human use of Piper is not for its looks however, but ultimately for the wide range of powerful  |secondary_compounds|Secondary_Compounds|  found particularly in the fruits.          Culinary use of pepper plants is attested perhaps as early as 9,000 years ago. Peppercorn remains were found among the food refuse left by  |Hoabinhian|Hoabinhian|  artisans at  |Spirit_Cave|Spirit_Cave| ,  |Thailand|Thailand| . It is likely that these plants were collected from the wild rather than deliberately grown.          Use of peppercorns as pungent spice is significant on an international scale. By  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity| , there was a vigorous  |trade_of_spices|Spice_Trade|  including black pepper  from  |South_Asia|South_Asia|  to  |Europe|Europe| . The  Apicius , a recipe collection complied about 400 AD, mentions pepper as a spice for most main dishes.  In the late  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , black pepper was expensive, but was available readily enough to be used more frequently than  |salt|Salt|  or  |sugar|Sugar| .     As Europe moved into the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| , trade routes deteriorated and the use of pepper declined somewhat, but peppercorns, storing easily and having a high mass per volume, never ceased to be a profitable trade item. In the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , international traders were nicknamed Pfeffersäcke in  |German|Germany|  towns of the  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League|  and elsewhere. Later, Wars were fought by European powers, between themselves and in complex alliances and enmities with  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean|  states, in part about control of the supply of spices, perhaps the most  |archetypal|Archetypal|  being black pepper fruit. Today, peppercorns of the three preparations are one of the most widely used spices of plant origin worldwide.     Due to the wide distribution of Piper, the fruit of other species are also important spices, many of them internationally.  |Long_pepper|Long_Pepper|  , is possibly the second-most popular Piper spice internationally; it has a rather  |chili|Chili_Pepper| -like heat and the whole  |inflorescence|Inflorescence|  is used as the fruits are tiny.  |Cubeb|Cubeb|  , also known as tailed pepper, played a major role in the spice trade. Reputedly  |Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip_Iv_Of_Spain|  suppressed trade in cubeb peppercorns at the end of the 1630s to capitalize on his share of the black pepper trade.  It remains a significant spice around the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean|  region today, however. West African pepper , is commonly used in  |West_African_cuisine|West_African_Cuisine| , and is sonetimes used in the  |East_Africa|East_Africa| n  berbere  spice mix. This species, despite being traded more extensively in earlier times, is less common outside Africa today.     Not only the seeds of Piper are used in cooking. West African Pepper leaves, known locally as uziza, are used as a flavoring vegetable in  |Nigerian|Nigerian_Cuisine|  stews. In  |Mexican|Mexico| -influenced cooking, hoja santa or Mexican pepperleaf  has a variety of uses. In  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia| , leaves of two species of Piper have major importance in cooking:  |lolot|Lolot|   is used to wrap meat for grilling in the  |Indochina|Indochina|  region, while wild betel  is used raw or cooked as a vegetable in  |Malay|Malay_Cuisine|  and  |Thai_cuisine|Thai_Cuisine| ;   The stems and roots of  Piper chaba  are used as a spice in  |Bangladeshi_cuisine|Bangladeshi_Cuisine| .           |Cubeb|Cubeb|   has been used in  |folk_medicine|Folk_Medicine|  and  |herbalism|Herbalism|  as well as, particularly in the early 20th century, as a  |cigarette|Cigarette|  flavoring.  P.  darienense  is used medically by the  |Kuna_people|Kuna_People|  of the  |Panama|Panama| - |Colombia|Colombia|  border region, and elsewhere it is used to intoxicate fish which then can be easily caught.  |Spiked_pepper|Spiked_Pepper| , often called matico appears to have strong  |disinfectant|Disinfectant|  and  |antibiotic|Antibiotic|  properties. Black pepper   |essential_oil|Essential_Oil|  is sometimes used in herbalism, and long pepper  is similarly employed in  |Ayurveda|Ayurveda| , where it was an ingredient of Triphala Guggulu and of Trikatu  |pills|Pill| , used for  rasayana   purposes.     One Piper species has gained large-scale use as a  |stimulant|Stimulant| .  |Betel|Betel|   leaves are used to wrap  |betel_palm|Betel_Palm|  nut slices; its sap helps release the stimulating effect of these cookies which are widely known as pan in  |India|India| .     Conversely, another Piper species,  |kava|Kava|  , is used for its  |depressant|Depressant|  and  |euphoriant|Euphoriant|  effects. In the  |Pacific|Pacific|  region, where it has been widely spread as a  |canoe_plant|Canoe_Plants| , kava is used to produce a calming and socializing drink somewhat similar to alcohol and  |benzodiazapines|Benzodiazapines|  but without many of the negative side effects and less of an  |addiction|Substance_Use_Disorder|  risk. It has also become popular elsewhere in recent decades, and is used as a medical plant. However, pills that contain parts of the whole plant have occasionally shown a strong  |hepatotoxic|Hepatotoxic|  effect, which has led to the banning of kava in many countries. On the other hand, the traditional preparation of the root as a calming drink appears to pose little, if any, such hazard.          The genus contains species suitable for studying  |natural_history|Natural_History| ,  |molecular_biology|Molecular_Biology| ,  |natural_products|Natural_Product| |_chemistry|Chemistry| ,  |community_ecology|Community_Ecology| , and  |evolutionary_biology|Evolutionary_Biology| .         Piper is a  |model_genus|Model_Organism|  for research in  |ecology_and_evolutionary_biology|Ecology_And_Evolutionary_Biology| . The diversity and ecological importance of the genus makes it an strong candidate for ecological and evolutionary studies. Most research has focused on the economically important species P. nigrum , P.  methysticum , and P.  betle .     The obligate and facultative  |ant|Ant| |_mutualists|Mutualism|  found in some Piper species have a strong influence on their biology, making them ideal systems for research on the evolution of  |symbioses|Symbiosis|  and the effect of mutualisms on biotic communities.     Important  |secondary_metabolites|Secondary_Metabolite|  found in pepper plants are  |piperine|Piperine|  and  |chavicine|Chavicine| , which were first isolated from Black Pepper, and reported to have antibiotic activities. Preliminary research reports has shown that piperine has an antibacterial activity against various bacteria such as S. aureus,   Streptococcus mutans,  and gastric cancer pathogen Helicobacter pylori  and decreased H. pylori toxin entry to gastric epithelial cells.  The  |piperidine|Piperidine| |_functional_group|Functional_Group|  is named after the former, and  |piperazine|Piperazine|   was in turn named after piperidine.     The significant secondary metabolites of kava are  |kavalactones|Kavalactone|  and  |flavokawains|Flavokawain| .  |Pipermethystine|Pipermethystine|  is suspected to be the main  |hepatotoxic|Hepatotoxic|  compound in this plants stems and leaves.          The largest number of Piper species are found in the Americas , with about 300 species from Southern Asia. There are smaller groups of species from the South Pacific and Africa . The American, Asian, and South Pacific groups each appear to be  |monophyletic|Monophyletic| ; the affinity of the African species is unclear.      Some species are sometimes  |segregated|Segregate|  into the genera Pothomorphe, Macropiper, Ottonia, Arctottonia, Sarcorhachis, Trianaeopiper, and Zippelia, but other sources keep them in Piper.     The species called Piper aggregatum and P.  fasciculatum are actually  Lacistema aggregatum , a plant from the family  |Lacistemataceae|Lacistemataceae| .
