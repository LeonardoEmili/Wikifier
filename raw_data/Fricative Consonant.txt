      Fricatives are  |consonants|Consonant| |_produced|Manner_Of_Articulation|  by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two  |articulators|Place_Of_Articulation|  close together . These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of ; the back of the tongue against the  |soft_palate|Soft_Palate| , in the case of  |German|German_Language|   ; or the side of the tongue against the  |molars|Molar| , in the case of  |Welsh|Welsh_Language|   . This turbulent airflow is called frication.     A particular subset of fricatives are the  sibilant s. When forming a sibilant, one still is forcing air through a narrow channel, but in addition, the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth . English , , , and  are examples of sibilants.     The usage of two other terms is less standardized: Spirant is an older term for fricatives used by some American and European phoneticians and phonologists  . Strident could mean just sibilant , but some authors include also  |labiodental|Labiodental_Consonant|  and  |uvular|Uvular_Consonant|  fricatives in the class.             |voiceless_coronal_sibilant|Voiceless_Alveolar_Fricative| , as in English sip     |voiced_coronal_sibilant|Voiced_Alveolar_Fricative| , as in English zip     |voiceless_dental_sibilant|Voiceless_Dental_Sibilant| |_voiced_dental_sibilant|Voiced_Dental_Sibilant| |_voiceless_apical_sibilant|Voiceless_Apicoalveolar_Fricative| |_voiced_apical_sibilant|Voiced_Apicoalveolar_Fricative| |_voiceless_postalveolar_sibilant|Voiceless_Postalveolar_Fricative| |_voiced_postalveolar_sibilant|Voiced_Postalveolar_Fricative| |_voiceless_palato_alveolar_sibilant|Voiceless_Postalveolar_Fricative|  , as in English ship     |voiced_palato_alveolar_sibilant|Voiced_Postalveolar_Fricative|  , as the si in English vision     |voiceless_alveolo_palatal_sibilant|Voiceless_Alveolo_Palatal_Fricative| |_voiced_alveolo_palatal_sibilant|Voiced_Alveolo_Palatal_Fricative| |_voiceless_retroflex_sibilant|Voiceless_Retroflex_Fricative| |_voiced_retroflex_sibilant|Voiced_Retroflex_Fricative|      All  |sibilants|Sibilants|  are  |coronal|Coronal_Consonant| , but may be  |dental|Dental_Consonant| ,  |alveolar|Alveolar_Consonant| ,  |postalveolar|Postalveolar_Consonant| , or  |palatal|Palatal_Consonant|   within that range. However, at the postalveolar place of articulation, the tongue may take several shapes: domed,  |laminal|Laminal_Consonant| , or  |apical|Apical_Consonant| , and each of these is given a separate symbol and a separate name. Prototypical retroflexes are  |subapical|Subapical_Consonant|  and palatal, but they are usually written with the same symbol as the apical postalveolars. The alveolars and dentals may also be either apical or laminal, but this difference is indicated with diacritics rather than with separate symbols.         |voiceless_bilabial_fricative|Voiceless_Bilabial_Fricative| |_voiced_bilabial_fricative|Voiced_Bilabial_Fricative| |_voiceless_labiodental_fricative|Voiceless_Labiodental_Fricative| , as in English fine     |voiced_labiodental_fricative|Voiced_Labiodental_Fricative| , as in English vine     |voiceless_linguolabial_fricative|Voiceless_Linguolabial_Fricative| |_voiced_linguolabial_fricative|Voiced_Linguolabial_Fricative| |_voiceless_dental_non_sibilant_fricative|Voiceless_Dental_Non_Sibilant_Fricative| , as in English thing     |voiced_dental_non_sibilant_fricative|Voiced_Dental_Non_Sibilant_Fricative| , as in English that     |voiceless_alveolar_non_sibilant_fricative|Voiceless_Alveolar_Fricativevoiceless_Alveolar_Non_Sibilant_Fricative| |_voiced_alveolar_non_sibilant_fricative|Voiced_Alveolar_Fricativevoiced_Alveolar_Non_Sibilant_Fricative| |_voiceless_trilled_fricative|Voiceless_Alveolar_Trillvoiceless_Alveolar_Raised_Non_Sonorant_Trill| |_voiced_trilled_fricative|Alveolar_Trillvoiced_Alveolar_Raised_Non_Sonorant_Trill| |_voiceless_palatal_fricative|Voiceless_Palatal_Fricative| |_voiced_palatal_fricative|Voiced_Palatal_Fricative| |_voiceless_velar_fricative|Voiceless_Velar_Fricative| |_voiced_velar_fricative|Voiced_Velar_Fricative| |_voiceless_palatal_velar_fricative|Voiceless_Palatal_Velar_Fricative| |_voiceless_uvular_fricative|Voiceless_Uvular_Fricative| |_voiceless_pharyngeal_fricative|Voiceless_Pharyngeal_Fricative|      The IPA also has letters for epiglottal fricatives,     |voiceless_epiglottal_fricative|Voiceless_Epiglottal_Fricative| |_voiced_epiglottal_fricative|Voiced_Epiglottal_Fricative|    with allophonic trilling, but these might be better analyzed as pharyngeal trills.

For the pharyngeal, approximants are more numerous than fricatives. A fricative realization may be specified by adding the  |uptack|Raised|  to the letters, . Likewise, the  |downtack|Lowered|  may be added to specify an approximant realization, .                |voiceless_glottal_transition|Voiceless_Glottal_Fricative| , as in English hat   |breathy_voiced_glottal_transition|Voiced_Glottal_Fricative|      In many languages, such as English, the glottal fricatives are unaccompanied  |phonation|Phonation|  states of the glottis, without any accompanying  |manner|Manner_Of_Articulation| , fricative or otherwise. However, in languages such as Arabic, they are true fricatives.       In addition,  is usually called a  |voiceless_labial_velar_fricative|Voiceless_Labial_Velar_Fricative|  , but it is actually an approximant. True doubly articulated fricatives may not occur in any language; but see  |voiceless_palatal_velar_fricative|Voiceless_Palatal_Velar_Fricative|  for a putative example.     Aspirated fricatives |tenuis|Tenuis_Consonant|  fricatives. Other  |phonations|Phonation|  are common in languages that have those phonations in their stop consonants.

Laver Principles of Phonetics     ----          Until its extinction,  |Ubykh|Ubykh_Language|  may have been the language with the most fricatives , some of which did not have dedicated symbols or diacritics in the  |IPA|International_Phonetic_Alphabet| . This number actually outstrips the number of all consonants in English . By contrast, approximately 8.7% of the worlds languages have no phonemic fricatives at all. Maddieson, Ian. 2008.  . In: Haspelmath, Martin & Dryer, Matthew S. & Gil, David & Comrie, Bernard The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Munich: Max Planck Digital Library, chapter 18. Accessed on 2008-09-15. This is a typical feature of  |Australian_Aboriginal_languages|Australian_Aboriginal_Languages| , where the few fricatives that exist result from changes to  |plosives|Plosive_Consonant|  or  |approximants|Approximant_Consonant| , but also occurs in some indigenous languages of  |New_Guinea|Papuan_Languages|  and South America that have especially small numbers of consonants. However, whereas  is entirely unknown in indigenous Australian languages, most of the other languages without true fricatives do have  in their consonant inventory.     Voicing contrasts in fricatives are largely confined to Europe, Africa, and Western Asia. Languages of South and East Asia, such as  |Mandarin_Chinese|Mandarin_Chinese| ,  |Korean|Korean_Language| , the  |Dravidian|Dravidian_Languages|  and  |Austronesian_languages|Austronesian_Languages| , typically do not have such voiced fricatives as  and , which are familiar to many European speakers. These voiced fricatives are also relatively rare in indigenous languages of the Americas. Overall, voicing contrasts in fricatives are much rarer than in plosives, being found only in about a third of the worlds languages as compared to 60 percent for plosive voicing contrasts. Maddieson, Ian. Voicing in Plosives and Fricatives , in Martin Haspelmath et al. The World Atlas of Language Structures, pp. 26â€“29. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. .     About 15 percent of the worlds languages, however, have unpaired voiced fricatives, i.e. a voiced fricative without a voiceless counterpart. Two-thirds of these, or 10 percent of all languages, have unpaired voiced fricatives but no voicing contrast between any fricative pair. Maddieson, Ian. Patterns of Sounds. Cambridge University Press, 1984. .     This phenomenon occurs because voiced fricatives have developed from  |lenition|Lenition|  of plosives or  |fortition|Fortition|  of approximants. This phenomenon of unpaired voiced fricatives is scattered throughout the world, but is confined to nonsibilant fricatives with the exception of a couple of languages that have  but lack .  The fricatives that occur most often without a voiceless counterpart are â€“ in order of ratio of unpaired occurrences to total occurrences â€“ , , ,  and .       Fricatives appear in  |waveforms|Waveforms|  as random noise caused by the turbulent airflow, upon which a periodic pattern is overlaid if voiced.  Fricatives produced in the front of the mouth tend to have energy concentration at higher frequencies than ones produced in the back.  The centre of gravity, the average frequency in a spectrum weighted by the amplitude, may be used to determine the place of articulation of a fricative relative to that of another.
