     Country calling codes or country dial-in codes are  |telephone_number|Telephone_Number|  prefixes for reaching telephone subscribers in the networks of the member countries or regions of the  |International_Telecommunication_Union|International_Telecommunication_Union|  . The codes are defined by the  |ITU_T|Itu_T|  in standards  |E_123|E_123|  and  |E_164|E_164| . The prefixes enable  |international_direct_dialing|International_Direct_Dialing|  , and are also referred to as international subscriber dialing codes.     Country codes are a component of the international  |telephone_numbering_plan|Telephone_Numbering_Plan| , and are necessary only when dialing a  |telephone_number|Telephone_Number|  to establish a call to another country. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign , which also indicates to the subscriber that the local  |international_call_prefix|List_Of_International_Call_Prefixes|  must first be dialed. For example, the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the  |North_American_Numbering_Plan|North_American_Numbering_Plan|  is 011, while it is 00 in most European, Asian and African countries. On  |GSM|Gsm|  networks, the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign.       Country calling codes are  |prefix_codes|Prefix_Code|  and can be organized as a  |tree|Tree| . In each row of the table, the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.          While there is a general geographic grouping to the zones, some exceptions exist for political and historical reasons. Thus, the geographical indicators below are approximations only.                 Member countries of the  |North_American_Numbering_Plan|North_American_Numbering_Plan|  are assigned three-digit  |area_codes|List_Of_Nanp_Area_Codes|  under the common country prefix 1, shown in the format +1 XXX.
