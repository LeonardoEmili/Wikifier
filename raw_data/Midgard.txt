The Old Norse form plays a notable role in  |Norse_cosmology|Norse_Cosmology| .             This name occurs in  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse_Language|  literature as . In  |Old_Saxon|Old_Saxon|   Heliand  it appears as  and in  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German|  poem  Muspilli  it appears as .

The word is present in  |Old_English|Old_English|  epic and poetry as ; later transformed to  or   in  |Middle_English|Middle_English|  literature. .     All these forms are from a  |Common_Germanic|Common_Germanic|  midja-gardaz , a compound of  midja-  middle and  gardaz  yard, enclosure .   In early Germanic cosmology, the term stands alongside  world  , from a  |Common_Germanic|Common_Germanic|  compound wira-alđiz, the age of men . Orel, Vladimir E. . A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden: Brill. p. 462.        Midgard is a realm in  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| . It is one of the Nine Worlds and the only one that is completely visible to mankind . Pictured as placed somewhere in the middle of  |Yggdrasil|Yggdrasil| , Midgard is between the land of  |Niflheim|Niflheim| —the land of ice—to the north and  |Muspelheim|Muspelheim| —the land of fire—to the south.  Midgard is surrounded by a world of water, or ocean, that is impassable. The ocean is inhabited by the great sea serpent  |Jörmungandr|Jörmungandr|  , who is so huge that he encircles the world entirely, grasping his own tail. The concept is similar to that of the  |Ouroboros|Ouroboros| . Midgard was also connected to Asgard, the home of the gods, by the  |Bifröst|Bifröst| , the rainbow bridge, guarded by  |Heimdallr|Heimdallr| .     In Norse mythology, Miðgarðr became applied to the wall around the world that the gods constructed from the eyebrows of the giant  |Ymir|Ymir|  as a defense against the  |Jotuns|Jötunn|  who lived in  |Jotunheim|Jotunheim| , east of Manheimr, the home of men , a word used to refer to the entire world. The gods slew the giant  |Ymir|Ymir| , the first created being, and put his body into the central void of the universe, creating the world out of his body: his flesh constituting the land, his  |blood|Ymirs_Blood|  the oceans, his bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs, his hairs the trees, and his brains the clouds. Ymirs skull was held by four dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri, Austri, and Vestri, who represent the four points on the compass and became the dome of heaven. The sun, moon, and stars were said to be scattered sparks in the skull.        According to the  |Eddas|Eddas| , Midgard will be destroyed at  |Ragnarök|Ragnarök| , the battle at the end of the world. Jörmungandr will arise from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom and causing the sea to rear up and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plane of  |Vígríðr|Vígríðr| , following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea only to rise again, fertile and green when the cycle repeats and the creation begins again.     Although most surviving instances of the word Midgard refer to spiritual matters, it was also used in more mundane situations, as in the  |Viking_Age|Viking_Age| |_runestone|Runestone|  poem from the inscription  |Sö_56|Fyrby_Runestone|  from Fyrby:          The  |Danish|Danish_Language|  and  |Swedish|Swedish_Language|  form  or , the  |Norwegian|Norwegian_Language|   or , as well as the  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language|  and  |Faroese|Faroese_Language|  form , all derive from the Old Norse term.       The name middangeard occurs six times in the  |Old_English|Old_English_Language|  epic poem  Beowulf , and is the same word as Midgard in  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse| . The term is equivalent in meaning to the Greek term  |Oikoumene|Oikoumene| , as referring to the known and inhabited world.     The concept of Midgard occurs many times in  |Middle_English|Middle_English| . The association with earth  in Middle English middellærd, middelerde is by  |popular_etymology|Popular_Etymology| ; the continuation of geard enclosure is  yard . An early example of this transformation is from the  |Ormulum|Ormulum| þatt ure Drihhtin wollde / ben borenn i þiss middellærd     ::that our Lord wanted / be born in this Middle-earth.     The usage of  |Middle_earth|Middle_Earth|  as a name for a setting was popularized by Old English scholar  |J_R_R_Tolkien|J_R_R_Tolkien|  in his  The Lord of the Rings  and other fantasy works; he was originally inspired by the references to middangeard and  Éarendel  in the Old English poem  Crist .       Mittilagart is mentioned in the 9th-century  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German|   Muspilli  meaning the world as opposed to the sea and the heavens:   ::muor varsuuilhit sih, suilizot lougiu der himil,   ::mano uallit, prinnit mittilagart .
