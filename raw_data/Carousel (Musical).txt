Carousel is the second  |musical|Musical_Theatre|  by the team of  |Richard_Rodgers|Richard_Rodgers|  and  |Oscar_Hammerstein_II|Oscar_Hammerstein_Ii|  . The 1945 work was adapted from  |Ferenc_Molnárs|Ferenc_Molnár|  1909 play  Liliom , transplanting its  |Budapest|Budapest|  setting to the  |Maine|Maine|  coastline. The story revolves around  |carousel|Carousel| |barker|Barker|  Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. The show includes the well-known songs  |If_I_Loved_You|If_I_Loved_You|  , June Is Bustin Out All Over and  |Youll_Never_Walk_Alone|Youll_Never_Walk_Alone|  . Richard Rodgers later wrote that Carousel was his favorite of all his musicals.     Following the spectacular success of the first  |Rodgers_and_Hammerstein|Rodgers_And_Hammerstein|  musical,  Oklahoma!  , the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with Oklahoma!, most likely unfavorably. They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to Liliom; Molnár had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre. After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful.     The musical required considerable modification during out-of-town tryouts, but once it opened on  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  on April 19, 1945, it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences. Carousel initially ran for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the  |West_End|West_End_Theatre|  in 1950. Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as Oklahoma!, the piece has been repeatedly revived, recorded several times and was  |filmed_in_1956|Carousel| . A production by  |Nicholas_Hytner|Nicholas_Hytner|  enjoyed success in 1992 in London, in 1994 in New York and on tour. Another Broadway revival opened in 2018. In 1999,  Time  magazine named Carousel the best musical of the 20th century.         Liliom  |Ferenc_Molnárs|Ferenc_Molnár|  Hungarian-language drama,  Liliom , premiered in  |Budapest|Budapest|  in 1909. The audience was puzzled by the work, and it lasted only thirty-odd performances before being withdrawn, the first shadow on Molnárs successful career as a playwright. Liliom was not presented again until after  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . When it reappeared on the Budapest stage, it was a tremendous hit. Molnár, pp. ix–x        Except for the ending, the plots of Liliom and Carousel are very similar. Fordin, p. 226 Andreas Zavocky , Hyland, p. 158 a carnival  |barker|Barker| , falls in love with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and they begin living together. With both discharged from their jobs, Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant. A subplot involves Julies friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a hotel porter—after the two marry, he becomes the owner of the hotel. Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife Ficsur to commit a robbery, but it goes badly, and Liliom stabs himself. He dies, and his spirit is taken to heavens police court. As Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be robbers like them do not come before God Himself. Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.     On his return to Earth, Liliom encounters his daughter, Louise, who like her mother is now a factory worker. Saying that he knew her father, he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens. When Louise refuses to take it, he strikes her. Not realizing who he is, Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with him. Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a kiss. Julie reminiscently tells her daughter that it is very possible for that to happen. Molnár, pp. 1–185     An English translation of Liliom was credited to  |Benjamin_Barney_Glazer|Benjamin_Glazer| , though there is a story that the actual translator, uncredited, was Rodgers first major partner  |Lorenz_Hart|Lorenz_Hart| . The  |Theatre_Guild|Theatre_Guild|  presented it in New York City in 1921, with  |Joseph_Schildkraut|Joseph_Schildkraut|  as Liliom, and the play was a success, running 300  performances. Hischak, p. 38 A 1940 revival, with  |Burgess_Meredith|Burgess_Meredith|  and  |Ingrid_Bergman|Ingrid_Bergman|  was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers. Nolan, p. 153 Glazer, in introducing the English translation of Liliom, wrote of the plays appeal:     And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.  ... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist. Molnár, p. xiii       In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became well known for creating  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  hits with other partners. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as  Babes in Arms  ,  The Boys from Syracuse  and  Pal Joey  . Secrest, pp. 403–04 Some of Rodgers work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre:  On Your Toes  was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot , while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. Block , pp. 194–95 Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as  Rose-Marie  ,  The Desert Song  ,  The New Moon  and  Show Boat  . Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an  |Oscar|Academy_Awards|  for his song with  |Jerome_Kern|Jerome_Kern| ,  |The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris|The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris|  , which was included in the 1941 film  Lady Be Good .  . Songwriters Hall of Fame. Retrieved on December 22, 2010     By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him. Layne, Joslyn.  Lorenz Hart Biography at Allmusic. Retrieved on December 22, 2010 Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was  Oklahoma!  . Nolan, pp. 1–25. Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma! and what came after it. Hischak, pp. 201–02 An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would serve, according to Hischak, as the model for Broadway shows for decades , and proved a huge popular and financial success. Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. Film producer  |Samuel_Goldwyn|Samuel_Goldwyn|  saw Oklahoma! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers was Sams blunt but funny way of telling me that Id never create another show as good as Oklahoma! Rodgers, p. 234 As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, Were such fools. No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, This is not another Oklahoma! Fordin, p. 224     Oklahoma! had been a struggle to finance and produce. Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed the Gloat Club . At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Molnárs Liliom into a musical. Both men refused—they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre. In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal. Fordin, p. 220 At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed Liliom, suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole . Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with zis and zose , would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.     A breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in Connecticut , proposed a New England setting. Hyland, p. 157 Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945,     I began to see an attractive ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls who worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to refute  ... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest. Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere. Hammerstein, Oscar II. The New York Times, April 15, 1945, Arts and Leisure, p. X1. Retrieved on December 20, 2010. Fee for article.       Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed the tunnel of Molnárs second act—a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Lilioms suicide—followed by a dark ending. They also felt it would be difficult to set Lilioms motivation for the robbery to music. Molnárs opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue; he had famously turned down Giacomo Puccini when the great composer wished to transform Liliom into an opera, stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccinis. In 1937, Molnár, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined another offer from Kurt Weill to adapt the play into a musical.     The pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a Liliom adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944—writing the film musical  |State_Fair|State_Fair|  Nolan, pp. 144–45 and producing  |I_Remember_Mama|I_Remember_Mama|  on Broadway. Fordin, pp. 223–24 Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see Oklahoma! Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt Liliom as beautifully as they had modified  |Green_Grow_the_Lilacs|Green_Grow_The_Lilacs|  into Oklahoma!, he would be pleased to have them do it. Fordin, pp. 221–22 The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943. The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for personal services . Hyland, pp. 157–58 The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot. At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded. Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, we could never have made Carousel. Secrest, p. 273     In seeking to establish through song Lilioms motivation for the robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in Pal Joey. Rodgers and Hart had overcome the problem with a song that Joey sings to himself, Im Talking to My Pal . This inspired Soliloquy . Both partners later told a story that Soliloquy was only intended to be a song about Lilioms dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl. However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely. Fordin, pp. 156–57     thu that begins Carousel; 1921   Hammerstein and Rodgers returned to the Liliom project in mid-1944. Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Molnár would disapprove of the results. Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard. Molnárs text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. Hyland, pp. 158–59 This Was a Real Nice Clambake was repurposed from a song, A Real Nice Hayride , written for Oklahoma! but not used. Block, p. 162     Molnárs ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts, Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical. According to Frederick Nolan in his book on the teams works: From that scene the song Youll Never Walk Alone sprang almost naturally. Nolan, p. 157 In spite of Hammersteins simple lyrics for Youll Never Walk Alone , Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music. Block , p. 184 Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending,     Liliom was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people. The way Molnár wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless. We couldnt accept that. The way we ended Carousel it may still be a tragedy but its a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others. Block , p. 180       When the pair decided to make This Was a Real Nice Clambake into an ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like, and researched the matter. Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, First came codfish chowder . However, further research convinced him the proper term was codhead chowder , a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. He decided to keep it as codfish . When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line We slit em down the back/And peppered em good . He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. One error not caught involved the song June Is Bustin Out All Over , in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter. Whenever this was brought to Hammersteins attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring. Fordin, pp. 227–28     Rodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves. Fordin, p. 222 In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musicals small orchestra. He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a pantomime scene accompanied by what became known as The Carousel Waltz . Rodgers, p. 239 The pantomime paralleled one in the Molnár play, which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience. Author Ethan Mordden described the effectiveness of this opening:     Other characters catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billys spiel. And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well. They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had. Mordden, p. 75         The casting for Carousel began when Oklahoma!s production team, including Rodgers and Hammerstein, was seeking a replacement for the part of Curly . Lawrence Langner had heard, through a relative, of a California singer named John Raitt , who might be suitable for the part. Langner went to hear Raitt, then urged the others to bring Raitt to New York for an audition. Raitt asked to sing Largo al factotum , Figaros aria from The Barber of Seville , to warm up. The warmup was sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a Curly, they had found a Liliom . Block , p. 122 Theresa Helburn made another California discovery, Jan Clayton , a singer/actress who had made a few minor films for MGM . She was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of Julie.     The producers sought to cast unknowns. Though many had played in previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto , had ever played on Broadway before. It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads, due to the war—Rodgers told his casting director, John Fearnley , that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive. Secrest, p. 277 Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made Oklahoma! a success, including director Rouben Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille . Miles White was the costume designer while Jo Mielziner was the scenic and lighting designer. Even though Oklahoma! orchestrator Russell Bennett had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on Carousel due to a radio contract, Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time. He orchestrated The Carousel Waltz and Mister Snow before finally being replaced by Don Walker . Fordin, p. 231 A new member of the creative team was Trude Rittmann , who arranged the dance music. Rittmann initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman, and found him difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers shows until the 1970s. Hyland, p. 161     le     Rehearsals began in January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Fordin, p. 232 Raitt was presented with the lyrics for Soliloquy on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were never fully addressed. Secrest, p. 276 At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. There are a number of variations on the story. Fordin, pp. 231–32 As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár in the rear of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner. Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, What you have done is so beautiful. And you know what I like best? The ending! Rodgers, pp. 240–41 Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.     Like most of the pairs works, Carousel contains a lengthy ballet, Billy Makes a Journey , Hischak, pp. 21–22 in the second act, as Billy looks down to the Earth from Up There and observes his daughter. In the original production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille. Hischak, pp. 26–27 It began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor, with the village women gathered for a birthing . The ballet involved every character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and contained a number of subplots. The focus was on Louise, played by Bambi Linn , who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the innocence of childhood. She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates, and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who symbolize Billys world. A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more girl than woman, and he leaves her. After Julie comforts her, Louise goes to a childrens party, where she is shunned. The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the childrens party, with Louise lost between the two groups. At the end, the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies. Easton, pp. 243–45.     The play opened for tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. The first act was well-received; the second act was not. Fordin, p. 233 Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1:30  a.m. The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. John Fearnley commented, Now I see why these people have hits. I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life. De Mille said of this conference, not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. Nor was there any idle joking.  ... We cut and cut and cut and then we went to bed. Block , p. 132 By the time the company left New Haven, de Milles ballet was down to forty minutes.     A major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the characters He and She , Block, p. 160 before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. Block , p. 129. At this time, according to the cast sheet distributed during the Boston run, Dr. Seldon was listed as the Minister . The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, Weve got to get God out of that parlor . When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, I dont care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor! Hammerstein duly put Mr. God atop a ladder, Block, pp. 161–62 and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth .     Hammerstein wrote that Molnárs advice, to combine two scenes into one, was key to pulling together the second act and represented a more radical departure from the original than any change we had made . A reprise of If I Loved You was added in the second act, which Rodgers felt needed more music. Rodgers, p. 241 Three weeks of tryouts in Boston followed the brief New Haven run, and the audience there gave the musical a warm reception. An even shorter version of the ballet was presented the final two weeks in Boston, but on the final night there, de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes, and it brought the house down, causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to embrace her.           Two young female millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the towns carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow . When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive . Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow , to whom she is newly engaged. Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julies job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other .     thu is Julie , and Margot Moser is Carrie .   Over a month passes, and preparations for the summer clambake are under way . Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julies cousin Netties spa. Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being unemployed, hit her. Carrie has happier news—she is engaged to Enoch, who enters as she discusses him . Billy arrives with his neer-do-well whaler friend, Jigger. The former barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie. Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family, larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having .     Jigger and his shipmates, joined by Billy, then sing about life on the sea . The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim—Julies former boss, Mr. Bascombe—might have to be killed. Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel . He would have to abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single. Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave. She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel. Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.—until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects soberly that youve got to be a father to a girl . Determined to provide financially for his future child, whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jiggers accomplice.     The whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy, who had earlier refused to go, agrees to join in, to Julies delight, as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jiggers alibi .       thu   Everyone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun . Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks in at the wrong moment, and declares that he is finished with her , as Jigger jeers . The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that hes your feller and you love him . Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. She begs him to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.     As they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards. They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mills money. The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die. Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him. Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair .     Billys defiant spirit is taken Up There to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official. The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself. He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since his suicide, and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her . Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young. The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter. He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.     Outside Julies cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch. Carries husband and their many children enter to fetch her—the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day. Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters. Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: each insults the others father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father. He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly. Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billys presence .     Billy invisibly attends Louises graduation, hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents success or be held back by their failure . Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song, Youll Never Walk Alone . Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldons words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she does not have to be an outcast. Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her. As his widow and daughter join in the singing, Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.           ° denotes original Broadway cast           Act I Carousel at the IBDB Database.
