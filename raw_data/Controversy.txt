      Controversy is a state of prolonged public dispute or debate, usually concerning a matter of conflicting  |opinion|Opinion|  or point of view. The word was coined from the  |Latin|Latin|  controversia, as a composite of controversus – turned in an opposite direction, from contra – against – and vertere – to turn, or versus , hence, to turn against.       In the  |theory_of_law|Jurisprudence| , a controversy differs from a  |legal_case|Legal_Case| ; while legal cases include all suits,  |criminal|Crime|  as well as  |civil|Civil_Law| , a controversy is a purely civil proceeding.     For example, the  |Case_or_Controversy_Clause|Case_Or_Controversy_Clause|  of  |Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution|Article_Three_Of_The_United_States_Constitution|   states that the judicial Power shall extend  ...  to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party . This clause has been deemed to impose a requirement that United States federal courts are not permitted to hear cases that do not pose an actual controversy  that is, an actual dispute between adverse parties which is capable of being resolved by the In addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, it also prohibits courts from issuing  |advisory_opinions|Advisory_Opinion| , or from hearing cases that are either  |unripe|Ripeness| , meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or  |moot|Mootness| , meaning that the controversy has already been resolved.             |Benfords_law_of_controversy|Gregory_Benfordbenfords_Law_Of_Controversy| , as expressed by the astrophysicist and science fiction author  |Gregory_Benford|Gregory_Benford|  in 1980, states:  Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.   In other words, it claims that the less factual information is available on a topic, the more controversy can arise around that topic – and the more facts are available, the less controversy can arise. Thus, for example, controversies in physics would be limited to subject areas where experiments cannot be carried out yet, whereas controversies would be inherent to politics, where communities must frequently decide on courses of action based on insufficient information.       Controversies are frequently thought to be a result of a lack of confidence on the part of the disputants – as implied by  |Benfords_law_of_controversy|Gregory_Benfordbenfords_Law_Of_Controversy| , which only talks about lack of information . For example, in analyses of the political controversy over  |anthropogenic_climate_change|Anthropogenic_Climate_Change| , which is exceptionally virulent in the  |United_States|United_States| , it has been proposed that those who are opposed to the scientific consensus do so because they dont have enough information about the topic.   A study of 1540 US adults  found instead that levels of scientific literacy correlated with the strength of  |opinion_on_climate_change|Public_Opinion_On_Climate_Change| , but not on which side of the debate that they stood.     The puzzling phenomenon of two individuals being able to reach different conclusions after being exposed to the same facts has been frequently explained by reference to a  |bounded_rationality|Bounded_Rationality|  – in other words, that most judgments are made using fast acting heuristics   that work well in every day situations, but are not amenable to decision making about complex subjects such as climate change.  |Anchoring|Anchoring|  has been particularly identified as relevant in climate change controversies  as individuals are found to be more positively inclined to believe in climate change if the outside temperature is higher, if they have been primed to think about heat, and if they are primed with higher temperatures when thinking about the future temperature increases from climate change.     In other controversies – such as that around the  |HPV_vaccine|Hpv_Vaccine| , the same evidence seemed to license inference to radically different conclusions.  Kahan et al.  explained this by the cognitive biases of biased assimilation  and a credibility heuristic.      Similar effects on reasoning are also seen in non-scientific controversies, for example in the  |gun_control_debate_in_the_United_States|Gun_Politics_In_The_United_States| .  As with other controversies, it has been suggested that exposure to empirical facts would be sufficient to resolve the debate once and for all.   In computer simulations of cultural communities, beliefs were found to polarize within isolated sub-groups, based on the mistaken belief of the communitys unhindered access to ground truth. Such confidence in the group to find the ground truth is explicable through the success of  |wisdom_of_the_crowd|Wisdom_Of_The_Crowd|  based inferences.  However, if there is no access to the ground truth, as there was not in this model, the method will fail.      |Bayesian_decision_theory|Bayes_Estimator|  allows these failures of rationality to be described as part of a statistically optimized system for decision making. Experiments and computational models in  |multisensory_integration|Multisensory_Integration|  have shown that sensory input from different senses is integrated in a statistically optimal way,  in addition, it appears that the kind of inferences used to infer single sources for multiple sensory inputs uses a Bayesian inference about the causal origin of the sensory stimuli.  As such, it appears neurobiologically plausible that the brain implements decision-making procedures that are close to optimal for Bayesian inference.     Brocas and Carrillo propose a model to make decisions based on noisy sensory inputs,  beliefs about the state of the world are modified by Bayesian updating, and then decisions are made based on beliefs passing a threshold. They show that this model, when optimized for single-step decision making, produces belief  |anchoring|Anchoring|  and polarization of opinions – exactly as described in the  |global_warming_controversy|Global_Warming_Controversy|  context – in spite of identical evidence presented, the pre-existing beliefs has an overwhelming effect on the beliefs formed. In addition, the preferences of the agent also cause the beliefs formed to change – this explains the biased assimilation  shown above. This model allows the production of controversy to be seen as a consequence of a decision maker optimized for single-step decision making, rather than as a result of limited reasoning in the  |bounded_rationality|Bounded_Rationality|  of  |Daniel_Kahneman|Daniel_Kahneman|.
