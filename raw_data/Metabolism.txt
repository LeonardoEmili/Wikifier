                       Metabolism  is the set of  |life|Life| -sustaining  |chemical_reactions|Chemical_Reactions|  in  |organisms|Organisms| . The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to  |energy|Energy|  to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for  |proteins|Protein| ,  |lipids|Lipid| ,  |nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid| , and some  |carbohydrates|Carbohydrate| ; and the elimination of  |nitrogenous_wastes|Metabolic_Wastenitrogen_Wastes| . These  |enzyme|Enzyme| -catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. .     Metabolic reactions may be categorized as  catabolic  - the breaking down of compounds ; or  anabolic  - the building up  of compounds . Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy.     The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into  |metabolic_pathways|Metabolic_Pathway| , in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific  |enzyme|Enzyme| . Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require  |energy|Energy|  that will not occur by themselves, by  |coupling|Coupling|  them to  |spontaneous_reactions|Spontaneous_Process|  that release energy. Enzymes act as  |catalysts|Catalysis|  - they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly - and they also allow the  |regulation|Metabolic_Pathwayregulation|  of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the  |cells|Cell|  environment or to  |signals|Cell_Signaling|  from other cells.     The metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find  |nutritious|Nutrition|  and which  |poison|Poison| ous. For example, some  |prokaryotes|Prokaryote|  use  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals.  The  |basal_metabolic_rate|Basal_Metabolic_Rate|  of an organism is the measure of the amount of energy consumed by all of these chemical reactions.     A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways among vastly different species.  For example, the set of  |carboxylic_acids|Carboxylic_Acid|  that are best known as the intermediates in the  |citric_acid_cycle|Citric_Acid_Cycle|  are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the  |unicellular|Unicellular_Organism|  bacterium  Escherichia coli  and huge  |multicellular_organisms|Multicellular_Organism|  like  |elephants|Elephant| .  These similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in  |evolutionary_history|Evolutionary_History_Of_Life| , and their retention because of their  |efficacy|Efficacy| .                  Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of  |molecule|Molecule| |amino_acids|Amino_Acid| ,  |carbohydrates|Carbohydrate|  and  |lipids|Lipid|  . As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make  |polymers|Polymer|  such as  |DNA|Dna|  and  |proteins|Protein| , essential  |macromolecules|Macromolecules|  of life.           |Proteins|Protein|  are made of  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  arranged in a linear chain joined together by  |peptide_bonds|Peptide_Bond| . Many proteins are  |enzymes|Enzyme|  that  |catalyze|Catalysis|  the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as those that form the  |cytoskeleton|Cytoskeleton| , a system of  |scaffolding|Scaffolding|  that maintains the cell shape.  Proteins are also important in  |cell_signaling|Cell_Signaling| ,  |immune_responses|Antibody| ,  |cell_adhesion|Cell_Adhesion| ,  |active_transport|Active_Transport|  across membranes, and the  |cell_cycle|Cell_Cycle| .  Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle ,  especially when a primary source of energy, such as  |glucose|Glucose| , is scarce, or when cells undergo metabolic stress.         |Lipids|Lipid|  are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Their main structural uses are as part of  |biological_membranes|Biological_Membrane|  both internal and external, such as the  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane| , or as a source of energy. Lipids are usually defined as  |hydrophobic|Hydrophobe|  or  |amphipathic|Amphiphiles|  biological molecules but will dissolve in  |organic_solvents|Organic_Solvent|  such as  |alcohol|Ethanol| ,  |benzene|Benzene|  or  |chloroform|Chloroform| .  The  |fats|Fat|  are a large group of compounds that contain  |fatty_acids|Fatty_Acid|  and  |glycerol|Glycerol| ; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid  |esters|Ester|  is called a  |triacylglyceride|Triglyceride| .  Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as  |sphingosine|Sphingosine|  in the  |sphingolipids|Sphingolipid| , and  |hydrophilic|Hydrophile|  groups such as  |phosphate|Phosphate|  as in  |phospholipids|Phospholipid| .  |Steroids|Steroid|  such as  |cholesterol|Cholesterol|  are another major class of lipids.            |Carbohydrates|Carbohydrate|  are  |aldehydes|Aldehyde|  or  |ketones|Ketone| , with many  |hydroxyl|Hydroxyl|  groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of  |energy|Energy|   and structural components . The basic carbohydrate units are called  |monosaccharides|Monosaccharide|  and include  |galactose|Galactose| ,  |fructose|Fructose| , and most importantly  |glucose|Glucose| . Monosaccharides can be linked together to form  |polysaccharides|Polysaccharide|  in almost limitless ways.        The two nucleic acids, DNA and  |RNA|Rna| , are polymers of  |nucleotides|Nucleotide| . Each nucleotide is composed of a phosphate attached to a  |ribose|Ribose|  or  |deoxyribose|Deoxyribose|  sugar group which is attached to a  |nitrogenous_base|Nitrogenous_Base| . Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of  |transcription|Transcription|  and  |protein_biosynthesis|Protein_Biosynthesis| . This information is protected by  |DNA_repair|Dna_Repair|  mechanisms and propagated through  |DNA_replication|Dna_Replication| . Many  |virus|Virus| es have an  |RNA_genome|Rna_Virus| , such as  |HIV|Hiv| , which uses  |reverse_transcription|Reverse_Transcription|  to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome.  RNA in  |ribozymes|Ribozyme|  such as  |spliceosomes|Spliceosome|  and  |ribosomes|Ribosome|  is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual  |nucleosides|Nucleoside|  are made by attaching a  |nucleobase|Nucleobase|  to a  |ribose|Ribose|  sugar. These bases are  |heterocyclic|Heterocyclic|  rings containing nitrogen, classified as  |purines|Purine|  or  |pyrimidines|Pyrimidine| . Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.              Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of  |functional_groups|Functional_Group|  of atoms and their bonds within molecules.  This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called  |coenzymes|Coenzyme| . Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the  |substrate|Substrate|  for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.      One central coenzyme is  |adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  , the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There is only a small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between  |catabolism|Catabolism|  and  |anabolism|Anabolism| . Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in  |phosphorylation|Phosphorylation|  reactions.     A  |vitamin|Vitamin|  is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in cells. In human  |nutrition|Nutrition| , most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells.   |Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide|  , a derivative of vitamin B 3 , is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of  |dehydrogenases|Dehydrogenase|  remove electrons from their substrates and  |reduce|Redox|  NAD + into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the  |reductases|Reductase|  in the cell that need to reduce their substrates.  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD + /NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP + /NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.               Inorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism; some are abundant  while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammals mass is made up of the elements  |carbon|Carbon| ,  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| ,  |calcium|Calcium| ,  |sodium|Sodium| ,  |chlorine|Chlorine| ,  |potassium|Potassium| ,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| ,  |phosphorus|Phosphorus| ,  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |sulfur|Sulfur| .   |Organic_compounds|Organic_Compound|  contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.     The abundant inorganic elements act as  |ion|Ion| ic  |electrolytes|Electrolyte| . The most important ions are  |sodium|Sodium| ,  |potassium|Potassium| ,  |calcium|Calcium| ,  |magnesium|Magnesium| ,  |chloride|Chloride| ,  |phosphate|Phosphate|  and the organic ion  |bicarbonate|Bicarbonate| . The maintenance of precise  |ion_gradients|Ion_Gradient|  across  |cell_membranes|Cell_Membrane|  maintains  |osmotic_pressure|Osmotic_Pressure|  and  |pH|Ph| .  Ions are also critical for  |nerve|Nerve|  and  |muscle|Muscle|  function, as  |action_potentials|Action_Potential|  in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the  |extracellular_fluid|Extracellular_Fluid|  and the cells fluid, the  |cytosol|Cytosol| .  Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called  |ion_channels|Ion_Channel| . For example,  |muscle_contraction|Muscle_Contraction|  depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and  |T-tubules|T-Tubule| .       |Transition_metals|Transition_Metal|  are usually present as  |trace_elements|Trace_Element|  in organisms, with  |zinc|Zinc|  and  |iron|Iron|  being most abundant of those.   These metals are used in some proteins as  |cofactors|Cofactor|  and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as  |catalase|Catalase|  and oxygen-carrier proteins such as  |hemoglobin|Hemoglobin| .  Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state by the end of the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as  |ferritin|Ferritin|  or  |metallothionein|Metallothionein|  when not in use.          |Catabolism|Catabolism|  is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon , as shown in the table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by  |organotrophs|Organotroph| , while  |lithotrophs|Lithotroph|  use inorganic substrates, and  |phototrophs|Phototroph|  capture sunlight as  |chemical_energy|Potential_Energychemical_Potential_Energy| . However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on  |redox|Redox|  reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as  |organic_molecules|Organic_Molecule| , water,  |ammonia|Ammonia| ,  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  or  |ferrous_ions|Ferrous|  to acceptor molecules such as  |oxygen|Oxygen| ,  |nitrate|Nitrate|  or  |sulfate|Sulfate| .  In animals, these reactions involve complex  |organic_molecules|Organic_Molecule|  that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and water. In  |photosynthetic|Photosynthesis|  organisms, such as plants and  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria| , these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.           The most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as protein s, polysaccharide s or lipid s, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A , which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain , releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide into NADH.         Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins cannot be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzyme s include protease s that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolase s that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides .     Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts , including the stomach and pancreas , and salivary gland s. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.   thu s, carbohydrate s and fat s           Carbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharide s. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis , where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle . Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD + as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate , through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway , which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose , the sugar component of nucleic acid s.     Fats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all be used by the cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.     Amino acid s are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase . The amino group is fed into the urea cycle , leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid . Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α- ketoglutarate . The glucogenic amino acid s can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis .               In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryote s by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain . In prokaryote s, these proteins are found in the cells inner membrane . These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump proton s across a membrane.   thu . ATP is shown in red, ADP and phosphate in pink and the rotating stalk subunit in black.   Pumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient . This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase . The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate  – turning it into ATP.           Chemolithotroph y is a type of metabolism found in prokaryote s where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compound s. These organisms can use hydrogen , reduced sulfur compounds , ferrous iron or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite . These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycle s such as acetogenesis , nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility .           The energy in sunlight is captured by plant s, cyanobacteria , purple bacteria , green sulfur bacteria and some protist s. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.     In many organisms the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centre s or rhodopsin s. Reaction centers are classed into two types depending on the type of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.     In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the cytochrome b6f complex , which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast . These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP + , for use in the Calvin cycle , which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.           Anabolism.
