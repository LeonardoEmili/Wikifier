In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , a principal ideal domain, or PID, is an  |integral_domain|Integral_Domain|  in which every  |ideal|Ideal|  is  |principal|Principal_Ideal| , i.e., can be generated by a single element. More generally, a  |principal_ideal_ring|Principal_Ideal_Ring|  is a nonzero commutative ring whose ideals are principal, although some authors refer to PIDs as principal rings. The distinction is that a principal ideal ring may have  |zero_divisors|Zero_Divisor|  whereas a principal ideal domain cannot.     Principal ideal domains are thus mathematical objects that behave somewhat like the  |integers|Integers| , with respect to  |divisibility|Integral_Domaindivisibility,_Prime_And_Irreducible_Elements| |prime_elements|Integral_Domaindivisibility,_Prime_And_Irreducible_Elements|  ; any two elements of a PID have a  |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor|  . If x and y are elements of a PID without common divisors, then every element of the PID can be written in the form ax  +  by.     Principal ideal domains are  |noetherian|Noetherian_Ring| , they are  |integrally_closed|Integrally_Closed_Domain| , they are  |unique_factorization_domains|Unique_Factorization_Domain|  and  |Dedekind_domains|Dedekind_Domain| . All  |Euclidean_domains|Euclidean_Domain|  and all  |fields|Field|  are principal ideal domains.     Principal ideal domains appear in the following chain of  |class_inclusions|Subclass|           Examples include:   K : any  |field|Field| ,     : the  |ring|Ring|  of  |integers|Integer| , See Fraleigh & Katz , p. 73, Corollary of Theorem 1.7, and notes at p. 369, after the corollary of Theorem 7.2   K :  |rings_of_polynomials|Polynomial_Ring|  in one variable with coefficients in a field. Furthermore, a ring of formal power series in one variable over a field is a PID since every ideal is of the form ,     : the ring of  |Gaussian_integers|Gaussian_Integers|  See Fraleigh & Katz , p. 385, Theorem 7.8 and p. 377, Theorem 7.4. ,     : the  |Eisenstein_integers|Eisenstein_Integers| ,   Any  |discrete_valuation_ring|Discrete_Valuation_Ring| , for instance the ring of  |-adic_integers|P-Adic_Integer|    .     Examples of integral domains that are not PIDs:     : the ring of all polynomials with integer coefficients. It is not principal because   2, x   is an example of an ideal that cannot be generated by a single polynomial.   K :  |rings_of_polynomials_in_two_variables|Polynomialringthepolynomialringinseveralvariables| . The ideal   x, y   is not principal.          The key result is the structure theorem: If R is a principal ideal domain, and M is a finitely   generated R-module, then M is a direct sum of cyclic modules, i.e., modules with one generator. The cyclic modules are isomorphic to R/xR for some x  R See also Ribenboim , , proof of lemma 2. .     If M is a  |free_module|Free_Module|  over a principal ideal domain R, then every submodule of M is again free. This does not hold for modules over arbitrary rings, as the example     of modules over   shows.       In a principal ideal domain, any two elements  have a  |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor| , which may be obtained as a generator of the ideal .     All  |Euclidean_domains|Euclidean_Domain|  are principal ideal domains, but the converse is not true.   An example of a principal ideal domain that is not a Euclidean domain is the ring   Wilson, Jack C.
