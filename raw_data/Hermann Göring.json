As the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitlers efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile. His last birthday, celebrated at the  Führerbunker  in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included.

A week after the start of the Soviet invasion, Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death, thus codifying the declaration he had made soon after the beginning of the war. The decree also gave Göring full authority to act as Hitlers deputy if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action.     Göring feared being branded a traitor if he tried to take power, but also feared being accused of dereliction of duty if he did nothing. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitlers successor. After conferring with Koller and ": null

With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitlers deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night , he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.          The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor. Bormann argued that Görings telegram was not a request for permission to act as Hitlers deputy, but a demand to resign or be overthrown. Bormann also intercepted another telegram in which Göring directed Ribbentrop to report to him if there was no further communication from Hitler or Göring before midnight. Hitler sent a reply to Göringprepared with Bormanns helprescinding the 1941 decree and threatening him with execution for high treason unless he immediately resigned from all of his offices. Göring duly resigned. Afterwards, Hitler ordered the SS to place Göring, his staff, and Lammers under house arrest at Obersalzberg.
