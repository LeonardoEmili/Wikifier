      The history of the Republic of the Congo  has been marked by diverse civilisations: indigenous, French and post-independence.       The earliest inhabitants of the region comprising present-day Congo were the  |Bambuti|Mbuti_People|  people. The Bambuti were linked to  |Pygmy|Pygmy|  tribes whose  |Stone_Age|Stone_Age|  culture was slowly replaced by  |Bantu|Bantu_Peoples|  tribes coming from regions north of present-day  |Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo|Democratic_Republic_Of_The_Congo|  about 2,000 years ago, introducing  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  culture to the region. The main Bantu tribe living in the region were the  |Kongo|Kongo_People| , also known as Bakongo, who established mostly weak and unstable kingdoms along the mouth, north and south of the  |Congo_River|Congo_River| . The capital of this Kongolese kingdom,  |Mbanza_Kongo|Mbanza_Kongo| , later baptized as São Salvador by the  |Portuguese|Portuguese_People| , is a town in northern  |Angola|Angola|  near the border with the DRC.     From the capital they ruled over an empire encompassing large parts of present-day Angola, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. They ruled over nearby tributary states, often by appointing sons of the Kongo kings to head these states. It had six so-called provinces called Mbemba,  |Soyo|Soyo| , Mbamba, Mbata,  |Nsundi|Nsundi|  and Mpangu. With the  |Kingdom_of_Loango|Kingdom_Of_Loango|  in the north and the Kingdom of Mbundu in the south being tributary states. In the East it bordered on the  |Kwango_river|Kwango_River| , a tributary of the Congo River. In total the kingdom is said to have had 3 to 4 million inhabitants and a surface of about 300,000  km². According to oral traditions it was established in around 1400 when King  |Lukeni_lua_Nimi|Lukeni_Lua_Nimi|  conquered the kingdom of Kabunga and established  |Mbanza_Kongo|Mbanza_Kongo|  as its capital.          This  |Africa|Africa| n  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  culture came under great pressure with the arrival of the first  |Europeans|European_Ethnic_Groups| , in this case  |Portuguese_explorers|Portuguese_Empire| . King  |John_II_of_Portugal|John_Ii_Of_Portugal|  sought, in order to break  |Venetian|Republic_Of_Venice|  and  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  control over trade with the East, to organize a series of expeditions south along the African coast with the goal of establishing direct contact with Asia. In 1482–1483, Captain  |Diogo_Cão|Diogo_Cão| , sailing southwards on the uncharted  |Congo_River|Congo_River| , discovered the mouth of the river, and became the first European to encounter the  |Kingdom_of_Kongo|Kingdom_Of_Kongo| . . .     Initially relations were limited and considered beneficial to both sides. With  |Christianity|Christianity|  easily accepted by the local nobility, leading on 3 May 1491 to the baptism of king  |Nzinga_a_Nkuwu|Nzinga_A_Nkuwu|  as the first Christian Kongolese king  |João_I|João_I_Of_Kongo| . He was succeeded after his death in 1506 by his son  |Nzinga_Mbemba|Nzinga_Mbemba| , who ruled as King  |Afonso_I|Afonso_I|  until 1543. Under his reign Christianity gained a strong foothold in the country. Many churches were built in Mbanza, of which the  |Kulumbimbi_Cathedral|Cathedral_Of_The_Holy_Saviour_Of_Congo|  was the most impressive. In theory the kings of Portugal and Kongo were equals and they exchanged letters as such. Kongo at some point even established diplomatic relations with the  |Vatican|Holy_See| , and the  |Pope|Pope|  appointed a local priest as bishop for the region.       The result was a series of revolts against Portuguese rule of which the  |battle_of_Mbwila|Battle_Of_Mbwila|  and the revolt led by  |Kimpa_Vita|Kimpa_Vita|  were the most important. The battle of Mbwila was the result of a conflict between the Portuguese, led by governor  |André_Vidal_de_Negreiros|André_Vidal_De_Negreiros| , and the Kongolese king António I concerning mining rights. The Kongolese refused to give the Portuguese extra territorial rights and the Portuguese were angry because of Kongolese support for previous  |Dutch|Netherlands|  invasions of the region. During a battle on 25 October 1665 an estimated 20,000 Kongolese fought against the Portuguese, who won the battle thanks to the early death in battle of Kongolese King  |Afonso_I_of_Kongo|Afonso_I_Of_Kongo| .     The revolt of Kimpa Vita was another attempt to regain independence from the Portuguese. Baptised around 1684 as Dona Béatrice, Kimpa Vita was raised Catholic and being very pious she became a nun seeing visions of  |St._Anthony_of_Padua|St._Anthony_Of_Padua|  ordering her to restore the kingdom of Kongo to its former glory. Creating the Anthonian prophetic movement she interfered directly in the then civil war between the three members of the local nobility claiming the Kongolese throne, João II, Pedro IV and Pedro Kibenga. In it she took sides against Pedro IV, considered the favorite of the Portuguese. Her revolt, during which she captured the capital Mbanza Kongo, was short lived. She was captured by the forces of Pedro IV and under orders of Portuguese  |Capuchin_Friars|Capuchin_Friars|  condemned for being a witch and a heretic and consequently burned to death. For many, she is the African version of  |Joan_of_Arc|Joan_Of_Arc|  and an early symbol of African resistance against colonialism because, for her outspokenness, she was burned alive on a pyre. Thornton, John K. The Kongolese Saint Anthony: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998.           As a result of all these wars the kingdom of the Loango in the north gained independence from Kongo. Also new kingdoms came to existence of which the  |Téké|Téké|  was the most important, ruling over a large area encompassing present-day  |Brazzaville|Brazzaville|  and  |Kinshasa|Kinshasa| . Portugals position in Europe suffered a major change in 1580 when the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal were united by a  |personal_union|Personal_Union|  under  |King_Philip|Philip_Ii_Of_Spain| , creating the  |Iberian_Union|Iberian_Union|  which lasted until 1640. This resulted in a diminished role for Portugal in African affairs, including the area around the mouth of the Congo River. The Kingdom of Kongo was reduced to a small enclave in the north of Angola with King Pedro V in 1888 finally accepting to become a vassal of the Portuguese. The Portuguese abolished the kingdom after the revolt of the Kongolese in 1914.。。           The period leading up to the  |Berlin_Conference|Berlin_Conference|  on Africa saw a rush by the major European powers to increase their control of the African continent. The rise in Western Europe of  |capitalism|Capitalism|  and the consequent  |industrialization|Industrialization|  led to a fast-growing demand for African raw materials like  |rubber|Rubber| ,  |palm_oil|Palm_Oil|  and  |cotton|Cotton| . Those who had these raw materials could have their economy grow strong. Others would lose out. This resulted in a new and more intensified  |scramble_for_Africa|Scramble_For_Africa| .     The Congo River hereby was a prime target for this new conquest by the European nations. Here the French, the Belgian  |King_Leopold_II|King_Leopold_Ii|  and the Portuguese, in close cooperation with the British, fought for control of this area. Resulting in the division of the mouth of the Congo River between Portugal, who obtained  |Cabinda|Cabinda| , an enclave north of the Congo River situated on the Atlantic Coast, the French who seized the large area north of the River, and king Leopold II gaining only a small foothold at the mouth of the Congo River but obtaining the huge hinterland, the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo . Hereby Leopold II obtained control via his  |International_African_Society|International_African_Society|  and later the International Congolese Society, so-called philanthropic organizations who hired the British explorer  |Henry_Morton_Stanley|Henry_Morton_Stanley|  to establish its authority. This resulted in the creation of the  |Congo_Free_State|Congo_Free_State| , the private empire of Leopold II. On November 15, 1908 the Belgian parliament annexed the colony, the reign of Leopold II over Congo being discredited.       On the north bank of the river arrived the French explorer  |Pierre_Savorgnan_de_Brazza|Pierre_Savorgnan_De_Brazza| , born in the Italian city of Rome in 1852. As a French naval officer he refused to work for the International African Society and instead helped the French in their conquest of the area north of the Congo River. Traveling from the Atlantic Ocean coast in present-day Gabon via the rivers  |Ogooué|Ogooué|  and  |Lefini|Lefini_River|  he arrived in 1880 in the kingdom of the Téké where on 10 September 1880 he signed the treaty with king  |Makoko|Makoko|  establishing French control over the region and making his capital soon afterwards at the small village named Mfoa later to be called Brazzaville.             Establishing French control was difficult. Belgian  |King_Leopold_II|King_Leopold_Ii|  also tried to gain a foothold on the northern bank of the Congo River and sent Stanley to the area around Brazzaville. Following this was a series of revolts against the French of which the Bahangala Revolt led by Mabiala Ma Nganga was the first important one. It started in 1892 with the murder of the French administrator Laval and ended with the killing by the French of its leader in 1896. Many of the revolts were the result of French policy of maltreating the local population through the use of harsh forced labor. The locals were governed through the use of the repressive Code de l |indigénat|Indigénat|  Act. A law, which introduced forced labor, made it illegal for the local population to publicly air its grievances and excluded them from all the important jobs.     The French government allowed for the establishment of the so-called Concessionary Companies in 1889 so as to circumvent the economic non-discrimination provisions of the Treaty of Berlin and maximize the revenue drawn from underpopulated and undeveloped regions under their control. Roughly forty companies with a capital of roughly 59.5 million francs were given a free hand to exploit the colonys resources under virtual monopoly conditions. 650,000 square miles of land, except for a few strategic locations mainly around the Congo River, were leased as concessions for a thirty year period. Cost-benefit considerations reigned supreme as often undercapitalized companies employed unqualified personnel and/or adventurers who lived off the land while stripping their concessions of all possible riches. Ivory and rubber virtually disappeared from the concessionary areas; indigenous populations were decimated by brutal forced labor, disease, and maladministration, and some fled to neighboring colonies.      French rule was brutal and led to many thousands of deaths. The construction between 1921 and 1934 of the 511  km long railway, the Chemin de Fer Congo-Océan between Brazzaville and  |Pointe-Noire|Pointe-Noire|  is for example said to have cost the lives of around 23,000 locals and a few hundred Europeans. Any resistance against French colonial rule, however small, was brutally repressed. Ultimately the French government lost more money than it gained in rents and taxes from the Concessionary system upon which the colony had become reliant, and French public opinion was shocked by reports of the wide-scale brutalities which the system had given rise to. By 1930 most of the Concessionary companies had gone bankrupt and the practice had largely ceased.     In 1911 parts of the colony  were ceded to the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  in exchange for German recognition of Frances rights to Morocco. German rule in these regions lasted only five years, and ultimately the New Cameroon territories were seized back by France in 1916, after the fall of German forces in  |Kamerun|Kamerun| .       The first name given officially on 1 August 1886 for the new colony was Colony of Gabon and Congo. On 30 April 1891 this was renamed Colony of French Congo, consisting of Gabon and Middle Congo, the name the French gave to Congo-Brazzaville at that time. On 15 January 1910 the colony again was renamed to  |French_Equatorial_Africa|French_Equatorial_Africa|  , this time it also included  |Chad|Chad|  and  |Oubangui-Chari|Oubangui-Chari| , nowadays the  |Central_African_Republic|Central_African_Republic| . Congo-Brazzaville gained autonomy on the November 28, 1958 and independence from France on the August 15, 1960. The capital of the AEF was Brazzaville, for Middle Congo the capital was Pointe Noire.     The Federation quickly became centered on Middle Congo due to the presence of the Governor-General in Brazzaville, so while each colony was theoretically fairly autonomous the centralization of powers meant that the Governor-General gave preferential treatment to the region in which he resided. Education, health services, judicial systems, and public works were all under the control of Brazzaville-based authorities who could overrule the territorial governors. Middle Congo was provided with the only deep-water port in the Federation at Pointe Noire as well as the railway. Brazzavilles public buildings, schools, law courts, trading firms, telecommunications and medical services soon surpassed by far their counterparts elsewhere in the Federation. Peoples from more marginal areas of AEF such as Chad were forced to work in Middle Congo, and funds were funneled primarily into the region, causing a great sense of resentment. Ultimately the massive expansion of Middle Congos civil service contributed to a drain of the rural population into the cities, and created an entrenched bureaucracy and trade union network that would prove to be a burden on state stability following independence.      The French government continued to rule through a Governor-General until the elections of 1957 when a High Commissioner of the République was established. The total population in 1950 for the whole AEF was 4,143,922, with only around 15,000 non-Africans present.              As with the arrival of the Portuguese events in Europe again had a deep impact on the affairs of Congo-Brazzaville, and Africa in general. Marshal  |Philippe_Pétain|Philippe_Pétain|  surrendered to Germany on 22 June 1940, and this gave birth to the so-called  |Vichy_France|Vichy_France|  republic. Pétain had earlier refused to continue the war against Germany from African territory alongside Great Britain. With the help of a handful of local French administrators and officers, the British, and the Belgian government in exile  |Charles_de_Gaulles|Charles_De_Gaulle| |Free_French|Free_French|  won over large parts of the French Empire. Politicians such as  |René_Pleven|René_Pleven| , who later became prime minister, and officers as General  |Philippe_Leclerc_de_Hauteclocque|Philippe_Leclerc_De_Hauteclocque| , Lieutenant René Amiot, Captain Raymond Delange, Colonel  |Edgar_De_Larminat|Edgar_De_Larminat|  and Adolphe Sicé helped him to gain control of the AEF territory. In three days troops loyal to De Gaulle took control of Chad , Cameroon and of Middle Congo . Brazzaville hereby became the capital of the so-called  |Free_French|Free_French|  in Africa, ruled in theory by a Conseil de défense de lEmpire set up by De Gaulle on 27 October 1940. The FEA centred on Middle Congo went overnight from a backwater to a linchpin of Free French forces in Africa. Point Noire in particular became a vital transit area and base for bringing supplies, soldiers and labor from the interior to the coast and back again. The intense use of the railway led to the rise of a new urban labor class and improved the infrastructure of the colony.        In this revolt the then-governor of Chad  |Félix_Eboué|Félix_Eboué|  played a key role. Because of this and his earlier support for De Gaulle he became Governor-General of the Afrique Equatoriale Française in 1940, the first non-white to achieve this position in French colonial history. Born in 1884 in  |French_Guiana|French_Guiana|  this descendant of African slaves was a key figure together with René Pleven in the organization by the De Gaulle government of  |the_Brazzaville_Conference_of_1944|Brazzaville_Conference_Of_1944| , which took place between the January 30 and February 8, 1944 and which did set out the new direction of French colonial policies after World War II. Many of these were policies already put forward by Eboué in his 1941 book entitled La nouvelle politique coloniale de lA.E.F. This conference led to the abolition of forced labor and the code de lindigénat, which had made the political and social activities of the indigenous people illegal. This in turn led to the new French constitution of the Fourth Republic approved on 27 October 1946 and the election of the first Equatorial African members of Parliament in Paris. For Eboué and the new French government the people in the colonies were officially part of the French empire and had a new series of rights, including freedom of association, a uniform code of law, and elective institutions at three levels. A severely weakened France, under pressure from the US, had hardly any option but to change its colonial policies.       Governor General  |Felix_Eboué|Felix_Eboué|  had a  |carrot_and_stick|Carrot_And_Stick|  approach to local Congolese grievances. While allowing certain freedoms he brutally repressed any activities deemed dangerous to French colonial control. The case of the Congolese trade unionist  |André_Matsoua|André_Matsoua|  shows his tough approach to political dissent.     André Matsoua can be seen as the father of modern Congolese nationalism. His rise shows how, in spite of the Code de lIndigénat and the brutal repression, Africans in French colonies were able to set up resistance movements to colonial rule. Local schools run by French missionaries, as elsewhere in Africa formed the basis of this rise of African nationalism. André Matsoua got his education and contacts with European thinking through the church. Born in 1899 in Mandzakala he joined the French customs administration in Brazzaville in 1919 and soon after left for France where he joined the French army to fight in  |Morocco|Morocco| . He returned home as a non-commissioned officer. In 1926 he in Paris formed the Association des Originaires de lA.E.F. with the purpose of helping people from his region living in France. For this he got support from some sections of French society as the  |French_Communist_Party|French_Communist_Party|  and elements within the  |Free_Masonry|Free_Masons|  movement.     When in 1929 his group also became active in Congo itself and demanded an end to the Code de lIndigénat, things changed. In 1929 the French dissolved Matsouas association and he together with some of his friends were jailed and sent in exile to Chad, leading to riots and a campaign of disobedience against the French administration lasting many years. He however escaped to France in 1935 where under a new identity he continued his political work. Showing his loyalty to France, in spite of the harsh repression, he joined the French army to fighting the German invasion in 1940. Wounded, he was rearrested, and sent back to Brazzaville where on 8 February 1941 he was sentenced under Felix Eboué to work in labor camps for the rest of his life. He died under unclear circumstances in prison on 13 January 1942. His supporters maintain that he was murdered, and began the Matsouanist movement, active chiefly among the Lari, even after independence.       The Congo went in the space of fourteen years from having no political freedom whatsoever to complete independence, making the rise of legitimate democratic institutions respected by a substantial proportion of the population near-impossible. Original democratic institutions were modeled on those of France, but multiple Africanising constitutions were instituted and then set aside in 1961, 1963, 1968, 1973 and 1992. As a heterogeneous state, political parties very quickly began to focus solely on ethnic and regionalist groupings. For example, between 1946 and 1956 the Lari, an important community in the country, refused to take part in elections, with many under the belief that their deceased messianic leader André Matsoua would return. The absence of the Bakongo from early politics led to a power vacuum into which the Vili and Mbochi moved until independence.      The most prominent Congolese politician until 1956 was  |Jean-Félix_Tchicaya|Jean-Félix_Tchicaya| , born in  |Libreville|Libreville|  on 9 November 1903 and a member of the royal family of the  |Kingdom_of_Loango|Kingdom_Of_Loango| . Together with  |Ivorian|Ivory_Coast|  leader  |Félix_Houphouët-Boigny|Félix_Houphouët-Boigny|  and others, he formed the  |Rassemblement_Démocratique_Africain|Rassemblement_Démocratique_Africain|  in 1946 and, in 1947, the  |Parti_Progressiste_Africain|Parti_Progressiste_Africain| . On 21 November 1945, Tchicaya became one of the first African leaders elected to the  |French_parliament|French_Parliament| , giving him great prestige in his native country.     Although Tchicaya was on the left of the French political spectrum, he never strongly questioned French colonial rule. This resulted in a loss of influence as the Congo prepared for independence, influenced by nationalist anti-colonial leaders as  |Kwame_Nkrumah|Kwame_Nkrumah|  from  |Ghana|Ghana|  and  |Egyptian_President|President_Of_Egypt| |Gamel_Abdel_Nasser|Gamel_Abdel_Nasser| . Only by aligning himself with his erstwhile enemy, the more radical  |Jacques_Opangault|Jacques_Opangault|  in the parliamentary elections of March 31, 1957 could he continue to play a leading role in Congolese political life.     Prior to independence, the French establishment and  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  feared Opangaults radicalism and favored the rise of  |Fulbert_Youlou|Fulbert_Youlou| , a former priest. The defection of Georges Yambot from the  |African_Socialist_Movement|African_Socialist_Movement|  to Youlous Union Démocratique pour la Défense dIntérêts Africains helped Youlou become prime minister in 1958. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Congo on 28 November 1958 .     On 16 February 1959, a revolt organized by Opangault and his MSA erupted in clashes along tribal lines between Southerners, supporting Youlou, and people from the North, loyal to the MSA. The riots were suppressed by French army and Opangault was arrested. In total about 200 people died. Prime Minister Youlou then held the elections for which Opangault had previously asked in vain. After the May 9 arrest of several politicians, including veteran politician Simon Kikhounga Ngot, because of an alleged  |communist|Communist|  plot, parliamentary elections were convincingly won by Youlou. On 12 July 1960 France agreed to Congo becoming fully independent.  On 15 August 1960, the Republic of Congo became an independent country and  |Fulbert_Youlou|Fulbert_Youlou|  became its first President.     In November that year, Youlou released Opangault, Ngot and other adversaries, as part of an amnesty. In return both politicians, as well as Germain Bicoumat, joined Youlous government and received ministerial posts, effectively destroying any organized political opposition.       Shortly before gaining independence an event occurred that in the years to come would have deep influence on the country and its relations with the outside world, mainly France. Although French geologists had already established for certain in 1926 the presence of oil and gas in the country, in 1957 near Pointe Indienne the French Societé des Pétroles de lAfrique Equatoriale Françaises found  |oil|Oil|  and  |gas|Gas|  reserves offshore in sufficient exploitable quantities. Only then did France start exploiting these reserves. The reason was that in  |Algeria|Algeria|  a  |war_of_independence|Algerian_War|  was fought, and the French were losing. Until then Algeria was the main source of oil and gas destined for the French market. To remain independent of the American and British oil majors France had to look elsewhere for its supply. For some the discovery of oil of the Congolese coast was a blessing. For the majority of the local population it rather proved to be a curse as the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  in its yearly reports on the country a few years ago sadly observed. By the 1970s oil was Congos largest export, however global market-price vicissitudes together with Congos tendency to rely on overly optimistic projections of future revenues for the political purposes of sustaining a large civil service and a highly-inefficient State sector, have regularly caused serious fiscal imbalances. Development of the sector has been hampered by the nations traditionally powerful trade unionist movement, political uncertainties, as well as the costs of exploitation in a country with poor transport infrastructure.        As Brazzaville had been the capital of the large federation of French Equatorial Africa, it had an important workforce and lots of trade unions. Further radicalization elsewhere in Africa as a result of the decolonization led to revolt against the dictatorial rule of Youlou. Following Youlous 6 August 1963 announcement of the formation of a one-party state with only one legal trade union, trade unions started their revolt on 13 August. Youlous palace was besieged in August by angry workers and the French refused to intervene militarily, and he was forced to resign. This uprising is known as  |Les_Trois_Glorieuses|Les_Trois_Glorieuses|  , named after the French  |July_Revolution|July_Revolution|  against King Charles X in 1830. Fulbert Youlou and his main supporters were arrested by the military and ceased to play any further role in Congolese political life.     The Congolese military took charge of the country briefly and installed a civilian provisional government headed by  |Alphonse_Massamba-Débat|Alphonse_Massamba-Débat| . Under the 1963  |constitution|Constitution_Of_The_Democratic_Republic_Of_The_Congo| , Massamba-Débat was elected president for a five-year term and named  |Pascal_Lissouba|Pascal_Lissouba|  to serve as prime minister.     President  |Massamba-Débats_term_in_office|Alphonse_Massamba-Débatcongo_Under_Massamba-Débat|  was characterized by a shift to the  |political_left|Political_Left|  which included nationalizations and increased political ties to the  |USSR|Ussr|  and communist  |China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| . Massamba-Débats government ended in August 1968 when Captain  |Marien_Ngouabi|Marien_Ngouabi|  and other army officers toppled the government in a bloodless coup. After a period of consolidation under the newly formed National Revolutionary Council, Ngouabi assumed the presidency on December 31, 1968. One year later, President Ngouabi proclaimed the  |Peoples_Republic_of_the_Congo|Peoples_Republic_Of_The_Congo| , Africas first  |Peoples_Republic|Peoples_Republic|  and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the  |Congolese_Party_of_Labour|Congolese_Party_Of_Labour|  .        On March 18, 1977 President Ngouabi was assassinated. A number of people were accused of shooting Ngouabi were tried and some of them executed, including former President  |Alphonse_Massemba-Débat|Alphonse_Massemba-Débat|  and a fisherman called Chanrithy Moukoko, but there was little evidence to prove their involvement, and the motive behind the assassination remains unclear.     An 11-member Military Committee of the Party was named to head an interim government with Col.  |Joachim_Yhombi-Opango|Joachim_Yhombi-Opango|  to serve as President of the Republic. After two years in power, Yhombi-Opango was accused of corruption and deviation from party directives, and removed from office on February 5, 1979, by the Central Committee of the PCT, which then simultaneously designated Vice President and Defense Minister Col.  |Denis_Sassou-Nguesso|Denis_Sassou-Nguesso|  as interim President.     The Central Committee directed Sassou-Nguesso to take charge of preparations for the Third Extraordinary Congress of the PCT, which proceeded to elect him President of the Central Committee and President of the Republic. Under a congressional resolution, Yhombi-Opango was stripped of all powers, rank, and possessions and placed under arrest to await trial for high treason. He was released from house arrest in late 1984 and ordered back to his native village of  |Owando|Owando| .             After decades of turbulent politics bolstered by  |Marxist-Leninist|Marxist-Leninist|  rhetoric, and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Congolese gradually moderated their economic and political views to the point that, in 1992, Congo completed a transition to  |multi-party|Multi-Party|  democracy. Ending a long history of one-party Marxist rule, a specific agenda for this transition was laid out during Congos national conference of 1991 and culminated in August 1992 with multi-party  |parliamentary|Republic_Of_The_Congo_Parliamentary_Election,_1992|  and  |presidential_elections|Republic_Of_The_Congo_Presidential_Election,_1992| . Sassou Nguesso conceded defeat and Congos new president, Professor  |Pascal_Lissouba|Pascal_Lissouba| , was inaugurated on August 31, 1992.     Congolese democracy experienced severe trials in 1993 and early 1994. The President dissolved the  |National_Assembly|National_Assembly_Of_The_Republic_Of_The_Congo|  in November 1992, calling for new  |elections_in_May_1993|Republic_Of_The_Congo_Parliamentary_Election,_1993| . The results of those elections were disputed, touching off violent civil unrest in June and again in November. In February 1994 the decisions of an international board of arbiters were accepted by all parties, and the risk of large-scale insurrection subsided.     Mr. Lissouba lost favour with the French government early in his presidency by asking the American-owned  |Occidental_Petroleum|Occidental_Petroleum|  company to provide financial support for his Government in exchange for promises of future oil production. As the French company  |Elf_Aquitaine|Elf_Aquitaine|  had only just recently opened a large deep-water  |oil_platform|Oil_Platform|  off the coast of  |Pointe-Noire|Pointe-Noire| , Mr. Lissouba was pressured by the French into canceling all contracts with Occidental Petroleum, but suspicions of Lissouba remained.      However, Congos democratic progress derailed in 1997. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso camps mounted. In May, a visit by Sassou Nguesso to  |Owando|Owando| ,  |Joachim_Yhombi-Opangos|Joachim_Yhombi-Opango|  political stronghold, led to the outbreak of violence between their supporters.  , Congolese Human Rights Observatory and International Federation of Human Rights , April 1998 . On June 5, 1997, government forces surrounded Sassou Nguessos home in the  |Mpila|Mpila|  section of Brazzaville, attempting to arrest two men, Pierre Aboya and Engobo Bonaventure, who had been implicated in the earlier violence. Fighting broke out between the government forces and Sassou Nguessos fighters, called Cobras, igniting a 4-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville.     Angola supported Sassou Nguesso with about 1,000 Angolan tanks, troops. Support by the sympathetic  |French_government|French_Government|  further bolstered Sassou Nguessos rebels.

Soon thereafter, Sassou Nguesso declared himself President and named a 33-member government.     In January 1998 the Sassou Nguesso regime held a National Forum for Reconciliation to determine the nature and duration of the transition period. The Forum, tightly controlled by the government, decided elections should be held in about three years, elected a transition advisory legislature, and announced that a constitutional convention will finalize a draft constitution. However, the eruption in late 1998 of fighting between Sassou Nguessos government forces and an armed opposition disrupted the transitional return to democracy. This new violence also closed the economically vital  |Congo-Ocean_Railway|Congo-Ocean_Railway| , caused great destruction and loss of life in southern Brazzaville and in the Pool, Bouenza, and Niari regions, and displaced hundreds of thousands of persons.     In November and December 1999, the government signed agreements with representatives of many, though not all, of the rebel groups. The December accord, mediated by President  |Omar_Bongo|Omar_Bongo|  of  |Gabon|Gabon| , called for follow-on, inclusive political negotiations between the government and the opposition.       Sassou won elections in 2002 with an implausible 90% or so of the votes. His two main rivals, Lissouba and  |Bernard_Kolelas|Bernard_Kolelas| , were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival,  |André_Milongo|André_Milongo| , boycotted the elections and withdrew from the race due to, among other reasons, perceived voter fraud on the part of Sassou. A new  |constitution|Constitution|  was agreed upon in January 2002, granting the president new powers and extending his term to seven years as well as introducing a new bicameral assembly. On December 30, twenty opposition political parties issued a statement through spokesman Chistope Ngokaka, saying Sassous government had purchased weapons and military craft... under contracts signed between the officials in Brazzaville and the government in  |Beijing|Beijing| .  Sassou was re-elected for a further seven-year term at the next presidential election in July 2009.

After violent protests in the capital, Sassou attacked the Pool region, where the  |Ninja_rebels|Ninja|  of the civil war used to be based, in what was believed to be a distraction. This led to a revival of the Ninja rebels who launched attacks against the army in April 2016, leading 80,000 people to flee their homes. A ceasefire deal was signed in December 2017.
