              Radium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   Ra and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|   88. It is the sixth element in  |group_2|Alkaline_Earth_Metal|  of the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , also known as the  |alkaline_earth_metals|Alkaline_Earth_Metal| . Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride . All isotopes of radium are highly  |radioactive|Radioactive| , with the most stable  |isotope|Isotope|  being  |radium-226|Radium-226| , which has a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 1600 years and  |decays|Radioactive_Decay|  into  |radon|Radon|  gas . When radium decays,  |ionizing_radiation|Ionizing_Radiation|  is a product, which can excite  |fluorescent|Fluorescent|  chemicals and cause  |radioluminescence|Radioluminescence| .     Radium, in the form of  |radium_chloride|Radium_Chloride| , was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  by  |Marie|Marie_Curie|  and  |Pierre_Curie|Pierre_Curie|  in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from  |uraninite|Uraninite|  and published the discovery at the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  five days later. Radium was isolated in its  |metal|Metal| lic state by Marie Curie and  |André-Louis_Debierne|André-Louis_Debierne|  through the  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  of radium chloride in 1911.      In nature, radium is found in  |uranium|Uranium|  and  |thorium|Thorium|  ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in  |nuclear_medicine|Nuclear_Medicine| , radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it was used as a radioactive source for  |radioluminescent|Radioluminescent|  devices and also in  |radioactive_quackery|Radioactive_Quackery|  for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radiums toxicity has become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.       Radium is the heaviest known  |alkaline_earth_metal|Alkaline_Earth_Metal|  and is the only  |radioactive|Radioactive|  member of its group. Its physical and chemical properties most closely resemble its lighter  |congener|Congener| |barium|Barium| .     Pure radium is a  |volatile|Volatility|  silvery-white metal, although its lighter congeners  |calcium|Calcium| ,  |strontium|Strontium| , and barium have a slight yellow tint. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 112 This tint rapidly vanishes on exposure to air, yielding a black layer of  |radium_nitride|Radium_Nitride|  . Kirby et al., p. 4 Its  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  is either  or  and its  |boiling_point|Boiling_Point|  is . Both of these values are slightly lower than those of barium, confirming  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trend|  down the group 2 elements.  Like barium and the  |alkali_metals|Alkali_Metal| , radium crystallizes in the  |body-centered_cubic|Body-Centered_Cubic|  structure at  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Temperature_And_Pressure| |picometers|Picometer| .  Radium has a density of 5.5  g/cm 3 , higher than that of barium, again confirming periodic trends; the radium-barium density ratio is comparable to the radium-barium atomic mass ratio,  due to the two elements similar crystal structures.  . uni-bielefeld.de.             Radium has 33 known isotopes, with  |mass_numbers|Mass_Number|  from 202 to 234: all of them are  |radioactive|Radioactive| . Four of these –  |223_Ra|Radium-223|  , 224 Ra , 226 Ra , and 228 Ra – occur naturally in the  |decay_chains|Decay_Chain|  of primordial  |thorium|Thorium| -232,  |uranium-235|Uranium-235| , and  |uranium-238|Uranium-238|  . These isotopes nevertheless still have half-lives too short to be  |primordial_radionuclides|Primordial_Nuclide|  and only exist in nature from these decay chains. Kirby et al., p. 3 Together with the mostly  |artificial|Synthetic_Radioisotope|  225 Ra , which occurs in nature only as a decay product of minute traces of 237 Np,  these are the five most stable isotopes of radium. All other known radium isotopes have half-lives under two hours, and the majority have half-lives under a minute. At least 12  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  have been reported; the most stable of them is radium-205m, with a half-life between 130 and 230 milliseconds; this is still shorter than twenty-four  |ground-state|Ground_State|  radium isotopes.     In the early history of the study of radioactivity, the different natural isotopes of radium were given different names. In this scheme, 223 Ra was named actinium X , 224 Ra thorium X , 226 Ra radium , and 228 Ra mesothorium 1 . When it was realized that all of these are isotopes of the same element, many of these names fell out of use, and radium came to refer to all isotopes, not just 226 Ra. Some of radium-226s decay products received historical names including radium , ranging from radium A to radium G, with the letter indicating approximately how far they were down the chain from their parent 226 Ra.     226 Ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the  decay chain of uranium-238 with a half-life of over a millennium: it makes up almost all of natural radium. Its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas| |radon|Radon|  , which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium. It is 2.7 million times more radioactive than the same  |molar_amount|Amount_Of_Substance|  of natural  |uranium|Uranium|  , due to its proportionally shorter half-life.       A sample of radium metal maintains itself at a higher  |temperature|Temperature|  than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits  –  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particles| ,  |beta_particles|Beta_Particles| , and  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Rays| . More specifically, natural radium emits mostly alpha particles, but other steps in its decay chain  emit alpha or beta particles, and almost all particle emissions are accompanied by gamma rays.      In 2013, it was discovered that the nucleus of radium-224 is pear-shaped.  This was the first discovery of an asymmetric nucleus.       Radium, like barium, is a highly  |reactive|Reactivity|  metal and always exhibits its group oxidation state of +2. It forms the colorless Ra 2+  |cation|Cation|  in  |aqueous_solution|Aqueous_Solution| , which is highly  |basic|Base|  and does not form  |complexes|Coordination_Complex|  readily. Most radium compounds are therefore simple  |ionic|Ionic_Bond|  compounds, though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons is expected due to  |relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Quantum_Chemistry|  and would enhance the  |covalent|Covalent_Bond|  character of radium compounds such as Ra |F|Fluorine|  2 and Ra |At|Astatine|  2 .  For this reason, the  |standard_electrode_potential|Standard_Electrode_Potential|  for the half-reaction Ra 2+ + 2e − → Ra is −2.916   |V|Volt| , even slightly lower than the value −2.92  V for barium, whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 111 The values for barium and radium are almost exactly the same as those of the heavier alkali metals  |potassium|Potassium| ,  |rubidium|Rubidium| , and  |caesium|Caesium| .       Solid radium compounds are white as radium ions provide no specific coloring, but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self- |radiolysis|Radiolysis|  from radiums  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| . Insoluble radium compounds  |coprecipitate|Coprecipitation|  with all barium, most  |strontium|Strontium| , and most  |lead|Lead|  compounds. Kirby et al., p. 8      |Radium_oxide|Radium_Oxide|  has not been characterized well past its existence, despite oxides being common compounds for the other alkaline earth metals.  |Radium_hydroxide|Radium_Hydroxide|  is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and is a stronger base than its barium congener,  |barium_hydroxide|Barium_Hydroxide| . Kirby et al., pp. 4–8 It is also more soluble than  |actinium_hydroxide|Actinium_Hydroxide|  and  |thorium_hydroxide|Thorium_Hydroxide| |ammonia|Ammonia| .      |Radium_chloride|Radium_Chloride|  is a colorless, luminous compound. It becomes yellow after some time due to self-damage by the  |alpha_radiation|Alpha_Radiation|  given off by radium when it decays. Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color. It is soluble in water, though less so than  |barium_chloride|Barium_Chloride| , and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| . Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl 2 ·2H 2 O, isomorphous with its barium analog.      |Radium_bromide|Radium_Bromide|  is also a colorless, luminous compound. In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr 2 ·2H 2 O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  molecules in the air, making it glow. The  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral  |helium|Helium| , which builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.      |Radium_nitrate|Radium_Nitrate|  is a white compound that can be made by dissolving  |radium_carbonate|Radium_Carbonate|  in  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| . As the concentration of nitric acid increases, the solubility of radium nitrate decreases, an important property for the chemical purification of radium.     Radium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble  |sulfate|Radium_Sulfate|  ,  |chromate|Radium_Chromate|  ,  |carbonate|Radium_Carbonate|  ,  |iodate|Radium_Iodate|  ,  |tetrafluoroberyllate|Radium_Tetrafluoroberyllate|  , and nitrate . With the exception of the carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally,  |radium_phosphate|Radium_Phosphate| ,  |oxalate|Radium_Oxalate| , and  |sulfite|Radium_Sulfite|  are probably also insoluble, as they  |coprecipitate|Coprecipitation|  with the corresponding insoluble barium salts. Kirby et al., pp. 8–9 The great insolubility of radium sulfate  means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds. Kirby et al., p. 12 The large ionic radius of Ra 2+ results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.       All isotopes of radium have half-lives much shorter than the  |age_of_the_Earth|Age_Of_The_Earth| , so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs  |in_the_environment|Radium_And_Radon_In_The_Environment| , as the isotopes 223 Ra, 224 Ra, 226 Ra, and 228 Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay. Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is 226 Ra , a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, 226 Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one  |part_per_trillion|Parts_Per_Trillion|  of the Earths crust; essentially all natural radium is 226 Ra. Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore  |uraninite|Uraninite|  and various other uranium  |minerals|Minerals| , and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals. One  |ton|Ton|  of  |pitchblende|Uraninite|  typically yields about one seventh of a  |gram|Gram|  of radium.  , Los Alamos National Laboratory. Retrieved 5 August 2009. One kilogram of the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust|  contains about 900   |picograms|Picogram|  of radium, and one  |liter|Liter|  of  |sea_water|Sea_Water|  contains about 89   |femtograms|Femtogram|  of radium.

Boca Raton, Florida .                Radium was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  by  |Marie_Sklodowska-Curie|Marie_Curie|  and her husband  |Pierre_Curie|Pierre_Curie|  on 21 December 1898, in a  |uraninite|Uraninite|  sample. Hammond, C. R. Radium in  While studying the mineral earlier, the Curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. In July 1898 while studying pitchblende they isolated an element similar to  |bismuth|Bismuth|  which turned out to be  |polonium|Polonium| . They then isolated a radioactive mixture consisting mostly of two components: compounds of  |barium|Barium| , which gave a brilliant green flame color, and unknown radioactive compounds which gave  |carmine|Carmine| |spectral_lines|Spectral_Line|  that had never been documented before. The Curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds, except that they were less soluble. This made it possible for the Curies to isolate the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them. The Curies announced their discovery to the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  on 26 December 1898.   The naming of radium dates to about 1899, from the French word radium, formed in Modern Latin from radius        On September 1910, Marie Curie and  |André-Louis_Debierne|André-Louis_Debierne|  announced that they had isolated radium as a pure  |metal|Metal|  through the  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  of a pure radium  |chloride|Chloride|  solution using a  |mercury|Mercury| |cathode|Cathode| , producing a radium–mercury  |amalgam|Amalgam| .  This amalgam was then heated in an atmosphere of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  gas to remove the mercury, leaving pure radium metal.  Later that same year, E. Eoler isolated radium by  |thermal_decomposition|Thermal_Decomposition|  of its  |azide|Azide| , Ra 2 . Radium metal was first industrially produced in the beginning of the 20th century by  |Biraco|Biraco| , a subsidiary company of  |Union_Minière_du_Haut_Katanga|Union_Minière_Du_Haut_Katanga|  in its  |Olen|Olen,_Belgium|  plant in Belgium.      The common historical unit for radioactivity, the  |curie|Curie| , is based on the radioactivity of 226 Ra.                Radium was formerly used in  |self-luminous|Luminescence|  paints for watches, nuclear panels, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium. In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was filed against the  |United_States_Radium_Corporation|United_States_Radium_Corporation|  by five dying  |Radium_Girls|Radium_Girls|  – dial painters who had painted radium-based  |luminous_paint|Luminous_Paint|  on the dials of watches and clocks. The dial painters were instructed to lick their brushes to give them a fine point, thereby ingesting radium. Frame, Paul.  ,  |Oak_Ridge_Associated_Universities|Oak_Ridge_Associated_Universities| . Retrieved September 17, 2007. Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores,  |anemia|Anemia| , and  |bone_cancer|Bone_Cancer| . This is because the body treats radium as  |calcium|Calcium|  and  |deposits_it_in_the_bones|Bone_Seeker| , where radioactivity degrades  |marrow|Bone_Marrow|  and can mutate  |bone_cells|Bone_Cells| .     During the litigation, it was determined that the companys scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation, yet had not seen fit to protect their employees. Additionally, for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the Radium Girls were instead suffering from  |syphilis|Syphilis| . This complete disregard for employee welfare had a significant impact on the formulation of  |occupational_disease|Occupational_Disease| |labor_law|Labor_Law| .      As a result of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them . Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries to dial painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls could easily have been avoided. Rowland, R. E.  . Argonne National Laboratory. p. 22     From the 1960s the use of radium paint was discontinued. In many cases luminous dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades. Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive  |promethium|Promethium| -147 or  |tritium|Tritium|  paint was used; both continue to be used today.  These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium.  Tritium emits very low-energy  |beta_radiation|Beta_Radiation|   which cannot penetrate the skin, . ehso.emory.edu rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer.      Clocks, watches, and instruments dating from the first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium.  The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested. . Encyclopædia Britannica  . vintagewatchstraps.com                 Radium was once an additive in products such as toothpaste, hair creams, and even food items due to its supposed curative powers.  Such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects.   |Spas|Destination_Spa|  featuring radium-rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial, such as those in  |Misasa,_Tottori|Misasa,_Tottori| , Japan. In the U.S., nasal radium irradiation was also administered to children to prevent middle-ear problems or enlarged tonsils from the late 1940s through the early 1970s.        Radium  was used in  |medicine|Medicine|  to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a  |cancer|Cancer|  treatment; for example, several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.  However, many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused. Some examples of these effects are  |anaemia|Anaemia| , cancer, and  |genetic_mutations|Mutation| .  Safer gamma emitters such as  |60_Co|Cobalt-60| , which is less costly and available in larger quantities, are usually used today to replace the historical use of radium in this application.     Early in the 1900s, biologists used radium to induce mutations and study  |genetics|Genetics| . As early as 1904, Daniel MacDougal used radium in an attempt to determine whether it could provoke sudden large mutations and cause major evolutionary shifts.  |Thomas_Hunt_Morgan|Thomas_Hunt_Morgan|  used radium to induce changes resulting in white-eyed fruit flies.   Nobel-winning biologist Hermann Muller briefly studied the effects of radium on fruit fly mutations before turning to more affordable x-ray experiments.       |Howard_Atwood_Kelly|Howard_Atwood_Kelly| , one of the founding physicians of  |Johns_Hopkins_Hospital|Johns_Hopkins_Hospital| , was a major pioneer in the medical use of radium to treat cancer.  His first patient was his own aunt in 1904, who died shortly after surgery.  Kelly was known to use excessive amounts of radium to treat various cancers and tumors. As a result, some of his patients died from radium exposure.  His method of radium application was inserting a radium capsule near the affected area, then sewing the radium points directly to the  |tumor|Tumor| . This was the same method used to treat  |Henrietta_Lacks|Henrietta_Lacks| , the host of the original  |HeLa_cells|Hela_Cells| , for  |cervical_cancer|Cervical_Cancer| .  Currently, safer and more available radioisotopes are used instead.       Uranium had no large scale application in the late 19th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed. In the beginning the only large source for uranium ore was the  |silver|Silver|  mines in Joachimsthal,  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary|  . The uranium ore was only a  |byproduct|Byproduct|  of the mining activities.      In the first extraction of radium, Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, which is similar to  |barium_sulfate|Barium_Sulfate|  but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide, followed by  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid|  treatment to minimize impurities of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with  |sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate|  to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate , thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution, the barium and radium were reprecipitated as sulfates; this was then repeated to further purify the mixed sulfate. Some impurities that form insoluble sulfides were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide, followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfates were pure enough, they were once more converted to mixed chlorides; barium and radium thereafter were separated by  |fractional_crystallisation|Fractional_Crystallization|  while monitoring the progress using a  |spectroscope|Spectroscope|  , and the  |electroscope|Electroscope| .  . lateralscience.blogspot.se. November 2012     After the isolation of radium by Marie and Pierre Curie from uranium ore from Joachimsthal, several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities. Later, small companies purchased mine tailings from Joachimsthal mines and started isolating radium. In 1904, the Austrian government  |nationalised|Nationalization|  the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. For some time radium availability was low.     The formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s. The  |Carnotite|Carnotite|  sands in  |Colorado|Colorado|  provide some of the element, but richer ores are found in the  |Congo|Democratic_Republic_Of_The_Congo|  and the area of the  |Great_Bear_Lake|Great_Bear_Lake|  and the  |Great_Slave_Lake|Great_Slave_Lake|  of northwestern Canada.  Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable.     The Curies process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation.  If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough it is easy to add some to carry the radium. These processes were applied to high grade uranium ores but may not work well with low grade ores.     Small amounts of radium were still extracted from uranium ore by this method of mixed precipitation and ion exchange as late as the 1990s, Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 109–110 but today they are extracted only from spent nuclear fuel.  In 1954, the total worldwide supply of purified radium amounted to about   and it is still in this range today, while the annual production of pure radium compounds is only about 100  g in total today. The chief radium-producing countries are Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic,  |Slovakia|Slovakia| , the United Kingdom, and  |Russia|Russia| . The amounts of radium produced were and are always relatively small; for example, in 1918, 13.6  g of radium were produced in the United States.  The metal is isolated by reducing radium oxide with aluminium metal in a vacuum at 1200  °C.       Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope| , such as  |cobalt-60|Cobalt-60|  and  |caesium-137|Caesium-137| , are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters, safer to handle, and available in more concentrated form.       The isotope 223 Ra  was approved by the United States  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  in 2013 for use in  |medicine|Medicine|  as a  |cancer|Cancer|  treatment of bone  |metastasis|Metastasis| .  . cancer.org. The main indication of treatment with Xofigo is the therapy of bony metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer due to the favourable characteristics of this alpha-emitter radiopharmaceutical.  225 Ra has also been used in experiments concerning therapeutic irradiation, as it is the only reasonably long-lived radium isotope which does not have radon as one of its daughters.      Radium is still used today as a radiation source in some  |industrial_radiography|Industrial_Radiography|  devices to check for flawed metallic parts, similarly to  |X-ray_imaging|X-Ray_Imaging| . When mixed with  |beryllium|Beryllium| , radium acts as a  |neutron_source|Neutron_Source| .  Radium-beryllium neutron sources are still sometimes used even today, .  |United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|   but other materials such as  |polonium|Polonium|  are now more common: about 1500 polonium-beryllium neutron sources, with an individual activity of , have been used annually in  |Russia|Russia| .   . stringer.ru . These RaBeF 4 -based neutron sources have been deprecated despite the high number of neutrons they emit in favour of  |241_Am|Americium-241| –Be sources. Today, the isotope 226 Ra is mainly used to form 227  |Ac|Actinium|  by  |neutron_irradiation|Neutron_Irradiation|  in a nuclear reactor.       Radium is highly radioactive and its immediate daughter,  |radon|Radon|  gas, is also radioactive. When ingested, 80% of the ingested radium leaves the body through the  |feces|Feces| , while the other 20% goes into the  |bloodstream|Bloodstream| , mostly accumulating in the bones. Exposure to radium, internal or external, can cause cancer and other disorders, because radium and radon emit alpha and  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray|  upon their decay, which kill and mutate cells. At the time of the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project|  in 1944, the tolerance dose for workers was set at 0.1 micrograms of ingested radium.        Some of the biological effects of radium include the first case of radium-dermatitis , reported in 1900, two years after the elements discovery. The French physicist  |Antoine_Becquerel|Antoine_Becquerel|  carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for six hours and reported that his skin became  |ulcerated|Ulcer| . Pierre and Marie Curie were so intrigued by radiation that they sacrificed their own health to learn more about it. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue.  Handling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curies death due to  |aplastic_anemia|Aplastic_Anemia| . A significant amount of radiums danger comes from its daughter radon: being a gas, it can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium.     Today, 226 Ra is considered to be the most toxic of the quantity radioelements, and it must be handled in tight glove boxes with significant airstream circulation that is then treated to avoid escape of its daughter 222 Rn to the environment. Old ampoules containing radium solutions must be opened with care because radiolytic decomposition of water can produce an overpressure of hydrogen and oxygen gas.  The worlds largest concentration of 226 Ra is stored within the  |Interim_Waste_Containment_Structure|Lake_Ontario_Ordnance_Worksinterim_Waste_Containment_Structure| , approximately  north of  |Niagara_Falls,_New_York|Niagara_Falls,_New_York| .
