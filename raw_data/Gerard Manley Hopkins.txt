           Gerard Manley Hopkins  was an English poet and  |Jesuit|Society_Of_Jesus|  priest, whose posthumous fame established him among the leading  |Victorian_poets|English_Poetryvictorian_Poetry| . His manipulation of  |prosody|Metre|  – particularly his concept of  |sprung_rhythm|Sprung_Rhythm|  and use of  |imagery|Imagery|  – established him as an innovative writer of verse. Two of his major themes were nature and religion. Only after his death did  |Robert_Bridges|Robert_Bridges|  begin to publish a few of Hopkinss mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare the way for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 his work was recognized as being among the most original literary accomplishments of his century. It had a marked influence on such leading 20th-century poets as  |T._S._Eliot|T._S._Eliot| ,  |Dylan_Thomas|Dylan_Thomas| ,  |W._H._Auden|W._H._Auden| ,  |Stephen_Spender|Stephen_Spender|  and  |C._Day_Lewis|C._Day_Lewis| .         Gerard Manley Hopkins was born in  |Stratford|Stratford,_London| ,  |Essex|South_Essex|  Gardner, W. H. Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose Penguin pxvi , as the eldest of probably nine children to Manley and Catherine Hopkins, née Smith.  Norman White, Hopkins, Gerard Manley , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. He was christened at the  |Anglican|Anglicanism|  church of  |St_Johns,_Stratford|St_Johns_Church,_Stratford| . His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian  |consul-general|Consul_Consulates_And_Embassies|  in London. He was also for a time  |churchwarden|Churchwarden|  at  |St_John-at-Hampstead|St_John-At-Hampstead| . His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of  |John_Keats|John_Keats| , and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist  |Ann_Thwaytes|Ann_Thwaytes| .     As a poet, Hopkinss father published works including A Philosophers Stone and Other Poems , Pietas Metrica , and Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins . He reviewed poetry for  The Times  and wrote one novel. Catherine Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially  |German_philosophy|German_Philosophy| , literature and the novels of  |Dickens|Dickens| . Both parents were deeply religious  |high-church|High-Church|  Anglicans. Catherines sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle  |Richard_James_Lane|Richard_James_Lane| , a professional artist, and many other family members. Hopkinss first ambition was to be a painter, and he would continue to sketch throughout his life, inspired as an adult by the work of  |John_Ruskin|John_Ruskin|  and the  |Pre-Raphaelites|Pre-Raphaelites| .  accessed 2010-03-18     Hopkins became a skilled draughtsman, and found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet. His siblings were greatly inspired by language, religion and the creative arts. Milicent joined an Anglican sisterhood in 1878. Kate would go on to help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkinss youngest sister Grace set many of his poems to music.  |Lionel|Lionel_Charles_Hopkins|  became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur and Everard were both highly successful artists. Cyril was to join his fathers insurance firm.        Manley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where  |John_Keats|John_Keats|  had lived thirty years before and close to the wide green spaces of  |Hampstead_Heath|Hampstead_Heath| . When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at  |Highgate_School|Highgate_School|  . While studying Keatss poetry, he wrote The Escorial , his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill. On another occasion, he abstained from salt for a week. Eleanor Ruggles Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Life. Norton. Among his teachers at Highgate was  |Richard_Watson_Dixon|Richard_Watson_Dixon| , who became an enduring friend and correspondent, and among the older pupils Hopkins recalls in his boarding house was the poet  |Philip_Stanhope_Worsley|Philip_Stanhope_Worsley| , who won the  |Newdigate_Prize|Newdigate_Prize| .        Hopkins studied classics at  |Balliol_College,_Oxford|Balliol_College,_Oxford|  . W. H. Gardner , Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose Penguin p. xvii. He began his time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet, but he seems to have alarmed himself with the changes in his behaviour that resulted. At Oxford he forged a lifelong friendship with  |Robert_Bridges|Robert_Bridges|  , which would be of importance in his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim. Hopkins was deeply impressed with the work of  |Christina_Rossetti|Christina_Rossetti|  and she became one of his greatest contemporary influences, meeting him in 1864. Gardner, W. H. Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems and Prose Penguin p. xviii. During this time he studied with the eminent writer and critic  |Walter_Pater|Walter_Pater| , who tutored him in 1866 and remained a friend until Hopkins left Oxford in September 1879. Gerald Monsman, Pater, Hopkins and the self , Victorian Notes, 1974.        On 18 January 1866, Hopkins composed his most ascetic poem, The Habit of Perfection. On 23 January, he included poetry in the list of things to be given up for  |Lent|Lent| . In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts,  |John_Henry_Newman|John_Henry_Newman| . Newman received him into the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church|  on 21 October 1866.     The decision to convert estranged him from his family and from a number of his acquaintances. After his graduation in 1867, Hopkins was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly resolved to be a religious. Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poems and gave up poetry almost entirely for seven years. He also felt the call to enter the ministry and decided to become a  |Jesuit|Society_Of_Jesus| . He paused to first visit  |Switzerland|Switzerland| , which officially forbade Jesuits to enter. P. Kitchen, Gerard Manley Hopkins, London, 1978.     Hopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at  |Manresa_House|Parkstead_House| ,  |Roehampton|Roehampton| , in September 1868. Two years later, he moved to St Marys Hall,  |Stonyhurst|Stonyhurst| , for his philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870.  He felt his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading  |Duns_Scotus|Duns_Scotus|  in 1872, he saw that the two need not conflict.  Glenn Everett, PhD. He continued to write a detailed prose journal between 1868 and 1875. Unable to suppress his desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions wrote some verses, as he called them. He would later write sermons and other religious pieces.     In 1874 Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While he was studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies,  |St_Beunos|St_Beunos_Ignatian_Spirituality_Centre| , near  |St_Asaph|St_Asaph|  in  |North_Wales|North_Wales| , he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875, he was moved to take up poetry once more and write a lengthy poem,  |The_Wreck_of_the_Deutschland|The_Wreck_Of_The_Deutschland|  . The work was inspired by the  Deutschland  incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five  |Franciscan|Franciscan|  nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh  |anti-Catholic|Anti-Catholic|  laws . The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual  |metre|Meter|  and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but also tells of the poets reconciling the terrible events with Gods higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry. Most of his poetry remained unpublished until after his death.        Hopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was at times gloomy. Biographer  |Robert_Bernard_Martin|Robert_Bernard_Martin|  notes that the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population. The brilliant student who had left Oxford with a first-class honours degree failed his final theology exam. This failure almost certainly meant that, although ordained in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote Gods Grandeur, an array of sonnets which included The Starlight Night . He finished  |The_Windhover|The_Windhover|  only a few months before his ordination. Though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, his life during Jesuit training had at least some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after he completed The Sea and the Skylark and only a month after he had been ordained as a priest, Hopkins took up his duties as sub-minister and teacher at Mount St. Marys College, Chesterfield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of St. Aloysiuss Church, Oxford, then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of the  |Oxford_University_Newman_Society|Oxford_University_Newman_Society| , a society established in 1878 for the Catholic members of the  |University_of_Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| . He taught Greek and Latin at  |Mount_St_Marys_College|Mount_St_Marys_College| , Sheffield, and  |Stonyhurst_College|Stonyhurst_College| , Lancashire.     In 1884 he became professor of Greek and Latin at  |University_College_Dublin|University_College_Dublin| . New English key notes 2013 Mentor books Dublin His English roots and his disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, as well as his own small stature , unprepossessing nature and personal oddities meant that he was not a particularly effective teacher. This, as well as his isolation in Ireland, deepened his gloom. His poems of the time, such as I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day , reflected this. They came to be known as the terrible sonnets , not because of their quality but because according to Hopkinss friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, they reached the terrible crystal , meaning that they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the later part of Hopkinss life.       Several issues brought about this melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration during the last five years of his life. Gardner, W.  H. Gerard Manly Hopkins: Poems and Prose Penguin pxxvii His work load was extremely heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends; he was also disappointed at how far the city had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century.  His general health deteriorated as his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue any egotism which would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems. But Hopkins realised that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent caused him to feel that he had failed them both.     After suffering ill health for several years and bouts of  |diarrhoea|Diarrhoea| , Hopkins died of  |typhoid_fever|Typhoid_Fever|  in 1889 and was buried in  |Glasnevin_Cemetery|Glasnevin_Cemetery| , Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3rd ed.: 2 . McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. following his funeral in  |Saint_Francis_Xavier_Church|Saint_Francis_Xavier_Church,_Dublin|  on  |Gardiner_Street|Gardiner_Street| , located in Georgian  |Dublin|Dublin| . He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be diagnosed as either  |bipolar_disorder|Bipolar_Disorder|  or chronic  |unipolar_depression|Unipolar_Depression| , and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, on his death bed, his last words were, I am so happy, I am so happy. I loved my life.         According to  |John_Bayley|John_Bayley| , All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of times eunuch with no more to spend... a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets.  Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. His terrible sonnets struggle with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as e thin gleanings of a long weary while.      Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord echoes Jeremiah 12:1 in asking why the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of a faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person capable of hearing the complaint, but seemingly unwilling to listen.  Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.     The image of the poets estrangement from God figures in I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day , in which he describes lying awake before dawn, likening his prayers to dead letters sent To dearest him that lives alas! away. The opening line recalls Lamentations 3:2: He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.     No Worst, There is None and Carrion Comfort are also counted among the terrible sonnets .            Much of Hopkinss historical importance has to do with the changes he brought to the form of poetry, which ran contrary to conventional ideas of metre. Prior to Hopkins, most  |Middle_English|Middle_English|  and  |Modern_English|Modern_English|  poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating feet of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure running rhythm , and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which  Beowulf  is the most famous example.     Hopkins called his own rhythmic structure  |sprung_rhythm|Sprung_Rhythm| . Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the rolling stresses of  |Robinson_Jeffers|Robinson_Jeffers| , another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become same and tame . In this way, Hopkins sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of  |free_verse|Free_Verse| . His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary  |Pre-Raphaelite|Pre-Raphaelite|  and  |neo-romanticism|Neo-Romanticism|  schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to  |modernist_poetry|Modernist_Poetry| , or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.       The language of Hopkinss poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in Heaven-Haven, where the comparison is between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, as it is in As Kingfishers Catch Fire, where he leaps from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.     Hopkins was a supporter of  |linguistic_purism_in_English|Linguistic_Purism_In_English| . In an 1882 letter to  |Robert_Bridges|Robert_Bridges| , Hopkins writes: It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity. Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p. 328. He took time to learn  |Old_English|Old_English| , which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English a vastly superior thing to what we have now.  |Brook,_George_Leslie|George_Leslie_Brook|  . An Introduction to Old English, Manchester University Press, p. 1.     He uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is twindles, which seems from its context in Inversnaid to mean a combination of twines and dwindles. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen  but often without, as in rolling level underneath him steady air. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of  |compounds_nouns|Kenning| , concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the  |instress|Instress|  of the poets perceptions of an  |inscape|Inscape| .     Added richness comes from Hopkinss extensive use of  |alliteration|Alliteration| ,  |assonance|Assonance| ,  |onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeia|  and  |rhyme|Rhyme| , both at the end of lines and internally as in:          Hopkins was influenced by the  |Welsh_language|Welsh_Language| , which he had acquired while studying theology at  |St_Beunos|St_Beunos_Ignatian_Spirituality_Centre|  near  |St_Asaph|St_Asaph| . The poetic forms of  |Welsh_literature|Literature_Of_Wales|  and particularly  |cynghanedd|Cynghanedd| , with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkinss own concept of inscape, which was derived in part from the medieval theologian  |Duns_Scotus|Duns_Scotus| . Anthony Domestico explains, Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.      The Windhover  aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkinss most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.        During his lifetime, Hopkins published few poems. It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkinss death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then  |poet_laureate|Poet_Laureate| , published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by  |Charles_Williams|Charles_Williams| , appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by  |William_Henry_Gardner|William_Henry_Gardner|  appeared in 1948 .     Notable collections of Hopkinss manuscripts and publications are in  |Campion_Hall,_Oxford|Campion_Hall,_Oxford| ; the  |Bodleian_Library|Bodleian_Library| ,  |Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| ; and the Foley Library at  |Gonzaga_University|Gonzaga_University|  in  |Spokane,_Washington|Spokane,_Washington| .          Timothy dArch Smith, antiquarian bookseller, ascribes to Hopkins suppressed erotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met  |Robert_Bridgess|Robert_Bridges|  distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian  |Digby_Mackworth_Dolben|Digby_Mackworth_Dolben| , a Christian  |Uranian|Uranian|  . Timothy dArch Smith. Love in Earnest, p. 188. Robert Martin asserts that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolbens 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of undergraduate years, probably of his entire life. Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life, p. 80; see also Norman White, Hopkins: A Literary Biography, p. 110. According to Robert Martin, Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.
