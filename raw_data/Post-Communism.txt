   Post-communism is the period of political and economic transformation or  |transition|Transition_Economy|  in former  |communist_states|Communist_State|  located in parts of  |Europe|Europe|  and  |Asia|Asia|  in which new governments aimed to create  |free_market|Free_Market| -oriented  |capitalist|Capitalist|  economies.       The policies of most  |communist_parties|Communist_Party|  in both the  |Eastern|Eastern_Bloc|  and  |Western_Bloc|Western_Bloc|  had been governed by the example of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . In most countries in the Eastern Bloc, following the  |fall_of_communist-led_governments_in_1989|Revolutions_Of_1989|  the communist parties split in two factions: a reformist  |social_democratic|Social_Democracy|  party and a new less  |reform|Reformism| -oriented  |communist|Communist|  party. The newly created social democratic parties were generally larger and more powerful than the remaining communist parties—only in  |Belarus|Belarus| , the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic| ,  |Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan| ,  |Moldova|Moldova| ,  |Russia|Russia| ,  |Tajikistan|Tajikistan|  did the communist parties remain a significant force.     In the Western Bloc, many of the self-styled communist parties reacted by changing their policies to a more  |moderate|Moderate|  and less  |radical|Far-Left_Politics|  course. In countries such as  |Italy|Italy|  and  |Germany|Germany| , post-communism is marked by the increased influence of their existing social democrats. The anti-Soviet communist parties in the Western Bloc  who felt that the  |fall_of_the_Soviet_Union|Fall_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  vindicated their views and predictions did not particularly prosper from it—in fact, some became less radical as well.       Several communist states had undergone economic reforms from a  |planned_economy|Planned_Economy|  towards a more  |market-oriented_economy|Market_Economy|  in the 1980s, notably  |Hungary|Hungarian_Peoples_Republic| ,  |Poland|Polish_Peoples_Republic|  and  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| . The post-communist economic transition was much more abrupt and aimed at creating fully capitalist economies.     All the countries concerned have abandoned the traditional tools of communist economic control and moved more or less successfully toward free market systems. A summary of the process containing both economic analysis and anecdotal case studies can be found in Charles Paul Lewiss How the East Was Won . Although some stress the beneficial effect of  |multinational_investment|Multinational_Investment| , the reforms also had important negative consequences that are still unfolding.     Average  |standards_of_living|Standards_Of_Living|  registered a catastrophic fall in the early 1990s in many parts of the former  |Comecon|Comecon| —most notably in the  |former_Soviet_Union|Former_Soviet_Union| —and began to rise again only toward the end of the decade. Some populations are still considerably worse off today than they were in 1989 . However, others have bounced back considerably beyond that threshold  and some such as  |Estonia|Estonia| ,  |Latvia|Latvia| ,  |Lithuania|Lithuania|   and  |Slovakia|Slovakia|  underwent an economic boom, although all have suffered from the  |2009_recession|2009_Recession| .     Today, most post-communist countries in Europe are generally seen to have  |mixed_economies|Mixed_Economy| , although some such as Estonia, Romania and Slovakia often adopt more traditionally free-market policies  than does the Western Bloc.     A fundamental challenge in post-communist economies is that institutional pressures that reflect the logic of  |capitalism|Capitalism|  and  |democracy|Democracy|  are exerted on organizations  that were created under communism and to this day are run by  |managers|Business_Manager| |socialized|Socialized|  in that context, resulting in a great deal of continuing tension in organizations in post-communist states.
