             Beta-lactamases are  |enzymes|Enzyme|   produced by bacteria that provide  |multi-|Multiple_Drug_Resistance| |resistance|Antibiotic_Resistance|  to  |β-lactam_antibiotics|Β-Lactam_Antibiotic|  such as  |penicillins|Penicillin| ,  |cephalosporins|Cephalosporin| ,  |cephamycins|Cephamycin| , and  |carbapenems|Carbapenem|  , although  |carbapenems|Carbapenem|  are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the  |antibiotics|Antibiotic|  structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a  |β-lactam|Β-Lactam| . Through  |hydrolysis|Hydrolysis| , the enzyme lactamase breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecules antibacterial properties.     Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of  |Gram-positive|Gram-Positive|  and  |Gram-negative|Gram-Negative|  bacteria.     Beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment.          The structure of a  Streptomyces  β-lactamase is given by .       Penicillinase is a specific type of β-lactamase, showing specificity for  |penicillins|Penicillin| , again by  |hydrolysing|Hydrolysis|  the  |β-lactam|Β-Lactam|  ring. Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50 kiloDaltons.     Penicillinase was the first β-lactamase to be identified. It was first isolated by Abraham and Chain in 1940 from Gram-negative E. coli even before penicillin entered clinical use,  but penicillinase production quickly spread to bacteria that previously did not produce it or produced it only rarely. Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as  |methicillin|Methicillin|  were developed, but there is now widespread  |resistance|Antibiotic_Resistance|  to even these.       Among Gram-negative bacteria, the emergence of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins has been a major concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species  that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes  due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs . Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- , but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins ; has been blocked by inhibitors such as  |clavulanate|Clavulanate| ,  |sulbactam|Sulbactam|  or  |tazobactam|Tazobactam|  and did not involve  |carbapenems|Carbapenems|  and  |temocillin|Temocillin| . Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins  such as  |cefoxitin|Cefoxitin|  or  |cefotetan|Cefotetan|  but are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.        Members of the family commonly express  |plasmid|Plasmid| -encoded β-lactamases , which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, a new group of enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases , was detected .  The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals.  ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include  |cefotaxime|Cefotaxime| ,  |ceftriaxone|Ceftriaxone| , and  |ceftazidime|Ceftazidime| , as well as the oxyimino-monobactam  |aztreonam|Aztreonam| . Thus ESBLs confer  |multi-resistance|Multiple_Drug_Resistance|  to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described.  The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes . Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited.  |Carbapenems|Carbapenem|  are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant  isolates have recently been reported. ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum  |cephalosporins|Cephalosporin| . However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.           TEM-1 is the most commonly encountered beta-lactamase in  |Gram-negative|Gram-Negative|  bacteria. Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in  |E._coli|Escherichia_Coli|  is due to the production of TEM-1.  Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in  H. influenzae  and  N. gonorrhoeae  in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in  E. coli  and  K. pneumoniae , they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the  |extended-spectrum_beta_lactamase|Beta-Lactamaseextended-Spectrum_Beta-Lactamase_.28Esbl.29|  phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.    The term TEM comes from the name of the Athenian patient from which the isolate was recovered in 1963.        SHV-1 shares 68 percent of its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 beta-lactamase is most commonly found in  K. pneumoniae  and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known. SHV-5 and SHV-12 are among the most common.       These enzymes were named for their greater activity against  |cefotaxime|Cefotaxime|  than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates . Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of  Kluyvera  species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. More than 80 CTX-M enzymes are currently known. Despite their name, a few are more active on  |ceftazidime|Ceftazidime|  than  |cefotaxime|Cefotaxime| . They have mainly been found in strains of  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium and  E. coli , but have also been described in other species of  |Enterobacteriaceae|Enterobacteriaceae|  and are the predominant ESBL type in parts of South America. CTX-M-14, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-2 are the most widespread. CTX-M-15 is currently the most widespread type in  E. coli  the UK and is widely prevalent in the community.  An example of beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, along with ISEcp1, has been found to have recently transposed onto the chromosome of  Klebsiella pneumoniae  ATCC BAA-2146.        OXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze  |oxacillin|Oxacillin|  and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d . The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to  |ampicillin|Ampicillin|  and  |cephalothin|Cephalothin|  and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against  |oxacillin|Oxacillin|  and  |cloxacillin|Cloxacillin|  and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by  |clavulanic_acid|Clavulanic_Acid| . Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in  E. coli ,  K. pneumoniae , and other  |Enterobacteriaceae|Enterobacteriaceae| , the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in  P. aeruginosa . OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.       Other plasmid-mediated ESBLs, such as PER, VEB, GES, and IBC beta-lactamases, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in  P. aeruginosa  and at a limited number of geographic sites. PER-1 in isolates in Turkey, France, and Italy; VEB-1 and VEB-2 in strains from Southeast Asia; and GES-1, GES-2, and IBC-2 in isolates from South Africa, France, and Greece. PER-1 is also common in multiresistant acinetobacter species in Korea and Turkey. Some of these enzymes are found in Enterobacteriaceae as well, whereas other uncommon ESBLs have been found only in Enterobacteriaceae.       While ESBL-producing organisms were previously associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly found in the community. CTX-M-15-positive  |E._coli|Escherichia_Coli|  are a cause of community-acquired  |urinary_infections|Cystitis|  in the UK, and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as  |quinolones|Quinolone_Antibiotic|  and  |sulfonamides|Sulfonamide| . Treatment options may include  |nitrofurantoin|Nitrofurantoin| ,  |fosfomycin|Fosfomycin| ,  |mecillinam|Mecillinam|  and  |chloramphenicol|Chloramphenicol| . In desperation, once-daily  |ertapenem|Ertapenem|  or  |gentamicin|Gentamicin|  injections may also be used.       Although the inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of  E. coli , but also some strains of  K. pneumoniae ,  Klebsiella oxytoca ,  P. mirabilis , and  Citrobacter freundii . Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by  |clavulanic_acid|Clavulanic_Acid|  and  |sulbactam|Sulbactam| , thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—lactamase inhibitor combinations of  |amoxicillin|Amoxicillin| - |clavulanate|Clavulanate|  ,  |ticarcillin|Ticarcillin| - |clavulanate|Clavulanate|  , and  |ampicillin/sulbactam|Ampicillin/Sulbactam| , they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by  |tazobactam|Tazobactam|  and subsequently the combination of  |piperacillin/tazobactam|Piperacillin/Tazobactam| , although resistance has been described. This is no longer a primarily European epidemiology, it is found in northern parts of America often and should be tested for with complex UTIs.       AmpC type β-lactamases are commonly isolated from extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. AmpC β-lactamases are typically encoded on the chromosome of many Gram-negative bacteria including  Citrobacter ,  Serratia  and  Enterobacter  species where its expression is usually  |inducible|Regulation_Of_Gene_Expressioninducible_Vs._Repressible_Systems| ; it may also occur on  Escherichia coli  but is not usually inducible, although it can be hyperexpressed. AmpC type β-lactamases may also be carried on plasmids. AmpC β-lactamases, in contrast to ESBLs, hydrolyse broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins but are not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such as  |clavulanic_acid|Clavulanic_Acid| . AmpC-type β-lactamase organisms are often clinically grouped through the acronym, SPACE :  Serratia , Pseudomonas  or  Proteus , Acinetobacter , Citrobacter , and  Enterobacter .       Carbapenems are famously stable to AmpC β-lactamases and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases. Carbapenemases are a diverse group of β-lactamases that are active not only against the oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also against the carbapenems. Aztreonam is stable to the metallo-β-lactamases,   but many IMP and VIM producers are resistant, owing to other mechanisms. Carbapenemases were formerly believed to derive only from classes A, B, and D, but a class C carbapenemase has been described.       Plasmid-mediated IMP-type carbapenemases , 19 varieties of which are currently known, became established in Japan in the 1990s both in enteric Gram-negative organisms and in  Pseudomonas  and  Acinetobacter  species. IMP enzymes spread slowly to other countries in the Far East, were reported from Europe in 1997, and have been found in Canada and Brazil.       A second growing family of carbapenemases, the VIM family, was reported from Italy in 1999 and now includes 10 members, which have a wide geographic distribution in Europe, South America, and the Far East and have been found in the United States. VIM-1 was discovered in P. aeruginosa in Italy in 1996; since then, VIM-2 - now the predominant variant - was found repeatedly in Europe and the Far East; VIM-3 and -4 are minor variants of VIM-2 and -1, respectively. VIM enzymes occur mostly in P. aeruginosa, also P. putida and, very rarely, Enterobacteriaceae.     Amino acid sequence diversity is up to 10% in the VIM family, 15% in the IMP family, and 70% between VIM and IMP. Enzymes of both the families, nevertheless, are similar. Both are integron-associated, sometimes within plasmids. Both hydrolyse all β-lactams except monobactams, and evade all β-lactam inhibitors. The VIM enzymes are among the most widely distributed MBLs, with ref  /ref  .
