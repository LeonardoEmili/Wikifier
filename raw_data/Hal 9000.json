        ". Faced with the prospect of disconnection, HAL decides to kill the astronauts in order to protect and continue its programmed directives. HAL uses one of the Discoverys EVA pods to kill Poole while he is repairing the ship. When Bowman, without space helmet, uses another pod to attempt to rescue Poole, HAL locks him out of the ship, then disconnects the life support systems of the other hibernating crew members. Bowman circumvents HALs control, entering the ship by manually opening an emergency airlock with his service pods clamps, detaching the pod door via its explosive bolts. Bowman jumps across empty space, reenters Discovery, and quickly re-pressurizes the airlock.     While HALs motivations are ambiguous in the film, the novel explains that the computer is unable to resolve a conflict between his general mission to relay information accurately, and orders specific to the mission requiring that he withhold from Bowman and Poole the true purpose of the mission.  With the crew dead, HAL reasons, he would not need to lie to them.     In the novel, the orders to disconnect HAL come from Dave and Franks superiors on Earth. After Frank is killed while attempting to repair the communications antenna he is pulled away into deep space using the safety tether which is still attached to both the pod and Frank Pooles spacesuit. Dave begins to revive his hibernating crew mates, but is foiled when HAL vents the ships atmosphere into the vacuum of space, killing the awakening crew members and almost killing Bowman, who is only narrowly saved when he finds his way to an emergency chamber which has its own oxygen supply and a spare space suit inside.     In both versions, Bowman then proceeds to shut down the machine. In the film, HALs central core is depicted as a crawlspace full of brightly lit computer modules mounted in arrays from which they can be inserted or removed. Bowman shuts down HAL by removing modules from service one by one; as he does so, HALs consciousness degrades. HAL finally reverts to material that was programmed into him early in his memory, including announcing the date he became operational as 12 January 1992 .

Prior to leaving Earth, Dr. Chandra has also had a discussion with HALs twin, the SAL 9000. Like HAL, SAL was created by Dr. Chandra. Whereas HAL was characterized as being male , SAL is characterized as being female  and is represented by a blue camera eye instead of a red one.

In essence: if the crew were dead, he would no longer have to keep the information secret.     The alien intelligence initiates a terraforming scheme, placing the Leonov, and everybody in it, in danger. Its human crew devises an escape plan which unfortunately requires leaving the Discovery and HAL behind to be destroyed.

First, in contradiction to the book , Heywood Floyd is absolved of responsibility for HALs condition; it is asserted that the decision to program HAL with information concerning TMA-1 came directly from the White House. In the film, HAL functions normally after being reactivated, while in the book it is revealed that his mind was damaged during the shutdown, forcing him to begin communication through screen text. Also, in the film the Leonov crew initially lies to HAL about the dangers that he faced , whereas in the novel he is told at the outset. However, in both cases the suspense comes from the question of what HAL will do when he knows that he may be destroyed by his actions.     In the novel, the basic reboot sequence initiated by Dr. Chandra is quite long, while the movie uses a shorter sequence voiced from HAL as: HELLODOCTORNAMECONTINUEYESTERDAYTOMORROW .     While Curnow tells Floyd that Dr. Chandra has begun designing the HAL 10000, the 10000 has not been mentioned in subsequent novels.     2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: The Final Odyssey 2061: Odyssey Three , ": null
