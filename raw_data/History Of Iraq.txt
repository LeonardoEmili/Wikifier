|Iraq|Iraq|  is the name of the state that currently partially encompasses the territory of the civilization of ancient  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| . This civilization came into being between the  |Tigris_and_Euphrates|Tigris_And_Euphrates|  rivers. These rivers flow into the Persian Gulf, through the State of  |Iraq|Iraq| . The  |Hashemite_Kingdom_of_Iraq|Hashemite_Kingdom_Of_Iraq| , also known as  |Mandatory_Iraq|Kingdom_Of_Iraq|  in its early phase, was established by the  |Anglo-Iraqi_treaty_of_1922|Anglo-Iraqi_Treaty_Of_1922|  resulting from the  |1920_Iraqi_revolt|1920_Iraqi_Revolt|  against British rule. It is centered in  |Lower_Mesopotamia|Lower_Mesopotamia|   but also includes part of  |Upper_Mesopotamia|Upper_Mesopotamia|  and of the  |Syrian_Desert|Syrian_Desert|  and the  |Arabian_Desert|Arabian_Desert| . The history of this area has witnessed some of the worlds earliest  |writing|List_Of_Languages_By_First_Written_Accounts| ,  |literature|Sumerian_Literature| ,  |sciences|Babylonian_Astronomy| ,  |mathematics|Babylonian_Mathematics| ,  |laws|Babylonian_Law|  and  |philosophies|Assyro-Babylonian_Literaturephilosophy| ; hence its common epithet, the  |Cradle_of_Civilization|Cradle_Of_Civilization| .     As part of the larger  |Fertile_Crescent|Fertile_Crescent| ,  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  saw the earliest emergence of  |civilization|Civilization|  in the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|   Age and formed a significant part of the  |Ancient_Near_East|Ancient_Near_East|  throughout the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  and the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  .  After the fall of the  |Neo-Babylonian_Empire|Neo-Babylonian_Empire| , Mesopotamia fell under  |Persian|Achaemenid_Empire|  and then  |Greek|Seleucid_Empire|  rule. By the 3rd century, when it was once again under Persian  control, the earlier and larger population was increasingly converted from the religion of the ancient, Judaism and Christianity to Islam, especially during the reign of Timur-lang. Furthermore, a very small population of Arab Muslim ruling minority, succeeded in the transformation of the Mesopotamians old religions to Islam , yet with a significant help of the native Christians, . As for the Name of the country Iraq it is derived from the Sumerian city of URUK, a name very well known to the natives long before the Arrival of Arab Muslim invaders. Also, The Sassanid Empire was destroyed by the  |Islamic_conquests|Islamic_Conquest_Of_Iraq|  and displaced by the  |Rashidun_Caliphate|Rashidun_Caliphate|  in the 7th century.  |Baghdad|History_Of_Baghdad|  became the center of the  |Islamic_Golden_Age|Islamic_Golden_Age|  under the  |Abbasid_Caliphate|Abbasid_Caliphate|  during the 9th century. Baghdads rapid growth stagnated in the 10th century due to the  |Buwayhid|Buwayhid|  and  |Seljuq|Seljuk_Turks|  invasions, but it remained of central importance until the  |Mongol_invasion|Siege_Of_Baghdad|  of 1258. After this, Iraq became a province of the Turco-Mongol  |Ilkhanate|Ilkhanate|  and declined in importance. After the disintegration of the Ilkhanate, Iraq was ruled by the  |Jalairids|Jalairid_Sultanate|  and  |Kara_Koyunlu|Kara_Koyunlu|  until its eventual absorption into the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  in the 16th century, intermittently falling under Iranian  |Safavid|Safavid_Dynasty|  and  |Mamluk|Mamluk_Dynasty_Of_Iraq|  control.     Ottoman rule ended with  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , and the  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  administered Iraq as  |Mandatory_Iraq|Mandatory_Iraq|  until the establishment of the  |Kingdom_of_Iraq|Kingdom_Of_Iraq|  in 1933. A republic formed in 1958 following a coup détat.  |Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein|  governed from 1979 to 2003, into which period fall the  |Iran–Iraq_War|Iran–Iraq_War|  and the  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| . Saddam Hussein was deposed following the  |2003_US-led_invasion_of_the_country|2003_Invasion_Of_Iraq| .  |Over_the_following_years|History_Of_Iraq| , Iraq came to the brink of  |civil_war|Civil_War_In_Iraq| , and the situation deteriorated after the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011.  |By_2015|History_Of_Iraq| , Iraq was effectively divided, the central and southern part being controlled by the  |government|Government_Of_Iraq| , the northwest by the  |Kurdistan_Regional_Government|Kurdistan_Regional_Government|  and the western part by the  |Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant|Islamic_State_Of_Iraq_And_The_Levant| . ISIS was expelled from Iraq in 2017, but  |continued_fighting_in_an_insurgency|Iraqi_Insurgency| .       During 1957–1961  |Shanidar_Cave|Shanidar_Cave|  was excavated by  |Ralph_Solecki|Ralph_Solecki|  and his team from  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University| , and nine skeletons of  |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  man of varying ages and states of preservation and completeness were discovered dating from 60,000–80,000 years  |BP|Before_Present| . A tenth individual was recently discovered by  |M._Zeder|Melinda_A._Zeder|  during examination of a faunal assemblage from the site at the Smithsonian Institution. The remains seemed to Zeder to suggest that Neanderthals had  |funeral_ceremonies|Funeral| ,  |burying_their_dead|Burial|  with flowers , and that they took care of injured and elderly individuals.     Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the  |Neolithic_Revolution|Neolithic_Revolution|  from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script, Mathematics, Astronomy and Agriculture.                      |Sumer|Sumer|  emerged as the civilization of Lower Mesopotamia out of the prehistoric  |Ubaid_period|Ubaid_Period|  in the Early Bronze Age    Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the  |Akkadian_Empire|Akkadian_Empire|  in the 24th century BC. Following the  |Gutian_period|Gutian_Period| , there is a brief  |Sumerian_renaissance|Sumerian_Renaissance|  in the 21st century, cut short in the 20th century BC by  |Amorite|Amorites|  invasion. The Amorite dynasty of  |Isin|Isin|  persisted until c. 1600 BC, when southern Mesopotamia was united under  |Kassite|Kassite| |Babylonia|Babylonia| n rule.     The north of Mesopotamia had become the  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Language| -speaking state of  |Assyria|Assyria|  by the late 25th century BC. Along with the rest of Mesopotamia it was ruled by Akkadian kings from the late 24th to mid 22nd centuries BC, after which it once again became independent. George Roux – Ancient Iraq      |Babylonia|Babylonia|  was a state in Lower Mesopotamia with  |Babylon|Babylon|  as its capital. It was founded as an independent state by an  |Amorite|Amorite|  king named  |Sumuabum|Sumuabum|  in 1894 BC. Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq During the 3rd millennium BCE, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread  |bilingualism|Wikt:Bilingualism| .      Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC, Woods C. 2006 “Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian”. In S.L. Sanders Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture but Sumerian continued to be used as a written or ceremonial language in Mesopotamia well into the period of  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity| .     Babylonia emerged from the Amorite dynasties when  |Hammurabi|Hammurabi|  , unified the territories of the former  |kingdoms|Monarchy|  of Sumer and Akkad.   During the early centuries of what is called the Amorite period , the most powerful city states were Isin and  |Larsa|Larsa| , although  |Shamshi-Adad_I|Shamshi-Adad_I|  came close to uniting the more northern regions around  |Assur|Assur|  and  |Mari|Mari,_Syria| . One of these Amorite dynasties was established in the  |city-state|City-State|  of Babylon, which would ultimately take over the others and form the first Babylonian empire, during what is also called the  |Old_Babylonian|First_Babylonian_Dynasty|  Period.      |Assyria|Assyria|  was an  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Language|  kingdom in Upper Mesopotamia, that came to rule regional empires a number of times through history. It was named for its original capital, the ancient city of  |Assur|Assur|  .     Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the  |Assyrian_King_List|Assyrian_King_List| , the earliest king recorded was  |Tudiya|Tudiya| . He was a contemporary of  |Ibrium|Ibrium|  of  |Ebla|Ebla|  who appears to have lived in the late 25th or early 24th century BC, according to the king list. The foundation of the first true urbanised Assyrian monarchy was traditionally ascribed to  |Ushpia|Ushpia|  a contemporary of  |Ishbi-Erra|Ishbi-Erra|  of  |Isin|Isin|  and  |Naplanum|Naplanum|  of  |Larsa|Larsa| . According to the  |Assyrian_King_List|Assyrian_King_List|  and Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq, p. 187. c. 2030 BC.     Assyria had a period of empire from the 19th to 18th centuries BC. From the 14th to 11th centuries BC Assyria once more became a major power with the rise of the  |Middle_Assyrian_Empire|Middle_Assyrian_Empire| .       The  |Neo-Assyrian_Empire|Neo-Assyrian_Empire|  was the dominant political force in the Ancient Near East during the Iron Age, eclipsing  |Babylonia|Babylonia| ,  |Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ,  |Urartu|Urartu|   and  |Elam|Elam| .   During this period,  |Aramaic|Aramaic_Language|  was also made an official language of the empire, alongside the  |Akkadian_language|Akkadian_Language| .     The  |Neo-Babylonian_Empire|Neo-Babylonian_Empire|    marks the final period of the history of the Ancient Near East preceding  |Persian_conquest|Persian_Empire| .   A year after the death of the last strong Assyrian ruler,  |Assurbanipal|Assurbanipal| , in 627 BC, the Assyrian empire spiralled into a series of brutal civil wars. Babylonia rebelled under  |Nabopolassar|Nabopolassar| , a member of the  |Chaldea|Chaldea| n tribe which had migrated from  |the_Levant|The_Levant|  to south eastern Babylonia in the early 9th century BC. In alliance with the  |Medes|Medes| ,  |Persians|Persian_People| ,  |Scythians|Scythians|  and  |Cimmerians|Cimmerians| , they sacked the city of  |Nineveh|Nineveh|  in 612 BC, and the seat of empire was transferred to  |Babylon|Babylon| ia for the first time since the death of  |Hammurabi|Hammurabi|  in the mid 18th century BC. This period witnessed a general improvement in economic life and agricultural production, and a great flourishing of architectural projects, the arts and science.   The Neo-Babylonian period ended with the reign of  |Nabonidus|Nabonidus|  in 539 BC. To the east, the Persians had been growing in strength, and eventually  |Cyrus_the_Great|Cyrus_The_Great|  established his dominion over Babylon.              Mesopotamia was conquered by the  |Achaemenid_Persians|Achaemenid_Empire|  under  |Cyrus_the_Great|Cyrus_The_Great|  in 539 BC, and remained under Persian rule for two centuries.     The Persian Empire fell to  |Alexander_of_Macedon|Alexander_The_Great|  in 331 BC and came under  |Greek|Hellenistic_Greece|  rule as part of the  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire| .  |Babylon|Babylon|  declined after the founding of  |Seleucia_on_the_Tigris|Seleucia_On_The_Tigris| , the new  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire|  capital.   The Seleucid Empire at the height of its power stretched from the Aegean in the west to  |India|Indo-Greeks|  in the east. It was a major center of  |Hellenistic|Hellenistic_Period|  culture that maintained the preeminence of  |Greek|Ancient_Greece|  customs where a Greek political elite dominated, mostly in the urban areas.  The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by immigration from  |Greece|Ancient_Greece| .    Much of the eastern part of the empire was conquered by the  |Parthians|Parthian_Empire|  under  |Mithridates_I_of_Parthia|Mithridates_I_Of_Parthia|  in the mid-2nd century BC.          At the beginning of the 2nd century AD, the  |Romans|Roman_Empire| , led by emperor  |Trajan|Trajan| , invaded Parthia and conquered Mesopotamia, making it an imperial province. It was returned to the Parthians shortly after by Trajans successor,  |Hadrian|Hadrian| .      |Christianity|Early_Christianity|  reached Mesopotamia in the 1st century AD, and  |Roman_Syria|Roman_Syria|  in particular became the center of  |Eastern_Rite|East_Syrian_Rite|  Christianity and the  |Syriac|Syriac_Christianity|  literary tradition.  |Mandeism|Mandeism|  is also believed to have either originated there around this time or entered as Mandaeans sought refuge from Palestine.   Sumerian-Akkadian religious tradition disappeared during this period, as did the last remnants of  |cuneiform|Cuneiform|  literacy, although temples were still being dedicated to the Assyrian national god  |Ashur|Ashur|  in his home city as late as the 4th century.          In the 3rd century AD, the Parthians were in turn succeeded by the  |Sassanid_dynasty|Sassanid_Dynasty| , which ruled Mesopotamia until the 7th century Islamic invasion. The Sassanids conquered the independent states of  |Adiabene|Adiabene| ,  |Osroene|Osroene| ,  |Hatra|Hatra|  and finally  |Assur|Assur|  during the 3rd century. In the mid-6th century the Persian Empire under the Sassanid dynasty was divided by  |Khosrow_I|Khosrow_I|  into four quarters, of which the western one, called Khvārvarān, included most of modern Iraq, and subdivided to provinces of Mishān,  |Asuristān|Asuristān|  ,  |Adiabene|Adiabene|  and Lower Media. The term Iraq is widely used in the medieval Arabic sources for the area in the center and south of the modern republic as a geographic rather than a political term, implying no greater precision of boundaries than the term Mesopotamia or, indeed, many of the names of modern states before the 20th century.     There was a substantial influx of  |Arabs|Arabs|  in the Sassanid period.    |Upper_Mesopotamia|Upper_Mesopotamia|  came to be known as Al-Jazirah in Arabic , and Lower Mesopotamia came to be known as  ʿIrāq-i ʿArab , meaning the escarpment of the Arabs   .
