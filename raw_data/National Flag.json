A general rule is that the national flag should be flown in the position of honour, and not in an inferior position to any other flag . The following rules are typical of the conventions when flags are flown on land:   When a national flag is displayed together with any other flags, it must be hoisted first and lowered last.   When a national flag is displayed together with the national flags of other countries, all the flags should be of approximately equal size and must be flown at an equal height, although the national flag of the host country should be flown in the position of honour .   When a national flag is displayed together with flags other than national flags, it should be flown on a separate flagpole, either higher or in the position of honour.   When a national flag is displayed together with any other flags on the same flagpole, it must be at the top, though separate flagpoles are preferable.   When a national flag is displayed together with any other flag on crossed flagpoles, the national flag must be on the observers left and its flagpole must be in front of the flagpole of the other flag.   When a national flag is displayed together with another flag or flags in procession, the national flag must be on the marching right. If there is a row of flags, it should be in the position of honour.   When a national flag, with some exceptions, is flown upside down it indicates distress. This however is merely tradition.
