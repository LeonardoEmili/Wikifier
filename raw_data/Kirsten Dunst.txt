Dunst, who was born in Point Pleasant, raised in Brick and schooled for a while at the Ranney School in Tinton Falls, has achieved an acting career unlike any of her peers.

After graduating from high school in 2000, Dunst continued acting. As a teenager, she found it difficult to deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later said that her mother always had the best intentions . When asked if she had any regrets about her childhood, Dunst said, Well, its not a natural way to grow up, but its the way I grew up and I wouldnt change it. I have my stuff to work out... I dont think anybody can sit around and say, My life is more screwed up than yours. Everybody has their issues.      In addition to her American citizenship, Dunst obtained German citizenship in 2011, in part because it helps her get roles in film projects with European financing which limits the number of Americans they are allowed to employ.   Translation of title: How her German passport helps her career         Dunst began her career when she was three years old as a child  |fashion_model|Fashion_Photography|  in television commercials.

In an interview with  Interview  magazine, she revealed that kissing him had made her feel uncomfortable: I thought it was gross, that Brad had  |cooties|Cooties| . I mean, I was 10.  Her performance earned her the  |MTV_Movie_Award|Mtv_Movie_Awards|  for Best Breakthrough Performance, the  |Saturn_Award|Saturn_Award|  for Best Young Actress, and her first  |Golden_Globe_Award|Golden_Globe_Award|  nomination.

Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of Interview With the Vampire, is a little vamp with a big future.      In 1995, Dunst co-starred in the fantasy adventure film  Jumanji , loosely based on  |Chris_Van_Allsburgs|Chris_Van_Allsburg|  1981 childrens  |book_of_the_same_name|Jumanji| .

The film generated mostly positive reviews,  with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review,  |A._O._Scott|A._O._Scott|  called her a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt. Charles Taylor of  Salon  noted that among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist , even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides.  Jessica Winter from  The Village Voice  complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick and commenting that provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.  Peter Stack of the  San Francisco Chronicle , despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film.

Dunst is so good in this film, playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted...
