   Edward Mitchell Bannister was a  |Black_Canadian|Black_Canadian| - |American|Americans| |_Tonalist|Tonalism| |_painter|Painting| . Like other Tonalists, his style and predominantly  |pastoral|Pastoral|  subject matter were drawn from his admiration for  |Millet|Jean_François_Millet|  and the French  |Barbizon_School|Barbizon_School| .               Bannister was born in  |St_Andrews_New_Brunswick|St_Andrews_New_Brunswick|  and moved to  |New_England|New_England|  in the late 1840s, where he remained for the rest of his life. Bannister was well known in the artistic community of his adopted home of  |Providence_Rhode_Island|Providence_Rhode_Island|  and admired within the wider East Coast art world: he won a  |bronze_medal|Bronze_Medal|  for his large oil Under the Oaks at the 1876  |Philadelphia_Centennial|Centennial_Exposition| . But he was largely forgotten for almost a century for various reasons, principally  |racial_prejudice|Racism| . Bannister began his official career as an artist when an article in the 1867  New York Herald  belittled both him and his work, stating ...the negro has an appreciation for art while being manifestly unable to produce it. Prior to working as a painter, Bannister worked as barber and  |tinted_photos|Tinted_Photograph| . In the late 1850s he attended lectures given by D.  |William_Rimmer|William_Rimmer| , a sculptor noted for his accuracy in rendering the human figure. Over the course of his career, Bannister was inspired by the  |Barbizon_school|Barbizon_School| -influenced paintings of  |William_Morris_Hunt|William_Morris_Hunt|  who had studied in Europe and held numerous public exhibitions in Boston around the 1860s. Although committed to freedom and equal rights for  |Afro_Americans|African_Americans| , he chose not to inject those issues into his work, adopting instead a spiritual philosophy and individually expressive style which represented harmony and liberty on a more universal plane.     As his career matured, Bannister accumulated many honors, several from the  |Massachusetts_Charitable_Mechanics_Association|Massachusetts_Charitable_Mechanic_Association| . His two biggest support systems were his mother, who was the catalyst from the very beginning for his passion for the arts, and his wife, who also was an activist. Both strong supporters of  |abolition|Abolitionism| , wife Christina lobbied for equal pay for black soldiers during the Civil War and also organized the soldiers’ relief fair in 1864. In 1880, Bannister joined with other professional artists, amateurs, and art collectors to found the  |Providence_Art_Club|Providence_Art_Club|  to stimulate the appreciation of art in the community. Bannister was the only major African American artist of the late nineteenth century who developed his talents without the benefit of European exposure.     Although primarily known for his idealised  |landscapes|Landscape_Art|  and  |seascapes|Seascapes| , Bannister also executed  |portraits|Portrait| , biblical and mythological scenes, and  |genre|Genre_Works|  scenes. An intellectual  |autodidact|Autodidacticism| , his tastes in literature were typical of an educated  |Victorian|Victorian_Era|  painter, including  |Spenser|Edmund_Spenser| ,  |Virgil|Virgil| ,  |Ruskin|John_Ruskin|  and  |Tennyson|Alfred_Tennyson_1St_Baron_Tennyson| , from whose works much of his iconography can be traced. His work reflected the composition, mood, and influences of French Barbizon painters  |Jean_Baptiste_Camille_Corot|Jean_Baptiste_Camille_Corot| ,  |Jean_François_Millet|Jean_François_Millet| , and  |Charles_François_Daubigny|Charles_François_Daubigny| . He had an affinity for  |Native_American|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  thought.     Bannister died of a heart attack in 1901 while attending a prayer meeting at his church, Elmwood Avenue Free Baptist Church. He is buried in the  |North_Burial_Ground|North_Burial_Ground|  in Providence.       With the ascendency of the  |civil_rights_movement|Civil_Rights_Movement|  in the 1970s, Bannisters work was again celebrated and collected. In 1978,  |Rhode_Island_College|Rhode_Island_College|  dedicated its Art Gallery in Bannisters name with the exhibition: Four From Providence ~ Alston, Bannister, Jennings & Prophet . This event was attended and commented on by numerous notable political figures of the time, and supported by the Rhode Island Committee for Humanities and the  |Rhode_Island_Historical_Society|Rhode_Island_Historical_Society| .     E. M. Bannister Gallery at  |Rhode_Island_College|Rhode_Island_College|  is named after Bannister.      The historian Anne Louise Avery is currently compiling the first  |Catalogue_Raisonné|Catalogue_Raisonné|  and major biography of Bannisters work. See the  for further details.       The house at 93 Benevolent Street in Providence, where Bannister lived between 1884 and 1899, was owned by  |Brown_University|Brown_University|  until 2016. Brown renovated the property and restored it to its original appearance,  and it was sold to Professor Jeff Huang as part of the Brown to Brown Home Ownership Program.
