Southeast Alaska, colloquially referred to as the Alaska Panhandle or Alaskan Panhandle, is the southeastern portion of the  |U.S._state|U.S._State|  of  |Alaska|Alaska| , bordered to the east by the northern half of the  |Canadian_province|Provinces_And_Territories_Of_Canada|  of  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia| . The majority of Southeast Alaskas area is part of the  |Tongass_National_Forest|Tongass_National_Forest| , the United States largest  |national_forest|United_States_National_Forest| . In many places, the  |international_border|International_Border|  runs along the crest of the  |Boundary_Ranges|Boundary_Ranges|  of the  |Coast_Mountains|Coast_Mountains|  . The region is noted for its scenery and mild, rainy  |climate|Climate| .     The largest cities in the region are  |Juneau|Juneau| ,  |Sitka|Sitka,_Alaska| , and  |Ketchikan|Ketchikan| . This region is also home to the easternmost town in Alaska,  |Hyder|Hyder,_Alaska| .       Southeast Alaska has a land area of , comprising much of the  |Alexander_Archipelago|Alexander_Archipelago| . The largest islands are, from North to South,  |Chichagof_Island|Chichagof_Island| ,  |Admiralty_Island|Admiralty_Island| ,  |Baranof_Island|Baranof_Island| ,  |Kupreanof_Island|Kupreanof_Island| ,  |Revillagigedo_Island|Revillagigedo_Island|  and  |Prince_of_Wales_Island|Prince_Of_Wales_Island| . Major bodies of water of Southeast Alaska include  |Glacier_Bay|Glacier_Bay| ,  |Lynn_Canal|Lynn_Canal| ,  |Icy_Strait|Icy_Strait| ,  |Chatham_Strait|Chatham_Strait| ,  |Stephens_Passage|Stephens_Passage| ,  |Frederick_Sound|Frederick_Sound| ,  |Sumner_Strait|Sumner_Strait| , and  |Clarence_Strait|Clarence_Strait| .     The archipelago is the northern terminus of the  |Inside_Passage|Inside_Passage| , a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in  |Puget_Sound|Puget_Sound|  in  |Washington|Washington|  state. This was an important travel corridor for  |Tlingit|Tlingit_People| ,  |Haida|Haida_People| , and  |Tsimshian|Tsimshian|  Native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. In modern times it is an important route for  |Alaska_Marine_Highway|Alaska_Marine_Highway|  ferries as well as  |cruise_ships|Cruise_Ship| .             Southeast Alaska is composed of seven entire  |boroughs|County-Equivalent|  and two  |census_areas|Census_Area| , in addition to the portion of the  |Yakutat_Borough|Yakutat_City_And_Borough,_Alaska|  lying east of  |141°_West|141St_Meridian_West|  longitude. Although it has only 6.14 percent of Alaskas land area, it is larger than the state of  |Maine|Maine| , and almost as large as the state of  |Indiana|Indiana| . The Southeast Alaskan coast is roughly as long as the  |west_coast|British_Columbia_Coast|  of Canada.     The  |2010_census|2010_United_States_Census|  population of Southeast Alaska was 71,616 inhabitants, about 45 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of  |Juneau|Juneau,_Alaska| . As of 2018, the number of settlements in Southeast Alaska that have a population of at least 1,000 people has grown to nine.        |Haines_Borough|Haines_Borough,_Alaska| |Hoonah-Angoon_Census_Area|Hoonah-Angoon_Census_Area,_Alaska| |Juneau_Borough|Juneau_City_And_Borough,_Alaska| |Ketchikan_Gateway_Borough|Ketchikan_Gateway_Borough,_Alaska| |Petersburg_Borough|Petersburg,_Alaska| |Prince_of_Wales-Hyder_Census_Area|Prince_Of_Wales-Hyder_Census_Area,_Alaska| |Sitka_Borough|Sitka_City_And_Borough,_Alaska| |Skagway_Borough|Skagway,_Alaska| |Wrangell_Borough|Wrangell,_Alaska| |Yakutat_Borough|Yakutat_City_And_Borough,_Alaska|         Populations are based off 2018 estimates, except for Haines and Metlakatla which are based off the  |2010_Census|2010_United_States_Census| .     |Juneau|Juneau,_Alaska|  - 32,113 inhabitants    |Sitka|Sitka,_Alaska|  - 8,647 inhabitants    |Ketchikan|Ketchikan,_Alaska|  - 8,289 inhabitants    |Petersburg|Petersburg,_Alaska|  - 3,221 inhabitants    |Wrangell|Wrangell,_Alaska|  - 2,503 inhabitants    |Haines|Haines,_Alaska|  - 1,713 inhabitants    |Metlakatla|Metlakatla,_Alaska|  - 1,375 inhabitants    |Craig|Craig,_Alaska|  - 1,301 inhabitants    |Skagway|Skagway,_Alaska|  - 1,148 inhabitants          Southeast Alaska includes the  |Tongass_National_Forest|Tongass_National_Forest|  ,  |Glacier_Bay_National_Park|Glacier_Bay_National_Park| ,  |Sitka_National_Historical_Park|Sitka_National_Historical_Park| ,  |Alaskas_Inside_Passage|Alaskas_Inside_Passage| , and myriad large and small islands. It is the largest  |national_park|National_Park|  in the  |United_States|United_States| . On August 20, 1902,  |President|President_Of_The_United_States| |Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt|  established the  |Alexander_Archipelago_Forest_Reserve|Alexander_Archipelago_Forest_Reserve| , which formed the heart of the  |Tongass_National_Forest|Tongass_National_Forest|  that covers most of the region.      |Glacier_Bay_National_Park_and_Preserve|Glacier_Bay_National_Park_And_Preserve| |Klondike_Gold_Rush_National_Historical_Park|Klondike_Gold_Rush_National_Historical_Park| |Sitka_National_Historical_Park|Sitka_National_Historical_Park| |Wrangell–St._Elias_National_Park_and_Preserve|Wrangell–St._Elias_National_Park_And_Preserve| |Admiralty_Island_National_Monument|Admiralty_Island_National_Monument| |Misty_Fjords_National_Monument|Misty_Fjords_National_Monument|           The climate of Southeast Alaska is dominated by a mid-latitude  |oceanic_climate|Oceanic_Climate|   in the south, an oceanic, marine sub-polar climate  in the central region around  |Juneau|Juneau,_Alaska| , and a  |subarctic_climate|Subarctic_Climate|   to the far northwest and the interior highlands of the archipelago. Southeast Alaska is also the only region in Alaska where the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.       Southeast Alaska is a  |temperate_rain_forest|Temperate_Rain_Forest|  within the  |Pacific_temperate_rain_forest|Pacific_Temperate_Rain_Forest|  zone, as classified by the  |World_Wildlife_Funds|World_Wildlife_Fund| |ecoregion|Ecoregion|  system, which extends from northern  |California|California|  to  |Prince_William_Sound|Prince_William_Sound| . The most common tree species are  |sitka_spruce|Sitka_Spruce|  and  |western_hemlock|Western_Hemlock| .     Wildlife includes  |brown_bears|Brown_Bear| ,  |black_bears|American_Black_Bear| , endemic  |Alexander_Archipelago_wolf|Alexander_Archipelago_Wolf|  packs,  |Sitka_black-tailed_deer|Black-Tailed_Deer| ,  |humpback_whales|Humpback_Whale| ,  |orcas|Orca| , five species of  |salmon|Salmon| ,  |bald_eagles|Bald_Eagle| ,  |harlequin_ducks|Harlequin_Duck| ,  |scoters|Scoter| , and  |marbled_murrelets|Marbled_Murrelet| .     The , published by Audubon Alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the regions landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources.          This area is the traditional homeland of the  |Tlingit|Tlingit_People| , and home of a historic settling of  |Haida|Haida_People|  as well as a modern settlement of  |Tsimshian|Tsimshian| . The region is closely connected to  |Seattle|Seattle|  and the American  |Pacific_Northwest|Pacific_Northwest|  economically and culturally.       Major industries in Southeast Alaska include  |commercial_fishing|Commercial_Fishing|  and  |tourism|Tourism|  .        |Logging|Logging|  has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the regions major pulp mills; the Alaska Forest Association described the situation as desperate in 2011.  Its members include Alcan Forest Products  and Viking Lumber, which is based in  |Craig,_Alaska|Craig,_Alaska| .  Debates over whether to expand logging in the federally owned Tongass are not uncommon.         Mining remains important in the northern area with the  |Juneau_mining_district|Juneau_Mining_District|  and  |Admiralty_mining_district|Admiralty_Mining_District|  hosting active mines as of 2015. Gold was discovered in 1880 and played an important part in the early history of the region.      In the 2010s, mines increasingly begun to be explored and eventually completed in neighboring  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia| , upstream of important rivers such as the  |Unuk|Unuk_River|  and the  |Stikine|Stikine_River| , which became known as the transboundary mining issue. In 2014, the  |Mount_Polley_Mine_disaster|Mount_Polley_Mine_Disaster|  focused attention on the issue, and an agreement between Canada and Alaska was drafted in 2015.      The proposed  |Kerr_Sulphurets_Mitchell|Kerr_Sulphurets_Mitchell|  exploration is upstream of the Unuk. Mines upstream of the Stikine include the Red Chris, which is owned by the same company as the Mount Polley mine.        The border between Alaska and the Canadian province of  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia|  was the subject of the  |Alaska_boundary_dispute|Alaska_Boundary_Dispute| , where the United States and the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  claimed different borderlines at the Alaskan panhandle. While the British foreign affairs were in favor of support of the Canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to alienation of the British from the new nation of  |Canada|Canada| .          Due to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities  have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The  |Alaska_Marine_Highway|Alaska_Marine_Highway|  passes through this region.        |Alaska_Airlines|Alaska_Airlines|  is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneaus  |Juneau_International_Airport|Juneau_International_Airport|  serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikans  |Ketchikan_International_Airport|Ketchikan_International_Airport|  serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. Alaskas  |bush_airlines|Bush_Aviation|  and  |air_taxis|Air_Taxi|  serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. Many communities are accessible by air only by  |floatplane|Floatplane| , as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.       Southeast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run  |Alaska_Marine_Highway|Alaska_Marine_Highway| , which links Skagway, Haines,  |Hoonah|Hoonah,_Alaska| ,  |Juneau|Juneau| ,  |Sitka|Sitka,_Alaska| ,  |Petersburg|Petersburg,_Alaska| ,  |Wrangell|Wrangell,_Alaska| ,  |Ketchikan|Ketchikan,_Alaska|  and other outlying communities with  |Prince_Rupert,_BC|Prince_Rupert,_Bc|  and  |Bellingham,_Washington|Bellingham,_Washington| ; and secondarily by the  |Prince_of_Wales_Island|Prince_Of_Wales_Island| -based  |Inter-Island_Ferry_Authority|Inter-Island_Ferry_Authority| , which provides the only scheduled passenger and auto ferry service to the island. A new Authority, the Rainforest Islands Ferry Authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the North End route. The Authority would connect Coffman Cove with Wrangell and Petersburg. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the  |Lynn_Canal|Lynn_Canal|  occasionally also offer marine passenger service. Ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with  |cruise_ship|Cruise_Ship| .
