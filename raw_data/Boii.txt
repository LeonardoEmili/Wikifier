        The Boii  were a  |Gallic|Gauls|  tribe of the later  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| , attested at various times in  |Cisalpine_Gaul|Cisalpine_Gaul|  ,  |Pannonia|Pannonia|  , parts of  |Bavaria|Bavaria| , in and around  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  , parts of  |Poland|Poland| , and  |Gallia_Narbonensis|Gallia_Narbonensis| . In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the  |Kłodzko_Valley|Kłodzko_Valley|  into  |Silesia|Silesia| , now part of  |Poland|Poland|  and the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic| .      They first appear in history in connection with the  |Gallic_invasion_of_north_Italy|Campaign_History_Of_The_Roman_Militaryceltic_Invasion_Of_Italia| , 390 BC, when they made the  |Etruscan|Etruscan_Civilization|  city of Felsina their new capital,  |Bononia|Bologna| . After a series of wars they were decisively beaten by the Romans in a  |Battle_of_Mutina|Battle_Of_Mutina|  and their territory became part of the Roman province of  |Cisalpine_Gaul|Cisalpine_Gaul| . According to  |Strabo|Strabo| , writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours,     Around 60 BC, a group of Boii joined the  |Helvetiis|Helvetii|  ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| , along with their allies, in the  |Battle_of_Bibracte|Battle_Of_Bibracte| . Caesar settled the remnants of that group in  |Gorgobina|Gorgobina| , from where they sent two thousand to  |Vercingetorixs|Vercingetorix|  aid at the  |Battle_of_Alesia|Battle_Of_Alesia|  six years later. The eastern Boii on the Danube were incorporated into the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  in 8 AD.       From all the different names of the same Celtic people in literature and inscriptions it is possible to abstract a  |Continental_Celtic|Continental_Celtic_Languages|  segment, boio-.  There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of  |Indo-European_languages|Indo-European_Languages| |Old_Irish|Old_Irish|  legal term for outsider: ambue, from  |Proto-Celtic|Proto-Celtic_Language|  ambouios         .
