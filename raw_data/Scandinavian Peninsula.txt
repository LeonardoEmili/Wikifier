          The Scandinavian Peninsula  is a  |peninsula|Peninsula|  of  |Eurasia|Eurasia|  located in  |Northern_Europe|Northern_Europe| , which roughly comprises the mainland of  |Sweden|Sweden| , the mainland of  |Norway|Norway| , and the northwestern area of  |Finland|Finland| .     The name of the peninsula is derived from the term  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| , the cultural region of  |Denmark|Denmark| ,  |Norway|Norway|  and  |Sweden|Sweden| . That cultural name is in turn derived from the name of  |Scania|Scania| , the region at the southern extremity of the peninsula which was for centuries a part of Denmark, which is the ancestral home of the  |Danes|Danes| , and which is now part of Sweden. The derived term Scandinavian also refers to the  |Germanic_peoples|Germanic_Peoples|  who speak  |North_Germanic_languages|North_Germanic_Languages| , considered to be a  |dialect_continuum|Dialect_Continuum|  derived from  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse| .

The name Scandinavia was used by classical authors in the first centuries of the Christian era to identify Skåne and the mainland further north which they believed to be an island. Olwig, Kenneth R.

International Journal of Heritage Studies, Vol. 11, No. 1, March 2005, p. 3: The very name Scandinavia is of cultural origin, since it derives from the Scanians or Scandians , a people who long ago lent their name to all of Scandinavia, perhaps because they lived centrally, at the southern tip of the peninsula.

These modern North Germanic languages found in Scandinavia are  |Danish|Danish_Language| ,  |Norwegian|Norwegian_Language| , and  |Swedish|Swedish_Language| ; additionally  |Faroese|Faroese_Language|  and  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language|  belong to the same language group, but they are not part of the modern Scandinavian dialect continuum and are not intelligible with the other languages.     The Scandinavian Peninsula is the largest of the well-known peninsulas of  |Europe|Europe| , with a greater area than the  |Balkan|Balkan_Peninsula| ,  |Iberian|Iberian_Peninsula|  and  |Italian|Italian_Peninsula|  peninsulas. During the Ice Ages, the sea level of the  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean|  dropped so much that the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| , the  |Gulf_of_Bothnia|Gulf_Of_Bothnia|  and the  |Gulf_of_Finland|Gulf_Of_Finland|  disappeared, and the countries now surrounding them, including Germany, Poland, the other Baltic countries and Scandinavia, were directly joined by land.                  The largest peninsula in Europe, the Scandinavian Peninsula is approximately  long with a width varying approximately from 370 to 805 kilometres . The  |Scandinavian_mountain_range|Scandinavian_Mountain_Range|  generally defines the border between Norway and Sweden. The peninsula is bordered by several bodies of water including:     the  |Barents_Sea|Barents_Sea|  to the north   the  |Norwegian_Sea|Norwegian_Sea|  to the west   the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  and  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  to the south   the Baltic Sea,  to the east.     Its highest elevation was  |Glittertinden|Glittertinden|  in Norway at 2,470 metres above sea level, but since the glacier at its summit partially melted , the highest elevation is at 2,469 metres at  |Galdhøpiggen|Galdhøpiggen| , also in Norway. These mountains also have the largest  |glacier|Glacier|  on the mainland of Europe,  |Jostedalsbreen|Jostedalsbreen| .     About one quarter of the Scandinavian Peninsula lies north of the  |Arctic_Circle|Arctic_Circle| , its northernmost point being at  |Cape_Nordkyn|Cape_Nordkyn| ,  |Norway|Norway| .     The climate across Scandinavia varies from tundra  and subarctic in the north, with cool marine west coast climate in northwestern coastal areas reaching just north of  |Lofoten|Lofoten| , to humid continental in the central portion and marine west coast in the south and southwest.    The region is rich in timber, iron and copper with the best farmland in southern Sweden. Large petroleum and natural-gas deposits have been found off Norways coast in the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  and the Atlantic Ocean.     Much of the population of the Scandinavian Peninsula is naturally concentrated in its southern part, which is also its  |agricultural|Agricultural|  region. The largest cities of the peninsula are  |Stockholm|Stockholm| , Sweden;  |Oslo|Oslo| , Norway;  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg| , Sweden;  |Malmö|Malmö| , Sweden and  |Bergen|Bergen| , Norway, in that order.       The Scandinavian Peninsula occupies part of the  |Baltic_Shield|Baltic_Shield| , a stable and large crust segment formed of very old,  |crystalline|Crystalrocks| |metamorphic_rocks|Metamorphic_Rock| . Most of the soil covering this substrate was scraped by glaciers during the  |Ice_Ages|Ice_Age|  of antiquity,  As a consequence of this scouring, the  |elevation|Elevation|  of the land and the cool-to-cold  |climate|Climate| , a relatively small percentage of its land is  |arable|Arable_Land| . Hobbs, Joseph J. and Salter, Christopher L.Essentials Of World Regional Geography,p. 108.Thomson Brooks/Cole.2005.     The  |glaciation|Glaciation|  during the Ice Ages also deepened many of the river valleys, which were invaded by the sea when the ice melted, creating the noteworthy  |fjords|Fjords|  of Norway. In the southern part of the peninsula, the glaciers deposited vast numbers of  |terminal_moraines|Terminal_Moraine| , configuring a very chaotic landscape. Ostergren, Robert C., Rice, John G. The Europeans. Guilford Press. 2004. These terminal moraines covered all of what is now Denmark.          Although the Baltic Shield is mostly  |geologically|Geology|  stable and hence resistant to the influences of other neighbouring tectonic formations, the weight of nearly four kilometres of ice during the Ice Ages caused all of the Scandinavian terrain to sink. When the ice sheet disappeared, the shield rose again, a tendency that continues to this day at a rate of about one metre per century. Conversely, the southern part has tended to sink to compensate, causing flooding of the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  and Denmark.     The crystalline substrate of the land and absence of soil in many places have exposed mineral deposits of metal  |ores|Ore| , such as those of  |iron|Iron| ,  |copper|Copper| ,  |nickel|Nickel| ,  |zinc|Zinc| ,  |silver|Silver|  and  |gold|Gold| . The very most valuable of these have been the deposits of  |iron_ore|Iron_Ore|  in northwestern Sweden. In the 19th century these deposits prompted the building of a  |railway|Rail_Transport|  from northwestern Sweden to the Norwegian  |seaport|Seaport|  of  |Narvik|Narvik|  so that the iron ore could be exported by ship to places like southern Sweden,  |Germany|Germany| ,  |Great_Britain|Uk|  and  |Belgium|Belgium|  for smelting into iron and  |steel|Steel| . This railway is in a region of Norway and Sweden that otherwise does not have any railways because of the very rugged terrain, mountains and  |fjords|Fjord|  of that part of Scandinavia.       The first recorded human presence in the southern area of the peninsula and Denmark dates from 12,000 years ago. Tilley, Christopher Y. Ethnography of the Neolithic: Early Prehistoric Societies in Southern Scandinavia, p. 9, Cambridge University Press. 2003.  As the ice sheets from the glaciation retreated, the climate allowed a  |tundra|Tundra| |_biome|Biome|  that attracted  |reindeer|Reindeer|  hunters. The climate warmed up gradually, favouring the growth of  |evergreen|Evergreen|  trees first and then  |deciduous|Deciduous|  forest which brought animals like  |aurochs|Aurochs| . Groups of hunter-fisher-gatherers started to inhabit the area from the  |Mesolithic|Mesolithic|  , up to the advent of agriculture in the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  .     The northern and central part of the peninsula is partially inhabited by the  |Sami|Sami_People| , often referred to as Lapps or Laplanders, who began to arrive several thousand years after the Scandinavian Peninsula had already been inhabited in the south. In the earliest recorded periods they occupied the  |arctic|Arctic|  and  |subarctic|Subarctic|  regions as well as the central part of the peninsula as far south as  |Dalarna|Dalarna| , Sweden. They speak the  |Sami_language|Sami_Languages| , a non- |Indo_European_language|Indo_European_Language|  of the  |Uralic|Uralic_Languages|  family which is related to  |Finnish|Finnish_Language|  and  |Estonian|Estonian_Language| . The first inhabitants of the peninsula were the Norwegians on the west coast of Norway, the Danes in what is now southern and western Sweden and southeastern Norway, the  |Svear|Swedes|  in the region around  |Mälaren|Mälaren|  as well as a large portion of the present day eastern seacoast of Sweden and the  |Geats|Geat|  in  |Västergötland|Västergötland|  and  |Östergötland|Östergötland| . These peoples spoke closely related  |dialects|Dialect|  of an Indo-European language,  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse| . Although political boundaries have shifted, descendants of these peoples still are the dominant populations in the peninsula in the early 21st century.              Although the  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries|  look back on more than 1,000 years of history as distinct political entities, the international boundaries came late and emerged gradually. It was not until the middle of the 17th century that Sweden had a secure outlet on the  |Kattegat|Kattegat|  and control of the south Baltic coast. The Swedish and Norwegian boundaries were finally agreed and marked out in 1751. The Finnish-Norwegian border on the peninsula was established after extensive negotiation in 1809, and the common Norwegian-Russian districts were not partitioned until 1826. Even then the borders were still fluid, with Finland gaining access to the  |Barents_Sea|Barents_Sea|  in 1920, but ceding this territory to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  in 1944.      Denmark, Sweden and the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  dominated the  |political_relationships|Political_Science|  on the Scandinavian Peninsula for centuries, with  |Iceland|Iceland| , Finland and Norway only gaining their full independence during the 20th century. The Kingdom of  |Norway|Norway|  long held in  |personal_union|Personal_Union|  by  |Denmark|Denmark_Norway|  fell to  |Sweden|United_Kingdoms_Of_Sweden_And_Norway|  after the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars|  and only attained full independence in 1905. Having been an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire since 1809, Finland declared independence during the Soviet revolution of Russia in 1917. Iceland declared its independence from Denmark in 1944, while Denmark was under the occupation of  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| . Iceland was encouraged to do this by the British and American armed forces that were defending Iceland from Nazi invasion.     The  |Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht|  invaded Norway in 1940 and the German Army occupied all of Norway until May 1945. With the acquiescence of the  |Kingdom_of_Sweden|Kingdom_Of_Sweden| , German troops moved from northern Norway, across northern Sweden, into Finland, which had become an ally of Nazi Germany. Then, in the spring of 1941, the German Army and the  |Finnish_Army|Finnish_Army|  invaded the Soviet Union together. The Republic of Finland had a grievance against the Soviet Union because the  |Red_Army|Red_Army|  had invaded southeastern Finland in the  |Winter_War|Winter_War|  and had taken a large area of territory away from Finland.     Sweden remained a  |neutral_country|Neutral_Country|  during the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , the  |Korean_War|Korean_War|  and the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , but chose to ally with Nazi Germany in the Second World war.     In 1945, Norway, Denmark and Iceland were founding members of the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| . Sweden joined the U.N. soon after. Finland joined during the 1950s. The first  |Secretary_General_of_the_United_Nations|Secretary_General_Of_The_United_Nations| ,  |Trygve_Lie|Trygve_Lie| , was a Norwegian citizen. The second Secretary General of the United Nations,  |Dag_Hammarskjöld|Dag_Hammarskjöld| , was a Swedish citizen. Thus the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula had a strong influence in international affairs during the 20th century.     In 1949, Norway, Denmark and Iceland became founding members of the  |North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation|Nato|  for their defence against East Germany, the Soviet Union and all other potential invaders, and these three countries remain members as of 2011.     Sweden and Finland joined the  |European_Union|European_Union| .
