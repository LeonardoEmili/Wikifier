The film presents and illustrates Chomsky and Hermans  |propaganda_model|Propaganda_Model|  thesis that  |corporate_media|Corporate_Media| , as profit-driven institutions, tend to serve and further the agendas and interests of dominant, elite groups in the society. A centerpiece of the film is a long examination of the history of  The New York Times coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor , which Chomsky says exemplifies the medias unwillingness to criticize an ally of the elite.     Until the release of  |The_Corporation|The_Corporation|  , made by Mark Achbar , Jennifer Abbott and Joel Bakan , it was the most successful feature documentary in Canadian history playing theatrically in over 300 cities around the world. It appeared in more than 50 international film festivals where it received 22 awards. It was broadcast on television in over 30 markets and translated into a dozen languages.     Chomskys response to the film was mixed; in a published conversation with Achbar and several activists, he stated that the positive impact of it has been astonishing to me but people mistakenly get the impression that he is the leader of a movement that they should join. He also criticizes The New York Times review of the film, which mistakes his message for being a call for voter organizing rather than for engaging in media critique and political action.
