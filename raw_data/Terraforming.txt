               Terraforming or terraformation of a  |planet|Planet| ,  |moon|Natural_Satellite| , or other body is the  |hypothetical|Hypothesis|  process of deliberately modifying its  |atmosphere|Atmosphere| ,  |temperature|Temperature| , surface  |topography|Topography|  or  |ecology|Ecology|  to be similar to the environment of  |Earth|Earth|  to make it  |habitable|Planetary_Habitability|  by Earth-like life.     The concept of terraforming developed from both  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  and actual  |science|Science| . The term was coined by  |Jack_Williamson|Jack_Williamson|  in a science-fiction short story  published during 1942 in  Astounding Science Fiction ,  but the concept may  |pre_date_this_work|Terraforming_In_Popular_Culture| .     Even if the environment of a planet could be altered deliberately, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet has yet to be verified.  |Mars|Mars|  is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and  |NASA|Nasa|  has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods of  |altering_the_climate_of_Mars|Terraforming_Of_Mars|  may fall within humanitys technological capabilities, but at present the economic resources required to do so are far beyond that which any government or society is willing to allocate to it. The long timescales and practicality of terraforming are the subject of debate. Other unanswered questions relate to the  |ethics|Ethics_Of_Terraforming| ,  |logistics|Logistics| ,  |economics|Economics| ,  |politics|Politics| , and  |methodology|Methodology|  of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world.       The astronomer  |Carl_Sagan|Carl_Sagan|  proposed the  |planetary_engineering|Planetary_Engineering|  of Venus in an article published in the journal  Science  in 1961.  Sagan imagined seeding the atmosphere of  |Venus|Venus|  with  |algae|Algae| , which would convert water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide into  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound| . As this process removed  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  from the atmosphere, the  |greenhouse_effect|Greenhouse_Effect|  would be reduced until surface temperatures dropped to comfortable levels. The resulting carbon, Sagan supposed, would be incinerated by the high surface temperatures of Venus, and thus be  |sequestered|Carbon_Sequestering|  in the form of graphite or some involatile form of carbon on the planets surface. Sagan 1997, pp. 276–7. However, later discoveries about the conditions on  |Venus|Venus|  made this particular approach impossible. One problem is that the clouds of Venus are composed of a highly concentrated  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  solution. Even if atmospheric algae could thrive in the hostile environment of Venuss upper atmosphere, an even more insurmountable problem is that its atmosphere is simply far too thick—the high atmospheric pressure would result in an atmosphere of nearly pure molecular oxygen and cause the planets surface to be thickly covered in fine graphite powder. This volatile combination could not be sustained through time. Any carbon that was fixed in organic form would be liberated as carbon dioxide again through combustion, short-circuiting the terraforming process.     Sagan also visualized making  |Mars|Mars|  habitable for human life in Planetary Engineering on Mars , an article published in the journal  Icarus .  Three years later, NASA addressed the issue of planetary engineering officially in a study, but used the term planetary ecosynthesis instead. The study concluded that it was possible for Mars to support life and be made into a  |habitable_planet|Planetary_Habitability| . The first conference session on terraforming, then referred to as Planetary Modeling , was organized that same year.     In March 1979, NASA engineer and author  |James_Oberg|James_Oberg|  organized the First Terraforming Colloquium, a special session at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. Oberg popularized the terraforming concepts discussed at the colloquium to the general public in his book New Earths .  Not until 1982 was the word terraforming used in the title of a published journal article. Planetologist Christopher McKay wrote Terraforming Mars , a paper for the  Journal of the British Interplanetary Society .  The paper discussed the prospects of a self-regulating Martian biosphere, and McKays use of the word has since become the preferred term.   In 1984,  |James_Lovelock|James_Lovelock|  and Michael Allaby published The Greening of Mars.  Lovelocks book was one of the first to describe a novel method of warming Mars, where  |chlorofluorocarbons|Chlorofluorocarbon|  are added to the atmosphere.     Motivated by Lovelocks book, biophysicist  |Robert_Haynes|Robert_Haynes|  worked behind the scenes to promote terraforming, and contributed the  |neologism|Neologism|  Ecopoiesis, Haynes, RH , Ecce Ecopoiesis: Playing God on Mars , in MacNiven, D. , Moral Expertise: studies in practical and professional ethics, Routledge. pp. 161–163. . forming the word from the Greek , oikos, house , . and , poiesis, production . . Ecopoiesis refers to the origin of an ecosystem. In the context of space exploration, Haynes describes ecopoiesis as the fabrication of a sustainable ecosystem on a currently lifeless, sterile planet . Fogg defines ecopoiesis as a type of  |planetary_engineering|Planetary_Engineering|  and is one of the first stages of terraformation. This primary stage of ecosystem creation is usually restricted to the initial seeding of microbial life.  A 2019 opinion piece by Lopez, Peixoto and Rosado has reintroduced microbiology as a necessary component of any possible colonization strategy based on the principles of microbial symbiosis and their beneficial ecosystem services.  As conditions approach that of Earth, plant life could be brought in, and this will accelerate the production of oxygen, theoretically making the planet eventually able to support animal life.       In 1985,  |Martyn_J_Fogg|Martyn_J_Fogg|  started publishing several articles on terraforming. He also served as editor for a full issue on terraforming for the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 1992. In his book Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments , Fogg proposed the following definitions for different aspects related to terraforming:    |Planetary_engineering|Planetary_Engineering| |Geoengineering|Climate_Engineering| |insolation|Insolation|  or impact flux.   Terraforming: a process of planetary engineering, specifically directed at enhancing the capacity of an extraterrestrial planetary environment to support life as we know it. The ultimate achievement in terraforming would be to create an open planetary  |ecosystem|Ecosystem|  emulating all the functions of the  |biosphere|Biosphere|  of Earth, one that would be fully habitable for human beings.     Fogg also devised definitions for candidate planets of varying degrees of human compatibility: Fogg, 1996   Habitable Planet : A world with an environment sufficiently similar to Earth as to allow comfortable and free human habitation.   Biocompatible Planet : A planet possessing the necessary physical parameters for life to flourish on its surface. If initially lifeless, then such a world could host a  |biosphere|Biosphere|  of considerable complexity without the need for terraforming.   Easily Terraformable Planet : A planet that might be rendered biocompatible, or possibly habitable, and maintained so by modest planetary engineering techniques and with the limited resources of a starship or robot precursor mission.     Fogg suggests that  |Mars|Mars|  was a biologically compatible planet in its youth, but is not now in any of these three categories, because it can only be terraformed with greater difficulty.           An absolute requirement for life is an energy source, but the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before the surface of an astronomical body is able to support life. Of particular interest is the set of factors that has sustained complex, multicellular animals in addition to simpler organisms on Earth. Research and theory in this regard is a component of  |planetary_science|Planetary_Science|  and the emerging discipline of  |astrobiology|Astrobiology| .     In its astrobiology roadmap,  |NASA|Nasa|  has defined the principal habitability criteria as extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly of complex  |organic_molecules|Organic_Molecule| , and energy sources to sustain  |metabolism|Metabolism| .        Once conditions become more suitable for  |life|Life|  of the  |introduced_species|Introduced_Species| , the importation of  |microbial|Microbial|  life could begin. As conditions approach that of Earth,  |plant_life|Plants|  could also be brought in. This would accelerate the production of oxygen, which theoretically would make the planet eventually able to support  |animal|Animal|  life.                 In many respects,  |Mars|Mars|  is the most Earth-like planet in the Solar System. Read and Lewis 2004, p.16 Kargel 2004, pp. 185–6. It is thought that Mars once had a more Earth-like environment early in its history, with a thicker atmosphere and abundant water that was lost over the course of hundreds of millions of years. Kargel 2004, 99ff     The exact mechanism of this loss is still unclear, though three mechanisms in particular seem likely: First, whenever surface water is present,  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|   reacts with rocks to form  |carbonates|Carbonate| , thus drawing atmosphere off and binding it to the planetary surface. On Earth, this process is counteracted when  |plate_tectonics|Plate_Tectonics|  works to cause volcanic eruptions that vent carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. On Mars, the lack of such tectonic activity worked to prevent the recycling of gases locked up in sediments. Forget, Costard & amp; Lognonné 2007, pp. 80–2.     Second, the lack of a  |magnetosphere|Magnetosphere|  around Mars may have allowed the  |solar_wind|Solar_Wind|  to gradually erode the atmosphere.  |Convection|Convection|  within the core of Mars, which is made mostly of  |iron|Iron| ,  originally generated a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| . However the  |dynamo|Dynamo_Theory|  ceased to function long ago, Schubert, Turcotte & amp; Olson 2001, p. 692 and the magnetic field of Mars has largely disappeared, probably due to ...  loss of core heat, solidification of most of the core, and/or changes in the mantle convection regime.  Results from the NASA  |MAVEN|Maven|  mission show that the atmosphere is removed primarily due to  |Coronal_Mass_Ejection|Coronal_Mass_Ejection|  events, where outbursts of high-velocity protons from the sun impact the atmosphere. Mars does still retain a limited  |magnetosphere|Magnetosphere|  that covers approximately 40% of its surface. Rather than uniformly covering and protecting the atmosphere from solar wind, however, the magnetic field takes the form of a collection of smaller, umbrella-shaped fields, mainly clustered together around the planets southern hemisphere. Solar Wind, 2008     Finally, between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago,  |asteroid|Asteroid|  impacts during the  |Late_Heavy_Bombardment|Late_Heavy_Bombardment|  caused significant changes to the surface environment of objects in the Solar System. The low  |gravity|Gravity|  of Mars suggests that these impacts could have ejected much of the Martian atmosphere into deep space. Forget, Costard & amp; Lognonné 2007, pp. 80.     Terraforming Mars would entail two major interlaced changes: building the atmosphere and heating it. Faure & amp; Mensing 2007, p. 252. A thicker atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  would trap incoming  |solar_radiation|Solar_Radiation| . Because the raised temperature would add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the two processes would augment each other.  Carbon dioxide alone would not suffice to sustain a temperature above the freezing point of water, so a mixture of specialized greenhouse molecules might be manufactured.              Terraforming  |Venus|Venus|  requires two major changes; removing most of the planets dense  carbon dioxide atmosphere and reducing the planets  surface temperature.   These goals are closely interrelated, because Venuss extreme temperature is thought to be due to the  |greenhouse_effect|Greenhouse_Effect|  caused by its dense atmosphere. Sequestering the atmospheric carbon would likely solve the temperature problem as well.              Although the gravity on Earths  |moon|Moon|  is too low to hold an atmosphere for geological spans of time, if given an atmosphere, it would retain the atmosphere for spans of time that are long compared to human lifespans. Landis Landis, Geoffrey Air Pollution on the Moon, Analog, June. and others Benford, Greg , Slate, July 14. Retrieved 30 January 2017 Williams, Matt , Universe Today, 31 March. Retrieved 30 January 2017 have thus proposed that it could be feasible to terraform the moon, although not all agree with that proposal. Dorminey, Bruce , Forbes, July 27. Retrieved 30 January 2017 Landis estimates that a 1 PSI atmosphere of pure oxygen on the moon would require on the order of two hundred trillion tons of oxygen, and suggests it could be produced by reducing the oxygen from an amount of lunar rock equivalent to a cube about fifty kilometers on an edge. Alternatively, he suggests that the water content of fifty to a hundred comets the size of Halleys comet would do the job, assuming that the water doesnt splash away when the comets hit the moon. Likewise, Benford calculates that terraforming the moon would require about 100 comets the size of Halleys.       It has been recently proposed that due to the effects of  |Climate_change|Global_Warming| , an interventionist program might be designed to return  |Earth|Earth|  to its usual and more benign climate parameters. In order to achieve this, multiple solutions have been proposed, such as the management of  |solar_radiation|Solar_Radiation_Management| , the sequestration of carbon dioxide using  |geoengineering|Climate_Engineering|  methods and the design and release of climate altering  |genetically_engineered|Genetically_Modified_Organism|  organisms.              Other possible candidates for terraforming include  |Titan|Titan| ,  |Callisto|Callisto| ,  |Ganymede|Ganymede| ,  |Europa|Europa| , and even  |Mercury|Mercury| , Saturns moon  |Enceladus|Enceladus| , and the dwarf planet  |Ceres|Ceres| .                Many proposals for planetary engineering involve the use of genetically engineered bacteria.       As  |synthetic_biology|Synthetic_Biology|  matures over the coming decades it may become possible to build designer organisms from scratch that directly manufacture desired products efficiently.  Lisa Nip, Ph.D. candidate at the  |MIT_Media_Labs|Mit_Media_Lab|  Molecular Machines group, said that by synthetic biology, scientists could genetically engineer humans, plants and bacteria to create Earth-like conditions on another planet.       Gary King, microbiologist at  |Louisiana_State_University|Louisiana_State_University|  studying the most extreme organisms on Earth, notes that synthetic biology has given us a remarkable toolkit that can be used to manufacture new kinds of organisms specially suited for the systems we want to plan for and outlines the prospects for terraforming, saying well want to investigate our chosen microbes, find the genes that code for the survival and terraforming properties that we want , and then use that knowledge to genetically engineer specifically Martian-designed microbes . He sees the projects biggest bottleneck in the ability to genetically tweak and tailor the right microbes, estimating that this hurdle could take a decade or more to be solved . He also notes that it would be best to develop not a single kind microbe but a suite of several that work together .       |DARPA|Darpa|  is researching using photosynthesizing plants, bacteria, and algae grown directly on the Mars surface that could warm up and thicken its atmosphere. In 2015 the agency and some of its research partners have created a software called  |DTA_GView|Dta_Gview|  − a  |Google_Maps|Google_Maps|  of  |genomes|Genome| , in which genomes of several organisms can be pulled up on the program to immediately show a list of known genes and where they are located in the genome. According to Alicia Jackson, deputy director of  |DARPAs_Biological_Technologies_Office|Biological_Technologies_Office|  by this they have developed a technological toolkit to transform not just hostile places here on Earth, but to go into space not just to visit, but to stay .           Also known as the worldhouse concept, paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which encompasses most of the planets usable area. Taylor, 1992 The enclosure would consist of a transparent roof held one or more kilometers above the surface, pressurized with a breathable atmosphere, and anchored with tension towers and cables at regular intervals. The worldhouse concept is similar to the concept of a domed habitat, but one which covers all of the planet.       It has also been suggested that instead of or in addition to terraforming a hostile environment humans might adapt to these places by the use of  |genetic_engineering|Genetic_Engineering| ,  |biotechnology|Biotechnology|  and  |cybernetic_enhancements|Cyborg| .                        There is a philosophical debate within  |biology|Biology|  and  |ecology|Ecology|  as to whether terraforming other worlds is an  |ethical|Ethics|  endeavor. From the point of view of a  |cosmocentric_ethic|Cosmocentric_Ethic| , this involves balancing the need for the preservation of human life against the intrinsic value of existing planetary ecologies. MacNiven 1995     On the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like  |Robert_Zubrin|Robert_Zubrin| ,  |Martyn_J_Fogg|Martyn_J_Fogg| , Richard L. S. Taylor and the late  |Carl_Sagan|Carl_Sagan|  who believe that it is humanitys moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for  |life|Life| , as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. Robert Zubrin,  The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must , pp. 248–249, Simon & Schuster/Touchstone, 1996,  Fogg 2000 They also point out that  |Earth_would_eventually_be_destroyed_if_nature_takes_its_course|Future_Of_The_Earth| , so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become  |extinct|Extinction| . Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life.     The opposing argument posits that terraforming would be an unethical interference in  |nature|Nature| , and that given humanitys past treatment of Earth, other planets may be better off without human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as  |Christopher_McKay|Christopher_Mckay| , who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the  |alien_life|Extraterrestrial_Life|  and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Christopher McKay and Robert Zubrin, Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration? , pp. 177–182, in On to Mars: Colonizing a New World, Apogee Books Space Series, 2002,  Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.       The initial cost of such projects as planetary terraforming would be gargantuan, and the infrastructure of such an enterprise would have to be built from scratch. Such  |technology|Technology|  is not yet developed, let alone financially feasible at the moment. John Hickman has pointed out that almost none of the current schemes for terraforming incorporate  |economic_strategies|Economy| , and most of their models and expectations seem highly optimistic.           National pride, rivalries between nations, and the politics of  |public_relations|Public_Relations|  have in the past been the primary motivations for shaping space projects.  Thompson 2001 p. 108 It is reasonable to assume that these factors would also be present in planetary terraforming efforts.          Terraforming is a common concept in  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction| , ranging from  |television|Science_Fiction_Television| ,  |movies|Science_Fiction_Film|  and  |novels|Science_Fiction_Novels|  to  |video_games|Video_Games| .
