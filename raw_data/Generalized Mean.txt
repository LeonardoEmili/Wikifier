In mathematics, generalized means are a family of functions for aggregating sets of numbers, that include as special cases the  |Pythagorean_means|Pythagorean_Means|  . The generalized mean is also known as power mean or Hölder mean .       If p is a non-zero  |real_number|Real_Number| , and x1,  are  |positive_real_numbers|Positive_Real_Numbers| , then the generalized mean or power mean with exponent p of these positive real numbers is:     : Mp   .     . For  we set it equal to the geometric mean :     : M0       Furthermore, for a sequence of positive weights w i  with sum   wi 1 we define the weighted power mean as:     :     Mp &       M0 &   xi         The unweighted means correspond to setting all .               :     :          Each generalized mean always lies between the smallest and largest of the x values.   Each generalized mean is a symmetric function of its arguments; permuting the arguments of a generalized mean does not change its value.   Like most  |means|Meanproperties| , the generalized mean is a  |homogeneous_function|Homogeneous_Function|  of its arguments x 1 , ..., x n . That is, if b is a positive real number, then the generalized mean with exponent p of the numbers b  x1,  b  xn is equal to b times the generalized mean of the numbers x 1 , …, x n .   Like the  |quasi-arithmetic_means|Quasi-Arithmetic_Mean| , the computation of the mean can be split into computations of equal sized sub-blocks. This enables use of a  |divide_and_conquer_algorithm|Divide_And_Conquer_Algorithm|  to calculate the means, when desirable.   : Mp Mp        In general,   : if p  .
