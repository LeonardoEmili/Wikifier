A lateral is a  |consonant|Consonant|  in which the  |airstream|Airstream_Mechanism|  proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. An example of a lateral consonant is the  |English|English_Language|  L, as in Larry.     For the most common laterals, the tip of the tongue makes contact with the upper teeth  or the upper gum , but there are many other possible places for laterals to be made. The most common laterals are  |approximants|Approximant|  and belong to the class of  |liquids|Liquid_Consonant| , but lateral  |fricatives|Fricative_Consonant|  and  |affricates|Affricate_Consonant|  are also common in some parts of the world. Some languages, such as the  |Iwaidja|Iwaidja_Language|  and  |Ilgar|Ilgar_Language|  languages of  |Australia|Australia| , have  |lateral_flaps|Lateral_Flap| , and others, such as the  |Xhosa|Xhosa_Language|  and  |Zulu|Zulu_Language|  languages of  |Africa|Africa| , have  |lateral_clicks|Lateral_Click| .     When pronouncing the  |labiodental|Labiodental_Consonant|  fricatives , the lip blocks the airflow in the centre of the vocal tract, so the airstream proceeds along the sides instead. Nevertheless, they are not considered lateral consonants because the airflow never goes over the tongue. No known language makes a distinction between lateral and non-lateral labiodentals.  |Plosives|Plosive_Consonant|  are never lateral, but they may have  |lateral_release|Lateral_Release| .  |Nasals|Nasal_Consonant|  are never lateral either, but some languages have  |lateral_nasal_clicks|Lateral_Nasal_Click| . For consonants articulated in the throat , the lateral distinction is not made by any language, although pharyngeal and epiglottal laterals are reportedly possible.         English has one lateral phoneme: the lateral approximant , which in many accents has two  |allophones|Allophone| . One, found before vowels as in lady or fly, is called clear l, pronounced as the  |alveolar_lateral_approximant|Alveolar_Lateral_Approximant|   with a neutral position of the body of the tongue. The other variant, so-called dark l, found before consonants or word-finally, as in bold or tell, is pronounced as the  |velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant|Velarized_Alveolar_Lateral_Approximant|   with the tongue assuming a spoon-like shape with its back part raised, which gives the sound a - or -like resonance. In some languages, like  |Albanian|Albanian_Language| , those two sounds are different phonemes.  |East_Slavic_languages|East_Slavic_Languages|  contrast  and  but do not have     In many British accents , dark  may undergo  |vocalization|L-Vocalization|  through the reduction and loss of contact between the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge, becoming a rounded back vowel or glide. This process turns tell into something like , as must have happened with talk  or walk  at some stage. A similar process happened during the development of many other languages, including  |Brazilian_Portuguese|Brazilian_Portuguese| ,  |Old_French|Old_French| , and  |Polish|Polish_Language| , in all three of these resulting in  |voiced_velar_approximant|Voiced_Velar_Approximant|   or  |voiced_labio-velar_approximant|Voiced_Labio-Velar_Approximant|  , whence  |Modern_French|Modern_French|  sauce as compared with  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  salsa, or Polish Wisła  as compared with English  Vistula .     In central and Venice dialects of  |Venetian|Venetian_Language| , intervocalic  has turned into a semivocalic , so that the written word ła bała is pronounced . The orthography uses the letter  |ł|Ł|  to represent this phoneme .     Many aboriginal  |Australian_languages|Australian_Languages|  have a series of three or four lateral approximants, as do various dialects of  |Irish|Irish_Language| . Rarer lateral consonants include the retroflex laterals that can be found in many  |languages_of_India|Languages_Of_India|  and in some  |Swedish_dialects|Swedish_Dialects| , and the  |voiceless_alveolar_lateral_fricative|Voiceless_Alveolar_Lateral_Fricative|  , found in many  |Native_North_American_languages|Indigenous_Languages_Of_The_Americas| ,  |Welsh|Welsh_Phonology|  and  |Zulu|Zulu_Language| . In  |Adyghe|Adyghe_Language|  and some  |Athabaskan_languages|Athabaskan_Languages|  like  |Hän|Hän_Language| , both voiceless and voiced alveolar lateral fricatives occur, but there is no approximant. Many of these languages also have lateral  |affricates|Affricate| . Some languages have palatal or velar voiceless lateral fricatives or affricates, such as  |Dahalo|Dahalo_Language|  and  |Zulu|Zulu_Language| , but the IPA has no symbols for such sounds. However, appropriate symbols are easy to make by adding a lateral-fricative belt to the symbol for the corresponding lateral approximant . Also, a devoicing diacritic may be added to the approximant.     Nearly all languages with such lateral obstruents also have the approximant. However, there are a number of exceptions, many of them located in the  |Pacific_Northwest|Pacific_Northwest|  area of the United States. For example,  |Tlingit|Tlingit_Language|  has  but no . Other examples from the same area include  |Nuu-chah-nulth|Nuu-Chah-Nulth_Language|  and  |Kutenai|Kutenai_Language| , and elsewhere,  |Chukchi|Chukchi_Language|  and  |Kabardian|Kabardian_Language| .      |Standard_Tibetan|Standard_Tibetan|  has a  |voiceless_lateral_approximant|Voiceless_Lateral_Approximant| , usually romanized as lh, as in the name  |Lhasa|Lhasa| .     A  |uvular_lateral_approximant|Uvular_Lateral_Approximant|  has been reported to occur in some speakers of  |American_English|American_English| .       |Pashto|Pashto_Language|  has a  |retroflex_lateral_flap|Retroflex_Lateral_Flap| .     There are a large number of lateral  |click_consonants|Click_Consonant| ; 17 occur in  |!Xóõ|!Xóõ| .     Lateral  |trills|Trill_Consonant|  are also possible, but they do not occur in any known language. They may be pronounced by initiating  or  with an especially forceful airflow. There is no symbol for them in the IPA. They are sometimes used to imitate  |bird_calls|Bird_Call| , and they are a component of  |Donald_Duck_talk|Donald_Duck_Talk| .            |Dental_lateral_approximant|Dental_Lateral_Approximant| |Voiced_alveolar_lateral_approximant|Alveolar_Lateral_Approximant| |Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_approximant|Voiceless_Alveolar_Lateral_Approximant| |Retroflex_lateral_approximant|Retroflex_Lateral_Approximant| |Voiced_palatal_lateral_approximant|Palatal_Lateral_Approximant| |Voiceless_palatal_lateral_approximant|Voiceless_Palatal_Lateral_Approximant| |Velar_lateral_approximant|Velar_Lateral_Approximant| |Uvular_lateral_approximant|Uvular_Lateral_Approximant| |Voiceless_dental_lateral_fricative|Voiceless_Dental_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiced_dental_lateral_fricative|Voiced_Dental_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_fricative|Voiceless_Alveolar_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiced_alveolar_lateral_fricative|Voiced_Alveolar_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiceless_retroflex_lateral_fricative|Voiceless_Retroflex_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiced_retroflex_lateral_fricative|Voiced_Retroflex_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiceless_palatal_lateral_fricative|Voiceless_Palatal_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiced_palatal_lateral_fricative|Voiced_Palatal_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiceless_velar_lateral_fricative|Voiceless_Velar_Lateral_Fricative| |Voiced_velar_lateral_fricative|Voiced_Velar_Lateral_Fricative|        Only the alveolar lateral fricatives have dedicated letters in the IPA. However, others appear in the  |extIPA|Extipa| .        |Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_affricate|Voiceless_Alveolar_Lateral_Affricate| |Voiced_alveolar_lateral_affricate|Voiced_Alveolar_Lateral_Affricate| |Voiceless_palatal_lateral_affricate|Voiceless_Palatal_Lateral_Affricate| |Voiced_palatal_lateral_affricate|Voiced_Palatal_Lateral_Affricate| |Voiceless_velar_lateral_affricate|Voiceless_Velar_Lateral_Affricate| |Voiced_velar_lateral_affricate|Voiced_Velar_Lateral_Affricate| |Alveolar_lateral_flap|Alveolar_Lateral_Flap| |Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_flap|Voiceless_Alveolar_Lateral_Flap| |Retroflex_lateral_flap|Retroflex_Lateral_Flap| |Voiceless_retroflex_lateral_flap|Voiceless_Retroflex_Lateral_Flap| |Palatal_lateral_flap|Palatal_Lateral_Flap| |Velar_lateral_flap|Velar_Lateral_Flap| |Alveolar_lateral_ejective_fricative|Alveolar_Lateral_Ejective_Fricative| |Alveolar_lateral_ejective_affricate|Alveolar_Lateral_Ejective_Affricate| |Palatal_lateral_ejective_affricate|Palatal_Lateral_Ejective_Affricate| |Velar_lateral_ejective_affricate|Velar_Lateral_Ejective_Affricate| |Alveolar_lateral_clicks|Alveolar_Lateral_Click|  , , , etc.        The IPA requires sounds to be defined as to centrality, as either central or lateral. However, languages may be ambiguous as to some consonants laterality. A well-known example is the liquid consonant in Japanese, represented in common transliteration systems as , which can be recognized as a  |alveolar_tap|Alveolar_Tap| , Okada, Hideo , Japanese , in International Phonetic Association, Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet, Cambridge University Press, pp. 117–119, .  |alveolar_lateral_flap|Alveolar_Lateral_Flap| ,  |alveolar_lateral_approximant|Alveolar_Lateral_Approximant| ,  |alveolar_approximant|Alveolar_Approximant| ,  |voiced_retroflex_stop|Voiced_Retroflex_Stop| , Arai, Takayuki; Warner, Natasha; Greenberg, Steven , Analysis of spontaneous Japanese in a multi-language telephone-speech corpus , Acoustical Science and Technology, 28 : 46–48,  and various less common forms.       A superscript  is defined as  |lateral_release|Lateral_Release| .     Consonants may also be pronounced with simultaneous lateral and central airflow. This is well-known from speech pathology with a  |lateral_lisp|Lateral_Lisp| . However, it also occurs in nondisordered speech in some southern  |Arabic_dialects|Arabic_Dialects|  and possibly some  |Modern_South_Arabian_languages|Modern_South_Arabian_Languages| , which have pharyngealized nonsibilant  and   and possibly a sibilant  . Examples are  pain in the dialect of  |Al-Rubuah|Al-Rubuah|  and  back and  hyena in  |Rijal_Alma|Rijal_Alma| . Heselwood Phonetic transcription in theory and practice, p 122–123      |Old_Arabic|Old_Arabic|  has been analyzed as having the emphatic central–lateral fricatives ,  and .
