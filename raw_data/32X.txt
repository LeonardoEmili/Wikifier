           The 32X is an  |add-on|Video_Game_Accessory|  for the  |Sega_Genesis|Sega_Genesis| |video_game_console|Video_Game_Console| . Codenamed Project Mars , the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the  |32-bit_era|History_Of_Video_Game_Consoles|  until the release of the  |Sega_Saturn|Sega_Saturn| . Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own  |ROM_cartridges|Rom_Cartridge|  and has its own  |library_of_games|List_Of_Sega_32X_Games| . The add-on was distributed under the name   in Japan, Genesis 32X in North America, Mega Drive 32X in the  |PAL|Pal|  region, and Mega 32X in Brazil.     Unveiled by  |Sega|Sega|  at June 1994s  |Consumer_Electronics_Show|Consumer_Electronics_Show| , the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the  |Atari_Jaguar|Atari_Jaguar|  and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful. The final design contained two 32-bit  |central_processing_units|Central_Processing_Units|  and a 3D  graphics processor. To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party  |video_game_developers|Video_Game_Developer|  and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturns simultaneous release in Japan. Segas efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-ons hardware, including Genesis  |ports|Porting| . Sega produced 800,000 units of the 32X and managed to sell an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994, selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.     The 32X is considered a  |commercial_failure|List_Of_Commercial_Failures_In_Video_Gaming| . Reception after the add-ons unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.       The  |Sega_Genesis|Sega_Genesis| , initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Segas entry into the  |16-bit_era|History_Of_Video_Game_Consoles|  of video game consoles.  The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.     Although the earlier release of the  |Sega_CD|Sega_Cd|  add-on had been commercially disappointing,   Sega began to develop a  |stop-gap|Improvisation|  solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the  |Sega_Saturn|Sega_Saturn| , serving as a less expensive entry into the  |32-bit_era|History_Of_Video_Game_Consoles| .  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama and broadly supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the  |64-bit|64-Bit| |Atari_Jaguar|Atari_Jaguar| . As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.       During the Winter  |Consumer_Electronics_Show|Consumer_Electronics_Show|  in January 1994, Sega of America  |research_and_development|Research_And_Development|  head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar. Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as Project Jupiter , an entirely new independent console. Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited  |3D|3D_Computer_Graphics|  capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the  |Sega_Virtua_Processor|Sega_Genesissega_Virtua_Processor|  chip. Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, Oh, thats just a horrible idea. If all youre going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on. If its a new system with legitimate new software, great. But if the only thing it does is double the colors.... Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. This would come in the form of an add-on. From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed Project Mars , was advanced.     At the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit  |SuperH|Superh| -2 processors.  The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company  |Hitachi|Hitachi| .  The original design for the 32X add-on, according to Bayless, was created on a cocktail napkin,  but Miller insists that this was not the case. At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.     Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games. This was justified by Segas statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.  Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it a coders dream for the day with its twin processors and 3D capabilities. Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Satos team at Sega of Japan. Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.     Before the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32Xs target launch date in North America. Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturns Japan release occurring simultaneously. Their answer was to call the 32X a transitional device between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, ankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers.          The unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago. Promoted as the poor mans entry into next generation games , 32X was marketed for its  |US$|United_States_Dollar| 159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn. However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software. Founder of  |The_3DO_Company|The_3Do_Company| ,  |Trip_Hawkins|Trip_Hawkins| , was willing to point out that it would not, stating, Everyone knows that 32X is a  |Band-Aid|Band-Aid| . Its not a next generation system. Its fairly expensive. Its not particularly high-performance. Its hard to program for, and its not compatible with the Saturn. In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.     In August of that year,  GamePro  highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or  |PlayStation|Playstation|  systems and games from Japan. For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in 94.  In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.     The 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the  |holiday_season|Christmas_Holiday_Season|  that year. As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up with orders for the new system. Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturns price would be at launch. Despite Segas initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including  Doom ,  Star Wars Arcade ,  Virtua Racing Deluxe , and  Cosmic Carnage . Although Virtua Racing was considered a strong title, Cosmic Carnage looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it.  Games were available at a retail price of $69.95. Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an  |arcade|Arcade_Game|  system . Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, at a cost of  |JP¥|Japanese_Yen| 16,800.  The systems PAL release came in January 1995, at a price of  |GB£|Pound_Sterling| 169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.       Despite the lower price consoles positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing  |third-party_developers|Third-Party_Developer|  to create games for the new system. Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn,  |Nintendo_64|Nintendo_64| , and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz. Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was a technological dead-end , many developers decided not to make games for the system. Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X. According to Bayless, games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of.     Journalists were similarly concerned about Segas tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Segas approach to that of  |General_Motors|General_Motors|  and segmenting the market for its consoles.  In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco|  for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.      Though the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared. Over the first three months of 1995, several of the 32Xs third party publishers, including  |Capcom|Capcom|  and  |Konami|Konami| , cancelled their 32X projects so that they could focus on producing games for the Saturn and PlayStation.  The 32X failed to catch on with the public, and is considered a  |commercial_failure|List_Of_Commercial_Failures_In_Video_Gaming| . By 1995, the Genesis had still not proven successful in Japan, where it was known as Mega Drive, and the Saturn was beating the PlayStation, so Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to force Sega of America to focus on the Saturn and cut support for Genesis products, executing a surprise early launch of the Saturn in the early summer of 1995. Sega was supporting five different consoles before this—Saturn, Genesis,  |Game_Gear|Game_Gear| ,  |Pico|Sega_Pico| , and the  |Master_System|Master_System| —as well as the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons.  Sales estimates for the 32X stood at 665,000 units at the end of 1994.  Despite assurances from Sega that many games would be developed for the system, in early 1996, Sega finally conceded that it had promised too much out of the add-on and decided to discontinue the 32X in order to focus on the Saturn. In September 1995, the retail price for the 32X dropped to $99,  and later the remaining inventory was cleared out of stores at $19.95, with 800,000 units sold in total.        The Sega Neptune is an unproduced two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega planned to release in fall 1995, with the retail price planned to be something less than US$200.  Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced too close to the Saturn to be a viable competitor.   Electronic Gaming Monthly  used the Sega Neptune as an  |April_Fools_Day|April_Fools_Day|  prank in its  |April_2001_issue|Egm_April_Fools_Jokes2001| . The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for $199.           The 32X can be used only in conjunction with a Genesis system. It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge. The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis. As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons. The 32X also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the  |Sega_Genesis_CDX|Sega_Genesisfirst-Party_Models|  system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of  |electric_shock|Electric_Shock|  when the 32X and CDX were connected.  Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis cartridge slot.      Seated on top of a Genesis, the 32X measures . The 32X contains two Hitachi SH2 32-bit  |RISC|Reduced_Instruction_Set_Computing|  processors with a clock speed of 23  |MHz|Hertz| ,  which Sega claimed would allow the system to work 40 times faster than a stand-alone Genesis. Its  |graphics_processing_unit|Graphics_Processing_Unit|  is capable of producing 32,768 colors and rendering 50,000  |polygons|Polygon|  per second, which provides a noticeable improvement over the polygon rendering of the Genesis. The 32X also includes 256  |kilobytes|Kilobytes|  of  |random-access_memory|Random-Access_Memory|  , along with 256 kilobytes of  |video_RAM|Vram| . Sound is supplied through a  |pulse-width_modulation|Pulse-Width_Modulation|  sound source.  |Input/output|Input/Output|  is supplied to a television set via a provided  |A/V|Audiovisual|  cable that supplies  |composite_video|Composite_Video|  and  |stereo|Stereo|  audio, or through an  |RF_modulator|Rf_Modulator| . Stereo audio can also be played through  |headphones|Headphones|  via a  |headphone_jack|Headphone_Jack|  on the attached Genesis.             The 32Xs game library consists of forty  titles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD. Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade games  After Burner ,  Space Harrier , and Star Wars Arcade, a  |sidescroller|Side-Scrolling_Video_Game|  with a  |hummingbird|Hummingbird|  as a main character in  Kolibri , and a 32X-exclusive game in the  |Sonic_the_Hedgehog_series|Sonic_The_Hedgehog|  titled  Knuckles Chaotix . Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced  |ports|Porting|  of Genesis games, including  NFL Quarterback Club  and  World Series Baseball 95 .  In a retrospective review of the console, Star Wars Arcade was considered the best game for the 32X by  IGN  for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of  Star Wars .  In a separate review, IGN s Buchanan praised the 32X title  Shadow Squadron  as superior to Star Wars Arcade. See   Retro Gamer  writer Damien McFerran, however, praised  Virtua Fighter  as the jewel in the 32Xs crown , cf.  and  GamesRadar+  named Knuckles Chaotix as the best game for the system.  Next Generation  called Virtua Fighter the colorful wreath on 32Xs coffin , reflecting the consensus among contemporary critics that the game was at once arguably the 32Xs best release and a clear harbinger of the platforms imminent discontinuation, since it was clearly inferior to the Saturn versions of  Virtua Fighter Remix  and  Virtua Fighter 2  .    In response to fan inquiries, Sega stated that the 32X architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of Virtua Fighter 2.      Although the console used 32-bit processing and was capable of better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did not take advantage of its hardware.  Doom  for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch,     but was later criticized for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the  |PC|Personal_Computer|  and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, jerky movement, and running within a  |window|Window|  on the screen.   Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32Xs launch; former Sega of America  |executive_producer|Executive_Producer|  Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title Cosmic Carnage, We were rushed. We had to get games out for the 32X and it was going to be such a close cycle. When Cosmic Carnage showed up, we didnt even want to ship it. It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title. Likewise with Doom,  |id_Softwares|Id_Software|  John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32Xs launch and had to trim out a third of the games levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time. Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: I wont lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered.           Initial reception to the 32X and its games upon the launch of the add-on was very positive. Four reviewers from  Electronic Gaming Monthly  scored the add-on 8, 7, 8, and 8 out of 10 in their 1995 Buyers Guide, highlighting the add-ons enhancements to the Genesis but questioning how long the system would be supported.   GamePro  commented that the 32Xs multiple input and power cords make it as complicated as setting up your  |VCR|Vcr|  and noted some performance glitches with the prototype such as  |freezes|Freeze|  and overheating, but expressed confidence that the production models would perform well and gave the add-on their overall approval.  Reviews of its launch titles, such as Doom, were likewise positive. By late 1995, feedback to the add-on had soured. In its 1996 Buyers Guide, Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers scored the add-on 3, 3, 3, and 2 out of 10, criticizing the game library and Segas abandonment of the system in favor of the Saturn. A review in Next Generation panned the 32X for its weak polygon processing, the tendency of developers to show off its capabilities with garishly colored games, and its apparent function as simply a way of grabbing extra 1994 mind and market share while waiting for Saturn . The review gave it one out of five stars.     Retrospectively, the 32X is widely criticized as having been under-supported and a poor idea in the wake of the release of the Sega Saturn.  |1UP.com|1Up.Com| s Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X tainted just about everything it touched. GamesRadar+ also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself.  Retro Gamer s Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-ons price point, stating, If you didnt have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; its just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness. Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. According to Buchanan, I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one.     In particular, the consoles status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Segas video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers.  |Allgame|Allgame|  s Scott Alan Marriott states that ery add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales. GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. According to reviewer Blake Snow, Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if you were one of the unlucky souls who completely bought into Segas add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog. Writing for GamesRadar+, Reparaz noted that developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldnt split their user base with pricey add-ons. Reparaz went on to criticize Segas decision to release the 32X, noting that ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out. Writing for IGN, Buchanan points out, Notice that we havent seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And thats a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience.     Former executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X. Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the  |Kinect|Kinect|  and  |PlayStation_Move|Playstation_Move|.
