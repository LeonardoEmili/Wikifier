The climate is maritime, wet, with moderate winters and cool summers.  |Oil_shale|Oil_Shale|  and  |limestone|Limestone|  deposits, along with  |forests|Forest|  which cover 47% of the land, play key economic roles in this generally resource-poor country. Estonia boasts over 1,500  |lakes|Lake| , numerous  |bogs|Bog| , and 3,794 kilometers of  |coastline|Coastline|  marked by numerous bays, straits, and inlets.  |Tallinns|Tallinn| |Muuga_port|Port_Of_Muuga|  offers one of Europes finest  |warm-water_harbor|Ice-Free_Port|  facilities.     Estonias strategic location has precipitated many wars that were fought on its territory between other rival powers at its expense. In 1944, under  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  occupation, the  |Jaanilinn|Ivangorod|  and  |Petseri|Pechory|  regions were annexed to  |Russian_SFSR|Russian_Sfsr|  territory. The legal status of these territories has not been fully settled yet, though neither Estonia or Russia has not any territorial claims.                  Estonia is a flat country covering . Estonia has a long, shallow coastline  along the Baltic Sea, with 2222  islands dotting the shore. The two largest islands are  |Saaremaa|Saaremaa|  , at , and Hiiumaa, at . The two islands are favorite Estonian vacation spots. The countrys highest point, Suur Munamägi , is in the hilly southeast and reaches  above sea level. Estonia is covered by about  of forest. Arable land amounts to about . Meadows cover about , and pastureland covers about . There are more than 1,400 natural and artificial lakes in Estonia. The largest of them,  |Lake_Peipus|Lake_Peipus|  , forms much of the border between Estonia and Russia. Located in central Estonia,  |Võrtsjärv|Võrtsjärv|  is the second-largest lake . The  |Narva|Narva_River|  and  |Emajõgi|Emajõgi|  are among the most important of the countrys many rivers.     A small, recent cluster of meteorite craters, the largest of which is called  |Kaali|Kaali_Crater|  are found near  |Saaremaa|Saaremaa| , Estonia. It is thought that the impact was witnessed by the Iron Age inhabitants of the area.     Estonia has a temperate climate, with four seasons of near-equal length. Average temperatures range from  on the Baltic islands to  inland in July, the warmest month, and from  on the Baltic islands to  inland in February, the coldest month. Precipitation averages  per year and is heaviest in late summer.     Estonias land border with Latvia runs ;  |the_Russian_border|Estonia-Russia_Border|  runs . From 1920 to 1945, Estonias border with Russia, set by the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty, extended beyond the Narva River in the northeast and beyond the town of  |Petseri|Petseri|  in the southeast. This territory, amounting to some , was incorporated into Russia by  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  at the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .            There live 65 different species of mammals in the Estonian forests. There are an estimated 700 brown bears, over 150 wolves, 400 lynxes, 14,000–16,000 beavers, 3,400 wild boars, 10,000–11,000 moose and 120,000–130,000 deer. There are also red deer and other wild animals.             One of the most burdensome legacies of the  |Soviet_era|History_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  is widespread environmental pollution. Auer, M.R., Raukas, A. . Determinants of environmental cleanup in Estonia. Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, 20: 679–698. The worst offender in this regard was the Soviet army. Across military installations covering more than 800  km² of Estonian territory, the army dumped hundreds of thousands of tons of jet fuel into the ground, improperly disposed of toxic chemicals, and discarded outdated explosives and weapons in coastal and inland waters. In the 1990s, during the armys withdrawal from Estonia, extensive damage was done to discarded buildings and equipment. In October 1993, the Estonian Ministry of Environment issued a preliminary report summing up part of the degradation it had surveyed thus far. The report described the worst damage as having been done to Estonias topsoil and underground water supply by the systematic dumping of jet fuel at six Soviet army air bases. At the air base near Tapa, site of the worst damage, officials estimated that six square kilometers of land were covered by a layer of fuel; 11 square kilometers of underground water were said to be contaminated. The water in the surrounding area was undrinkable, and was sometimes set fire by locals to provide heat during the winter. With Danish help, Estonian crews began cleaning up the site, although they estimated the likely cost to be as much as 4 million EEK. The Ministry of Environment assigned a monetary cost of more than 10 billion EEK  to the damage to the countrys topsoil and water supply. However, the ministry was able to allocate only 5 million EEK in 1993 for cleanup operations.     In a 1992 government report to the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, Estonia detailed other major environmental concerns. For instance, for several consecutive years Estonia had led the world in the production of sulfur dioxide per capita. Nearly 75% of Estonias air pollution was reported to come from  |two_oil_shale-based_thermal_power_stations_operating_near_Narva|Narva_Power_Plants| . The  |mining_of_oil_shale|Oil_Shale_In_Estonia|  in northeastern Estonia has also left large mounds of limestone  |tailings|Tailings|  and ash dotting the region. Near the town of  |Sillamäe|Sillamäe| , site of a former uranium enrichment plant, about 1,200 tons of uranium and about 750 tons of thorium had been dumped into a reservoir on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. This was said to have caused severe health problems among area residents. In the coastal town of Paldiski, the removal of waste left by Soviet army nuclear reactors was also a major concern. The combined cost of environmental cleanup at both towns was put at more than EKR3.5 billion.     Natural hazards: flooding occurs frequently in the spring in certain areas     Environment – current issues: air polluted with sulfur dioxide from oil-shale burning power plants in northeast; however, the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have fallen steadily, the emissions of 2000 were 80% less than in 1980; the amount of unpurified wastewater discharged to water bodies in 2000 was 1/20 the level of 1980; in connection with the start-up of new water purification plants, the pollution load of wastewater decreased; Estonia has more than 1,400 natural and man-made lakes, the smaller of which in agricultural areas need to be monitored; coastal seawater is polluted in certain locations.
