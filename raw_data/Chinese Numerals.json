Multiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself , then the place ; then the next digit.     In Mandarin, the multiplier   is often used rather than   for all numbers 200 and greater with the 2 numeral . Use of both 兩  or 二  are acceptable for the number 200.

Larger than a myriad, each number is therefore four zeroes longer than the one before it, thus 10000 ×    . If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading one is omitted as per the above point. Hence :        In Taiwan, pure Arabic numerals are officially always and only grouped by thousands.  Unofficially, they are often not grouped, particularly for numbers below 100,000. Mixed Arabic-Chinese numerals are often used in order to denote myriads. This is used both officially and unofficially, and come in a variety of styles:        Interior zeroes before the unit position must be spelt explicitly. The reason for this is that trailing zeroes are often omitted as shorthand, so ambiguity occurs. One zero is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity. Where the zero is before a digit other than the units digit, the explicit zero is not ambiguous and is therefore optional, but preferred. Thus:          To construct a fraction, the ": null
