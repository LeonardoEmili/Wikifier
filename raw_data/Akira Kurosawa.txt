              Akira Kurosawa  was a Japanese film director and screenwriter, who directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.     Kurosawa entered the  |Japanese_film|Japanese_Film|  industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an  |assistant_director|Assistant_Director|  and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular  |action_film|Action_Film|   Sanshiro Sugata  . After the war, the critically acclaimed  Drunken Angel  , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor  |Toshiro_Mifune|Toshiro_Mifune|  in a starring role, cemented the directors reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.      Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the  |Golden_Lion|Golden_Lion|  at the 1951  |Venice_Film_Festival|Venice_Film_Festival| . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, including a number of highly regarded films, such as  Ikiru  ,  Seven Samurai  and  Yojimbo  . After the 1960s he became much less prolific; even so, his later work—including his final two epics,  Kagemusha  and  Ran  —continued to win awards, though more often abroad than in Japan.     In 1990, he accepted the  |Academy_Award|Academy_Awards|  for  |Lifetime_Achievement|Academy_Honorary_Award| . Posthumously, he was named  |Asian_of_the_Century|Asian_Of_The_Century|  in the Arts, Literature, and Culture category by  AsianWeek  magazine and  |CNN|Cnn| , cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media formats.           Kurosawa was born on March 23, 1910,  in  |Ōimachi|Ōimachi_Station|  in the  |Ōmori|Ōmori|  district of Tokyo. His father Isamu , a member of a  |samurai|Samurai|  family from  |Akita_Prefecture|Akita_Prefecture| , worked as the director of the Armys Physical Education Institutes  |lower_secondary_school|Secondary_Education_In_Japanmiddle_School| , while his mother Shima came from a merchants family living in  |Osaka|Osaka| .  Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.      In addition to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa was open to  |Western_traditions|Western_World|  and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six.  An important formative influence was his  |elementary_school|Elementary_Schools_In_Japan|  teacher Mr. Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general.  During this time, the boy also studied  |calligraphy|Calligraphy|  and  |Kendo|Kendo|  swordsmanship.      Another major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa, Akiras older brother by four years. In the aftermath of the  |Great_Kantō_earthquake|1923_Great_Kantō_Earthquake|  of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, encouraging Akira instead to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawas later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.       Heigo was academically gifted, but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyos foremost  |high_school|Secondary_Education_In_Japanupper_Secondary_School| , he began to detach himself from the rest of the family, preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature. In the late 1920s, Heigo became a  |benshi|Benshi|  for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films and quickly made a name for himself. Akira, who at this point planned to become a painter,  moved in with him, and the two brothers became inseparable.  With Heigos guidance, Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances,  while exhibiting his paintings and working for the left-wing Proletarian Artists League. However, he was never able to make a living with his art, and, as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas , he lost his enthusiasm for painting.      With the increasing production of  |talking_pictures|Sound_Film|  in the early 1930s, film narrators like Heigo began to lose work, and Akira moved back in with his parents. In July 1933, Heigo committed suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brothers death  and the chapter of his autobiography  that describes it—written nearly half a century after the event—is titled, A Story I Dont Want to Tell .  Only four months later, Kurosawas eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.          In 1935, the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. , advertised for assistant directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, there was no way to correct them. Kurosawas essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director  |Kajirō_Yamamoto|Kajirō_Yamamoto| , who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.       During his five years as an assistant director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but by far the most important figure in his development was Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto, many of them comedies featuring the popular actor  |Kenichi_Enomoto|Kenichi_Enomoto| , known as Enoken .  Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawas talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year.  Kurosawas responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing, and second-unit directing.  In the last of Kurosawas films as an assistant director for Yamamoto,  |Horse_|Horse| , Kurosawa took over most of the production, as his mentor was occupied with the shooting of another film.      One important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting.  Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director.  Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the film director  |Satsuo_Yamamotos|Satsuo_Yamamoto|  film,  A Triumph of Wings  . This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.        In the two years following the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, about a year after the  |Japanese_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor| , novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his  |Musashi_Miyamoto|Musashi| -inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawas initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.          Shooting of  Sanshiro Sugata  began on location in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter. The censorship office considered the work to be objectionably British-American by the standards of wartime Japan, and it was only through the intervention of director  |Yasujirō_Ozu|Yasujirō_Ozu| , who championed the film, that Sanshiro Sugata was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.       He next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in  The Most Beautiful , a propaganda film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.       During production, the actress playing the leader of the factory workers,  |Yōko_Yaguchi|Yōko_Yaguchi| , was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were constantly at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant , and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985.   They had two children, both surviving Kurosawa  |Kazuko|Kazuko_Kurosawa| , a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who became a costume designer.      Shortly before his marriage, Kurosawa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film. The often blatantly propagandistic  Sanshiro Sugata Part II , which premiered in May 1945, is generally considered one of his weakest pictures.        Kurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less expensive to produce.  The Men Who Tread on the Tigers Tail , based on the Kabuki play  Kanjinchō  and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the  |occupation_of_Japan|Occupation_Of_Japan|  had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly feudal and banned the work.  Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and democratic , so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion.       Red Beard First postwar works  No Regrets for Our Youth  , inspired by both the 1933  |Takigawa_incident|Takigawa_Incident|  and the  |Hotsumi_Ozaki|Hotsumi_Ozaki|  wartime spy case, criticized Japans prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie , who, born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme , the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the films title into a postwar  |catchphrase|Catchphrase| . ; ; ;      His next film,  One Wonderful Sunday  premiered in July 1947 to mixed reviews. It is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy, within the devastation of postwar Tokyo, their one weekly day off. The movie bears the influence of  |Frank_Capra|Frank_Capra| ,  |D_W_Griffith|D_W_Griffith|  and  |F_W_Murnau|F_W_Murnau| , each of whom was among Kurosawas favorite directors. ;   Another film released in 1947 with Kurosawas involvement was the action-adventure thriller,  Snow Trail , directed by  |Senkichi_Taniguchi|Senkichi_Taniguchi|  from Kurosawas screenplay. It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshiro Mifune. It was Kurosawa who, with his mentor Yamamoto, had intervened to persuade Toho to sign Mifune, during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kurosawa, but managed to alienate most of the other judges.          Drunken Angel  is often considered the directors first major work.  Although the script, like all of Kurosawas occupation-era works, had to go through forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster  with  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| , it was also the directors first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one  of the directors next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by  |Takashi_Shimura|Takashi_Shimura| , who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actors immense vitality, and Mifunes rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that  |Marlon_Brandos|Marlon_Brando|  defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later.  The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious  |Kinema_Junpo|Kinema_Junpo|  critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.         Kurosawa, with producer Sōjirō Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto,  |Mikio_Naruse|Mikio_Naruse|  and  |Senkichi_Taniguchi|Senkichi_Taniguchi| , formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association . For this organizations debut work, and first film for  |Daiei_studios|Kadokawa_Pictures| , Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen.  The Quiet Duel  starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with  |syphilis|Syphilis| , a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being  |typecast|Typecasting|  as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally considered one of the directors lesser achievements.         His second film of 1949, also produced by Film Art Association and released by  |Shintoho|Shintoho| , was  Stray Dog . It is a  |detective_movie|Mystery_Film|   that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective, played by Mifune, and his fixation on the recovery of his handgun, which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his,  |Georges_Simenon|Georges_Simenon| , it was the directors first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawas friend,  |Ishirō_Honda|Ishirō_Honda| , the future director of  Godzilla .    The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary  |police_procedural|Police_Procedural|  and  |buddy_cop_film|Buddy_Cop_Film|  genres.       Scandal , released by  |Shochiku|Shochiku|  in April 1950, was inspired by the directors personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese  |yellow_journalism|Yellow_Journalism| . The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. ;   ; ;  However, it would be Kurosawas second film of 1950,  Rashomon , that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.       After finishing Scandal, Kurosawa was approached by  |Daiei_studios|Kadokawa_Pictures| , which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter,  |Shinobu_Hashimoto|Shinobu_Hashimoto| , who would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on  |Ryūnosuke_Akutagawas|Ryūnosuke_Akutagawa|  experimental short story  |In_a_Grove|In_A_Grove|  , which recounts the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimotos help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.      The shooting of Rashomon began on July 7, 1950, and, after extensive location work in the primeval forest of  |Nara|Nara_Nara| , wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyos Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.           Kurosawas next film, for Shochiku, was  The Idiot , an adaptation of the novel by the directors favorite writer,  |Fyodor_Dostoyevsky|Fyodor_Dostoyevsky| . The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to  |Hokkaido|Hokkaido| , but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawas original cut of 265 minutes to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. The severely edited film version is widely considered today to be one of the directors least successful works and the original full length version no longer exists. Contemporary reviews of the much shortened edited version were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars,  |Setsuko_Hara|Setsuko_Hara| .         Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Kurosawa, Rashomon had been entered in the prestigious  |Venice_Film_Festival|Venice_Film_Festival| , due to the efforts of  |Giuliana_Stramigioli|Giuliana_Stramigioli| , a Japan-based representative of an Italian film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, Rashomon was awarded the festivals highest prize, the  |Golden_Lion|Golden_Lion| , shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japans decades-old cinematic tradition.      After Daiei very briefly exhibited a subtitled print of the film in Los Angeles,  |RKO|Rko_Pictures|  purchased distribution rights to Rashomon in the United States. The company was taking a considerable gamble. It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market, and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been  |Mikio_Naruses|Mikio_Naruse|  comedy, Wife! Be Like a Rose, in 1937: a critical and box-office flop. However, Rashomons commercial run, greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist  |Ed_Sullivan|Ed_Sullivan| , was very successful.     This success in turn led to a vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for  |Italian_neorealist|Italian_Neorealism|  cinema.  For example, by the end of 1952 Rashomon was released in Japan, the United States, and most of Europe. Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi  and, somewhat later, Yasujirō Ozu —artists highly respected in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West.  Kurosawas growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from  |Kon_Ichikawa|Kon_Ichikawa| ,  |Masaki_Kobayashi|Masaki_Kobayashi| ,  |Nagisa_Oshima|Nagisa_Oshima|  and  |Shohei_Imamura|Shohei_Imamura|  to  |Juzo_Itami|Juzo_Itami| ,  |Takeshi_Kitano|Takeshi_Kitano|  and  |Takashi_Miike|Takashi_Miike| .     His career boosted by his sudden international fame, Kurosawa, now reunited with his original film studio, Toho , set to work on his next project,  Ikiru . The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write 12 Kurosawa films. Despite the works grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of  |Brecht|Berthold_Brecht| , to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. Ikiru opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo Best Film award—and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artists films set in the modern era.        In December 1952, Kurosawa took his Ikiru screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded residence at an inn to create the screenplay for his next movie,  Seven Samurai . The  |ensemble|Ensemble_Cast|  work was Kurosawas first proper  |samurai_film|Samurai_Cinema| , the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in  |Sengoku_period|Sengoku_Period|  Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.      Three months were spent in pre-production and a month in rehearsals. Shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year, interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kurosawas health problems. The film finally opened in April 1954, half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget, making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made. . The film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit, quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could, and did, market internationally—though with extensive edits. Over time—and with the theatrical and home video releases of the uncut version—its reputation has steadily grown. It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made, and in 1979, a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made.   In the most recent version of the widely respected  |British_Film_Institute|British_Film_Institute|   Sight & Sound  Greatest Films of All Time poll, Seven Samurai placed 17th among all films from all countries in both the critics and the directors polls, receiving a place in the Top Ten lists of 48 critics and 22 directors.      In 1954, nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in Japan and one particular  |incident|Daigo_Fukuryū_Maru|  in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to  |nuclear_fallout|Nuclear_Fallout| , with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawas next film,  Record of a Living Being , was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the directors previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawas composer, collaborator and close friend  |Fumio_Hayasaka|Fumio_Hayasaka|  died at the age of 41. The films score was finished by Hayasakas student,  |Masaru_Sato|Masaru_Sato| , who would go on to score all of Kurosawas next eight films. Record of a Living Being opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.        Kurosawas next project,  Throne of Blood , an adaptation of  |William_Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|   Macbeth —set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress,  |Isuzu_Yamada|Isuzu_Yamada| , to regard the work as if it were a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawas appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the  |Noh|Noh|  theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the directors previous film. Abroad, Throne of Blood, regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.         Another adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of  The Lower Depths , based on  |a_play|The_Lower_Depths|  by  |Maxim_Gorky|Maxim_Gorky| , taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters lives. Though faithful to the play, this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late  |Edo_period|Edo_Period| —unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response similar to that of Throne of Blood. However, some critics rank it among the directors most underrated works.         Kurosawas three consecutive movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had. The mood of the directors work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths. He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new  |widescreen|Widescreen|  format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film,  The Hidden Fortress , is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawas most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on  |George_Lucass|George_Lucas|  1977  |space_opera|Space_Opera| ,  Star Wars .        Red Beard Rashomon, Kurosawas productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the directors budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested that he might help finance his own works, therefore making the studios potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as the majority shareholder.      Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a story that was more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work.  The Bad Sleep Well , based on a script by Kurosawas nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man who is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his fathers death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new  |U_S_–Japan_Security_treaty|Treaty_Of_Mutual_Cooperation_And_Security_Between_The_United_States_And_Japan| , which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the countrys democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawas most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.          Yojimbo  , Kurosawa Productions second film, centers on a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the  |Western|Western| , while at the same time offering an unprecedentedly graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring  |Tatsuya_Nakadai|Tatsuya_Nakadai|  in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by  |Kazuo_Miyagawa|Kazuo_Miyagawa|   and  |Takao_Saito|Takao_Saito| , the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its  |blackly_comic|Black_Comedy|  tone were also widely imitated abroad.  |Sergio_Leones|Sergio_Leone|   A Fistful of Dollars  was a virtual scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawas behalf and prevailing.           Following the success of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under pressure from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film.  Sanjuro  was the first of three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer  |Shūgorō_Yamamoto|Shūgorō_Yamamoto|  . It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews.        Kurosawa had meanwhile instructed Toho to purchase the film rights to Kings Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter  |Evan_Hunter|Evan_Hunter| , under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, as one of his  |87th_Precinct|87Th_Precinct|  series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled  High and Low , was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawas box office record , became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time . High and Low is considered by many commentators to be among the directors strongest works.         Kurosawa quickly moved on to his next project,  Red Beard . Based on a short story collection by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevskys novel  The Insulted and Injured , it is a period film, set in a mid-nineteenth century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawas humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as Akahige , played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.       |Yūzō_Kayama|Yūzō_Kayama| , who plays Yasumoto, was an extremely popular film and music star at the time, particularly for his Young Guy  series of musical comedies, so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kurosawa strong box-office. The shoot, the filmmakers longest ever, lasted well over a year , and wrapped in spring 1965, leaving the director, his crew and his actors exhausted. Red Beard premiered in April 1965, becoming the years highest-grossing Japanese production and the third Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawas best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawas best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artists previous commitment to social and political change.         The film marked something of an end of an era for its creator. The director himself recognized this at the time of its release, telling critic  |Donald_Richie|Donald_Richie|  that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different.  His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawas costly production methods.      Red Beard also marked the midway point, chronologically, in the artists career. During his previous twenty-nine years in the film industry , he had directed twenty-three films, while during the remaining twenty-eight years, for many and complex reasons, he would complete only seven more. Also, for reasons never adequately explained, Red Beard would be his final film starring Toshiro Mifune. Yu Fujiki, an actor who worked on The Lower Depths, observed, regarding the closeness of the two men on the set, Mr. Kurosawas heart was in Mr. Mifunes body.  Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique symbiosis .          When Kurosawas exclusive contract with Toho came to an end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before.      For his first foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story based on a  |Life_magazine|Life|  article. The  |Embassy_Pictures|Embassy_Pictures|  action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost two decades later, another foreign director working in Hollywood,  |Andrei_Konchalovsky|Andrei_Konchalovsky| , finally made  Runaway Train  , though from a new script loosely based on Kurosawas.      The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project.  Tora! Tora! Tora! , produced by  |20th_Century_Fox|20Th_Century_Fox|  and Kurosawa Production, would be a portrayal of the Japanese  |attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor|  from both the American and the Japanese points-of-view, with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an English-speaking filmmaker directing the American half. He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but very soon the project began to unravel. The director of the American sequences turned out not to be  |David_Lean|David_Lean| , as originally planned, but American  |Richard_Fleischer|Richard_Fleischer| . The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes—a major problem, considering that Kurosawas script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions with the direct involvement of  |Darryl_Zanuck|Darryl_Zanuck| , a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968.     Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. Kurosawa was examined at  |Kyoto_University|Kyoto_University|  Hospital by a neuropsychologist, Dr. Murakami, whose diagnosis was forwarded to  |Darryl_Zanuck|Darryl_Zanuck|  and  |Richard_Zanuck|Richard_Zanuck|  at Fox studios indicating a diagnosis of  |neurasthenia|Neurasthenia|  stating that, He is suffering from disturbance of sleep, agitated with feelings of anxiety and in manic excitement caused by the above mentioned illness. It is necessary for him to have rest and medical treatment for more than two months. Hiroshi Tasogawa. All the Emperors Men, Hardcover: 337 pp Publisher: Applause; 1 edition . . p. 255. On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to fatigue , effectively firing him. He was ultimately replaced, for the films Japanese sequences, with two directors,  |Kinji_Fukasaku|Kinji_Fukasaku|  and  |Toshio_Masuda|Toshio_Masuda| .      Tora! Tora! Tora!, finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an almost unmitigated tragedy in Kurosawas career. He had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again. The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company . His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he would never make another film.         Knowing that his reputation was at stake following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors  |Keisuke_Kinoshita|Keisuke_Kinoshita| , Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights . Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.       The first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called  Dora-heita , but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to  Dodesukaden , an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the directors best work.      Unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the directors health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he would ever direct another film.      In early 1973, the Soviet studio  |Mosfilm|Mosfilm|  approached the filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer  |Vladimir_Arsenyevs|Vladimir_Arsenyev|  autobiographical work  Dersu Uzala . The book, about a  |Goldi|Nani_People|  hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June.  Dersu Uzala  had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the  |9th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival|9Th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival| ,  as well as an  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film|Academy_Award_For_Best_Foreign_Language_Film| . Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawas alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.       Although proposals for television projects were submitted to him, he had no interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for  |Suntory|Suntory|  whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories.        In 1977, American director George Lucas released  Star Wars , a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawas The Hidden Fortress, among other works. Lucas, like many other  |New_Hollywood|New_Hollywood|  directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked to discover that the Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable:  Kagemusha , the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawas illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan  |Francis_Ford_Coppola|Francis_Ford_Coppola|  as co-producer.      Production began the following April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor,  |Shintaro_Katsu|Shintaro_Katsu| —creator of the very popular  |Zatoichi|Zatoichi|  character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the directors wishes, on videotaping his own performance. The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted  |Palme_dOr|Palme_Dor|  at the  |1980_Cannes_Film_Festival|1980_Cannes_Film_Festival|  in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.          The international success of Kagemusha allowed Kurosawa to proceed with his next project,  Ran , another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on  |William_Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|   King Lear , depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty  daimyō  , played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer  |Serge_Silberman|Serge_Silberman| , who had produced  |Luis_Buñuels|Luis_Buñuel|  final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.      In January 1985, production of Ran was halted as Kurosawas 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned to finish his film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, as he had done with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the films premieres in September and October.      Ran won several awards in Japan, but was not quite as honored there as many of the directors best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the selection of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the  |Best_Foreign_Film|Academy_Award_For_Best_Foreign_Language_Film|  category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the  |58th_Academy_Awards|58Th_Academy_Awards| . Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academys arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film , or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director  |Sidney_Lumet|Sidney_Lumet|  led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for  |Best_Director|Academy_Award_For_Best_Director|  that year . Rans costume designer,  |Emi_Wada|Emi_Wada| , won the movies only Oscar.       Kagemusha and Ran, particularly the latter, are often considered to be among Kurosawas finest works. After Rans release, Kurosawa would point to it as his best film, a major change of attitude for the director who, when asked which of his works was his best, had always previously answered my next one .            For his next movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures  had included brief dream sequences,  Dreams  was to be entirely based upon the directors own dreams. Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan,  |Steven_Spielberg|Steven_Spielberg| , who convinced  |Warner_Bros_|Warner_Bros_|  to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawas son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the films production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and Dreams premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world.  In 1990, he accepted the  |Academy_Award|Academy_Awards|  for  |Lifetime_Achievement|Academy_Honorary_Award| .         Kurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with  Rhapsody in August —the directors first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II. It was adapted from a  |Kiyoko_Murata|Kiyoko_Murata|  novel, but the films references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments,   though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.     Kurosawa wasted no time moving onto his next project:  Madadayo , or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by  |Hyakken_Uchida|Hyakken_Uchida| , the film follows the life of a Japanese professor of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the films 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.      Kurosawa nevertheless continued to work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film.  His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie  —was never to be fulfilled.     After his accident, Kurosawas health began to deteriorate. While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in  |Setagaya_Tokyo|Setagaya_Tokyo| , at the age of 88.   At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son  |Hisao_Kurosawa|Dreams|  who married  |Hiroko_Hayashi|Hiroko_Hayashi|  and his daughter  |Kazuko_Kurosawa|Kazuko_Kurosawa|  who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor  |Takayuki_Kato|After_The_Rain|  and  |grandson_by_Kazuko|_Ja_黒澤明芸能界に関係する家族| , became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime,  |Takashi_Koizumis|Takashi_Koizumi|   After the Rain  and  |Kei_Kumais|Kei_Kumai|  The Sea is Watching .           From the beginning, Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet quite distinct from it. Kurosawa was extensively involved with every aspect of  |film_production|Filmmaking| .  He was also a gifted screenwriter, and would usually work in close collaboration with his co-writers from the beginning of the development of a film to ensure a high-quality script, which he insisted was the absolute foundation of a good film. He frequently served as editor of his own films and was regarded by his production team as the greatest editor in the world . Though it was common in the Japanese film industry of that time for established directors to assemble around them a team, or -gumi , with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians, crew members and actors working from film to film , Kurosawas team, known as the Kurosawa-gumi —including, for example, the cinematographer  |Asakazu_Nakai|Asakazu_Nakai| , the production assistant Teruyo Nogami and the actor  |Takashi_Shimura|Takashi_Shimura| —was remarkable for its loyalty to the director and the consistent quality of its work.     Kurosawas style is marked by a number of devices and techniques which Kurosawa introduced in his films over the decades. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the  |axial_cut|Axial_Cut|  , in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of  |tracking_shots|Tracking_Shot|  or  |dissolves|Dissolve| , but through a series of matched  |jump_cuts|Jump_Cut| .  Another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is Kurosawas tendency to cut on motion : that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot.      A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the  |wipe|Wipe| . This is an effect created through an  |optical_printer|Optical_Printer| , in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to move across the screen, wiping away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the  |dissolve|Dissolve|  . In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in Drunken Angel.  Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films, especially with an emphasis on sound-image counterpoint, in which the music or sound effects would ironically comment upon the image rather than merely reinforcing it.  He was also involved with several of Japans outstanding contemporary composers, including  |Fumio_Hayasaka|Fumio_Hayasaka|  and the internationally famous  |Tōru_Takemitsu|Tōru_Takemitsu| .      Kurosawa employed a number of recurring major themes in his films. These include: the master-disciple relationship between a usually older mentor and one or more novices, which often involves spiritual as well as technical mastery and self-mastery; the heroic champion, the exceptional individual who emerges from the mass of people to produce something or right some injustice; the depiction of extremes of weather as both dramatic devices and symbols of human passion; and the recurrence of cycles of inexorable savage violence within history. According to Stephen Prince, the latter theme began with Throne of Blood , and recurred in Kurosawa films of the 1980s. Mr. Prince calls this theme the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawas cinema .             Since the early to mid-1950s, a number of critics from the  |French_New_Wave|French_New_Wave|  championed the films of the older Japanese master,  |Kenji_Mizoguchi|Kenji_Mizoguchi| , at the expense of Kurosawas work. New Wave critic-filmmaker  |Jacques_Rivette|Jacques_Rivette| , said: You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough  ... seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual.  According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between Japanese Mizoguchi and Western Kurosawa by pointing out that Mizo had been at least as much influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa had ever been, and that this awareness of foreign trends is reflected in his work.      In Japan, there have been critics and other filmmakers who have accused Kurosawas work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In her DVD commentary on Seven Samurai, Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which as far as she is concerned reveal Kurosawa privileging these samurai, support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist  ... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village ... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth  ... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.      Owing to Kurosawas popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward, he did not escape the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction of the left-wing director  |Nagisa_Oshima|Nagisa_Oshima|  to Kurosawa and his work, states: That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant that he must be  |pandering|Pandering|  to Western values and politics.  Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: He has never catered to a foreign audience writes Audie Bock, and has condemned those who do .           Many celebrated directors have been influenced by Kurosawa and have expressed admiration for his work. The filmmakers cited below can be presented according to four categories: those who, like Kurosawa himself, established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s; the so-called  |New_Hollywood|New_Hollywood|  directors, that is, American moviemakers who, for the most part, established their reputations in the early to mid-1970s; other Asian directors; and modern-day directors.        The Swedish director  |Ingmar_Bergman|Ingmar_Bergman|  called his own film  The Virgin Spring  touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa , and added, At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!  In Italy,  |Federico_Fellini|Federico_Fellini|  in an interview declared the director the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be —despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, Seven Samurai.  In France,  |Roman_Polanski|Roman_Polanski|  in 1965 cited Kurosawa as one of his three favorite filmmakers , singling out Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise.  The Italian director  |Bernardo_Bertolucci|Bernardo_Bertolucci|  considered the Japanese masters influence to be seminal: Kurosawas movies and  La Dolce Vita  of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director.   |German_New_Wave|German_New_Wave|  director  |Werner_Herzog|Werner_Herzog|  has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship, Griffith  ... Buñuel, Kurosawa and Eisensteins  |Ivan_the_Terrible|Ivan_The_Terrible| , all come to mind.  When asked to list his favorite directors, Russian director  |Andrei_Tarkovsky|Andrei_Tarkovsky|  cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named  Seven Samurai   as one of his ten favorite films.     According to his personal assistant  |Anthony_Frewin|Anthony_Frewin| ,  |Stanley_Kubrick|Stanley_Kubrick|  thought Kurosawa was one of the great film directors and followed him closely. In fact I cannot think of any other director he spoke so consistently and admiringly about. So, if Kubrick was cast away on a desert island and could only take a few films, what would they be? My money would be on  The Battle of Algiers ,  Danton ,  Rashomon ,  Seven Samurai  and  Throne of Blood .      Kurosawas New Hollywood admirers have included  |Robert_Altman|Robert_Altman| ,  |Francis_Ford_Coppola|Francis_Ford_Coppola| ,  |Steven_Spielberg|Steven_Spielberg| ,   |Martin_Scorsese|Martin_Scorsese| ,  |George_Lucas|George_Lucas| ,  and  |John_Milius|John_Milius| .  In his early years while still a television director, Robert Altman stated that when he first saw Rashomon he was so impressed by its cinematographers achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work.  It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, One thing that distinguishes is that he didnt make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, eight masterpieces.  Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older mans role as teacher and role model, and Scorsese called him his  sensei , using the Japanese term.  Spielberg has declared, I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker on the face of the earth , while Scorsese remarked, Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master, and  ... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years. Several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on Kagemusha, while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, Dreams, helped bring that picture to fruition.     As the first Asian filmmaker to achieve international prominence, Kurosawa has naturally served as an inspiration for other Asian  auteurs . Of Rashomon, the most famous director of India,  |Satyajit_Ray|Satyajit_Ray| , said: The effect of the film on me was electric. I saw it three times on consecutive days, and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a directors command over every aspect of film making.  Other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director  |Takeshi_Kitano|Takeshi_Kitano| ,  Hong Kong filmmaker  |John_Woo|John_Woo| ,    Japanese  |anime|Anime|  director  |Hayao_Miyazaki|Hayao_Miyazaki|   and  |mainland_Chinese|Mainland_China|  director  |Zhang_Yimou|Zhang_Yimou| , who called Kurosawa the quintessential Asian director .
