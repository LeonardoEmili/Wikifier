      In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , a  |field_extension|Field_Extension|  L/K is called algebraic if every element of L is  |algebraic|Algebraic_Element|  over K, i.e. if every element of L is a  |root|Root_Of_A_Function|  of some non-zero  |polynomial|Polynomial|  with coefficients in K. Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain  |transcendental_elements|Transcendental_Element| , are called transcendental.     For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  as an extension of the field of  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number| , is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number| .     All transcendental extensions are of  |infinite_degree|Degree_Of_A_Field_Extension| . This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic. See also Hazewinkel et al. , p. 3. The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all  |algebraic_numbers|Algebraic_Number|  is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.     If a is algebraic over K, then Ka, the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K, is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K. The converse is true as well, if Ka is a field, then a is algebraic over K. In the special case where K Q is the  |field_of_rational_numbers|Rational_Number| , Qa is an example of an  |algebraic_number_field|Algebraic_Number_Field| .     A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called  |algebraically_closed|Algebraically_Closed_Field| . An example is the field of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number| . Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed , but proving this in general requires some form of the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| .     An extension L/K is algebraic  |if_and_only_if|If_And_Only_If|  every sub K-algebra of L is a  |field|Field| .       The class of algebraic extensions forms a  |distinguished_class_of_field_extensions|Distinguished_Class_Of_Field_Extensions| , that is, the following three properties hold: Lang p.228   If E is an algebraic extension of F and F is an algebraic extension of K then E is an algebraic extension of K.   If E and F are algebraic extensions of K in a common overfield C, then the  |compositum|Compositum|  EF is an algebraic extension of K.   If E is an algebraic extension of F and E .
