South Africa is a  |parliamentary|Parliamentary_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |republic|Republic| , wherein the  |President_of_South_Africa|President_Of_South_Africa| , elected by parliament, is the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and of a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| .  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the government.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the government and the two chambers of  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_South_Africa| , the  |Council_of_Provinces|National_Council_Of_Provinces|  and the  |National_Assembly|National_Assembly_Of_South_Africa| . The  |judiciary|Judiciary|  is independent of the executive and the legislature. Government is three-tiered, with representatives elected at the national, provincial and local levels.          Following the 1994 elections, South Africa was governed under an interim constitution. This constitution required the  |Constituent_Assembly|Constituent_Assembly|  to draft and approve a permanent constitution by 9 May 1996.     The  |Government_of_National_Unity|Government_Of_National_Unity|  established under the interim constitution ostensibly remained in effect until the 1999 national elections. The parties originally comprising the GNU – the  |African_National_Congress|African_National_Congress|  , the  |National_Party|National_Party|  , and the  |Inkatha_Freedom_Party|Inkatha_Freedom_Party|  – shared executive power. On 30 June 1996, the NP withdrew from the GNU to become part of the opposition.

Until 2008, elected officials were allowed to change political party, while retaining their seats, during set windows which occurred twice each electoral term, due to controversial  |floor_crossing|Floor_Crossing|  legislative amendments made in 2002. The last two floor crossing windows occurred in 2005 and in 2007.     After the 2009 elections, the ANC lost its two-thirds majority in the national legislature which had allowed it to unilaterally alter the constitution.     The  |Congress_of_South_African_Trade_Unions|Congress_Of_South_African_Trade_Unions|  and the  |South_African_Communist_Party|South_African_Communist_Party|  are in a formal alliance with the ruling ANC , and thus do not stand separately for election.

Citizens entitlements to a safe environment, housing, education, and health care are included in the bill of rights, and are known as secondary constitutional rights. In 2003 the constitutional secondary rights were used by the HIV/AIDS activist group the  |Treatment_Action_Campaign|Treatment_Action_Campaign|  as a means of forcing the government to change its health policy.     Violent crime, including violence against women and children, and organised criminal activity are at high levels and are a grave concern. Partly as a result,  |vigilante|Vigilante|  action and  |mob_justice|Mob_Justice|  sometimes occur.     Some members of the police are accused of applying excessive force and abusing suspects in custody; as a result, the number of deaths in police custody remains a problem. In April 1997, the government established an Independent Complaints Directorate to investigate deaths in police custody and deaths resulting from police action.
