Ambrogio Traversari,  |O.S.B._Cam.|Camaldolese| , also referred to as Ambrose of Camaldoli , was an  |Italian|Italian_People| |monk|Monk|  and  |theologian|Theology|  who was a prime supporter of the  |papal|Papal|  cause in the 15th century. He is honored as a saint by the  |Camaldolese|Camaldolese|  Order.        |Traversari|Traversari|  was born near  |Forlì|Forlì| , in the village of  |Portico_di_Romagna|Portico_E_San_Benedetto|  in 1386. At the age of 14 he entered the Camaldolese Order in the Monastery of  |St._Mary_of_the_Angels|Santa_Maria_Degli_Angeli,_Florence|  in  |Florence|Florence| , and rapidly became a leading theologian and  |Hellenist|Hellenism| . In his study of  |Greek_literature|Greek_Literature|  his master was  |Emmanuel_Chrysoloras|Manuel_Chrysoloras| . He worked primarily as a scholar until he became  |prior|Prior|  general of the Order in 1431.     Ambrose emerged as a leading advocate of  |papal_primacy|Papal_Primacy| . This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the  |Council_of_Basel|Council_Of_Florence|  as legate of  |Pope_Eugene_IV|Pope_Eugene_Iv|  and defended the primacy of the pope, adjuring the council not to rend asunder  |Christs|Jesus|  seamless robe . He was next sent by the  |pope|Pope|  to the Emperor  |Sigismund|Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  to ask his aid in the popes efforts to end this council, which for five years had been encroaching on papal prerogatives. The pope transferred the council from  |Basel|Basel|  to  |Ferrara|Ferrara|  on 18 September 1437.     So strong was Ambroses hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western  |Babylon|Babylon| . He likewise supported the pope at Ferrara and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches. But in this council, and later, in that of Florence, Ambrose, by his efforts and charity toward some poor Greek bishops, greatly helped to bring about a union of the two Churches, the decree for which, 6 July 1439, he was called on to draw up.     He died soon after. His  |feastday|Calendar_Of_Saints|  is celebrated by the Camaldolese Order on 20 November.

Between 1424 and 1433 he worked on the translation of the  Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers  by  |Diogenes_Laërtius|Diogenes_Laërtius| , which came to be widely circulated in manuscript form.
