        In  |logic|Logic| , the law of excluded middle  states that for any  |proposition|Proposition| ,  |either|Exclusive_Or|  that proposition is  |true|Truth_Value|  or its  |negation|Negation|  is true. It is one of the so called  |three_laws_of_thought|Lawofthoughtthethreetraditionallaws| , along with the  |law_of_noncontradiction|Law_Of_Noncontradiction| , and the  |law_of_identity|Law_Of_Identity| . The law of excluded middle is logically equivalent to the law of noncontradiction by  |De_Morgans_laws|De_Morgans_Laws| . However, no system of logic is built on just these laws, and none of these laws provide  |inference_rules|Rule_Of_Inference| , such as  |modus_ponens|Modus_Ponens|  or De Morgans laws.     The law is also known as the law  of the excluded third, in  |Latin|Latin|  principium tertii exclusi. Another Latin designation for this law is tertium non datur |tautology|Tautology| .     The principle should not be confused with the semantical  |principle_of_bivalence|Principle_Of_Bivalence| , which states that every proposition is either true or false.       Some systems of logic have different but analogous laws. For some finite  |n_valued_logics|Finite_Valued_Logic| , there is an analogous law called the law of excluded n+1th. If negation is  |cyclic|Cyclic_Negation|  and ∨ is a max operator , then the law can be expressed in the object language by , where ~...~ represents n−1 negation signs and ∨ ... ∨ n−1 disjunction signs. It is easy to check that the sentence must receive at least one of the n  |truth_values|Truth_Value|  .     Other systems reject the law entirely.       For example, if P is the proposition:     :Socrates is mortal.     then the law of excluded middle holds that the  |logical_disjunction|Logical_Disjunction| Either Socrates is mortal, or it is not the case that Socrates is mortal.     is true by virtue of its form alone. That is, the middle position, that Socrates is neither mortal nor not-mortal, is excluded by logic, and therefore either the first possibility  or its negation  must be true.     An example of an argument that depends on the law of excluded middle follows. This well-known example of a non-constructive proof depending on the law of excluded middle can be found in many places, for example:  and Davis 2000:220, footnote 2. We seek to prove that there exist two irrational number s a and b such that     : ab is rational.     It is known that   is irrational . Consider the number     :   .     Clearly this number is either rational or irrational. If it is rational, the proof is complete, and   : a  and b  .     But if   is irrational, then let     : a  and b  .     Then     : ab       2 ,     and 2 is certainly rational. This concludes the proof.     In the above argument, the assertion this number is either rational or irrational invokes the law of excluded middle. An intuitionist , for example, would not accept this argument without further support for that statement. This might come in the form of a proof that the number in question is in fact irrational ; or a finite algorithm that could determine whether the number is rational.         The above proof is an example of a  |non_constructive|Non_Constructive|  proof disallowed by intuitionists:   .     By non-constructive Davis means that a proof that there actually are mathematic entities satisfying certain conditions would not have to provide a method to exhibit explicitly the entities in question. . Such proofs presume the existence of a totality that is complete, a notion disallowed by intuitionists when extended to the infinite—for them the infinite can never be completed:         David Hilbert and Luitzen E. J. Brouwer both give examples of the law of excluded middle extended to the infinite. Hilberts example: the assertion that either there are only finitely many prime numbers or there are infinitely many ; and Brouwers: Every mathematical species is either finite or infinite. .     In general, intuitionists allow the use of the law of excluded middle when it is confined to discourse over finite collections , but not when it is used in discourse over infinite sets . Thus intuitionists absolutely disallow the blanket assertion: For all propositions P concerning infinite sets DP or ~P .     :For more about the conflict between the intuitionists and the formalists see  |Foundations_of_mathematics|Foundations_Of_Mathematics|  and  |Intuitionism|Intuitionism| .     Putative counterexamples to the law of excluded middle include the liar paradox or Quines paradox . Certain resolutions of these paradoxes, particularly Graham Priest s dialetheism as formalised in LP, have the law of excluded middle as a theorem, but resolve out the Liar as both true and false. In this way, the law of excluded middle is true, but because truth itself, and therefore disjunction, is not exclusive, it says next to nothing if one of the disjuncts is paradoxical, or both true and false.           The earliest known formulation is in Aristotles discussion of the principle of non-contradiction , first proposed in  |On_Interpretation|On_Interpretation| , Geach p. 74 where he says that of two contradictory propositions one must be true, and the other false. On Interpretation, c. 9 He also states it as a principle in the  |Metaphysics|Metaphysics|  book 3, saying that it is necessary in every case to affirm or deny, Metaphysics 2, 996b 26–30 and that it is impossible that there should be anything between the two parts of a contradiction. Metaphysics 7, 1011b 26–27     Aristotle wrote that ambiguity can arise from the use of ambiguous names, but cannot exist in the facts themselves:         Aristotles assertion that ...it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing , which would be written in propositional logic as ¬, is a statement modern logicians could call the law of excluded middle , as distribution of the negation of Aristotles assertion makes them equivalent, regardless that the former claims that no statement is both true and false, while the latter requires that any statement is either true or false.     However, Aristotle also writes, since it is impossible that contradictories should be at the same time true of the same thing, obviously contraries also cannot belong at the same time to the same thing . He then proposes that there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate . In the context of Aristotles traditional logic , this is a remarkably precise statement of the law of excluded middle, P ∨ ¬P.     Also in On Interpretation, Aristotle seemed to deny the law of excluded middle in the case of future contingents , in his discussion on the sea battle.             Principia Mathematica  |Principia_Mathematica|Principia_Mathematica|  as:             .   p       p .     So just what is truth and falsehood ? At the opening PM quickly announces some definitions:         This is not much help. But later, in a much deeper discussion, PM defines truth and falsehood in terms of a relationship between the a and the b and the percipient . For example This a is b really means object a is a sense-datum and red is a sense-datum , and they stand in relation to one another and in relation to I . Thus what we really mean is: I perceive that This object a is red and this is an undeniable-by-3rd-party truth .     PM further defines a distinction between a sense-datum and a sensation :       Russell reiterated his distinction between sense-datum and sensation in his book The Problems of Philosophy published at the same time as PM :       Russell further described his reasoning behind his definitions of truth and falsehood in the same book .     Principia Mathematica  |Principia_Mathematica|Principia_Mathematica| , Whitehead and Russell derive some of the most powerful tools in the logicians argumentation toolkit.      ✸2.1 ~p ∨ p This is the Law of excluded middle .     The proof of ✸2.1 is roughly as follows: primitive idea 1.08 defines p → q ~p ∨ q. Substituting p for q in this rule yields p → p ~p ∨ p. Since p → p is true , then ~p ∨ p must be true.     ✸2.11 p ∨ ~p   ✸2.12 p → ~   ✸2.13 p ∨ ~   ✸2.14 ~ → p   ✸2.15  →    ✸2.16  →    ✸2.17  →    ✸2.18  → p      Most of these theorems—in particular ✸2.1, ✸2.11, and ✸2.14—are rejected by intuitionism. These tools are recast into another form that Kolmogorov cites as Hilberts four axioms of implication and Hilberts two axioms of negation .     Propositions ✸2.12 and ✸2.14, double negation :   The intuitionist writings of L. E. J. Brouwer refer to what he calls the principle of the reciprocity of the multiple species, that is, the principle that for every system the correctness of a property follows from the impossibility of the impossibility of this property .     This principle is commonly called the principle of double negation . From the law of excluded middle , PM derives principle ✸2.12 immediately. We substitute ~p for p in 2.11 to yield ~p ∨ ~, and by the definition of implication then ~p ∨ ~ p → ~. QED       It is correct, at least for bivalent logic—i.e. it can be seen with a Karnaugh map —that this law removes the middle of the inclusive-or used in his law . And this is the point of Reichenbachs demonstration that some believe the exclusive-or should take the place of the inclusive-or .     About this issue Reichenbach observes:     ::The tertium non datur   ::29. f ∨ ~f   ::is not exhaustive in its major terms and is therefore an inflated formula. This fact may perhaps explain why some people consider it unreasonable to write with the inclusive-or, and want to have it written with the sign of the exclusive-or     ::30. f ⊕ ~f, where the symbol ⊕ signifies exclusive-or The original symbol as used by Reichenbach is an upside down V, nowadays used for AND. The AND for Reichenbach is the same as that used in Principia Mathematica – a dot cf p. 27 where he shows a truth table where he defines a.b . Reichenbach defines the exclusive-or on p. 35 as the negation of the equivalence . One sign used nowadays is a circle with a + in it, i.e. ⊕ . Other signs are ≢ , or ≠ .   ::in which form it would be fully exhaustive and therefore nomological in the narrower sense.     In line the means for all or for every , a form used by Russell and Reichenbach; today the symbolism is usually   x. Thus an example of the expression would look like this:        :       In late 1800s through the 1930s a bitter, persistent debate raged between Hilbert and his followers versus Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer . Brouwers philosophy, called intuitionism , started in earnest with Leopold Kronecker in the late 1800s.     Hilbert intensely disliked Kroneckers ideas:             The debate had a profound effect on Hilbert. Reid indicates that Hilberts second problem evolved from this debate :     ::In his second problem had asked for a mathematical proof of the consistency of the axioms of the arithmetic of real numbers.   ::To show the significance of this problem, he added the following observation:   :: If contradictory attributes be assigned to a concept, I say that mathematically the concept does not exist ...     Thus Hilbert was saying: If p and ~p are both shown to be true, then p does not exist and he was thereby invoking the law of excluded middle cast into the form of the law of contradiction.         The rancorous debate continued through the early 1900s into the 1920s; in 1927 Brouwer complained about polemicizing against it in sneering tones . However, the debate had been fertile: it had resulted in  |Principia_Mathematica|Principia_Mathematica|  , and that work gave a precise definition to the law of excluded middle, and all this provided an intellectual setting and the tools necessary for the mathematicians of the early twentieth century:         Brouwer reduced the debate to the use of proofs designed from negative or non-existence versus constructive proof:   ::According to Brouwer, a statement that an object exists having a given property means that, and is only proved, when a method is known which in principle at least will enable such an object to be found or constructed...   ::Hilbert naturally disagreed.   :: ...pure existence proofs have been the most important landmarks in the historical development of our science, he maintained.     ::Brouwer ... refused to accept the logical principle of the excluded middle... His argument was the following:     :: Suppose that A is the statement There exists a member of the set S having the property P. If the set is finite, it is possible—in principle—to examine each member of S and determine whether there is a member of S with the property P or that every member of S lacks the property P. For finite sets, therefore, Brouwer accepted the principle of the excluded middle as valid. He refused to accept it for infinite sets because if the set S is infinite, we cannot—even in principle—examine each member of the set. If, during the course of our examination, we find a member of the set with the property P, the first alternative is substantiated; but if we never find such a member, the second alternative is still not substantiated.   ::Since mathematical theorems are often proved by establishing that the negation would involve us in a contradiction, this third possibility which Brouwer suggested would throw into question many of the mathematical statements currently accepted.   :: Taking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician, Hilbert said, is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.   :: The possible loss did not seem to bother Weyl... Brouwers program was the coming thing, he insisted to his friends in Zürich. ~A → Bcite book   last Clark   first Keith   title Logic and Data Bases   publisher Springer-Verlag   date 1978   pages 293–322   url http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/NegAsFailure.pdf   doi 10.1007/978-1-4684-3384-511cite IEP  url-idpar-russ  titleRussells Paradox  .
