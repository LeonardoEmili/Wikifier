      Elections are administered by an independent  |Commission_on_Elections|Commission_On_Elections|  every three years starting 1992. Held every second Monday of May, the winners in the elections take office on the following June 30.     Jomarie Rola, the general founder of Philippine politics believes that the occurrence of local government is produced by  |local_government_units|Local_Government_Units|  from the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays. While most regions do not have political power and exist merely for administration purposes, autonomous regions have expanded powers, more than the other local government units. While local government units enjoy autonomy, much of their budget is derived from allocations from the national government, putting their true autonomy in doubt.               |Congress|Congress_Of_The_Philippines|  is a  |bicameral|Bicameral|  legislature. The  |upper_house|Upper_House| , the  |Senate|Senate_Of_The_Philippines| , is composed of 24 senators elected via the  |plurality_at_large_voting|Plurality_At_Large_Voting|  with the country as one  |at_large|At_Large|  district. The senators elect amongst themselves a  |Senate_President|President_Of_The_Senate_Of_The_Philippines| . The  |lower_house|Lower_House|  is the  |House_of_Representatives|House_Of_Representatives_Of_The_Philippines| , currently composed of 292 representatives, with no more than 20% elected via  |party_list_system|Sectoral_Representation_In_The_House_Of_Representatives_Of_The_Philippines| , with the rest elected from  |legislative_districts|Legislative_Districts_Of_The_Philippines| . The House of Representatives is headed by the  |Speaker|Speaker_Of_The_House_Of_Representatives_Of_The_Philippines| .     Each  |bill|Bill|  needs the consent of both houses to be submitted to the president for his signature. If the president  |veto|Veto| es the bill, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds supermajority. If either house voted down on a bill or fails to act on it after an  |adjournment_sine_die|Adjournment_Sine_Die| , the bill is lost and would have to be proposed to the next congress, with the process starting all over again. Congress decisions are mostly via  |majority_vote|Majority_Vote| , except for voting on constitutional amendments and other matters. Each house has its inherent power, with the Senate given the power to vote on treaties, while  |money_bills|Money_Bill|  may only be introduced by the House of Representatives. The constitution provides Congress with  |impeachment_powers|Impeachment_In_The_Philippines| , with the House of Representatives having the power to impeach, and the Senate having the power to try the impeached official.     The  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party| ,  |Nationalist_Peoples_Coalition|Nationalist_Peoples_Coalition| , the  |National_Unity_Party_|National_Unity_Party| , the  |Nacionalista_Party|Nacionalista_Party| , the  |Lakas_CMD|Lakas–Cmd|  and the  |United_Nationalist_Alliance|United_Nationalist_Alliance|  are the parties with largest membership in Congress. The party of the sitting president controls the House of Representatives, while the Senate has been more independent. From 1907 to 1941, the Nacionalistas operated under a  |dominant_party_system|Dominant_Party_System| , with factions within that party becoming the primary political discourse. During World War II, the Japanese-sponsored  |Second_Philippine_Republic|Second_Philippine_Republic|  forced all the existing parties to merge into the  |KALIBAPI|Kalibapi|  that controlled the party as a  |one_party_state|One_Party_System| . From 1945 to 1972, the Philippines was under a  |two_party_system|Two_Party_System| , with the Nacionalistas and their offshoots Liberals alternating power until President  |Ferdinand_Marcos|Ferdinand_Marcos|  declared martial law. Political discourse was kept to a minimum until Marcos then merged the parties into the  |Kilusang_Bagong_Lipunan|Kilusang_Bagong_Lipunan|  , which dominated elections until 1986 when Marcos was overthrown as a result of the  |People_Power_Revolution|People_Power_Revolution| . The political climate ushered in a  |multi_party_system|Multi_Party_System|  which persists into this day.                 |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is vested to the  |President|President_Of_The_Philippines| ; in practice, however, the president delegates his power to a  |cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_Philippines| . The president, who is both the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , is directly elected to a single six-year term via  |first_past_the_post|First_Past_The_Post| . In case of death, resignation or incapacitation, the  |Vice_President|Vice_President_Of_The_Philippines|  acts as the president until the expiration of the term. The Vice President is elected separately from the president and may be of differing political parties. While the vice president has no constitutional powers aside from acting as president when the latter is unable to do so, the president may give the former a cabinet office. The cabinet is mostly composed of the heads of the  |executive_departments|Executive_Departments_Of_The_Philippines| , which provide services to the people, and other cabinet-level officials.     The president is also the  |commander_in_chief|Commander_In_Chief|  of the  |Armed_Forces_of_the_Philippines|Armed_Forces_Of_The_Philippines| , thereby ensuring civilian supremacy over the military. The president is also given several military powers, although once exercised, Congress can prolong or end it. The president also proposes a national budget, in which Congress may adopt in full, with amendments, or a complete revision altogether. The president wields considerable political power and may be able to influence other branches via the so-called  |Padrino_System|Padrino_System| .          The judiciary is composed of the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_Philippines|  and other lower courts. The Supreme Court is the court of last resort, and decides on the constitutionality of laws via  |judicial_review|Judicial_Review| . The President selects justices and judges from nominees given by the  |Judicial_and_Bar_Council|Judicial_And_Bar_Council| . The  |Court_of_Appeals|Court_Of_Appeals_Of_The_Philippines|  is the second-highest appellate court, the  |Court_of_Tax_Appeals|Court_Of_Tax_Appeals_Of_The_Philippines|  rules on tax matters, and the  |Sandiganbayan|Sandiganbayan|  is a special court for alleged government irregularities. The  |Regional_Trial_Courts|Regional_Trial_Court|  are the main  |trial_courts|Trial_Court| . The Regional Trial Courts are based on judicial regions, which almost correspond to the administrative  |regions|Regions_Of_The_Philippines| . Each RTC has at least one branch in each province and handles most of the criminal and civil cases; several branches of an RTC may be designated as  |family_court|Family_Court| |_Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines|Supreme_Court_Of_The_Philippines| |_Court_of_Appeals_of_the_Philippines|Court_Of_Appeals_Of_The_Philippines| |_Court_of_Tax_Appeals_of_the_Philippines|Court_Of_Tax_Appeals_Of_The_Philippines| |_Sandiganbayan|Sandiganbayan|        The  |Ombudsman|Ombudsman_Of_The_Philippines|  investigates and prosecutes government officials on crimes while in dispensing powers given by the government. The  |Office_of_the_Solicitor_General|Office_Of_The_Solicitor_General_Of_The_Philippines|  represents the government in legal cases.             The Philippine Legal System is a hybrid form based on the Spanish  |Civil_Law|Civil_Law|  and Anglo-American  |Common_Law|Common_Law|  system,  |Muslim_regions|Moro_People|  observe the  |Sharia_Law|Sharia_Law|  as binding legal system in accordance to their Islamic traditions     The  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_The_Philippines|  is the supreme law of the land and laws passed by the  |Congress|Congress_Of_The_Philippines|  shall be consistent with the Constitution. Under the  |Civil_Code_of_the_Philippines|Civil_Code_Of_The_Philippines| , Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution is part of the legal system, the doctrine of  |stare_decisis|Stare_Decisis|  applies in deciding legal controversies. The court may exercise  |judicial_review|Judicial_Review_In_The_Philippines|  to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. The  |President|President_Of_The_Philippines|  may issue executive orders, proclamations or other executive issuance. The  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_Philippines|  is also vested the powers to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. The Philippines adopts the dualist system in  |Incorporation_of_international_law|Incorporation_Of_International_Law| . The  |local_legislative_assemblies|Local_Government_In_The_Philippineslegislatures|  may enact local ordinances within their respective territorial and political boundaries in accordance with the local autonomy granted by the Local Government Code.          Elections are administered by the  |Commission_on_Elections|Commission_On_Elections|  . The elected officials are the president, vice president, members of Congress, regional governors and assemblymen, provincial governors, vice governors, and board members, city and municipal mayors, vice mayors and councilors, and  |barangay|Barangay|  chairmen and councilors. Elections are for  |fixed_terms|Fixed_Term_Election| . All elected officials have three-year terms, except for the president, vice president, and senators, which are six years. All terms above the barangay level begin and end on June 30 of the election year, and all elected officials are limited to three consecutive terms, except for senators, and the vice president, who are limited to two, and for the president, who cannot be reelected.     Elections above the barangay level are held every three years since 1992 on the second Monday of May, all positions are disputed except for the president and vice president;  |presidential_and_vice_presidential_elections|Philippine_Presidential_Elections|  are held every six years since 1992.  |Single_winner_elections|Single_Winner_Election|  are done via the  |plurality_voting_system|Plurality_Voting_System| |plurality_at_large_voting|Plurality_At_Large_Voting| . Each voter has x votes, with the x candidates with the highest number of votes being elected. For representatives elected the party-list system, a party that won at least 2% of the national vote wins one seat, with additional seats, but not exceeding three seats, depends on the number of votes it received. If the number of sectoral representatives does not reach 20% of the membership of the House of Representatives, parties with less than 2% of the vote are given a seat each until the 20% membership is filled.             The constitution mandates that local governments must have local autonomy. The smallest  |local_government_unit|Local_Government_Unit| , the  |barangay|Barangay|  or village, is descended from the  |balangay|Balangay|  of the  |Maragtas|Maragtas|  legend, where the first  |Austronesian_people|Austronesian_People|  reached the Philippines via the boat. The prehistoric barangays were headed by  |datus|Datu| . Currently, barangays are grouped into  |municipalities|Municipalities_Of_The_Philippines|  or  |cities|Cities_Of_The_Philippines| , while municipalities and cities may be further grouped into  |provinces|Provinces_Of_The_Philippines| . Each barangay, municipality or city, and province is headed by a barangay chairman, mayor, or governor, respectively, with its legislatures being the  |Sangguniang_Barangay|Sangguniang_Barangay|  ,  |Sangguniang_Bayan|Sangguniang_Bayan|  or  |Sangguniang_Panlungsod|Sangguniang_Panlungsod|  , and the  |Sangguniang_Panlalawigan|Sangguniang_Panlalawigan|  .     Regions are the highest administrative divisions but do not have powers possessed under them; however, autonomous regions are given wider powers than other local government units. While the constitution allows autonomous regions in the Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao, only the  |Autonomous_Region_in_Muslim_Mindanao|Autonomous_Region_In_Muslim_Mindanao|  exists, with the proposed autonomous region in Cordillera being defeated after two plebiscites. The ARMM has a regional governor and a regional assembly.     While local government units have the autonomy, most of their budget is derived from the  |Internal_Revenue_Allotment|Internal_Revenue_Allotment| , a disbursement from the national government which is ultimately derived from taxes. This makes most local government units ultimately dependent on the national government unless they have other sources of income, such as property taxes.                 Before the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, the Philippines was split into numerous  |barangays|Ancient_Barangay| , which were not unlike the  |Greek_city_states|Greek_City_States| . These barangays warred, made peace, traded and had relations with each other. In  |Mindanao|Mindanao| , Islamic sultanates such as the  |Sultanate_of_Sulu|Sultanate_Of_Sulu|  and  |Maguindanao|Sultanate_Of_Maguindanao| , prospered.  |Ferdinand_Magellans|Ferdinand_Magellan|  death in 1521 can be partly attributed to a dispute between  |Lapu_Lapu|Lapu_Lapu|  and  |Rajah_Humabon|Rajah_Humabon|  for control of Cebu. The  |Kingdom_of_Maynila|Kingdom_Of_Maynila|  was trading with China and other nearby empires when  |Miguel_Lopez_de_Legazpi|Miguel_López_De_Legazpi|  conquered the kingdom in 1565 and assimilated it with the other kingdoms he had conquered nearby to unite the Philippines under Spanish rule.             Upon the subjugation of the local population in Manila and Cebu, the Spaniards refused the locals any political participation. The old ruling class in the pre-Spanish era were given essentially powerless government posts.  |Several_revolts_erupted|Philippine_Revolts_Against_Spain|  against Spain but were all defeated. In 1808, when  |Joseph_Bonaparte|Joseph_Bonaparte|  became king of Spain, the liberal  |constitution_of_Cadiz|Constitution_Of_Cadiz|  was adopted, giving the Philippines representation to the  |Spanish_Cortes|Spanish_Cortes| . However, once the Spanish overthrew the Bonapartes, the Philippine, and indeed colonial, representation in the Spanish Cortes was rescinded.     The restoration of Philippine representation to the Cortes was one of the grievances of the  |Illustrados|Illustrados| , the learned indigenous class during the late 1800s. The Illustrados mounted a campaign that would include indigenous voices in running the government. However, the  |Katipunan|Katipunan|  advocated complete Philippine independence, thereby starting the  |Philippine_Revolution|Philippine_Revolution|  in 1896. After the execution of  |José_Rizal|José_Rizal|  on December 30, 1896, the leader of the Illustrados who disapproved of the revolution, the rebellion intensified.  |Cavite|Cavite| , Bulacan and Morong were the main areas of conflict; the Katipunan in Cavite had won several battles against the Spaniards, but was split into the  |Magdiwang|Magdiwang|  and  |Magdalo|Magdalo|  factions. A  |conference|Tejeros_Convention|  was held in 1897 to unite the two factions, but instead caused further division that led to the execution of  |Andres_Bonifacio|Andres_Bonifacio| , who was then the leader of the Katipunan; Bonifacios death passed the control of the Katipunan to  |Emilio_Aguinaldo|Emilio_Aguinaldo| .     The death of Bonifacio also caused several of the revolutionaries to be demoralized; Aguinaldo and his men retreated northward until reaching Biak-na-Bato in  |San_Miguel_Bulacan|San_Miguel_Bulacan| . The Spaniards and the revolutionaries signed the  |Pact_of_Biak_na_Bato|Pact_Of_Biak_Na_Bato| , that provided for Aguinaldos surrender and exile to Hong Kong, and amnesty and payment of indemnities by the Spaniards to the revolutionaries. However, both sides eventually violated the agreement, and this allowed the United States admiral  |George_Dewey|George_Dewey|  to  |lead_his_squadron|Battle_Of_Manila_Bay|  to  |Manila_Bay|Manila_Bay| , defeating the Spanish navy. Aguinaldo returned from exile, most of the Philippine revolutionaries rallying to his cause, and negotiated with the Americans, while the Americans in 1898 defeated the Spaniards in what was called  |a_mock_battle_in_Manila|Battle_Of_Manila| , and took control of the city. Aguinaldo then  |proclaimed_the_independence|Philippine_Declaration_Of_Independence|  of the Philippines on June 12, 1898, at his home in Cavite. A  |Congress|Revolutionary_Government_Of_The_Philippines|  was convened in January 1899 in  |Barasoain_Church|Barasoain_Church|  and inaugurated the  |first_Philippine_Republic|First_Philippine_Republic| .     The  |Philippine–American_War|Philippine–American_War|  erupted in February in a  |skirmish_in_Manila|Battle_Of_Manila| ; the Filipinos lost the battle, and Aguinaldo again began a northward retreat. Aguinaldo was captured on April 1, 1901, at  |Palanan_Isabela|Palanan_Isabela| , while the Americans had already started setting up civil governments in areas that had already been pacified.             The Americans gave Filipinos limited self-government at the local level by 1901, and the Americans passed the  |Philippine_Organic_Act|Philippine_Organic_Act|  in 1902 to introduce a national government; by 1907,  |an_election|1907_Philippine_Assembly_Elections|  to the  |Philippine_Assembly|Philippine_Assembly|  was held. Led by  |Sergio_Osmeña|Sergio_Osmeña| , the assembly was held predominantly by the  |Nacionalista_Party|Nacionalista_Party| , which advocated independence; they were opposed by the  |Progresista_Party|Progresista_Party| , which advocated statehood within the United States. The Americans controlled the  |Philippine_Commission|Philippine_Commission| , the upper house of the  |Philippine_Legislature|Philippine_Legislature| . The Nacionalista-dominated Philippine Assembly, and later the  |Philippine_Senate|Philippine_Senate| , which was created by the  |Jones_Law|Jones_Law|  and replaced the Philippine Commission, was often at odds with the  |Governor_General|Governor_General_Of_The_Philippines| . However, the Nacionalistas were split into camps loyal to Osmeña and Senate President  |Manuel_L_Quezon|Manuel_L_Quezon| . Several independence missions were sent to  |Washington_D_C_|Washington_D_C_| ; the  |OsRox_Mission|Osrox_Mission|  led by Osmeña and House Speaker  |Manuel_Roxas|Manuel_Roxas|  resulted in the  |Hare–Hawes–Cutting_Act|Hare–Hawes–Cutting_Act| . However, the Senate rejected this; a new law, the  |Tydings–McDuffie_Act|Tydings–Mcduffie_Act|  which was marginally different and more importantly, was supported by Quezon, was approved and paved the way for the  |Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines|Commonwealth_Of_The_Philippines| .     Quezon and Osmeña reconciled, and both were easily elected as president and vice president respectively, in  |1935|1935_Philippine_Presidential_Election| . The Nacionalistas controlled the now  |unicameral|Unicameral| |_National_Assembly|National_Assembly_Of_The_Philippines|  for the entirety of the Commonwealth, with the understanding that the Americans would grant independence in the near future. Quezon pressed for constitutional amendments that would allow him to obtain a second term and the restoration of a bicameral legislature. Quezon did obtain both amendments, with the newly restored Senate now being elected  |at_large|At_Large|  instead of per districts, as what was done during the pre-Commonwealth era. Quezon, Osmeña and the Nacionalista Party as a whole both won the  |elections_in_1941|1941_Philippine_General_Election|  in much larger margins.     The  |Japanese_invasion_of_1941|Battle_Of_The_Philippines|  at the onset of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  delayed this granting of independence, forced the Commonwealth government to go into exile, and subjected the country to a puppet government. The  |KALIBAPI|Kalibapi|  became the sole legal political party, and  |Jose_P_Laurel|Jose_P_Laurel|  was declared president of the  |Second_Philippine_Republic|Second_Philippine_Republic| . This nationalist KALIBAPI government espoused anti-American sentiment. Exiled leaders of the previous first Commonwealth government, including Quezon and Osmeña, provided limited support to the U.S. Despite the relationship with Japanese officials and opposition to U.S. control, the nationalist KALIBAPI government of Laurel refused to declare war on the U.S. However, the Americans reconquered the country in 1944, and Osmeña, who had succeeded Quezon upon the latters death, restored the Commonwealth government. The first meeting of a bicameral Commonwealth Congress occurred.     The Nacionalistas were divided during the  |1946_presidential_election|1946_Philippine_Presidential_Election| , with  |Manuel_Roxas|Manuel_Roxas|  setting up what would later be the  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party| . Roxas defeated Osmeña, and became the last president of the Commonwealth; the Americans agreed to grant independence on July 4, 1946.             Roxas succumbed to a heart attack in 1948, allowing Vice President  |Elpidio_Quirino|Elpidio_Quirino|  to rule the country for the next six years, after winning in  |1949|1949_Philippine_Presidential_Election| . Quirinos Liberal government was widely seen as corrupt and was easily beaten by his former Defense secretary  |Ramon_Magsaysay|Ramon_Magsaysay|  in the  |1953_election|1953_Philippine_Presidential_Election| . Magsaysay, who oversaw the surrender of the long implemented a Filipino First policy and an austerity program. Garcia was defeated by his Vice President,  |Diosdado_Macapagal|Diosdado_Macapagal|  of the Liberal Party, in 1961. Macapagal initiated a return to a system of free enterprise not seen since the Quirino administration. However, Macapagals policies faced stiff opposition in  |Congress|Congress_Of_The_Philippines| , where the Nacionalistas hold the majority. Macapagal was defeated in  |1965|1965_Philippine_Presidential_Election|  by Senator  |Ferdinand_Marcos|Ferdinand_Marcos| .     Marcos infrastructure projects were the feature policy of his term, he was the first president to be reelected, in  |1969|1969_Philippine_Presidential_Election| , although the election was tainted by violence and allegations that Marcos used the treasury to fund his campaign. However, significant protests, such as the  |First_Quarter_Storm|First_Quarter_Storm| , the  |communist|Cpp_Npa_Ndf_Rebellion|  and  |Moro_insurgencies|Moro_Insurgency_In_The_Philippines| , and civil unrest, heightened. This made Marcos in 1972 declare  |martial_law|Martial_Law|  and suspend the constitution. A new constitution calling for a  |semi_presidential|Semi_Presidential_System|  government was approved in 1973, but Marcos still ruled by decree until 1978, when the  |Interim_Batasang_Pambansa|Interim_Batasang_Pambansa|  was elected. However, opposition groups, whose leaders mostly had already left in exile, boycotted the election, and Marcos still allowed martial law to continue. Marcos did end martial law in 1981, but opposition groups still boycotted the  |1981_presidential_election|1981_Philippine_Presidential_Election| , which Marcos easily won.     Opposition leader  |Benigno_Aquino_Jr_|Benigno_Aquino_Jr_|  was slain upon his return to the country in 1983. By this time, the government was marred by alleged rampant corruption and allegations of human rights violations. The opposition participated in the  |1984_parliamentary_election|1984_Philippine_Parliamentary_Election|  and won several seats, but not enough to topple Marcos  |KBL|Kilusang_Bagong_Lipunan| . To counter growing opposition, Marcos called a  |snap_election_in_1986|1986_Philippine_Presidential_Election| , the opposition nominated Benignos widow Corazon as their candidate. Marcos was declared the winner, but the opposition refused to accept the result, alleging that the election was rigged. The  |People_Power_Revolution|People_Power_Revolution|  drove Marcos from power, and Aquino became president. Aquino ruled by decree in 1987 when a new constitution restoring the presidential system was approved. In the ensuing  |legislative_election|1987_Philippine_Legislative_Election| , the administration parties won most of the seats in Congress.             Aquinos government was mired by  |coup_attempts|1986–90_Philippine_Coup_Attempts| , high inflation and unemployment, and natural calamities, but introduced land reform and market liberalization. Aquinos administration also saw the pullout of the U.S. bases in Subic Bay and Clark. As the  |1992_election|1992_Philippine_Presidential_Election|  grew closer, Aquino declined to run even though she could do so, and instead supported  |Ramon_Mitra|Ramon_Mitra| ; she later backtracked and threw her support to  |Fidel_V_Ramos|Fidel_V_Ramos| , who later won albeit under controversial circumstances. Ramos had to face an ongoing energy crisis that had started during the Aquino administration which was resolved when Ramos issued contracts favorable to power producers. The Ramos administration hosted the 1996 APEC summit, reinstated the death penalty, signed a peace agreement with the  |Moro_National_Liberation_Front|Moro_National_Liberation_Front| , and bore the brunt of the  |1997_Asian_financial_crisis|1997_Asian_Financial_Crisis| . He wanted to amend the constitution, but Aquino and other sectors opposed the measure and backed off. Ramos vice president  |Joseph_Estrada|Joseph_Estrada|  defeated the formers party mate  |Jose_de_Venecia|Jose_De_Venecia|  and several others in the  |1998_election|1998_Philippine_Presidential_Election|  in a comfortable margin; meanwhile de Venecias running mate  |Gloria_Macapagal_Arroyo|Gloria_Macapagal_Arroyo|  was elected vice president.     Estrada expanded the land reform program and the death penalty and refused to sign contracts with sovereign guarantees on public projects. Estrada also wanted to amend the constitution but was again rebuffed by Aquino, the Catholic Church, and the left. The administration launched an all-out war against the  |Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front|Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front|  that saw the government retaking Camp Abubakar, the main rebel encampment. However, the administration was embroiled in charges of cronyism and corruption; the Juetengate scandal led to his impeachment by the  |House_of_Representatives|House_Of_Representatives_Of_The_Philippines| . In the impeachment trial, Estradas allies in the Senate successfully prevented evidence to be presented; this triggered massive protests. Days later, in what would be called the  |2001_EDSA_Revolution|2001_Edsa_Revolution| , the  |Armed_Forces_of_the_Philippines|Armed_Forces_Of_The_Philippines|  withdrew their support to Estrada and transferred their allegiance to Vice President Arroyo; the Supreme Court later ruled the presidency as vacant, and Estrada left  |Malacañang_Palace|Malacañang_Palace| .     Arroyo was sworn in as president on January 20, 2001. Four months later, Estradas supporters  |lay_siege|Edsa_Iii|  to the presidential palace but were later expelled; Arroyos  |People_Power_Coalition|People_Power_Coalition|  won a majority of seats in the  |2001_elections|2001_Philippine_General_Election|  and therefore consolidated power. In 2003, Arroyo put down  |a_coup_attempt|Oakwood_Mutiny|  in the central business district. Arroyo faced  |Fernando_Poe_Jr_|Fernando_Poe_Jr_| , a friend of Estrada, along with three others in  |2004|2004_Philippine_Presidential_Election| , and won on a slim plurality. Months after Poe died in December, it was exposed, via wiretapped conversations, that Arroyo  |rigged_the_election|Hello_Garci_Scandal| . On a national address, Arroyo said that she was sorry on a lapse of judgment. The opposition did not let up, and she had to put down two more coup attempts. The opposition united in the  |2007_Senate_election|2007_Philippine_Senate_Election|  and won easily, but Arroyos allies still held the House of Representatives. At the end of her presidency, Arroyo became the most unpopular president on record, with increases on taxes, attempts to amend the constitution, and the alleged illegitimacy of her administration as the reasons.     Before the  |2010_election|2010_Election| , Arroyos party nominated  |Gilberto_Teodoro|Gilberto_Teodoro|  for president; however, some quarters suggested that Arroyo was secretly supporting  |Manny_Villar|Manny_Villar| , who was the frontrunner. However, former president Aquino died, and her son,  |Benigno_Aquino_III|Benigno_Aquino_Iii| , overtook Villar in the polls. Estrada overtook Villar in the polls but still lost to Aquino. Aquino embarked on an anti-corruption drive, saw the economy grew and maintain high popularity. However, with natural calamities, and  |scams_on_the_use_of_pork_barrel|Priority_Development_Assistance_Fund_Scam|  and other discretionary funds coming into the light, the Aquino administration had to contend with rising opposition.     In 2016, Aquinos handpicked successor,  |Mar_Roxas|Mar_Roxas| , grandson of Manuel Roxas, was decisively defeated by  |Davao_City|Davao_City|  mayor  |Rodrigo_Duterte|Rodrigo_Duterte|  in the  |2016_Presidential_Election|2016_Philippine_Presidential_Election| . Duterte then implemented a  |massive_War_on_Drugs|Philippine_Drug_War| .       Due to the lack of indigenous representation in both houses of Congress, a proposal has been made where an ethnic legislative council will be established. This council of ethnic groups shall have one representation from every ethnolinguistic tribe in the country, totaling 135 council members. The council shall have at least 5 representations in the House of Representatives and 1 in the Senate. The representing members to be put in the House and the Senate shall be determined by the 135 council members among themselves. According to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, through its Atlas Filipinas as certified by the  |National_Commission_for_Culture_and_the_Arts|National_Commission_For_Culture_And_The_Arts| , there are 135 living languages in the Philippines, each belonging to one ethnolinguistic tribe. Each ethnic member shall be elected by citizens with the same ethnic inclination. The proposal is slated to solve the under-representation of ethnolinguistic tribes outside metropolitan areas in Philippine politics, thus empowering both the people of the provinces and the people belonging to indigenous classifications.
