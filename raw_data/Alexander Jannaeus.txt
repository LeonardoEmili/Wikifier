For other people with this name, see Alexander         Alexander Jannaeus  was the second  |Hasmonean_King_of_Judaea|Hasmonean_Dynasty|  from 103 to 76  BCE. A son of  |John_Hyrcanus|John_Hyrcanus| , he inherited the throne from his brother  |Aristobulus_I|Aristobulus_I| , and married his brothers widow, Queen  |Salome_Alexandra|Salome_Alexandra| . From his conquests to expand the kingdom to a bloody civil war, Alexanders reign has been generalized as cruel and oppressive with never ending conflict.       Alexander Jannaeus was the third son of John Hyrcanus, by his second wife. When Aristobulus I, Hyrcanus son by his first wife, became king, he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half-brother. Aristobulus died after a reign of one year. Upon his death, his widow,  |Salome_Alexandra|Salome_Alexandra|  had Alexander and his brothers released from prison. One of these brothers is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne.     Alexander, as the oldest living brother, had the right not only to the throne but also to Salome,  |the_widow_of_his_deceased_brother_who_had_died_childless|Yibbum| ; and, although she was thirteen years older than him, he married her in accordance with Jewish law. By her, he had two sons, the eldest,  |Hyrcanus_II|Hyrcanus_Ii|  became high-priest in 62  BCE and  |Aristobulus_II|Aristobulus_Ii|  who was high-priest from 66 - 62  BCE and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by  |Pompey_the_Great|Pompey| . Like his brother he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the  |Sadducees|Sadducees| , his wife Salome on the other hand came from a  |pharisaic|Pharisaic|  family , and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign. Like his father, Alexander also served as the high priest. This raised the ire of the Rabbis who insisted that these two offices should not be combined. According to the Talmud, Yannai was a questionable desecrated priest and was not allowed to serve in the temple according to the rabbis, this infuriated the king and sided with the Sadducees who defended him. This incident led the king to turn against the Pharisees and persecute them until his death.       Alexanders first expedition was against the city of  |Ptolemais|Acre_Israel| . While Alexander went forward to siege the city, Zoilus of  |Dora|Dor_Israel|  took the opportunity to see if he could liberate Ptolemais in hopes of establishing his rule over coastal territories. Alexanders Hasmonean army quickly defeated Zoiluss forces. Ptolemais then requested aid from  |Ptolemy_IX_Lathyros|Ptolemy_Ix_Lathyros| , who had been banished by his mother  |Cleopatra_III|Cleopatra_Iii_Of_Egypt| ; Ptolemy founded a kingdom in  |Cyprus|History_Of_Cyprus|  after being cast out by his mother. The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt by sea. However, an individual named Demaenetus convinced the inhabitants of their imprudent request for assistance. Realizing they had allied themselves with Ptolemy, they had unintentionally declared war on Cleopatra. When Ptolemy arrived at the city, the inhabitants denied him access.     Alexander too didnt want to be involved in a war between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, so he abandoned his campaign against Ptolemais and returned to  |Jeruselum|Jeruselum| . After he offered Ptolemy four hundred  |talents|Talent|  and a peace treaty in return for Zoiluss death, Alexander met him with treachery by negotiating an alliance with Cleopatra. When Alexander formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Alexaders conquest continued by capturing the coastal cities of Dora and  |Stratons_Tower|Caesarea_Maritima| . As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexanders scheme, he was determined to kill him. Ptolemy began to attack Ptolemais, but left his generals to besiege the city while he continued to pursue Alexander. Ptolemys pursuit had caused much destruction in the  |Galilee_region|Galilee|  and captured  |Asochis|Shikhin|  on the  |Sabbath|Sabbath| , taking ten thousand people as prisoners. Ptolemy also initiated an attack upon  |Sepphoris|Sepphoris|  but was unsuccessful.       Ptolemy and Alexander engaged in battle at Asophon near the  |Jordan_River|Jordan_River| . Estimated to have fifty thousand to eighty thousand soldiers, Alexanders army consisted of both  |Jews|Jews|  and  |pagans|Paganism| . At the head of his armed forces were his elite pagan mercenaries; They specialized in  |Greek_style|Ancient_Greek_Warfare| |_phalanx|Phalanx| . One of Ptolemys commanders, Philostephanus, commenced the first attack by crossing the river that divides both forces. The Hasmoneans had the advantage, however, Philostephanus held back a certain amount of his forces whom he sent to recover lost ground. Perceiving as vast reinforcements, Alexanders army fled. Some of his retreating forces tried to push back but quickly dispersed as Ptolemys forces pursued Alexanders fleeing army; Thirty thousand to fifty thousand Hasmonean soldiers died.     Ptolemys forces at Ptolemais also succeeded in capturing the city. He then continued to conquer much of the Hasmonean Kingdom, occupying the entirety of northern Judea, the coast, and territories east of the Jordan River. While doing so, he pillaged villages and ordered his soldiers to cannibalize women and children to create psychological fear towards his enemies. At the time, Salome Alexandra was notified of Cleopatras approachment to Judea.       Realizing that her son amassed a formidable force in Judea, Cleopatra appointed Jewish generals Ananias and Chelkias to command her forces. She too also went with a fleet towards Judea. When Cleopatra arrived at Ptolemais, the people refused her entry so she besieged the city. Ptolemy, believing Syria was defenseless, withdrew to Cyprus after his miscalculation. While in pursuit of Ptolemy, Chelkias died at  |Coele_Syria|Coele_Syria| .     After Ptolemy was defeated, Alexander had approached Cleopatra. Bowing before her, he requested to retain his rule. Cleopatra was urged by her subordinates to annex Judea. However, Ananias demanded she consider the residential Egyptian Jews who were the main support of her throne. This induced Cleopatra to modify her longings for Judea. Alexander and Cleopatra then met at  |Scythopolis|Beit_Shean|  to begin negotiations. He met her demands and suspended his campaigns. Cleopatra died five years after. Confident, after her death, Alexander found himself free to continue with new campaigns.          Alexander captured  |Gadara|Umm_Qais|  and fought to capture the strong fortress of  |Amathus|Amathus_Transjordan|  in the  |Transjordan|Transjordan|  region but was defeated. Alexander was more successful in his expedition against the coastal cities, capturing  |Raphia|Rafah|  and  |Anthedon|Anthedon| . In 96 BCE, Jannaeus defeated the inhabitants of  |Gaza|Gaza_City| . This victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet of the  |Nabatean|Nabataean_Kingdom|  trade routes. Alexander initially returned his focus back to the Transjordan region, avenging his previous defeat, he destroyed Amathus.       Determined to proceed with future campaigns despite his defeat at Amathus, Alexander set his focus on Gaza. His campaign against the city wasnt so easily achieved. Gazas general Apollodotus strategically employed a night attack against the Hasmonean army. With a force of two thousand less-skilled soldiers and ten thousand slaves, Gazas military was able to deceive the Hasmonean army into believing they were being attacked by Ptolemy. The Gazans killed many, and the Hasmonean army fled the battle. When morning exposed the delusive tactic, Alexader continued his assault but lost a thousand additional soldiers.     The Gazans still remained defiant in hopes that the Nabatean Kingdom would come to their aid. The city, however, would eventually suffer defeat from its leadership. Gaza at the time was governed by two brothers, Lysimachus and Apollodotus. Lysimachus had finally convinced the people to surrender, and Alexander peacefully entered the city. Though what seemed like an unaggressive Alexander, he suddenly ravaged the inhabitants. Now some men out of desperation killed their wives and children to ensure they wouldnt be captured and enslaved. Others burned down their homes to prevent the soldiers from plundering. The town council and five hundred civilians took refuge at the  |Temple_of_Apollo|Apollo| . There, Alexander massacred them.            The Judean Civil War initially began after the conquest of Gaza around 99 BCE. Due to Jannaeuss victory at Gaza, the Nabatean kingdom no longer had access to the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea| . Alexander soon captured Gadara, which caused the Nabateans to lose their main trade routes leading to  |Rome|Ancient_Rome|  and  |Damascus|Ancient_City_Of_Damascus| . After losing Gadara, the Nabatean king  |Obodas_I|Obodas_I|  launched an attack against Alexander in a steep valley in Gadara where Alexander barely managed to escape. After Jannaeus was defeated in the  |Battle_of_Gadara|Battle_Of_Gadara|  against the Nabataeans, he returned to Jerusalem only to be met with fierce Jewish opposition.       During the Jewish holiday  |Feast_of_Tabernacles|Sukkot| , Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the  |High_Priest|High_Priest_Of_Israel|  at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his displeasure against the Pharisees by refusing to perform the water  |libation|Libation|  ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting him with  |etrogim|Etrog|  . Outraged, he ordered soldiers to kill those who insulted him, which lead to the massacre of six thousand people in the Temple courtyard. With further frustration, Alexander had wooden barriers built around the altars preventing people from sacrificing and denied daily offerings except for the priests. This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War by igniting popular opposition against Jannaeus.       After Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with  |Demetrius_III_Eucaerus|Demetrius_Iii_Eucaerus|  to fight against Jannaeus. Alexander had gathered six thousand, two hundred mercenaries and twenty thousand Jews for battle as Demetrius had forty thousand soldiers and three thousand horses. There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon positions but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at  |Shechem|Shechem| , and all of Alexanders mercenaries were killed in battle. This defeat forced Alexander to take refuge in the mountains. In sympathy towards Jannaeus, six thousand Judean rebels ultimately returned to him. In fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. Nevertheless, war between Jannaeus and the rebels who returned to him continued. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of Bethoma until they were defeated.     Jannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he had eight hundred Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their deaths, Alexander had the rebels wives and children executed before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines. Alexander later returned the land he had seized from the Nabateans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish rebels. The remaining rebels, who numbered eight thousand, fled by night in fear of Alexander. Afterward, all rebel hostility ceased and Alexanders reign continued undisturbed.       The remainder of Alexanders life continued in his final campaigns. The Nabatean king  |Aretas_III|Aretas_Iii|  had defeated Alexander in battle, however, Alexander continued his Hasmonean expansion in the Transjordan region. In Gaulantis, he captured the cities of  |Gamala|Gamla|  and Selecuia. In Gaulana and Galaaditis, the cities of Duim,  |Gerasa|Jerash| , and Pella; Pella was destroyed by Alexanders soldiers for refusing to accept their  |ancestral_religion|Judaism| . He had taken  |Hippos|Hippos| ; Alexander captured all these cities in a period of three years . Three years later, Alexander had succumbed to an illness during the siege of Ragaba.
