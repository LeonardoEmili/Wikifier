The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience.          Miles Davis is considered one of the most innovative, influential, and respected figures in the history of music.  The Guardian  described him as a pioneer of 20th-century music, leading many of the key developments in the world of jazz.  He has been called one of the great innovators in jazz ,  and had the titles Prince of Darkness and the Picasso of Jazz bestowed upon him. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said, Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music.      William Ruhlmann of ": null

It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasnt there to push it forward.  Music writer Christopher Smith wrote,     Miles Davis artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary.  ... Miles performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.     His approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.
