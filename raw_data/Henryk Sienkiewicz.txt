                    Henryk Adam Aleksander Pius Sienkiewicz , also known by the pseudonym Litwos , was a  |Polish|Poles|  journalist, novelist and  |Nobel_Prize_laureate|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature| . He is best remembered for his historical novels, especially for his internationally known best-seller  Quo Vadis  .     Born into an impoverished  |Polish_noble_family|Szlachta|  in Russian-ruled  |Congress_Poland|Congress_Poland| , in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity. He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  for his outstanding merits as an epic writer.     Many of his novels remain in print. In Poland he is best known for his  |Trilogy|The_Trilogy|  of historical novels –  With Fire and Sword ,  The Deluge , and  Sir Michael  – set in the 17th-century  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth| ; internationally he is best known for  Quo Vadis , set in  |Neros|Nero| |Rome|Ancient_Rome| . The Trilogy and Quo Vadis have been filmed, the latter several times, with Hollywoods  |1951_version|Quo_Vadis|  receiving the most international recognition.           Sienkiewicz was born on 5 May 1846 in  |Wola_Okrzejska|Wola_Okrzejska| , now a village in the central part of eastern Polish region of  |Lubelskie|Lublin_Voivodeship| , then part of the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| . His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his fathers side deriving from  |Tatars|Lipka_Tatars|  who had settled in the  |Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania|Grand_Duchy_Of_Lithuania| . His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz and Stefania Cieciszowska . His mother descended from an old and affluent  |Podlachia|Podlachia| n family. He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz , and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish  |Oszyk_coat_of_arms|Oszyk_Coat_Of_Arms| . Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writers maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in  |Grabowce_Górne|Grabowce_Górne| ,  |Wężyczyn|Wężyczyn|  and  |Burzec|Burzec| . In September 1858 he began his education in  |Warsaw|Warsaw| , where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house  in eastern Warsaws  |Praga|Praga|  district. He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.      Due to the hard times, 19-year-old Sienkiewicz took a job as tutor to the  |Weyher_family|Weyher_Family|  in  |Płońsk|Płońsk| . It was probably in this period that he wrote his first novel, Ofiara ; he is thought to have destroyed the manuscript of the never-published novel. He also worked on his first novel to be published, Na marne . He completed extramural secondary-school classes, and in 1866 he received his secondary-school diploma. He first tried to study medicine, then law, at the  |Imperial_University_of_Warsaw|University_Of_Warsaw| , but he soon transferred to the universitys Institute of Philology and History, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of literature and  |Old_Polish_Language|Old_Polish_Language| . Little is known about this period of his life, other than that he moved out of his parents home, tutored part-time, and lived in poverty. His situation improved somewhat in 1868 when he became tutor to the princely Woroniecki family.     In 1867 he wrote a rhymed piece, Sielanka Młodości , which was rejected by  Tygodnik Ilustrowany  . In 1869 he debuted as a journalist; Przegląd Tygodniowy ran his review of a play on 18 April 1869, and shortly afterward The Illustrated Weekly printed an essay of his about the late-Renaissance Polish poet  |Mikołaj_Sęp_Szarzyński|Mikołaj_Sęp_Szarzyński| . He completed his university studies in 1871, though he failed to receive a diploma because he did not pass the examination in  |Greek_language|Greek_Language| . Sienkiewicz also wrote for Gazeta Polska and Niwa , under the pen name Litwos . In 1873 he began writing a column,  Bez tytułu , in The Polish Gazette; in 1874 a column, Sprawy bieżące for Niwa; and in 1875 the column, Chwila obecna . He also collaborated on a Polish translation, published in 1874, of  |Victor_Hugos|Victor_Hugo|  last novel,  Ninety-Three . In June that year, he became co-owner of Niwa .     Meanwhile, in 1872, he had debuted as a fiction writer with his short novel Na marne , published in the magazine Wieniec . This was followed by Humoreski z teki Woroszyłły , Stary Sługa , Hania and Selim Mirza . The last three are known as the Little Trilogy . These publications made him a prominent figure in Warsaws journalistic-literary world, and a guest at popular dinner parties hosted by actress  |Helena_Modrzejewska|Helena_Modrzejewska| .          In 1874 Sienkiewicz was briefly engaged to Maria Keller, and traveled abroad to  |Brussels|Brussels|  and Paris. Soon after he returned, his fiancées parents cancelled the engagement. In 1876 Sienkiewicz went to the  |United_States|United_States|  with Helena Modrzejewska  and her husband. He traveled via  |London|London|  to  |New_York|New_York_City|  and then on to  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco| , staying for some time in  |California|California| . His travels were financed by Gazeta Polska in exchange for a series of travel essays: Sienkiewicz wrote Listy z podróży and Listy Litwosa z Podróży , which were published in The Polish Gazette in 1876–78 and republished as a book in 1880. Other articles by him also appeared in Przegląd Tygodniowy and Przewodnik Naukowy i Literacki , discussing the situation of  |American_Polonia|American_Polonia| . He briefly lived in the town of  |Anaheim|Anaheim| , later in Anaheim Landing . He hunted, visited  |Native_American|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  camps, traveled in the nearby mountains , and visited the  |Mojave_Desert|Mojave_Desert| ,  |Yosemite_Valley|Yosemite_Valley| , and the  |silver_mines|Silver_Mine|  at  |Virginia_City,_Nevada|Virginia_City,_Nevada| . On 20 August 1877 he witnessed Modjeskas U.S. theatrical debut at San Franciscos  |California_Theatre|California_Theatre| , which he reviewed for The Polish Gazette; and on 8 September he published in the Daily Evening Post an article, translated into English for him by Modjeska, on Poland and Russia .     In America he also continued writing fiction, in 1877 publishing Szkice węglem in The Polish Gazette. He wrote a play, Na przebój, soon retitled Na jedną kartę , later staged at  |Lviv|Lviv|  and, to a better reception, at Warsaw . He also wrote a play for Modjeska, aimed at an American public, Z walki tutejszych partii , but it was never performed or published, and the manuscript appears to be lost.     On 24 March 1878 Sienkiewicz left the U.S. for Europe. He first stayed in London, then for a year in Paris, delaying his return to Poland due to rumors of possible conscription into the  |Imperial_Russian_Army|Imperial_Russian_Army|  on the eve of a predicted new war with Turkey.             In April 1879 Sienkiewicz returned to Polish soil. In  |Lviv|Lviv|  he gave a lecture that was not well attended: Z Nowego Jorku do Kalifornii . Subsequent lectures in  |Szczawnica|Szczawnica|  and  |Krynica|Krynica-Zdrój|  in July–August that year, and in Warsaw and  |Poznań|Poznań|  the following year, were much more successful. In late summer 1879 he went to Venice and Rome, which he toured for the next few weeks, on 7 November 1879 returning to Warsaw. There he met Maria Szetkiewicz, whom he married on 18 August 1881. The marriage was reportedly a happy one. The couple had two children, Henryk Józef and Jadwiga Maria . It was a short-lived marriage, however, because on 18 August 1885 Maria died of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| .     In 1879 the first collected edition of Sienkiewiczs works was published, in four volumes; the series would continue to 1917, ending with a total of 17 volumes. He also continued writing journalistic pieces, mainly in The Polish Gazette and Niwa. In 1881 he published a favorable review of the first collected edition of works by  |Bolesław_Prus|Bolesław_Prus| .     In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a historical novella, Niewola tatarska . In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief of a new Warsaw newspaper, Słowo . This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in the running of the newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the papers literary section until 1892.     From 1883 he increasingly shifted his focus from short pieces to historical novels. He began work on the historical novel, Ogniem i Mieczem . Initially titled Wilcze gniazdo , it appeared in  |serial_installments|Serial_Novel|  in The Word from May 1883 to March 1884. It also ran concurrently in the Kraków newspaper, Czas .     Sienkiewicz soon began writing the second volume of his Trilogy,  Potop  . It ran in The Word from December 1884 to September 1886. Beginning in 1884, Sienkiewicz accompanied his wife Maria to foreign  |sanatoriums|Sanatorium| . After her death, he kept on traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wifes parents, though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and  |Kraków|Kraków|  beginning in the 1890s. After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his  |Trilogy|The_Trilogy|  appeared –  Pan Wołodyjowski  – running in The Word from May 1887 to May 1888. The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer.     Sienkiewicz received 15,000  |rubles|Ruble| , in recognition of his achievements, from an unknown admirer who signed himself  |Michał_Wołodyjowski|Michał_Wołodyjowski|  after the Trilogy character. Sienkiewicz used the money to set up a fund, named for his wife and supervised by the  |Academy_of_Learning|Academy_Of_Learning| , to aid artists endangered by tuberculosis.     In 1886, he visited  |Istanbul|Istanbul| ; in 1888, Spain. At the end of 1890 he went to Africa, resulting in Listy z Afryki . The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels. In 1891 his novel  Without dogma  , previously serialized in 1889–90 in The Word, was published in book form. In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Połanieckich , which was serialized in The Polish Gazette from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894.       Sienkiewicz had several romances, and in 1892 Maria Romanowska-Wołodkowicz, stepdaughter of a wealthy  |Odessa|Odessa| n, entered his life. He and Romanowska became engaged there in 1893 and married in Kraków on 11 November. Just two weeks later, however, his bride left him; Sienkiewicz blamed in-law intrigues . On 13 December 1895 he obtained  |papal|Pope|  consent to dissolution of the marriage. In 1904 he  |married_his_niece|Avunculate_Marriage| , Maria Babska.     Sienkiewicz used his growing international fame to influence world opinion in favor of the Polish cause . He often criticized German policies of  |Germanization|Germanization|  of the  |Polish_minority_in_Germany|Polish_Minority_In_Germany| ; in 1901 he expressed support of  |Września_schoolchildren_who_were_protesting_the_banning_of_the_Polish_language|Wrześniawrześnia_School_Strike_Of_1901| . More cautiously, he called on Russias government to introduce reforms in Russian-controlled  |Congress_Poland|Congress_Poland| . During the  |Revolution_in_the_Kingdom_of_Poland|Revolution_In_The_Kingdom_Of_Poland| , he advocated broader Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire.      Sienkiewicz maintained some ties with Polish right-wing  |National_Democracy|National_Democracy|  politicians and was critical of the socialists, but he was generally a moderate and declined to become a politician and a deputy to the  |Russian_Duma|State_Duma_Of_The_Russian_Empire| . In the cultural sphere, he was involved in the creation of the  |Kraków|Adam_Mickiewicz_Monument,_Kraków|  and  |Warsaw_monuments_to_Adam_Mickiewicz|Adam_Mickiewicz_Monument,_Warsaw| . He supported educational endeavors and co-founded the Polska Macierz Szkolna organization. Reasonably wealthy by 1908 thanks to sales of his books, he often used his new wealth to support struggling writers. He helped gather funds for social-welfare projects such as starvation relief, and for construction of a tuberculosis sanatorium at  |Zakopane|Zakopane| . He was as prominent in philanthropy as in literature.     In February 1895 he wrote the first chapters of  |Quo_Vadis|Quo_Vadis| . The novel was serialized, beginning in March 1895, in Warsaws Polish Gazette, Krakóws Czas , and  |Poznańs|Poznań|  Dziennik Poznański . The novel was finished by March 1896. The book edition appeared later the same year, and soon gained international renown. In February 1897 he began serializing a new novel,  |Krzyżacy|The_Teutonic_Knights|  ; serialization finished in 1900, and the book edition appeared that year.     In 1900, with a three-year delay due to the approaching centenary of  |Mickiewiczs|Mickiewicz|  birth, Sienkiewicz celebrated his own quarter-century, begun in 1872, as a writer. Special events were held in a number of Polish cities, including Kraków, Lwów and Poznań. A jubilee committee presented him with a gift from the Polish people: an estate at  |Oblęgorek|Oblęgorek| , near  |Kielce|Kielce| , where he later opened a school for children.     In 1905 he won a Nobel Prize for his lifetime achievements as an epic writer. In his acceptance speech, he said this honor was of particular value to a son of Poland: She was pronounced dead — yet here is proof that she lives on.... She was pronounced defeated — and here is proof that she is victorious.      His social and political activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały , that was meant as the beginning of a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original  |Trilogy|The_Trilogy| , and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool , 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewiczs political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy , serialized in Kurier Warszawski , finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.     After the outbreak of  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , Sienkiewicz was visited at Oblęgorek by a  |Polish_Legions|Polish_Legions_In_World_War_I|  cavalry unit under  |Bolesław_Wieniawa-Długoszowski|Bolesław_Wieniawa-Długoszowski| . Soon after, he left for Switzerland. Together with  |Ignacy_Paderewski|Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski|  and Erazm Piltz, he established an organization for Polish war relief. He also supported the work of the  |Red_Cross|Red_Cross| . Otherwise, he eschewed politics, though shortly before his death he endorsed the  |Act_of_5th_November|Act_Of_5Th_November|  1916, a declaration by Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria and king of Hungary, pledging the creation of a Kingdom of Poland envisioned as a puppet state allied with, and controlled by, the Central Powers.          Sienkiewicz died on 15 November 1916, at the Grand Hotel du Lac in  |Vevey|Vevey| , Switzerland, where he was buried on 22 November. The cause of death was  |ischemic_heart_disease|Ischemic_Heart_Disease| . His funeral was attended by representatives of both the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  and the  |Entente|Entente_Powers| , and an address by  |Pope_Benedict_XV|Pope_Benedict_Xv|  was read.     In 1924, after Poland had regained her independence, Sienkiewiczs remains were repatriated to  |Warsaw|Warsaw| , Poland, and placed in the crypt of  |St._Johns_Cathedral|St._Johns_Archcathedral,_Warsaw| . During the coffins transit, solemn memorial ceremonies were held in a number of cities. Thousands accompanied the coffin to its Warsaw resting place, and Polands President  |Stanisław_Wojciechowski|Stanisław_Wojciechowski|  delivered a eulogy.       Sienkiewiczs early works  show him a strong supporter of  |Polish_Positivism|Positivism_In_Poland| , endorsing constructive, practical characters such as an engineer. Polish Positivism advocated economic and social modernization and deprecated armed  |irredentist|Irredentist|  struggle. Unlike most other Polish Positivist writers, Sienkiewicz was a conservative. His Little Trilogy  shows his interest in  |Polish_history|History_Of_Poland|  and his literary maturity, including fine mastery of humor and drama. His early works focused on three themes: the oppression and poverty of the peasants ; criticism of the partitioning powers ; and his voyage to the United States . His most common motif was the plight of the powerless: impoverished peasants, schoolchildren, emigrants.     His Latarnik  has been described as one of the best Polish short stories. His 1882 stories Bartek Zwycięzca and Sachem draw parallels between the tragic fates of their heroes and that of the occupied Polish nation.     His novel With Fire and Sword was enthusiastically received by readers , becoming an instant classic , though critical reception was lukewarm. The Trilogy is set in 17th-century Poland. While critics generally praised its style, they noted that some historic facts are misrepresented or distorted. The Trilogy merged elements of the  |epic|Epic|  and the historical novel, infused with special features of Sienkiewiczs style. The Trilogys patriotism worried the censors; Warsaws Russian censor I. Jankul warned Sienkiewicz that he would not allow publication of any further works of his dealing with Polish history.      Sienkiewiczs  Without dogma   was a notable artistic experiment, a self-analytical novel written as a fictitious diary. His works of the period are critical of  |decadent|Decadent_Movement|  and  |naturalistic|Naturalism|  philosophies. He had expressed his opinions on naturalism and writing, generally, early on in O naturaliźmie w powieści . A dozen years later, in 1893, he wrote that novels should strengthen and ennoble life, rather than undermining and debasing it. Later, in the early 1900s, he fell into mutual hostility with the  |Young_Poland|Young_Poland|  movement in Polish literature.     These views informed his novel  |Quo_Vadis|Quo_Vadis|  . This story of  |early_Christianity|Early_Christianity|  in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the  |Emperor_Neros|Emperor_Nero|  regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, due to its focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian  |West|Western_Culture| . The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of  |materialism|Materialism|  and decadence, and also an allegory for the strength of the Polish spirit.     His  Teutonic Knights  returned to Polands history. Describing the  |Battle_of_Grunwald|Battle_Of_Grunwald|  , a Polish-Lithuanian victory over the Germans in the  |Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic_War|Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic_War| , the book had a substantial contemporary political context in the ongoing  |Germanization|Germanization|  efforts  in  |German_Poland|German_Partition| . The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German  |National_Democracy|National_Democracy|  political movement, and became part of the Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.     It is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for Quo Vadis. While  Quo Vadis  is the novel that brought him international fame, the  |Nobel_Prize|Nobel_Prize|  does not name any particular novel, instead citing his outstanding merits as an epic writer .     Sienkiewicz often carried out substantial historic research for his novels, but he was selective in the findings that made it into the novels. Thus, for example, he prioritized Polish military victories over defeats.     Sienkiewicz kept a diary, but it has been  |lost|Lost_Works| .          About the turn of the 20th century, Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland, and one of the most popular in Germany, France, Russia, and the English-speaking world. The Trilogy went through many translations; With Fire and Sword saw at least 26 in his lifetime. Quo Vadis became extremely popular, in at least 40 different language translations, including English-language editions totaling a million copies. The American translator  |Jeremiah_Curtin|Jeremiah_Curtin|  has been credited with helping popularize his works abroad.  However, as Russia was not a signatory to the  |Berne_Convention|Berne_Convention| , he rarely received any  |royalties|Royalties|  from the translations.     Already in his lifetime his works were adapted for theatrical, operatic and musical presentations and for the emerging film industry. Writers and poets devoted works to him, or used him or his works as inspiration. Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewiczs novels, and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz-themed albums and exhibitions. The names of his characters were given to a variety of products. The popularity of Quo Vadis in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a  |Grand_Prix_de_Paris|Grand_Prix_De_Paris|  event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.     He was inducted into many international organizations and societies, including the Polish  |Academy_of_Learning|Academy_Of_Learning| , the  |Russian_Academy_of_Sciences|Russian_Academy_Of_Sciences| , the  |Serbian_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Arts|Serbian_Academy_Of_Sciences_And_Arts| , the  |Royal_Czech_Society_of_Sciences|Royal_Czech_Society_Of_Sciences| , and the Italian  |Academy_of_Arcadia|Academy_Of_Arcadia| . He received the French  Légion dhonneur  ;  |honorary_doctorates|Honorary_Doctorate|  from the  |Jagiellonian_University|Jagiellonian_University|  and  |Lwów_University|Lwów_University|  , and  |honorary_citizenship|Honorary_Citizenship|  of  |Lwów|Lwów|  . In 1905 he received the most prestigious award in the world of literature, the Nobel Prize, after having been nominated in that year by  |Hans_Hildebrand|Hans_Hildebrand| , member of the  |Swedish_Academy|Swedish_Academy| .       Named for Sienkiewicz, in Poland, are numerous streets and squares . Named for him is  |Białystoks|Białystok|   Osiedle Sienkiewicza ; city parks in  |Wrocław|Wrocław|  and  |Łódź|Łódź| ; and over 70 schools in Poland. He has statues in a number of Polish cities, including Warsaws  |Łazienki_Park|Łazienki_Park|  , and in Rome See Wikimedia Commons 26 March 2012 photo by user:Muhammad: A Sienkiewcz Mound stands at  |Okrzeja|Okrzeja| , near his birthplace,  |Wola_Okrzejska|Wola_Okrzejska| . He has been featured on a number of postage stamps.      There are three museums dedicated to him in Poland. The first, the Henryk Sienkiewicz Museum in Oblęgorek , opened in 1958. The second, founded in 1966, is in his birthplace: the Henryk Sienkiewicz Museum in Wola Okrzejska. The third opened in 1978 at Poznań.     In  |Rome|Rome|  , in the small church of  |Domine_Quo_Vadis|Church_Of_Domine_Quo_Vadis| , there is a bronze bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz. It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel  Quo Vadis  while sitting in this church.     Outside Poland, Sienkiewiczs popularity declined beginning in the  |interbellum|Interbellum| , except for Quo Vadis, which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations, including  |a_notable_American_one_in_1951|Quo_Vadis| . In Poland his works are still widely read; he is seen as a classic author, and his works are often required reading in schools. They have also been adapted for Polish films and television series.     The first critical analyses of his works were published in his lifetime. He has been the subject of a number of biographies. His works have received criticism, in his lifetime and since, as being simplistic: a view expressed notably by the 20th-century Polish novelist and dramatist  |Witold_Gombrowicz|Witold_Gombrowicz| , who described Sienkiewicz as a first-rate second-rate writer .  |Vasily_Rozanov|Vasily_Rozanov|  described Quo Vadis as not a work of art , but a crude factory-made  |oleograph|Oleograph|  , while  |Anton_Chekhov|Anton_Chekhov|  called Sienkiewiczs writing sickeningly cloying and clumsy .  Nonetheless, the Polish historian of literature  |Henryk_Markiewicz|Henryk_Markiewicz| , writing the  Polski słownik biograficzny  entry on Sienkiewicz , describes him as a master of Polish prose, as the foremost Polish writer of historical fiction, and as Polands internationally best-known writer.
