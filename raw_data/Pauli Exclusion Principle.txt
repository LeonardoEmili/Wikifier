        The Pauli exclusion principle is the  |quantum_mechanical|Quantum_Mechanics|  principle which states that two or more  |identical|Identical_Particles| |fermions|Fermion|   cannot occupy the same  |quantum_state|Quantum_State|  within a  |quantum_system|Quantum_System|  simultaneously. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist  |Wolfgang_Pauli|Wolfgang_Pauli|  in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his  |spin–statistics_theorem|Spin–Statistics_Theorem|  of 1940.     In the case of  |electrons|Electron|  in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four  |quantum_numbers|Quantum_Number| : n, the  |principal_quantum_number|Principal_Quantum_Number| , , the  |azimuthal_quantum_number|Azimuthal_Quantum_Number| , m , the  |magnetic_quantum_number|Magnetic_Quantum_Number| , and m s , the  |spin_quantum_number|Spin_Quantum_Number| . For example, if two electrons reside in the same  |orbital|Atomic_Orbital| , then their n, , and m  values are the same, therefore their m s  must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spin projections of 1/2 and −1/2.     Particles with an integer spin, or  |bosons|Boson| , are not subject to the Pauli exclusion principle: any number of identical bosons can occupy the same quantum state, as with, for instance, photons produced by a  |laser|Laser|  or atoms in a  |Bose–Einstein_condensate|Bose–Einstein_Condensate| .     A more rigorous statement is that concerning the exchange of two identical particles the total  |wave_function|Wave_Function|  is  |antisymmetric|Identical_Particlesquantum_Mechanical_Description_Of_Identical_Particles|  for fermions, and symmetric for bosons. This means that if the space and spin coordinates of two identical particles are interchanged, then the wave function changes its sign for fermions and does not change for bosons.       The Pauli exclusion principle describes the behavior of all  |fermions|Fermion|  , while  |bosons|Boson|  are subject to other principles. Fermions include  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle|  such as  |quarks|Quark| ,  |electrons|Electron|  and  |neutrinos|Neutrino| . Additionally,  |baryons|Baryon|  such as  |protons|Proton|  and  |neutrons|Neutron|   and some  |atoms|Atom|   are fermions, and are therefore described by the Pauli exclusion principle as well. Atoms can have different overall spin , which determines whether they are fermions or bosons — for example  |helium-3|Helium-3|  has spin 1/2 and is therefore a fermion, in contrast to  |helium-4|Helium-4|  which has spin 0 and is a boson.   As such, the Pauli exclusion principle underpins many properties of everyday matter, from its large-scale stability, to the  |chemical_behavior_of_atoms|Periodic_Table| .     Half-integer spin means that the intrinsic  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum|  value of fermions is   h/2   times a  |half-integer|Half-Integer|  . In the theory of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  fermions are described by  |antisymmetric_states|Identical_Particles| . In contrast, particles with integer spin have symmetric wave functions; unlike fermions they may share the same quantum states. Bosons include the  |photon|Photon| , the  |Cooper_pairs|Cooper_Pairs|  which are responsible for  |superconductivity|Superconductivity| , and the  |W_and_Z_bosons|W_And_Z_Bosons| .          In the early 20th century it became evident that atoms and molecules with even numbers of electrons are more  |chemically_stable|Chemical_Stabilityoutside_Chemistry|  than those with odd numbers of electrons. In the 1916 article The Atom and the Molecule by  |Gilbert_N._Lewis|Gilbert_N._Lewis| , for example, the third of his six postulates of chemical behavior states that the atom tends to hold an even number of electrons in any given shell, and especially to hold eight electrons which are normally arranged symmetrically at the eight corners of a cube .  In 1919 chemist  |Irving_Langmuir|Irving_Langmuir|  suggested that the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of  |electron_shells|Electron_Shell|  around the nucleus.  In 1922,  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr|  updated his model of the atom by assuming that certain numbers of electrons corresponded to stable closed shells .       Pauli looked for an explanation for these numbers, which were at first only  |empirical|Empirical_Relationship| . At the same time he was trying to explain experimental results of the  |Zeeman_effect|Zeeman_Effect|  in atomic  |spectroscopy|Spectroscopy|  and in  |ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetism| . He found an essential clue in a 1924 paper by  |Edmund_C._Stoner|Edmund_Clifton_Stoner| , which pointed out that, for a given value of the  |principal_quantum_number|Principal_Quantum_Number|  , the number of energy levels of a single electron in the  |alkali_metal|Alkali_Metal|  spectra in an external magnetic field, where all  |degenerate_energy_levels|Degenerate_Energy_Level|  are separated, is equal to the number of electrons in the closed shell of the  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas| es for the same value of n. This led Pauli to realize that the complicated numbers of electrons in closed shells can be reduced to the simple rule of one electron per state if the electron states are defined using four quantum numbers. For this purpose he introduced a new two-valued quantum number, identified by  |Samuel_Goudsmit|Samuel_Goudsmit|  and  |George_Uhlenbeck|George_Uhlenbeck|  as  |electron_spin|Electron_Spin| .           The Pauli exclusion principle with a single-valued many-particle wavefunction is equivalent to requiring the wavefunction to be  |antisymmetric_with_respect_to_exchange|Identicalparticlessymmetricalandantisymmetricalstates| . An antisymmetric two-particle state is represented as a  |sum_of_states|Superposition_Principle|  in which one particle is in state    x   and the other in state    y  , and is given by:   :        A  x,y         and antisymmetry under exchange means that . This implies  when , which is Pauli exclusion. It is true in any basis since local changes of basis keep antisymmetric matrices antisymmetric.     Conversely, if the diagonal quantities  are zero in every basis, then the wavefunction component   :   A                 is necessarily antisymmetric. To prove it, consider the matrix element   :             This is zero, because the two particles have zero probability to both be in the superposition state  x  +  y  . But this is equal to   :        x,x  +      x,y  +      y,x  +       y,y         The first and last terms are diagonal elements and are zero, and the whole sum is equal to zero. So the wavefunction matrix elements obey:     :       +    y,x  0,       or   :   A -A.         According to the  |spin–statistics_theorem|Spin–Statistics_Theorem| , particles with integer spin occupy symmetric quantum states, and particles with half-integer spin occupy antisymmetric states; furthermore, only integer or half-integer values of spin are allowed by the principles of quantum mechanics.   In relativistic  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory| , the Pauli principle follows from applying a  |rotation_operator|Rotation_Operator|  in  |imaginary_time|Imaginary_Time|  to particles of half-integer spin.     In one dimension, bosons, as well as fermions, can obey the exclusion principle. A one-dimensional Bose gas with delta-function repulsive interactions of infinite strength is equivalent to a gas of free fermions. The reason for this is that, in one dimension, the exchange of particles requires that they pass through each other; for infinitely strong repulsion this cannot happen. This model is described by a quantum  |nonlinear_Schrödinger_equation|Nonlinear_Schrödinger_Equation| . In momentum space, the exclusion principle is valid also for finite repulsion in a Bose gas with delta-function interactions,  as well as for  |interacting_spins|Heisenberg_Model|  and  |Hubbard_model|Hubbard_Model|  in one dimension, and for other models solvable by  |Bethe_ansatz|Bethe_Ansatz| . The  |ground_state|Stationary_State|  in models solvable by Bethe ansatz is a  |Fermi_sphere|Fermi_Energy| .            The Pauli exclusion principle helps explain a wide variety of physical phenomena. One particularly important consequence of the principle is the elaborate  |electron_shell|Electron_Configuration|  structure of  |atoms|Atom|  and the way atoms share electrons, explaining the variety of chemical elements and their chemical combinations. An  |electrically_neutral|Electric_Charge|  atom contains bound  |electrons|Electron|  equal in number to the protons in the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus| . Electrons, being fermions, cannot occupy the same quantum state as other electrons, so electrons have to stack within an atom, i.e. have different spins while at the same electron orbital as described below.     An example is the neutral  |helium_atom|Helium_Atom| , which has two bound electrons, both of which can occupy the lowest-energy  states by acquiring opposite spin; as spin is part of the quantum state of the electron, the two electrons are in different quantum states and do not violate the Pauli principle. However, the spin can take only two different values . In a  |lithium|Lithium|  atom, with three bound electrons, the third electron cannot reside in a 1s state and must occupy one of the higher-energy 2s states instead. Similarly, successively larger elements must have shells of successively higher energy. The chemical properties of an element largely depend on the number of electrons in the outermost shell; atoms with different numbers of occupied electron shells but the same number of electrons in the outermost shell have similar properties, which gives rise to the  |periodic_table_of_the_elements|Periodic_Table| .         In  |conductors|Electrical_Conductor|  and  |semiconductors|Semiconductor| , there are very large numbers of  |molecular_orbitals|Molecular_Orbital|  which effectively form a continuous  |band_structure|Electronic_Band_Structure|  of  |energy_levels|Energy_Level| . In strong conductors  electrons are so  |degenerate|Degenerate_Energy_Level|  that they cannot even contribute much to the  |thermal_capacity|Thermal_Capacity|  of a metal.   Many mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical and chemical properties of solids are the direct consequence of Pauli exclusion.       The stability of each electron state in an atom is described by the quantum theory of the atom, which shows that close approach of an electron to the nucleus necessarily increases the electrons kinetic energy, an application of the  |uncertainty_principle|Uncertainty_Principle|  of Heisenberg.  The Stability of Matter and Quantum Electrodynamics However, stability of large systems with many electrons and many  |nucleons|Nucleons|  is a different question, and requires the Pauli exclusion principle. This realization is attributed by  and by  to F. J. Dyson and A. Lenard: Stability of Matter, Parts I and II .     It has been shown that the Pauli exclusion principle is responsible for the fact that ordinary bulk matter is stable and occupies volume. This suggestion was first made in 1931 by  |Paul_Ehrenfest|Paul_Ehrenfest| , who pointed out that the electrons of each atom cannot all fall into the lowest-energy orbital and must occupy successively larger shells. Atoms, therefore, occupy a volume and cannot be squeezed too closely together. As described by F. J. Dyson , Ehrenfest made this suggestion in his address on the occasion of the award of the  |Lorentz_Medal|Lorentz_Medal|  to Pauli.     A more rigorous proof was provided in 1967 by  |Freeman_Dyson|Freeman_Dyson|  and Andrew Lenard, who considered the balance of attractive and repulsive forces and showed that ordinary matter would collapse and occupy a much smaller volume without the Pauli principle. F. J. Dyson and A. Lenard: Stability of Matter, Parts I and II       The consequence of the Pauli principle here is that electrons of the same spin are kept apart by a repulsive  |exchange_interaction|Exchange_Interaction| , which is a short-range effect, acting simultaneously with the long-range electrostatic or  |Coulombic_force|Coulombic_Force| . This effect is partly responsible for the everyday observation in the macroscopic world that two solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time.        |Freeman_Dyson|Freeman_Dyson|  and  |Andrew_Lenard|Andrew_Lenard|  did not consider the extreme magnetic or gravitational forces that occur in some  |astronomical|Astronomical|  objects. In 1995  |Elliott_Lieb|Elliott_Lieb|  and coworkers showed that the Pauli principle still leads to stability in intense magnetic fields such as in  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star| , although at a much higher density than in ordinary matter.  It is a consequence of  |general_relativity|General_Relativity|  that, in sufficiently intense gravitational fields, matter collapses to form a  |black_hole|Black_Hole| .     Astronomy provides a spectacular demonstration of the effect of the Pauli principle, in the form of  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  and  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star| . In both bodies, the atomic structure is disrupted by extreme pressure, but the stars are held in  |hydrostatic_equilibrium|Hydrostatic_Equilibrium|  by  degeneracy pressure , also known as Fermi pressure. This exotic form of matter is known as  |degenerate_matter|Degenerate_Matter| . The immense gravitational force of a stars mass is normally held in equilibrium by  |thermal_pressure|Ideal_Gas_Law|  caused by heat produced in  |thermonuclear_fusion|Thermonuclear_Fusion|  in the stars core. In white dwarfs, which do not undergo nuclear fusion, an opposing force to gravity is provided by  |electron_degeneracy_pressure|Electron_Degeneracy_Pressure| . In  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star| , subject to even stronger gravitational forces, electrons have merged with  |protons|Proton|  to form  |neutrons|Neutron| . Neutrons are capable of producing an even higher degeneracy pressure,  |neutron_degeneracy_pressure|Neutron_Degeneracy_Pressure| , albeit over a shorter range. This can stabilize neutron stars from further collapse, but at a smaller size and higher  |density|Density|  than a white dwarf. Neutron stars are the most rigid objects known; their  |Young_modulus|Young_Modulus|   is 20 orders of magnitude larger than that of  |diamond|Diamond| . However, even this enormous rigidity can be overcome by the  |gravitational_field|Gravitational_Field|  of a massive star or by the pressure of a  |supernova|Supernova| , leading to the formation of a  |black_hole|Black_Hole| .
