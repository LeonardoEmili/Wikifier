   In  |chemistry|Chemistry|  and atomic  |physics|Physics| , the main group is the group of elements  whose lightest members are represented by  |helium|Helium| ,  |lithium|Lithium| ,  |beryllium|Beryllium| ,  |boron|Boron| ,  |carbon|Carbon| ,  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| ,  |oxygen|Oxygen| , and  |fluorine|Fluorine|  as arranged in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  of the elements. The main group includes the elements  in groups 1 and 2 , and groups 13 to 18 . The s-block elements are primarily characterised by one main oxidation state, and the p-block elements, when they have multiple oxidation states, often have common oxidation states separated by two units.     Main-group elements  are the most abundant elements on  |earth|Earth| , in the  |solar_system|Solar_System| , and in the  |universe|Universe| .      |Group_12_elements|Group_12_Element|  are often considered to be transition metals; however,  |zinc|Zinc|  ,  |cadmium|Cadmium|  , and  |mercury|Mercury|  share some properties of both groups, and many scientists believe they should be included in the main group.   Occasionally, even the  |group_3_elements|Group_3_Element|  as well as the  |lanthanides|Lanthanide|  and  |actinides|Actinide|  have been included, because especially the group 3 elements and lanthanides are electropositive elements with only one main oxidation state like the group 1 and 2 elements. The position of the actinides is more questionable, but the most common and stable of them,  |thorium|Thorium|  and  |uranium|Uranium|  , are similar to main-group elements as thorium is an electropositive element with only one main oxidation state , and uranium has two main ones separated by two oxidation units .
