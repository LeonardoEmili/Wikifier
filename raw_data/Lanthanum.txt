   Lanthanum is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  La and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  57. It is a  |soft|Hardness| ,  |ductile|Ductility| , silvery-white  |metal|Metal|  that tarnishes slowly when exposed to air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and  |lutetium|Lutetium|  in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , of which lanthanum is the first and the prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period  |transition_metals|Transition_Metals| , which would put it in  |group_3|Group_3_Element| , although lutetium is sometimes placed in this position instead. Lanthanum is traditionally counted among the  |rare_earth_elements|Rare_Earth_Element| . The usual  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity.     Lanthanum usually occurs together with  |cerium|Cerium|  and the other rare earth elements. Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist  |Carl_Gustav_Mosander|Carl_Gustav_Mosander|  in 1839 as an impurity in  |cerium_nitrate|Cerium_Nitrate|  – hence the name lanthanum, from the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  λανθάνειν , meaning to lie hidden . Although it is classified as a rare earth element, lanthanum is the 28th most abundant element in the Earths crust, almost three times as abundant as  |lead|Lead| . In minerals such as  |monazite|Monazite|  and  |bastnäsite|Bastnäsite| , lanthanum composes about a quarter of the lanthanide content.    It is extracted from those minerals by a process of such complexity that pure lanthanum metal was not isolated until 1923.     Lanthanum compounds have numerous applications as  |catalysts|Catalysis| , additives in glass, carbon arc lamps for studio lights and projectors, ignition elements in  |lighters|Lighter|  and torches,  |electron_cathodes|Hot_Cathode| ,  |scintillators|Scintillator| ,  |GTAW|Gas_Tungsten_Arc_Welding|  electrodes, and other things.  |Lanthanum_carbonate|Lanthanum_Carbonate|  is used as a  |phosphate_binder|Phosphate_Binder|  in cases of  |renal_failure|Hyperphosphatemia| .           Lanthanum is the first element and prototype of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears to the right of the  |alkaline_earth_metal|Alkaline_Earth_Metal| |barium|Barium|  and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a  |group_3_element|Group_3_Element| , along with its lighter  |congeners|Congener| |scandium|Scandium|  and  |yttrium|Yttrium|  and its heavier congener, the radioactive  |actinium|Actinium| , Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1102 although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the  |configuration|Electron_Configuration|  d 1 6s 2 , with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s  |subshells|Electron_Shellsubshells|  to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas  |xenon|Xenon| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1106 Some lanthanum compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.      Among the lanthanides, lanthanum is exceptional as it does not have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic| , unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides . Cullity, B. D. and Graham, C. D. Introduction to Magnetic Materials, John Wiley & Sons,  Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest melting point among all the lanthanides: 920  °C. Krishnamurthy, Nagaiyar and Gupta, Chiranjib Kumar Extractive Metallurgy of Rare Earths, CRC Press,  The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high  |resistivity|Resistivity|  of 615  nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50  nΩm. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1429  Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides.  Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a  |hexagonal_crystal_structure|Hexagonal_Crystal_System|  at room temperature. At 310  °C, lanthanum changes to a  |face-centered_cubic|Face-Centered_Cubic|  structure, and at 865  °C, it changes to a  |body-centered_cubic|Body-Centered_Cubic|  structure.       As expected from  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trend| , lanthanum has the largest  |atomic_radius|Atomic_Radius|  of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, it is the most reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form  |lanthanum_oxide|Lanthanum_Oxide| , La 2 O 3 , which is almost as basic as  |calcium_oxide|Calcium_Oxide| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1105–7 A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide  |spalls|Spallation|  off like iron  |rust|Rust| , instead of forming a protective oxide coating like  |aluminium|Aluminium|  and lanthanums lighter congeners scandium and yttrium.  Lanthanum reacts with the  |halogens|Halogen|  at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form  |binary_compounds|Binary_Compound|  with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form  |lanthanum_hydroxide|Lanthanum_Hydroxide| , La 3 .  In dilute  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| , lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion  |hardest|Hsab_Theory|  base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again expected from its being the largest of them. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1434             Naturally occurring lanthanum is made up of two isotopes, the stable 139 La and the  |primordial_long-lived_radioisotope|Primordial_Nuclide|  138 La. 139 La is by far the most abundant, making up 99.910% of natural lanthanum: it is produced in the  |s-process|S-Process|   and the  |r-process|R-Process|  .  The very rare isotope 138 La is one of the few primordial  |odd–odd_nuclei|Odd–Odd_Nuclei| , with a long half-life of 1.05×10 11  years. It is one of the proton-rich  |p-nuclei|P-Nuclei|  which cannot be produced in the  |s-|S-Process|  or  |r-process|R-Process| es. 138 La, along with the even rarer  |180m_Ta|Tantalum-180M| , is produced in the ν-process, where  |neutrinos|Neutrino|  interact with stable nuclei. S. E. Woosley, D. H. Hartmann, R. D. Hoffman, W. C. Haxton: The ν-process. In: The Astrophysical Journal, Vol. 356, 1990, p. 272-301.  All other lanthanum isotopes are  |synthetic|Synthetic_Radioisotope| |fission_products|Fission_Product|  of uranium.           |Lanthanum_oxide|Lanthanum_Oxide|  is a white solid that can be prepared by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La 3+ ion, La 2 O 3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of  |scandium_oxide|Scandium_Oxide|  and  |yttrium_oxide|Yttrium_Oxide|  at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: a lot of heat is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard. Lanthanum hydroxide will react with atmospheric  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  to form the basic carbonate. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1107–8     Lanthanum fluoride is insoluble in water and can be used as a  |qualitative|Qualitative_Inorganic_Analysis|  test for the presence of La 3+ . The heavier halides are all very soluble  |deliquescent|Deliquescent|  compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl 3 produces LaOCl.     Lanthanum reacts exothermically with hydrogen to produce the dihydride LaH 2 , a black,  |pyrophoric|Pyrophoricity| , brittle, conducting compound with the  |calcium_fluoride|Calcium_Fluoride|  structure.  This is a non-stoichiometric compound, and further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH 3 is reached. Like LaI 2 and LaI, LaH 2 is probably an  |electride|Electride|  compound.     Due to the large ionic radius and great electropositivity of La 3+ , there is not much covalent contribution to its bonding and hence it has a limited  |coordination_chemistry|Coordination_Chemistry| , like yttrium and the other lanthanides. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1108–9 Lanthanum oxalate does not dissolve very much in alkali-metal oxalate solutions, and decomposes around 500  °C. Oxygen is the most common  |donor_atom|Donor_Atom|  in lanthanum complexes, which are mostly ionic and often have high coordination numbers over 6: 8 is the most characteristic, forming  |square_antiprism|Square_Antiprism| atic and  |dodecadeltahedral|Snub_Disphenoid|  structures. These high-coordinate species, reaching up to coordination number 12 with the use of  |chelating_ligands|Chelating_Ligand|  such as in La 2 3 ·9H 2 O, often have a low degree of symmetry because of stereo-chemical factors.     Lanthanum chemistry tends not to involve π bonding due to the electron configuration of the element: thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited. The best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the  |cyclopentadienyl_complex|Cyclopentadienyl_Complex|  La 3 , which is produced by reacting anhydrous LaCl 3 with NaC 5 H 5 in  |tetrahydrofuran|Tetrahydrofuran| , and its methyl-substituted derivatives. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1110          In 1751, the Swedish mineralogist  |Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt|Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt|  discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at  |Bastnäs|Bastnäs| , later named  |cerite|Cerite| . Thirty years later, the fifteen-year-old  |Vilhelm_Hisinger|Vilhelm_Hisinger| , from the family owning the mine, sent a sample of it to  |Carl_Scheele|Carl_Scheele| , who did not find any new elements within. In 1803, after Hisinger had become an ironmaster, he returned to the mineral with  |Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|  and isolated a new oxide which they named ceria after the  |dwarf_planet|Dwarf_Planet| |Ceres|Ceres| , which had been discovered two years earlier.  Ceria was simultaneously independently isolated in Germany by  |Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth|Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1424 Between 1839 and 1843, ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the Swedish surgeon and chemist  |Carl_Gustaf_Mosander|Carl_Gustaf_Mosander| , who lived in the same house as Berzelius: he separated out two other oxides which he named lanthana and  didymia .  He partially decomposed a sample of  |cerium_nitrate|Cerium_Nitrate|  by roasting it in air and then treating the resulting oxide with dilute  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| . See:    , Comptes rendus, 8 : 356-357. From p. 356:  Loxide de cérium, extrait de la cérite par la procédé ordinaire, contient à peu près les deux cinquièmes de son poids de loxide du nouveau métal qui ne change que peu les propriétés du cérium, et qui sy tient pour ainsi dire caché. Cette raison a engagé M. Mosander à donner au nouveau métal le nom de Lantane.      Philosophical Magazine, new series, 14 : 390-391. Since lanthanums properties differed only slightly from those of cerium, and occurred along with it in its salts, he named it from the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  λανθάνειν . Relatively pure lanthanum metal was first isolated in 1923.       Lanthanum is the third-most abundant of all the lanthanides, making up 39  mg/kg of the Earths crust, behind  |neodymium|Neodymium|  at 41.5  mg/kg and cerium at 66.5  mg/kg. It is almost three times as abundant as  |lead|Lead|  in the Earths crust.    Despite being among the so-called rare earth metals , lanthanum is thus not rare at all, but it is historically so named because it is rarer than common earths such as lime and magnesia, and historically only a few deposits were known. Lanthanum is considered a rare earth metal because the process to mine it is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Lanthanum is rarely the dominant lanthanide found in the rare earth minerals, and in their chemical formulae it is usually preceded by cerium. Rare examples of La-dominant minerals are monazite- and lanthanite-.           The La 3+ ion is similarly-sized to the early lanthanides of the cerium group  that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in  |phosphate|Phosphate| ,  |silicate|Silicate|  and  |carbonate|Carbonate|  minerals, such as  |monazite|Monazite|  and  |bastnäsite|Bastnäsite|  , where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive  |promethium|Promethium|  . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1103 Bastnäsite is usually lacking in  |thorium|Thorium|  and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide,  |hydrogen_fluoride|Hydrogen_Fluoride| , and  |silicon_tetrafluoride|Silicon_Tetrafluoride| |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with  |ammonium_oxalate|Ammonium_Oxalate|  to convert rare earths to their insoluble  |oxalates|Oxalate| . The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components,  |cerium|Cerium| , whose oxide is insoluble in HNO 3 . Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain  |228_Ra|Radium-228| , the daughter of 232 Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of  |fractional_crystallization|Fractional_Crystallization|  of La 3 ·2NH 4 NO 3 ·4H 2 O, or by  |ion-exchange|Ion-Exchange|  techniques when higher purity is desired.     Lanthanum metal is obtained from its oxide by heating it with  |ammonium_chloride|Ammonium_Chloride|  or fluoride and hydrofluoric acid at 300-400  °C to produce the chloride or fluoride:     :La 2 O 3 + 6 NH 4 Cl → 2 LaCl 3 + 6 NH 3 + 3 H 2 O     This is followed by reduction with alkali or alkaline earth metals in vacuum or argon atmosphere:     :LaCl 3 + 3 Li → La + 3 LiCl     Also, pure lanthanum can be produced by electrolysis of molten mixture of anhydrous LaCl 3 and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.          The first historical application of lanthanum was in gas lantern  |mantles|Gas_Mantle| . Carl Auer von Welsbach used a mixture of  |lanthanum_oxide|Lanthanum_Oxide|  and  |zirconium_oxide|Zirconium_Dioxide| , which he called Actinophor and patented in 1886. The original mantles gave a green-tinted light and were not very successful, and his first company, which established a factory in  |Atzgersdorf|Atzgersdorf|  in 1887, failed in 1889.      Modern uses of lanthanum include:        |nickel-metal_hydride_batteries|Nickel-Metal_Hydride_Battery|  is . Due to high cost to extract the other lanthanides, a  |mischmetal|Mischmetal|  with more than 50% of lanthanum is used instead of pure lanthanum. The compound is an  |intermetallic|Intermetallics|  component of the  type.     :As most hybrid cars use nickel-metal hydride batteries, massive quantities of lanthanum are required for the production of hybrid automobiles. A typical hybrid automobile battery for a  |Toyota_Prius|Toyota_Prius|  requires  of lanthanum. As engineers push the technology to increase fuel efficiency, twice that amount of lanthanum could be required per vehicle.     Hydrogen sponge alloys can contain lanthanum. These alloys are capable of storing up to 400 times their own volume of hydrogen gas in a reversible adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.     |Mischmetal|Mischmetal| , a  |pyrophoric|Pyrophoric|  alloy used in lighter flints, contains 25% to 45% lanthanum.     |Lanthanum_oxide|Lanthanum_Oxide|  and the  |boride|Lanthanum_Hexaboride|  are used in electronic  |vacuum_tubes|Vacuum_Tube|  as  |hot_cathode|Hot_Cathode|  materials with strong emissivity of  |electrons|Electron| . Crystals of  are used in high-brightness, extended-life, thermionic electron emission sources for  |electron_microscopes|Electron_Microscope|  and  |Hall-effect_thrusters|Hall-Effect_Thruster| .     |Lanthanum_trifluoride|Lanthanum_Trifluoride|   is an essential component of a heavy fluoride glass named  |ZBLAN|Zblan| . This glass has superior transmittance in the infrared range and is therefore used for fiber-optical communication systems.    Cerium-doped  |lanthanum_bromide|Lanthanum_Bromide|  and  |lanthanum_chloride|Lanthanum_Bromide|  are the recent inorganic  |scintillators|Scintillator| , which have a combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of  |neutrons|Neutrons|  or  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Rays| .     |Carbon_arc_lamps|Carbon_Arc_Lamp|  use a mixture of rare earth elements to improve the light quality. This application, especially by the  |motion_picture|Film|  industry for studio lighting and projection, consumed about 25% of the rare-earth compounds produced until the phase out of carbon arc lamps.     |Lanthanum_oxide|Lanthanum_Oxide|   improves the alkali resistance of  |glass|Glass|  and is used in making special optical glasses, such as infrared-absorbing glass, as well as  |camera|Camera|  and  |telescope|Telescope| |lenses|Lens| , because of the high  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index|  and low dispersion of rare-earth glasses. Lanthanum oxide is also used as a grain-growth additive during the liquid-phase  |sintering|Sintering|  of  |silicon_nitride|Silicon_Nitride|  and  |zirconium_diboride|Zirconium_Diboride| .    Small amounts of lanthanum added to  |steel|Steel|  improves its  |malleability|Malleability| , resistance to impact, and  |ductility|Ductility| , whereas addition of lanthanum to  |molybdenum|Molybdenum|  decreases its hardness and sensitivity to temperature variations.   Small amounts of lanthanum are present in many pool products to remove the phosphates that feed algae.    Lanthanum oxide additive to tungsten is used in  |gas_tungsten_arc_welding|Gas_Tungsten_Arc_Welding|  electrodes, as a substitute for  |radioactive|Radioactive|  thorium.     Various compounds of lanthanum and other rare-earth elements are components of various catalysis, such as  |petroleum_cracking|Petroleum_Cracking| |catalysts|Catalyst| .    Lanthanum-barium  |radiometric_dating|Radiometric_Dating|  is used to estimate age of rocks and ores, though the technique has limited popularity.     |Lanthanum_carbonate|Lanthanum_Carbonate|  was approved as a medication  to absorb excess  |phosphate|Phosphate|  in cases of  |end-stage_renal_failure|Hyperphosphatemia| .    Lanthanum fluoride is used in phosphor lamp coatings. Mixed with europium fluoride, it is also applied in the crystal membrane of  |fluoride_ion-selective_electrodes|Fluoride_Selective_Electrode| .   Like  |horseradish_peroxidase|Horseradish_Peroxidase| , lanthanum is used as an electron-dense tracer in  |molecular_biology|Molecular_Biology| .    Lanthanum-modified bentonite  is used to remove phosphates from water in lake treatments.        Lanthanum has no known biological role in humans. The element is very poorly absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow.  |Lanthanum_carbonate|Lanthanum_Carbonate|  was approved as a  |phosphate_binder|Phosphate_Binder|  to absorb excess phosphate in cases of  |end_stage_renal_disease|End_Stage_Renal_Disease| .     While lanthanum has pharmacological effects on several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the  |GABA|Gamma-Aminobutyric_Acid|  receptor is unique among trivalent cations. Lanthanum acts at the same modulatory site on the  |GABA_receptor|Gaba_Receptor|  as  |zinc|Zinc| , a known negative  |allosteric|Allosteric|  modulator. The lanthanum cation La 3+ is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.      Lanthanum is an essential cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the  |methanotrophic|Methanotrophic|  bacterium  Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum  SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means that it may be substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.           Lanthanum has a low to moderate level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces  |hyperglycemia|Hyperglycemia| , low blood pressure, degeneration of the  |spleen|Spleen|  and  |hepatic|Liver|  alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to  |pneumoconiosis|Pneumoconiosis| .   As the La 3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca 2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies.  Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to  |morphine|Morphine|.
