|Sweden|Sweden|  is a country in  |Northern_Europe|Northern_Europe|  on the  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| n Peninsula. It borders  |Norway|Norway|  to the west;  |Finland|Finland|  to the northeast; and the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  and  |Gulf_of_Bothnia|Gulf_Of_Bothnia|  to the south and east. At , Sweden is the 55th largest country in the world. It is the fifth largest in Europe and the largest in Northern Europe.     Sweden has a  long coastline on the eastern side and the  |Scandinavian_mountain_chain|Scandinavian_Mountain_Chain|  on the western border which separates Sweden from Norway. It has maritime borders with  |Denmark|Denmark| ,  |Germany|Germany| ,  |Poland|Poland| ,  |Russia|Russia| ,  |Lithuania|Lithuania| ,  |Latvia|Latvia|  and  |Estonia|Estonia| , and it is also linked to  |Denmark|Denmark|  by the  |Öresund_bridge|Øresund_Bridge| . It has an  |Exclusive_Economic_Zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|  of .            Much of Sweden is heavily forested, with 69%  of the country being forest and woodland, while farmland constitutes only 8% of land use.  Sweden consists of 39,960  km 2 of water area, constituting around 95,700 lakes.    The lakes are sometimes used for  |water_power|Water_Power|  plants, especially the large northern rivers and lakes.     Most of northern and western central Sweden consists of vast tracts of hilly and mountainous land called the  |Norrland_terrain|Norrland_Terrain| .  From the south the transition to the Norrland terrain is not only seen in the relief but also in the wide and contiguous  |boreal_forests|Taiga|  that extend north of it  with  |till|Till|  and  |peat|Peat|  being the overwhelmingly most common  |soil_types|Soil_Type| .      South of the Norrland terrain lies the  |Central_Swedish_lowland|Central_Swedish_Lowland|  which forms a broad east-west trending belt from  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg|  to  |Stockholm|Stockholm| .  This is the traditional heartland of Sweden due to its large population and  |agricultural_resources|Agriculture_In_Sweden| . The region forms a belt of fertile soils suitable for agriculture that interrupts the  |forested|Scandinavian_And_Russian_Taiga|  and  |till_coated|Till|  lands to the north and south. Before the expansion of agriculture, these fertile soils were covered by a  |broad_leaved_tree|Broad_Leaved_Tree|  forest where  |maples|Acer_Platanoides| ,  |oaks|Oak| ,  |ash|Fraxinus_Excelsior| es,  |small_leaved_lime|Tilia_Cordata|  and  |common_hazel|Corylus_Avellana|  grew. The Central Swedish lowland does however also contain soils of poor quality, particularly in hills where  |Scots_pine|Scots_Pine|  and  |Norway_spruce|Picea_Abies|  grow on top of thin till soils. Agriculture aside, the region benefits also from the proximity of  |hydropower|Hydropower| , forest and  |bergslagens|Bergslagen|  mineral resources.  Swedens four largest lakes,  |Vänern|Vänern| ,  |Vättern|Vättern| ,  |Mälaren|Lake_Mälaren|  and  |Hjälmaren|Hjälmaren| , lie within the lowlands.      To the south of the Central Swedish lowland lies the  |South_Swedish_highlands|South_Swedish_Highlands|  which except for a lack of deep valleys is similar to the  |Norrland_terrain|Norrland_Terrain|  found further north in Sweden. The highest point of the highlands lies at 377 m.  Poor soil conditions have posed significant difficulties for agriculture in the highlands, meaning that over time small industries became relatively important in local economies.      Southernmost Sweden contains a varied landscape with both plains and hilly terrain. A characteristic chain of elongated hills runs across Scania from northwest to southeast. These hills are  |horsts|Horst|  located along the  |Tornquist_Zone|Trans_European_Suture_Zone| .   Some of the horst are  |Hallandsås|Hallandsås| en,  |Römelåsen|Römelåsen|  and  |Söderåsen|Söderåsen| . The plains of Scania and  |Halland|Halland|  make up 10% of Swedens cultivated lands and are the countrys main agricultural landscape. Productivity is high relative to the rest of Sweden and more akin to that of more southern European countries.  The natural vegetation is made up of  |broadleaf_forest|Temperate_Broadleaf_And_Mixed_Forest|  although conifer plantations are common. Southern Sweden has Swedens greatest animal and plant diversity.       The two largest  |islands|Islands_Of_Sweden|  are  |Gotland|Gotland|  and  |Öland|Öland|  in the southeast. They differ from the rest of Sweden by being made up of  |limestone|Limestone|  and  |marl|Marl|  with an  |alvar|Alvar|  vegetation adapted to the islands calcareous soils.   Gotland and Öland have  |landforms|Landform|  that are rare or absent in mainland Sweden. These include  |active_cliffs|Cliff|  seen in segments of their western coasts,   |sea_stacks|Sea_Stack|  called  rauk s and  |large_cave_systems|Solutional_Cave| .                    Sweden has 25  |provinces|Province|  or landskap , based on culture, geography and history:  |Bohuslän|Bohuslän| ,  |Blekinge|Blekinge| ,  |Dalarna|Dalarna| ,  |Dalsland|Dalsland| ,  |Gotland|Gotland| ,  |Gästrikland|Gästrikland| ,  |Halland|Halland| ,  |Hälsingland|Hälsingland| ,  |Härjedalen|Härjedalen| ,  |Jämtland|Jämtland| ,  |Lapland|Lapland_Sweden| ,  |Medelpad|Medelpad| ,  |Norrbotten|Norrbotten| ,  |Närke|Närke| ,  |Skåne|Scania| ,  |Småland|Småland| ,  |Södermanland|Södermanland| ,  |Uppland|Uppland| ,  |Värmland|Värmland| ,  |Västmanland|Västmanland| ,  |Västerbotten|Västerbotten| ,  |Västergötland|Västergötland| ,  |Ångermanland|Ångermanland| ,  |Öland|Öland|  and  |Östergötland|Östergötland| .     While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role for peoples self-identification. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands  |Norrland|Norrland| , the central  |Svealand|Svealand|  and southern  |Götaland|Götaland| . The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country.               Administratively, Sweden is divided into 21  |counties|County| , or län. In each county there is a  |County_Administrative_Board|County_Administrative_Boards_Of_Sweden| , or länsstyrelse, which is appointed by the national government.     In each county there is also a separate  |County_Council|County_Councils_Of_Sweden| , or landsting, which is the municipal representation appointed by the county electorate.

Each county is further divided into municipalities or kommuner, ranging from only one  to forty-nine . The total number of municipalities is 290.     The northern municipalities are often large in size, but have small populations – the largest municipality is  |Kiruna|Kiruna|  with an area as large as the three southern provinces in Sweden  combined, but it only has a population of 25,000, and its density is about 1 / km 2 .               Sweden has a population of 10 million as of January 2017.  The mountainous north is considerably less populated than the southern and central regions, partly because the summer period lasts longer in the south, and this is where the more successful agricultural industries were originally established. Another historical reason is said to be the desired proximity to key trade routes and partners in continental Europe, e.g. Germany. As a result, all seven urban areas in Sweden with a population of 100,000 or more, are located in the southern half of the country.           Cities and towns in Sweden are neither political nor administrative entities; rather they are localities or  |urban_areas|Urban_Areas_In_Sweden| , independent of municipal subdivisions.   The largest city, in terms of population, is the capital  |Stockholm|Stockholm| , in the east, the dominant city for culture and media, with a population of 1,250,000. The second largest city is  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg| , with 510,500, in the west. The third largest is  |Malmö|Malmö|  in the south, with 258,000. The largest city in the north is  |Umeå|Umeå|  with 76,000 inhabitants.       Swedens  |natural_resources|Natural_Resources|  include  |copper|Copper| ,  |gold|Gold| ,  |hydropower|Hydropower| ,  |iron_ore|Iron_Ore| ,  |lead|Lead| ,  |silver|Silver| ,  |timber|Timber| ,  |uranium|Uranium| , and  |zinc|Zinc| .           |Acid_rain|Acid_Rain|  has become an issue because it is damaging  |soils|Soil|  and  |lakes|Lake|  and polluting the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  and the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| . The HBV  |hydrology_transport_model|Hydrology_Transport_Model|  has been used to analyze nutrient discharge to the Baltic from tributary watersheds.                                                  The extreme points of Sweden include the coordinates that are farthest north, south, east and west in Sweden, and the ones that are at the highest and the lowest elevations in the country. Unlike Norway and Denmark, Sweden has no external territories that can be considered either inside or outside the country depending on definition, meaning that the extreme points of Sweden are unambiguous.     The latitude and longitude are expressed in  |decimal_degree_notation|Geographic_Coordinate_Systemdegrees_A_Measurement_Of_Angle| , in which a positive latitude value refers to the Northern Hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, a negative elevation value refers to land below sea level. The coordinates used in this article are sourced from  |Google_Earth|Google_Earth| , which makes use of the  |World_Geodetic_System|World_Geodetic_System|   84, a geodetic reference system.          Swedens northernmost point is  |Treriksröset|Treriksröset| , in the  |Lapland|Lapland_Sweden|  province, where the borders of Sweden, Norway, and Finland meet. The closest Swedish city to the area is  |Kiruna|Kiruna| , which is Swedens northernmost city. Swedens southernmost point is in the harbour of the fishing village Smygehuk, near the city of  |Trelleborg|Trelleborg| ,  which borders the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| . At the  |pier|Pier|  of the harbour, a signpost displays the exact position of the point, as well as the distance to Treriksröset,  |Stockholm|Stockholm| ,  |Berlin|Berlin| ,  |Paris|Paris| , and  |Moscow|Moscow| .     Swedens westernmost point is on Stora Drammen, an  |islet|Islet|  in  |Skagerrak|Skagerrak|  outside the coast of  |Bohuslän|Bohuslän| .   |Seabirds|Seabirds|  and  |harbor_seals|Harbor_Seal|  have colonies on the islet, but it is uninhabited by humans.  Swedens easternmost point is on  |Kataja|Kataja| , an islet south of  |Haparanda|Haparanda|  in the  |Bothnian_Bay|Bothnian_Bay| .  The islet is divided between Sweden and Finland. The border was established in 1809, after the  |Finnish_War|Finnish_War| , between what was previously two islets, a Swedish one called Kataja and a smaller Finnish one called Inakari. Since 1809,  |post_glacial_rebound|Post_Glacial_Rebound|  has caused the sea level in the region to drop relative to land level, joining the two islets.  If counting the  |mainland|Mainland|  only, Stensvik in  |Strömstad|Strömstad|  is Swedens westernmost point, and Sundholmen in  |Haparanda|Haparanda|  is the easternmost point.             The highest point in Sweden is Kebnekaise, which stands at  . It is in the  |Scandinavian_Mountains|Scandinavian_Mountains|  chain, in the province of Lapland. The mountain has two peaks, of which the  |glaciated|Glacier|  southern one is the highest at .  The northern peak, which stands at , is free of ice. Although the south top is traditionally said to be  high, new measurements have shown that the glacier has shrunk fairly fast; therefore the summit is not as high as earlier. It was  in 2008. Other points of comparable height in the vicinity of Kebnekaise include Sarektjåkka at , and Kaskasatjåkka at . If the summers of 2016 and 2017 get as warm as the previous years, the northern peak will become the highest.      Swedens lowest point, which is  below sea level, is in the  |Kristianstads_Vattenrike_Biosphere_Reserve|Kristianstads_Vattenrike_Biosphere_Reserve|  in the city of  |Kristianstad|Kristianstad| .  The point is at the bottom of what was once Nosabyviken, a bay on the lake of Hammarsjön. The bay was drained in the 1860s by John Nun Milner, an engineer, to get more  |arable_land|Arable_Land|  for Kristianstad.          Only public transportation.
