      The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and  |processes|Biological_Process|  within an  |organism|Organism|  that protects against  |disease|Disease| . To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as  |pathogens|Pathogen| , from  |virus|Virus| es to  |parasitic_worms|Parasitic_Worm| , and  |distinguish|Major_Histocompatibility_Complex|  them from the organisms own healthy  |tissue|Biological_Tissue| . In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the  |innate_immune_system|Innate_Immune_System|  and the  |adaptive_immune_system|Adaptive_Immune_System| . Both subsystems use  |humoral_immunity|Humoral_Immunity|  and  |cell-mediated_immunity|Cell-Mediated_Immunity|  to perform their functions. In humans, the  |blood–brain_barrier|Blood–Brain_Barrier| ,  |blood–cerebrospinal_fluid_barrier|Blood–Cerebrospinal_Fluid_Barrier| , and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the  |neuroimmune_system|Neuroimmune_System| , which protects the  |brain|Human_Brain| .     Pathogens can rapidly  |evolve|Evolution|  and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple  |unicellular|Microorganism|  organisms such as  |bacteria|Bacteria|  possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of  |enzymes|Enzyme|  that protect against  |bacteriophage|Bacteriophage|  infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient  |eukaryotes|Eukaryote|  and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include  |phagocytosis|Phagocytosis| ,  |antimicrobial_peptides|Antimicrobial_Peptides|  called  |defensins|Defensin| , and the  |complement_system|Complement_System| .  |Jawed_vertebrates|Jawed_Vertebrate| , including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms,  including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive immunity creates  |immunological_memory|Immunological_Memory|  after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of  |vaccination|Vaccination| .     Disorders of the immune system can result in  |autoimmune_diseases|Autoimmune_Disease| ,  |inflammatory_diseases|Inflammation|  and  |cancer|Carcinogenesis| .   |Immunodeficiency|Immunodeficiency|  occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a  |genetic_disease|Genetic_Disease|  such as  |severe_combined_immunodeficiency|Severe_Combined_Immunodeficiency| , acquired conditions such as  |HIV|Hiv| / |AIDS|Aids| , or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast,  |autoimmunity|Autoimmunity|  results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include  |Hashimotos_thyroiditis|Hashimotos_Thyroiditis| ,  |rheumatoid_arthritis|Rheumatoid_Arthritis| ,  |diabetes_mellitus_type_1|Diabetes_Mellitus_Type_1| , and  |systemic_lupus_erythematosus|Systemic_Lupus_Erythematosus| .  |Immunology|Immunology|  covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.       The immune system protects organisms from  |infection|Infection|  with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as  |bacteria|Bacteria|  and  |virus|Virus| es from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the  |innate_immune_system|Innate_Immune_System|  provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all  |plants|Plant|  and  |animals|Animal| .  If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the  |adaptive_immune_system|Adaptive_Immune_System| , which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an  |immunological_memory|Immunological_Memory| , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.            Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self  |molecules|Molecule| . In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organisms body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Smith A.D. Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology. Oxford University Press. , p. 592 Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens  and are defined as substances that bind to specific  |immune_receptors|Immune_Receptor|  and elicit an immune response.     Newborn  |infants|Infant|  have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During  |pregnancy|Pregnancy| , a particular type of antibody, called  |IgG|Immunoglobulin_G| , is transported from mother to baby directly through the  |placenta|Placenta| , so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.   |Breast_milk|Breast_Milk|  or  |colostrum|Colostrum|  also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.  This is  |passive_immunity|Passive_Immunization|  because the  |fetus|Fetus|  does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be  |transferred_artificially|Intravenous_Immunoglobulin|  from one individual to another via antibody-rich  |serum|Blood_Plasma| .           Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system. The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by  |pattern_recognition_receptors|Pattern_Recognition_Receptors| , which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms,  or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals, many of which are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens.  Innate immune defenses are non-specific, meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way. This system does not confer long-lasting  |immunity|Immunity|  against a pathogen. The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.       Cells in the innate immune system use  |pattern_recognition_receptors|Pattern_Recognition_Receptor|  to recognize molecular structures that are produced by microbial pathogens. PRRs are germline-encoded host sensors, which detect molecules typical for the pathogens.  They are  |proteins|Protein|  expressed, mainly, by cells of the  |innate_immune_system|Innate_Immune_System| , such as dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and epithelial cells,   to identify two classes of molecules:  |pathogen-associated_molecular_patterns|Pathogen-Associated_Molecular_Patterns|  , which are associated with microbial  |pathogens|Pathogens| , and  |damage-associated_molecular_patterns|Damage-Associated_Molecular_Patterns|  , which are associated with components of hosts cells that are released during cell damage or death.       Recognition of extracellular or endosomal pathogen-associated molecular patterns is mediated by transmembrane proteins known as  |toll-like_receptors|Toll-Like_Receptor|  .  TLRs share a typical structural motif, the  |Leucine_rich_repeats|Leucine_Rich_Repeat| , which give them their specific appearance and are also responsible for TLR functionality.  Toll-like receptors were first discovered in  Drosophila  and trigger the synthesis and secretion of  |cytokines|Cytokine|  and activation of other host defense programs that are necessary for both innate or adaptive immune responses. To date, ten functional members of the TLR family have been described in humans.        Cells in the innate immune system have pattern recognition receptors that detect infection or cell damage in the cytosol. Three major classes of these cytosolic receptors are  |NOD–like_receptors|Nod-Like_Receptor| ,  |RIG_-like_receptors|Rig-I-Like_Receptor| , and cytosolic DNA sensors.           Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that form in response to cytosolic PAMPs and DAMPs, whose function is to generate active forms of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18.        Several barriers protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers. The waxy  |cuticle|Plant_Cuticle|  of most  |leaves|Leaf| , the  |exoskeleton|Exoskeleton|  of  |insects|Insect| , the  |shells|Eggshell|  and membranes of externally deposited  |eggs|Egg| , and  |skin|Skin|  are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection.  However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the  |lungs|Lung| ,  |intestines|Intestine| , and the  |genitourinary_tract|Genitourinary_System| . In the lungs,  |cough|Cough| ing and  |sneezing|Sneeze|  mechanically eject pathogens and other  |irritants|Irritation|  from the  |respiratory_tract|Respiratory_Tract| . The flushing action of  |tears|Tears|  and  |urine|Urine|  also mechanically expels pathogens, while  |mucus|Mucus|  secreted by the respiratory and  |gastrointestinal_tract|Gastrointestinal_Tract|  serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.      Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete  |antimicrobial_peptides|Antimicrobial_Peptides|  such as the β- |defensins|Defensin| .   |Enzymes|Enzyme|  such as  |lysozyme|Lysozyme|  and  |phospholipase_A2|Phospholipase_A2|  in  |saliva|Saliva| , tears, and  |breast_milk|Breast_Milk|  are also  |antibacterials|Antiseptic| .    |Vagina|Vagina| l secretions serve as a chemical barrier following  |menarche|Menarche| , when they become slightly  |acid|Acid| ic, while  |semen|Semen|  contains defensins and  |zinc|Zinc|  to kill pathogens.   In the  |stomach|Stomach| ,  |gastric_acid|Gastric_Acid|  serves as a powerful chemical defense against ingested pathogens.      Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts,  |commensal|Commensalism| |flora|Gut_Flora|  serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as  |pH|Ph|  or available iron.  As a result of the  |symbiotic_relationship_between_commensals_and_the_immune_system|Microbial_Symbiosis_And_Immunity| , the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness is reduced. However, since most  |antibiotics|Antibiotic|  non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an overgrowth of  |fungi|Fungus|  and cause conditions such as a vaginal  |candidiasis|Candidiasis|  .  There is good evidence that re-introduction of  |probiotic|Probiotic|  flora, such as pure cultures of the  |lactobacilli|Lactobacillus|  normally found in unpasteurized  |yogurt|Yogurt| , helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on  |bacterial_gastroenteritis|Bacterial_Gastroenteritis| ,  |inflammatory_bowel_diseases|Inflammatory_Bowel_Disease| ,  |urinary_tract_infection|Urinary_Tract_Infection|  and  |post-surgical_infections|Post-Surgical_Infections| .             Leukocytes act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the  |phagocytes|Phagocyte|  ,  |innate_lymphoid_cells|Innate_Lymphoid_Cell| ,  |mast_cells|Mast_Cell| ,  |eosinophils|Eosinophil_Granulocyte| ,  |basophils|Basophil_Granulocyte| , and  |natural_killer_cells|Natural_Killer_Cell| . These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.       |Phagocytosis|Phagocytosis|  is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called phagocytes that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular  |vesicle|Vesicle|  called a  |phagosome|Phagosome| , which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a  |lysosome|Lysosome|  to form a  |phagolysosome|Phagolysosome| . The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a  |respiratory_burst|Respiratory_Burst|  that releases  |free_radicals|Radical|  into the phagolysosome.   Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring  |nutrients|Nutrient| , but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.  Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.         |Neutrophils|Neutrophil|  and  |macrophages|Macrophage|  are  |phagocytes|Phagocyte|  that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.  Neutrophils are normally found in the  |bloodstream|Circulatory_System|  and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes,  and consisting of neutrophil-killer and neutrophil-cager  |subpopulations|Neutrophilsubpopulations| . During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes,  |complement_proteins|Complement_System| , and cytokines, while they can also act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as  |antigen-presenting_cells|Antigen-Presenting_Cell|  that activate the adaptive immune system.         |Dendritic_cells|Dendritic_Cell|  are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the  |skin|Human_Skin| ,  |nose|Human_Nose| , lungs, stomach, and intestines.  They are named for their resemblance to  |neuron|Neuron| al  |dendrites|Dendrite| , as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the  |nervous_system|Nervous_System| . Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they  |present_antigens|Antigen_Presentation|  to  |T_cells|T_Cell| , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.          Granulocytes are leukocytes that have granules in their cytoplasm. In this category are neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils.  |Mast_cells|Mast_Cell|  reside in  |connective_tissues|Connective_Tissue|  and  |mucous_membranes|Mucous_Membrane| , and regulate the inflammatory response.  They are most often associated with  |allergy|Allergy|  and  |anaphylaxis|Anaphylaxis| .  |Basophils|Basophil|  and  |eosinophils|Eosinophil|  are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators that are involved in defending against  |parasites|Parasitism|  and play a role in allergic reactions, such as  |asthma|Asthma| .         |Innate_lymphoid_cells|Innate_Lymphoid_Cell|  are a group of  |innate_immune|Innate_Immune_System|  cells that are derived from  |common_lymphoid_progenitor|Common_Lymphoid_Progenitor|  and belong to the  |lymphoid_lineage|Lymphopoiesis| . These cells are defined by absence of antigen specific  |B|B-Cell_Receptor|  or  |T_cell_receptor|T-Cell_Receptor|  because of the lack of  |recombination_activating_gene|Recombination_Activating_Gene|  . ILCs do not express myeloid or dendritic cell markers.       |Natural_killer_cells|Natural_Killer_Cells| , one of member ILCs, are lymphocytes and a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes.  Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as missing self. This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I —a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells. They were named natural killer because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing self. For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of missing self . Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.           Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection.  The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased  |blood|Blood|  flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by  |eicosanoids|Eicosanoid|  and  |cytokines|Cytokine| , which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include  |prostaglandins|Prostaglandin|  that produce  |fever|Fever|  and the  |dilation|Vasodilator|  of  |blood_vessels|Blood_Vessel|  associated with inflammation, and  |leukotrienes|Leukotriene|  that attract certain  |white_blood_cells|White_Blood_Cell|  .   Common cytokines include  |interleukins|Interleukin|  that are responsible for communication between white blood cells;  |chemokines|Chemokine|  that promote  |chemotaxis|Chemotaxis| ; and  |interferons|Interferon|  that have  |anti-viral|Antiviral_Drug|  effects, such as shutting down  |protein_synthesis|Protein_Biosynthesis|  in the host cell.   |Growth_factors|Growth_Factor|  and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.           The complement system is a  |biochemical_cascade|Biochemical_Cascade|  that attacks the surfaces of foreign cells. It contains over 20 different proteins and is named for its ability to complement the killing of pathogens by  |antibodies|Antibody| . Complement is the major humoral component of the innate immune response.   Many species have complement systems, including non- |mammals|Mammal|  like plants, fish, and some  |invertebrates|Invertebrate| .      In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to  |carbohydrates|Carbohydrate|  on the surfaces of  |microbes|Microbe| . This recognition  |signal|Cell_Signaling|  triggers a rapid killing response.  The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs after sequential  |proteolytic|Proteolysis|  activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a  |catalytic|Catalysis|  cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled  |positive_feedback|Positive_Feedback| .  The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase  |vascular_permeability|Vascular_Permeability| , and  |opsonize|Opsonin|  the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their  |plasma_membrane|Cell_Membrane| .              The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is remembered by a signature antigen.  The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific non-self antigens during a process called antigen presentation. Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by memory cells . Should a pathogen infect the body more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it.       The cells of the adaptive immune system are special types of leukocytes, called lymphocytes.  |B_cells|B_Cell|  and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from  |hematopoietic_stem_cells|Hematopoietic_Stem_Cell|  in the  |bone_marrow|Bone_Marrow| . B cells are involved in the  |humoral_immune_response|Humoral_Immunity| , whereas T cells are involved in  |cell-mediated_immune_response|Cell-Mediated_Immunity| .     Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to  |Class_I_MHC|Major_Histocompatibility_Complexmhc_Class_I|  molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to  |Class_II_MHC|Major_Histocompatibility_Complexmhc_Class_Ii|  molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the  |γδ_T_cells|Gamma/Delta_T_Cells|  that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.  The double-positive T cells are exposed to a wide variety of self-antigens in the  |thymus|Thymus| , in which  |iodine|Iodine|  is necessary for its thymus development and activity.      In contrast, the B cell antigen-specific receptor is an  |antibody|Antibody|  molecule on the B cell surface, and recognizes whole pathogens without any need for  |antigen_processing|Antigen_Processing| . Each lineage of B cell expresses a different antibody, so the complete set of B cell antigen receptors represent all the antibodies that the body can manufacture.       Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets. T cells recognize a non-self target, such as a pathogen, only after antigens have been processed and presented in combination with a self receptor called a major histocompatibility complex molecule.       There are two major subtypes of T cells: the  |killer_T_cell|Cytotoxic_T_Cell|  and the  |helper_T_cell|T_Helper_Cell| . In addition there are  |regulatory_T_cells|Regulatory_T_Cells|  which have a role in modulating immune response.        |Killer_T_cells|Cytotoxic_T_Cell|  are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.  As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their  |T-cell_receptor|T-Cell_Receptor|  binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a  |co-receptor|Co-Receptor|  on the T cell, called  |CD8|Cd8| . The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases  |cytotoxins|Cytotoxicity| , such as  |perforin|Perforin| , which form pores in the target cells  |plasma_membrane|Cell_Membrane| , allowing  |ions|Ion| , water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called  |granulysin|Granulysin|  induces the target cell to undergo  |apoptosis|Apoptosis| .  T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by helper T cells .           |Helper_T_cells|T_Helper_Cell|  regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help determine which immune responses the body makes to a particular pathogen.   These cells have no cytotoxic activity and do not kill infected cells or clear pathogens directly. They instead control the immune response by directing other cells to perform these tasks.     Helper T cells express T cell receptors that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cells  |CD4|Cd4|  co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell  that are responsible for the T cells activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell.  The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cells surface, such as CD40 ligand , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.         |Gamma_delta_T_cells|Gamma_Delta_T_Cell|   possess an alternative  |T-cell_receptor|T-Cell_Receptor|  as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other unconventional T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as  |CD1d|Cd1D_Receptor| -restricted  |Natural_Killer_T_cells|Natural_Killer_T_Cell| , γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity.  On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of  |adaptive_immunity|Adaptive_Immune_System|  as they  |rearrange_TCR_genes|Vj_Recombination|  to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as  |pattern_recognition_receptors|Pattern_Recognition_Receptor| . For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to  |common_molecules|Non-Peptidic_Antigen|  produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in  |epithelia|Epithelium|  respond to stressed epithelial cells.          A  |B_cell|B_Cell|  identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen.  This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by  |proteolysis|Proteolysis|  into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases  |lymphokines|Lymphokine|  and activates the B cell.  As the activated B cell then begins to  |divide|Cell_Division| , its offspring   |secrete|Secretion|  millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and  |lymph|Lymphatic_System| , bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by  |complement_activation|Complement_System|  or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.           When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate, some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again. This is adaptive because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges. Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory.          The immune system is involved in many aspects of physiological regulation in the body. The immune system interacts intimately with other systems, such as the  |endocrine|Endocrine_System|    and the  |nervous|Nervous_System|     systems. The immune system also plays a crucial role in  |embryogenesis|Embryogenesis|  , as well as in  |tissue|Tissue|  repair and  |regeneration|Regeneration| .        |Hormones|Hormone|  can act as  |immunomodulators|Immunomodulators| , altering the sensitivity of the immune system. For example,  |female_sex_hormones|Female_Sex_Hormones|  are known  |immunostimulators|Immunostimulator|  of both adaptive  and innate immune responses.     Some autoimmune diseases such as  |lupus_erythematosus|Lupus_Erythematosus|  strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with  |puberty|Puberty| . By contrast,  |male_sex_hormones|Androgen|  such as  |testosterone|Testosterone|  seem to be  |immunosuppressive|Immunosuppressive| .  Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably  |prolactin|Prolactin| ,  |growth_hormone|Growth_Hormone|  and  |vitamin_D|Vitamin_D| .         When a T-cell encounters a foreign  |pathogen|Pathogen| , it extends a  |vitamin_D_receptor|Vitamin_D_Receptor| . This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of  |vitamin_D|Vitamin_D| , the steroid hormone  |calcitriol|Calcitriol| . T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene  |CYP27B1|Cyp27B1| , which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D,  |calcidiol|Calcidiol|  into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express  |CYP27B1|Cyp27B1|  and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are  |dendritic_cells|Dendritic_Cell| ,  |keratinocytes|Keratinocyte|  and  |macrophages|Macrophage| .       It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals.  Conversely, some hormones are regulated by the immune system, notably  |thyroid_hormone|Thyroid_Hormone|  activity.  The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less  |cholecalciferol|Cholecalciferol|  via  |UVB_radiation|Uvb_Radiation| . Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.        The immune system is affected by sleep and rest,  and  |sleep_deprivation|Sleep_Deprivation|  is detrimental to immune function.  Complex feedback loops involving  |cytokines|Cytokines| , such as  |interleukin-1|Interleukin-1|  and  |tumor_necrosis_factor-α|Tumor_Necrosis_Factor-Α|  produced in response to infection, appear to also play a role in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement  sleep.  Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in  |slow-wave_sleep|Slow-Wave_Sleep|  relative to REM sleep.      When suffering from sleep deprivation, active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as  |NFIL3|Nfil3| , which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.      In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of  |cortisol|Cortisol| ,  |epinephrine|Epinephrine| , and  |norepinephrine|Norepinephrine|  induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1,  |interleukin-12|Interleukin-12| ,  |TNF-alpha|Tnf-Alpha|  and  |IFN-gamma|Ifn-Gamma| . These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak . In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the  |T_h_1/T_h_2|Th1_Cell|  cytokine balance towards one that supports T h 1, an increase in overall T h cell proliferation, and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.      In contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs , peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and  |catecholamines|Catecholamine| , peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of  |melatonin|Melatonin| . Inflammation causes a great deal of  |oxidative_stress|Oxidative_Stress|  and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.         |Overnutrition|Overnutrition|  is associated with diseases such as  |diabetes|Diabetes|  and  |obesity|Obesity| , which are known to affect immune function. More moderate malnutrition, as well as certain specific trace mineral and nutrient deficiencies, can also compromise the immune response. R.M. Suskind, C.L. Lachney, J.N. Udall, Jr.,  , in: Dairy products in human health and nutrition, M. Serrano-Ríos, ed., CRC Press, 1994, pp. 285–300     Foods rich in certain  |fatty_acids|Fatty_Acid|  may foster a healthy immune system.  Likewise,  |fetal_undernourishment|Prenatal_Development|  can cause a lifelong impairment of the immune system.        The immune system, particularly the innate component, plays a decisive role in  |tissue|Tissue|  repair after an insult.      Key actors include  |macrophages|Macrophage|  and  |neutrophils|Neutrophil| , but other cellular actors, including γδ T cells,  |innate_lymphoid_cells|Innate_Lymphoid_Cell|  , and  |regulatory_T_cells|Regulatory_T_Cell|  , are also important. The plasticity of immune cells and the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair. Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well, for example in amphibians. According to one hypothesis, organisms that can regenerate could be less immunocompetent than organisms that cannot regenerate.         The immune system is a remarkably effective structure that incorporates specificity, inducibility and adaptation. Failures of host defense do occur, however, and fall into three broad categories: immunodeficiencies, autoimmunity, and hypersensitivities.           |Immunodeficiencies|Immunodeficiency|  occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the  |elderly|Old_Age| , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to  |immunosenescence|Immunosenescence| .   In  |developed_countries|Developed_Country| ,  |obesity|Obesity| ,  |alcoholism|Alcohol_Abuse| , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However,  |malnutrition|Malnutrition|  is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in  |developing_countries|Developing_Country| . Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function,  |IgA|Immunoglobulin_A|  antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the  |thymus|Thymus|  at an early age through  |genetic_mutation|Mutation|  or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.      Immunodeficiencies can also be inherited or  |acquired|Immunodeficiencyacquired_Immune_Deficiency| .  |Chronic_granulomatous_disease|Chronic_Granulomatous_Disease| , where  |phagocytes|Phagocyte|  have a reduced ability to destroy pathogens, is an example of an inherited, or  |congenital,_immunodeficiency|Primary_Immunodeficiency| .  |AIDS|Aids|  and some types of  |cancer|Cancer|  cause acquired immunodeficiency.            Overactive immune responses form the other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the  |autoimmune_disorders|Autoimmunity| . Here, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self, and attacks part of the body. Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with self peptides.  One of the functions of specialized cells  is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity.           |Hypersensitivity|Hypersensitivity|  is an immune response that damages the bodys own tissues. They are divided into four classes based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or  |anaphylactic|Anaphylaxis|  reaction, often associated with  |allergy|Allergy| . Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by  |IgE|Immunoglobulin_E| , which triggers degranulation of  |mast_cells|Mast_Cell|  and  |basophils|Basophil_Granulocyte|  when cross-linked by antigen.    Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patients own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent hypersensitivity, and is mediated by  |IgG|Immunoglobulin_G|  and  |IgM|Immunoglobulin_M|  antibodies.    |Immune_complex|Immune_Complex| es deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity  usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve  contact dermatitis  . These reactions are mediated by  |T_cells|T_Cell| ,  |monocytes|Monocyte| , and  |macrophages|Macrophage| .          Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection, but it can appear without known cause.     Inflammation is produced by  |eicosanoids|Eicosanoid|  and  |cytokines|Cytokine| , which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include  |prostaglandins|Prostaglandin|  that produce  |fever|Fever|  and the  |dilation|Vasodilator|  of  |blood_vessels|Blood_Vessel|  associated with inflammation, and  |leukotrienes|Leukotriene|  that attract certain  |white_blood_cells|White_Blood_Cell|  . Common cytokines include  |interleukins|Interleukin|  that are responsible for communication between white blood cells;  |chemokines|Chemokine|  that promote  |chemotaxis|Chemotaxis| ; and  |interferons|Interferon|  that have  |anti-viral|Antiviral_Drug|  effects, such as shutting down  |protein_synthesis|Protein_Biosynthesis|  in the host cell.  |Growth_factors|Growth_Factor|  and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.            The immune response can be manipulated to suppress unwanted responses resulting from autoimmunity, allergy, and  |transplant_rejection|Transplant_Rejection| , and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system  or cancer.        |Immunosuppressive_drugs|Immunosuppressive_Drug|  are used to control autoimmune disorders or  |inflammation|Inflammation|  when excessive tissue damage occurs, and to prevent  |transplant_rejection|Transplant_Rejection|  after an  |organ_transplant|Organ_Transplant| .       |Anti-inflammatory|Anti-Inflammatory|  drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation.  |Glucocorticoids|Glucocorticoid|  are the most powerful of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable  |side_effects|Adverse_Effect| , such as  |central_obesity|Central_Obesity| ,  |hyperglycemia|Hyperglycemia| ,  |osteoporosis|Osteoporosis| , and their use must be tightly controlled.  Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with  |cytotoxic|Cytotoxicity|  or  |immunosuppressive_drugs|Immunosuppressive_Drug|  such as  |methotrexate|Methotrexate|  or  |azathioprine|Azathioprine| .    |Cytotoxic_drugs|Chemotherapy|  inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other  |constantly_dividing_cells|Constantly_Dividing_Cells|  and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive drugs such as  |cyclosporin|Cyclosporin|  prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting  |signal_transduction|Signal_Transduction|  pathways.            |Cancer_immunotherapy|Cancer_Immunotherapy|  covers the medical ways to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer tumours.       Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through  |vaccination|Vaccination| . The principle behind vaccination  is to introduce an  |antigen|Antigen|  from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop  |specific_immunity|Specific_Immunity|  against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.   |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization| . Retrieved on 1 January 2007.     Most viral  |vaccines|Vaccine|  are based on live  |attenuated|Attenuator|  viruses, while many bacterial vaccines are based on  |acellular|Non-Cellular_Life|  components of micro-organisms, including harmless  |toxin|Toxin|  components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional  |adjuvants|Immunologic_Adjuvant|  that activate the  |antigen-presenting_cells|Antigen-Presenting_Cell|  of the  |innate_immune_system|Immune_Systeminnate|  and maximize  |immunogenicity|Immunogenicity| .              Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate  |tumors|Tumor| . This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express  |antigens|Antigentumor_Antigens|  that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources;  some are derived from  |oncogenic|Oncogenic|  viruses like  |human_papillomavirus|Human_Papillomavirus| , which causes cancer of the  |cervix|Cervical_Cancer|   ,  |vulva|Vulva_Cancer| ,  |vagina|Vaginal_Cancer| ,  |penis|Penis_Cancer| ,  |anus|Anal_Cancer| ,  |mouth,_and_throat|Oropharynx| ,  while others are the organisms own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an  |enzyme|Enzyme|  called  |tyrosinase|Tyrosinase|  that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells  into tumors called  |melanomas|Melanoma| .   A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating  |cell_growth|Cell_Growth|  and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called  |oncogenes|Oncogene| .       The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells.  Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal.  NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors.  Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the  |complement_system|Complement_System| .     Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers.   Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine  |TGF-β|Tgf_Beta| , which suppresses the activity of  |macrophages|Macrophage|  and  |lymphocytes|Lymphocyte| .  In addition,  |immunological_tolerance|Immune_Tolerance|  may develop against tumor antigens, so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells.     Paradoxically, macrophages can promote tumor growth  when tumor cells send out cytokines that attract macrophages, which then generate cytokines and growth factors such as  |tumor-necrosis_factor_alpha|Tumor_Necrosis_Factor_Alpha|  that nurture tumor development or promote stem-cell-like plasticity. In addition, a combination of hypoxia in the tumor and a cytokine produced by macrophages induces tumor cells to decrease production of a protein that blocks  |metastasis|Metastasis|  and thereby assists spread of cancer cells.
