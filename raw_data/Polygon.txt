      In  |elementary_geometry|Elementary_Geometry| , a polygon  is a  |plane|Plane| |_figure|Shape|  that is described by a finite number of straight  |line_segments|Line_Segment|  connected to form a closed  |polygonal_chain|Polygonal_Chain|  or polygonal circuit. The solid plane region, the bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a polygon.     The segments of a polygonal circuit are called its  edges  or sides, and the points where two edges meet are the polygons  vertices  or corners. The interior of a solid polygon is sometimes called its body. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides; for example, a  |triangle|Triangle|  is a 3-gon.     A  |simple_polygon|Simple_Polygon|  is one which does not intersect itself. Mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding polygonal chains of simple polygons and they often define a polygon accordingly. A polygonal boundary may be allowed to cross over itself, creating  |star_polygons|Star_Polygon|  and other  |self_intersecting_polygons|List_Of_Self_Intersecting_Polygons| .     A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general  |polytope|Polytope|  in any number of dimensions. There are many more  |generalizations_of_polygons|Generalizations|  defined for different purposes.       The word polygon derives from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  adjective πολύς  much , many and γωνία  corner or angle . It has been suggested that γόνυ  knee may be the origin of gon.                Polygons are primarily classified by the number of sides. See the  |table_below|Naming| .       Polygons may be characterized by their convexity or type of non-convexity:    |Convex|Convex_Polygon| |Simple|Simple_Polygon| |Concave|Concave_Polygon| |Star_shaped|Star_Shaped_Polygon| |Self_intersecting|List_Of_Self_Intersecting_Polygons| complex is sometimes used in contrast to simple, but this usage risks confusion with the idea of a  complex polygon  as one which exists in the complex  |Hilbert|Hilbert_Space|  plane consisting of two  |complex|Complex_Number|  dimensions.    |Star_polygon|Star_Polygon| |Equiangular|Equiangular_Polygon| |Cyclic|Cyclic_Polygon| |circle|Circle| , called the  |circumcircle|Circumcircle| .   Isogonal or  |vertex_transitive|Vertex_Transitive| |symmetry_orbit|Symmetry_Orbit| . The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular.    |Equilateral|Equilateral_Polygon| |Tangential|Tangential_Polygon| |inscribed_circle|Inscribed_Circle| .   Isotoxal or  |edge_transitive|Edge_Transitive| |symmetry_orbit|Symmetry_Orbit| . The polygon is also equilateral and tangential.    |Regular|Regular_Polygon| isogonal and isotoxal. Equivalently, it is both cyclic and equilateral, or both equilateral and equiangular. A non-convex regular polygon is called a regular star polygon .        |Rectilinear|Rectilinear_Polygon| |Monotone|Monotone_Polygon|  with respect to a given line L |orthogonal|Orthogonal|  to L intersects the polygon not more than twice.        |Euclidean_geometry|Euclidean_Geometry|  is assumed throughout.       Any polygon has as many corners as it has sides. Each corner has several angles. The two most important ones are:    Interior angle  – The sum of the interior angles of a simple n-gon is   |radians|Radian|  or   |degrees|Degree| . This is because any simple n-gon  can be considered to be made up of  triangles, each of which has an angle sum of π radians or 180 degrees. The measure of any interior angle of a convex regular n-gon is   radians or 180-  degrees. The interior angles of regular  |star_polygons|Star_Polygon|  were first studied by Poinsot, in the same paper in which he describes the four  |regular_star_polyhedra|Kepler–Poinsot_Polyhedron| , each interior angle is   radians or   degrees.     Exterior angle  – The exterior angle is the  |supplementary_angle|Supplementary_Angle|  to the interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle turned at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing all the way around the polygon makes one full  |turn|Turn| , so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a  |pentagram|Pentagram|  and 0° for an angular eight or  |antiparallelogram|Antiparallelogram| , where d is the density or starriness of the polygon. See also  |orbit_|Orbit| .            In this section, the vertices of the polygon under consideration are taken to be , ,   in order. For convenience in some formulas, the notation  will also be used.     If the polygon is non-self-intersecting , the signed  |area|Area|  is   : A         xx   yny,   or, using  |determinants|Determinant|    : 16 A       Q & Q     Q & Q   ,   where Q is the squared distance between and .

Debrecen 1, 42–50        The signed area depends on the ordering of the vertices and of the  |orientation|Orientation|  of the plane. Commonly, the positive orientation is defined by the rotation that maps the positive -axis to the positive -axis. If the vertices are ordered counterclockwise , the signed area is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In either case, the area formula is correct in  |absolute_value|Absolute_Value| . This is commonly called the  |shoelace_formula|Shoelace_Formula|  or Surveyors formula.      The area A of a simple polygon can also be computed if the lengths of the sides, a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n  and the  |exterior_angles|Exterior_Angle| , θ 1 , θ 2 , ..., θ n  are known, from:   :     .     The formula was described by Lopshits in 1963.      If the polygon can be drawn on an equally spaced grid such that all its vertices are grid points,  |Picks_theorem|Picks_Theorem|  gives a simple formula for the polygons area based on the numbers of interior and boundary grid points: the former number plus one-half the latter number, minus 1.
