The book has a very different tone from Steinbecks amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row. It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel, but were disappointed that it was not another Grapes of Wrath. Cynthia Burkhead, The students companion to John Steinbeck, Greenwood Press, 2002, p. 24    In the Nobel Prize presentation speech next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.     Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.         In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception. The selection was heavily criticized, and described as one of the Academys biggest mistakes in one Swedish newspaper.  The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising , noting that e international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age . Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: Frankly, no. Biographer Jackson Benson notes, is honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into the main currents of American writing as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value. In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:          Fifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a compromise choice among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors ": null
