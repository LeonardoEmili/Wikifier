He was born in  |Brussels|Brussels| , the son of  |Cornelis_van_Aarsens|Cornelis_Van_Aarsens| , also a statesman. His talents commended him to the notice of Advocate  |Johan_van_Oldenbarnevelt|Johan_Van_Oldenbarnevelt| , who sent him, at the age of 26 years, as a diplomatic agent of the states-general to the court of  |France|France| . He took a considerable part in the negotiations of the  |Twelve_Years_Truce|Twelve_Years_Truce|  in 1609.     His conduct of affairs having displeased the French king, he was recalled from his post by Oldenbarneveldt in 1614, after the French ambassador  |Benjamin_Aubery_du_Maurier|Benjamin_Aubery_Du_Maurier|  had demanded Aarsens recall. Such was the hatred he henceforth conceived against his former benefactor, that he did his very utmost to effect Oldebarneveldts ruin. However, he was not a member of the court that convicted Oldenbarnevelt in the  |Trial_of_Oldenbarnevelt_Grotius_and_Hogerbeets|Trial_Of_Oldenbarnevelt_Grotius_And_Hogerbeets|  as Chisholm mistakenly reports.     He afterwards became the confidential counselor of  |Maurice_Prince_of_Orange|Maurice_Prince_Of_Orange| , and afterwards of  |Frederick_Henry_Prince_of_Orange|Frederick_Henry_Prince_Of_Orange| , in their conduct of the foreign affairs of the republic. He was sent on special embassies to  |Venice|Venice| ,  |Germany|Germany|  and  |England|England| , and displayed so much diplomatic skill and finesse that  |Cardinal_Richelieu|Cardinal_Richelieu|  ranked him among the three greatest politicians of his time. He died, aged 69, in  |The_Hague|The_Hague| .
