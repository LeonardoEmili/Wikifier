      A coalition government in a  |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System|  is a form of government in which multiple  |political_parties|Political_Party|  cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that coalition . The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the  |parliament|Parliament| . A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis to give a government the high degree of perceived  |political_legitimacy|Legitimacy|  or  |collective_identity|Collective_Identity|  it desires while also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed all-party coalitions . If a coalition collapses, a  |confidence_vote|Motion_Of_Confidence|  is held or a  |motion_of_no_confidence|Motion_Of_No_Confidence|  is taken.          When a general election does not produce a clear majority for a single party, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or  |minority_cabinets|Minority_Government|  which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a group of parties that command a majority in parliament tend to be more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of no confidence.  |Majority_governments|Majority_Government|  based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained.          Countries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries| , the  |Benelux|Benelux|  countries,  |Australia|Australia| ,  |Austria|Austria| ,  |Cyprus|Cyprus| ,  |France|France| ,  |Germany|Germany| ,  |Greece|Greece| ,  |India|India| ,  |Indonesia|Indonesia| ,  |Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland| ,  |Israel|Israel| ,  |Italy|Italy| ,  |Japan|Japan| ,  |Kenya|Kenya| ,  |Kosovo|Kosovo| ,  |Lithuania|Lithuania| ,  |Latvia|Latvia| ,  |Lebanon|Lebanon| ,  |Nepal|Nepal| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| ,  |Pakistan|Pakistan| ,  |Thailand|Thailand| ,  |Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad_And_Tobago| ,  |Turkey|Turkey|  and  |Ukraine|Ukraine| .  |Switzerland|Switzerland|  has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the  |Magic_Formula|Magic_Formula|  . Between 2010 and 2015, the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  also operated a formal coalition between the  |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  and the  |Liberal_Democrat|Liberal_Democrats|  parties, but this was unusual: the UK usually has a single-party majority government.                   In the  |United_Kingdom|Politics_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , coalition governments usually have only been formed at times of national crisis. The most prominent was the  |National_Government|National_Government|  of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both  |world_wars|World_War| . Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function: for instance the  |Labour|Labour_Party|  government of  |James_Callaghan|James_Callaghan|  formed  |a_pact|Lib-Lab_Pact|  with the  |Liberals|Liberal_Party|  from March 1977 until July 1978, after a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labours majority of three seats which had been gained at the  |October_1974_election|October_1974_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . However, in the run-up to the  |1997_general_election|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Labour opposition leader  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  was in talks with  |Liberal_Democrat|Liberal_Democrats|  leader  |Paddy_Ashdown|Paddy_Ashdown|  about forming a coalition government if Labour failed to win a majority at the election; but there proved to be no need for a coalition as Labour won the election by a  |landslide|Landslide_Victory| .  The  |2010_general_election|2010_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  resulted in a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament|  , and the  |Conservatives|Conservative_Party| , led by  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| , which had won the largest number of seats, formed a  |coalition|Cameron–Clegg_Coalition|  with the  |Liberal_Democrats|Liberal_Democrats|  in order to gain a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.  It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of  |Winston_Churchills|Winston_Churchill|  wartime coalition, Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940,  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron|  on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill Their Finest Hour.   Labour and the Liberal Democrats have entered into a coalition three times in the  |Scottish_Parliament|Scottish_Parliament|  and twice in the  |Welsh_Assembly|Welsh_Assembly| .       In Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the  |Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany|Christian_Democratic_Union_Of_Germany|  together with their partners the  |Christian_Social_Union_in_Bavaria|Christian_Social_Union_In_Bavaria|  , or the  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  , to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example,  |Helmut_Kohls|Helmut_Kohl|  CDU governed for years in coalition with the  |Free_Democratic_Party|Free_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  ; from 1998 to 2005  |Gerhard_Schröders|Gerhard_Schröder|  SPD was in power with the  |Greens|German_Green_Party| ; and from 2009  |Angela_Merkel|Angela_Merkel| , CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.     Grand coalitions of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare, as large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early  |elections|2005_German_Federal_Election| , the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the  |Chancellery|Chancellor_Of_Germany|  while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts. Parties frequently make statements ahead of elections which coalitions they categorically reject, similar to election promises or shadow cabinets in other countries.     In Germany, coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties . However, in the 2010s coalitions on the state level increasingly included three different parties, often  |FDP|Free_Democratic_Party| , Greens and one of the major parties or red red green coalitions of  |SPD|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany| ,  |Linkspartei|Linkspartei|  and Greens. By 2016, the Greens have joined governments on the state level in eleven coalitions in seven various constellations.             |Armenia|Armenia|  became an independent state in 1991, following the collapse of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . Since then, many political parties were formed in it, who mainly work with each other to form coalition governments. Currently the country is governed by the  |My_Step_Alliance|My_Step_Alliance|  coalition after successfully gaining a majority in the  |National_Assembly_of_Armenia|National_Assembly_Of_Armenia|  following the  |2018_Armenian_parliamentary_election|2018_Armenian_Parliamentary_Election| .       In federal  |Australian_politics|Politics_Of_Australia| , the conservative  |Liberal|Liberal_Party_Of_Australia| ,  |National|National_Party_Of_Australia| ,  |Country_Liberal|Country_Liberal_Party|  and  |Liberal_National|Liberal_National_Party_Of_Queensland|  parties are united in a coalition, known simply as  |the_Coalition|Coalition| . The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a  |two-party|Two-Party_System|  house, with the Coalition and the  |Labor_Party|Australian_Labor_Party|  being the major parties. This coalition is also found in the states of  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales|  and  |Victoria|Victoria| . In  |South_Australia|South_Australia|  and  |Western_Australia|Western_Australia|  the Liberal and National parties compete separately, while in the  |Northern_Territory|Northern_Territory|  and  |Queensland|Queensland|  the two parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party, in 1978, and the Liberal National Party, in 2008, respectively.     The other federal coalition has been:    |United_Australia|United_Australia_Party| – |Country|National_Country_Party| –Independents coalition in  |1940|1940_Australian_Federal_Election| |Tasmania|Tasmanian_Government| |1996|1996_Tasmanian_State_Election| .   Labor–Greens coalitions formed in  |1989|1989_Tasmanian_State_Election|  and  |2010|2010_Tasmanian_State_Election| .   In the  |Australian_Capital_Territory|Act_Government| |Independent|Independent|  coalition in  |1998|1998_Australian_Capital_Territory_General_Election| .   Labor–Greens coalitions in  |2001|2001_Australian_Capital_Territory_General_Election|  and  |2008|2008_Australian_Capital_Territory_General_Election| .       In  |Belgium|Politics_Of_Belgium| , where there are separate  |Dutch|Dutch_Language| -speaking and  |French|French_Language| -speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are common.       In  |Canada|Politics_Of_Canada| , the  |Great_Coalition|Great_Coalition|  was formed in 1864 by the  |Clear_Grits|Clear_Grits| ,  |Parti_bleu|Parti_Bleu| , and  |Liberal-Conservative_Party|Liberal-Conservative_Party| . During the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , Prime Minister  |Robert_Borden|Robert_Borden|  attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did  |cross_the_floor|Crossing_The_Floor|  and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.      As a result of the  |1919_Ontario_election|1919_Ontario_General_Election| , the  |United_Farmers_of_Ontario|United_Farmers_Of_Ontario|  and the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party_Of_Canada| , together with three independent MLAs, formed a coalition that governed  |Ontario|Ontario|  until 1923.     In  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia| , the governing Liberals formed a coalition with the opposition Conservatives in order to prevent the surging, left-wing  |Cooperative_Commonwealth_Federation|Cooperative_Commonwealth_Federation|  from taking power in the  |1941_British_Columbia_general_election|1941_British_Columbia_General_Election| . Liberal premier  |Duff_Pattullo|Duff_Pattullo|  refused to form a coalition with the third-place Conservatives, so his party removed him. The Liberal–Conservative coalition introduced a winner-take-all preferential voting system  in the hopes that their supporters would rank the other party as their second preference; however, this strategy did not take CCF second preferences into account. In the  |1952_British_Columbia_general_election|1952_British_Columbia_General_Election| , to the surprise of many, the right-wing populist  |BC_Social_Credit_Party|Bc_Social_Credit_Party|  won a minority. They were able to win a majority in the subsequent election as Liberal and Conservative supporters shifted their anti-CCF vote to Social Credit.     Manitoba has had more formal coalition governments than any other province. Following gains by the United Farmers/Progressive movement elsewhere in the country, the  |United_Farmers_of_Manitoba|United_Farmers_Of_Manitoba|  unexpectedly won the 1921 election. Like their counterparts in Ontario, they had not expected to win and did not have a leader. They asked  |John_Bracken|John_Bracken| , a professor in animal husbandry, to become leader and premier. Bracken changed the partys name to the  |Progressive_Party_of_Manitoba|Progressive_Party_Of_Manitoba| . During the Great Depression, Bracken survived at a time when other premiers were being defeated by forming a coalition government with the Manitoba Liberals . In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government with almost every party in the Manitoba Legislature . The only party not included was the small, communist  |Labor-Progressive_Party|Labor-Progressive_Party| , which had a handful of seats.     In Saskatchewan, NDP premier  |Roy_Romanow|Roy_Romanow|  formed a formal coalition with the  |Saskatchewan_Liberals|Saskatchewan_Liberal_Party|  in 1999 after being reduced to a minority. After two years, the newly elected Liberal leader David Karwacki ordered the coalition be disbanded, the Liberal caucus disagreed with him and left the Liberals to run as New Democrats in the upcoming election. The  |Saskatchewan_NDP|Saskatchewan_Ndp|  was re-elected with a majority under its new leader  |Lorne_Calvert|Lorne_Calvert| , while the Saskatchewan Liberals lost their remaining seats and have not been competitive in the province since.     According to historian  |Christopher_Moore|Christopher_Moore| , coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. That kind of leadership selection process had never been tried in any parliament system before and remains uncommon in the parliaments of the world today. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely.      During the  |2008–09_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute|2008–09_Canadian_Parliamentary_Dispute| , two of Canadas opposition parties signed an agreement to form what would become the countrys second coalition government since  |Confederation|Canadian_Confederation|  if the minority Conservative government was defeated on a vote of non-confidence,  unseating  |Stephen_Harper|Stephen_Harper|  as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party_Of_Canada|  and the  |New_Democratic_Party|New_Democratic_Party| . The  |Bloc_Québécois|Bloc_Québécois|  agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was  |prorogued|Prorogation_In_Canada|  by the  |Governor_General|Governor_General_Of_Canada| , and the coalition dispersed before parliament was reconvened.       From the creation of the  |Folketing|Folketing|  in 1849 through the introduction of  |proportional_representation|Proportional_Representation|  in 1918, there were only single-party governments in Denmark.  |Thorvald_Stauning|Thorvald_Stauning|  formed his  |second_government|Stauning_Ii_Cabinet|  and Denmarks first coalition government in 1929. With the exception of a string of one-party governments during the 1970s, the norm since 1929 has been coalition governments. Every government from 1982 until the  |2015_elections|2015_Danish_General_Election|  were coalitions. The most recent coalition was  |Løkkes_third_government|Lars_Løkke_Rasmussen_Iii_Cabinet| , which was replaced by the one-party  |Frederiksen_government|Frederiksen_Cabinet|  in 2019.     When the  |Social_Democrats|Social_Democrats|  under Stauning won 46% of the votes in the  |1935_election|1935_Danish_Folketing_Election| , this was the closest any party has gotten to winning an outright majority in parliament. One party has thus never held a majority alone, and even one-party governments since 1918 have needed the  |support|Confidence_And_Supply|  of at least one other party to govern. For example, the current government consists only of the Social Democrats, but also relies on the support of the  |Social_Liberal_Party|Danish_Social_Liberal_Party| , the  |Socialist_Peoples_Party|Socialist_Peoples_Party| , and the  |Red–Green_Alliance|Red–Green_Alliance| .       In  |Finland|Politics_Of_Finland| , no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government  since  |independence|Finlands_Declaration_Of_Independence|  with a five-party governing coalition, a so-called rainbow government . The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record and were unusual in the respect that both the centre-left and radical left-wing parties sat in the government with the major centre-right party . The  |Katainen_cabinet|Jyrki_Katainens_Cabinet|  was also a rainbow coalition of a total of five parties.       Since Indias Independence on 15 August 1947,  |Indian_National_Congress|Indian_National_Congress| , the major political party instrumental in  |Indian_independence_movement|Indian_Independence_Movement| , ruled the nation. The first Prime Minister  |Jawaharlal_Nehru|Jawaharlal_Nehru| , second PM  |Lal_Bahadur_Shastri|Lal_Bahadur_Shastri|  and the third PM  |Indira_Gandhi|Indira_Gandhi| , all were from the Congress party. However,  |Raj_Narain|Raj_Narain| , who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of  |Rae_Bareilly|Rae_Bareilly|  in 1971, lodged a case, alleging electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security. The  |next_elections_result|1977_Indian_General_Election|  was that  |Indias|Politics_Of_India|  first-ever coalition government was formed at the national level under the Prime Ministership of  |Morarji_Desai|Morarji_Desai| , which was also the first non-Congress national government, which existed from 24 March 1977 to 15 July 1979, headed by the  |Janata_Party|Janata_Party| ,  an amalgam of political parties opposed to Emergency imposed between 1975 and 1977. As the popularity of Janata Party dwindled, Morarji Desai had to resign and  |Charan_Singh|Charan_Singh| , a rival of Desai became the fifth PM. However, due to lack of support, this coalition government did not complete its five-year term.     Congress returned to the power in 1980 under Indira Gandhi, and later under  |Rajiv_Gandhi|Rajiv_Gandhi|  as the 6th PM. However, the next  |general_election_of_1989|1989_Indian_General_Election|  once again brought a coalition government under  |National_Front|National_Front| , which lasted until 1991, with two Prime Ministers, the second one being supported by Congress. The 1991 election resulted in a Congress led stable  |minority_government|Minority_Government|  for five years. The next 11th  |parliament|Lok_Sabha|  produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998. The first successful coalition government in India which completed the whole 5-year term was the  |Bharatiya_Janata_Party|Bharatiya_Janata_Party|  led  |National_Democratic_Alliance|National_Democratic_Alliance|  with  |Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee|Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee|  as PM from 1999 to 2004. Then another coalition, Congress led  |United_Progressive_Alliance|United_Progressive_Alliance| , consisting of 13 separate parties ruled India for two terms from 2004 to 2014 with  |Manmohan_Singh|Manmohan_Singh|  as PM. However, in the  |16th_general_election|2014_Indian_General_Election|  in May 2014, BJP secured majority on its own and National Democratic Alliance came into power, with  |Narendra_Modi|Narendra_Modi|  as Prime Minister. In 2019, Narendra Modi got re-elected as Prime Minister for the second time as National Democratic Alliance again secured majority in the  |17th_general_election|2019_Indian_General_Election| .       As a result of the  |toppling_of_Suharto|Fall_Of_Suharto| , political freedom is significantly increased. Compared to only three parties allowed to exist in the  |New_Order|New_Order|  era, a total of 48 political parties participated in the  |1999_election|1999_Indonesian_Legislative_Election| , a total of 24 parties in the  |2004_election|2004_Indonesian_Legislative_Election| , 38 parties in the  |2009_election|2009_Indonesian_Legislative_Election| , and 15 parties in the  |2014_election|2014_Indonesian_Legislative_Election| . There are no majority winner of those elections and coalition governments are inevitable. The current government is a coalition of seven parties led by the  |PDIP|Indonesian_Democratic_Party_–_Struggle|  and  |Golkar|Party_Of_The_Functional_Groups| .       In  |Republic_of_Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland| , coalition governments are quite common; not since 1977 has a single party been able to form a majority government. Coalitions are the typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties,  |Fianna_Fáil|Fianna_Fáil|  and  |Fine_Gael|Fine_Gael| , and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of a minority Fine Gael government, supported by a  |confidence_and_supply|Confidence_And_Supply|  arrangement with Fianna Fáil.     Irelands first coalition government was formed in  |1948|1948_Irish_General_Election| . Ireland has had consecutive coalition governments since the  |1989_general_election|1989_Irish_General_Election| , excluding two brief Fianna Fáil minority administrations in 1994 and 2011 that followed the withdrawal of their coalition partners from government. Before 1989, Fianna Fáil had opposed participation in coalition governments, preferring single-party minority government instead.     Irish coalition governments have traditionally been based on one of two large blocs in  |Dáil_Éireann|Dáil_Éireann| |23rd_Government_of_Ireland|23Rd_Government_Of_Ireland| , comprising Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, which ruled between 1993 and 1994. The  |Government_of_the_31st_Dáil|Government_Of_The_31St_Dáil| , though a traditional Fine Gael–Labour coalition, resembles a  |grand_coalition|Grand_Coalition| , due to the collapse of the Fianna Fáil to third place among parties in Dáil Éireann.       A similar situation exists in  |Israel|Politics_Of_Israel| , which typically has at least 10 parties holding representation in the  |Knesset|Knesset| . The only faction to ever gain the majority of Knesset seats was  |Alignment|Alignment| , an alliance of the  |Labor_Party|Israeli_Labor_Party|  and  |Mapam|Mapam|  that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968 to 1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing  |Likud|Likud|  in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties.  |Ariel_Sharons|Ariel_Sharon|  formation of the centrist  |Kadima|Kadima|  party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.     Israel also formed a  |national_unity_government|National_Unity_Government|  from  |1984–1988|1984_Israeli_Legislative_Election| . The premiership and foreign ministry portfolio were held by the head of each party for two years, and they switched roles in 1986.       Post-World War II  |Japan|Politics_Of_Japan|  has historically been dominated by the  |Liberal_Democratic_Party|Liberal_Democratic_Party| , but there was a brief coalition government formed after the  |1993_election|1993_Japanese_General_Election|  following LDPs first loss of its overall  |House_of_Representatives|House_Of_Representatives_Of_Japan|  majority since 1955, winning only 223 out of 511 seats. The LDP government was replaced by an eight-party coalition government, which consisted of all of the previous opposition parties excluding the  |Japanese_Communist_Party|Japanese_Communist_Party| , who together controlled 243 seats. Every Japanese government since then has been a coalition government in one way or another.           |MMP|Mmp_Representation|  was introduced in  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  in  |the_1996_election|1996_New_Zealand_General_Election| .   In order to get into power, parties need to get a total of 50% of the 121 seats in parliament – 61. Since no parties have ever gotten a full majority, they must form coalitions with other parties. For example, during the  |2017_general_election|2017_New_Zealand_General_Election| ,  |Labour|Labour_Party|  got 46 seats and  |New_Zealand_First|New_Zealand_First|  got nine. The two formed a  |Coalition_Government|Sixth_Labour_Government_Of_New_Zealand|  with  |confidence_and_supply|Confidence_And_Supply|  from the  |Green_Party|Green_Party|  which got eight seats.            Advocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising differing parties need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the  |electorate|Constituency|  within a country.     Those who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy.  Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in  |Flanders|Flanders|  or  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland| . A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play  |kingmaker|Kingmaker|  and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.     Coalition governments have also been criticized for sustaining a  |consensus|Consensus|  on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the oppositions proposals — even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.     Powerful parties can also act in an  |oligocratic|Oligocracy|  way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to  |two-party_systems|Two-Party_System| , which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory  |nomination_rules|Nomination_Rules|  regulations and  |plurality_voting_system|Plurality_Voting_System| .
