During this time he came to be seen as the leader of the  |Labor_Right|Labor_Right|  faction, and developed a reputation as a talented parliamentary performer.     After the Labor landslide at the  |1983_election|1983_Australian_Federal_Election| , Keating was appointed Treasurer by Prime Minister  |Bob_Hawke|Bob_Hawke| . He became one of the most influential figures in the Government, overseeing the introduction of a large number of reforms intended to  |liberalise|Economic_Liberalism|  and strengthen the Australian economy. These included the  |Prices_and_Incomes_Accord|Prices_And_Incomes_Accord| , the  |float|Floating_Exchange_Rate|  of the  |Australian_dollar|Australian_Dollar| , the elimination of  |tariffs|Tariff| , the deregulation of the financial sector, and reform of the  |taxation_system|Taxation_In_Australia|  . After an initially close partnership, leadership tensions began to increase between Hawke and Keating, culminating in a  |secret_agreement|Kirribilli_Agreement_Of_1988|  that Hawke would eventually retire in Keatings favour. Keating became  |Deputy_Prime_Minister|Deputy_Prime_Minister|  in 1990, but in June 1991 he  |unsuccessfully_challenged|Australian_Labor_Party_Leadership_Spill_June_1991|  for the leadership, believing that Hawke had reneged on their earlier agreement.

At the  |1996_election|1996_Australian_Federal_Election| , Labor suffered a landslide defeat to the  |Liberal–National_Coalition|Coalition| .
