         Paul Thomas Mann  was a German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and the 1929  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  laureate. His highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and  |novellas|Novella|  are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual. His analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized versions of German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| ,  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche|  and  |Arthur_Schopenhauer|Arthur_Schopenhauer| .     Mann was a member of the  |Hanseatic|Hanseaten| |Mann_family|Mann_Family|  and portrayed his family and class in his first novel,  Buddenbrooks . His older brother was the radical writer  |Heinrich_Mann|Heinrich_Mann|  and three of Manns six children,  |Erika_Mann|Erika_Mann| ,  |Klaus_Mann|Klaus_Mann|  and  |Golo_Mann|Golo_Mann| , also became significant German writers. When  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  came to power in 1933, Mann fled to Switzerland. When  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  broke out in 1939, he moved to the United States, then returned to Switzerland in 1952. Mann is one of the best-known exponents of the so-called  Exilliteratur , German literature written in exile by those who opposed the Hitler regime.     Manns work influenced many later authors, including  |Heinrich_Böll|Heinrich_Böll| ,  |Joseph_Heller|Joseph_Heller| ,  |Yukio_Mishima|Yukio_Mishima| , and  |Orhan_Pamuk|Orhan_Pamuk| .

Contemporary Literature, Vol. 16, No. 1 , pp. 41–60             Paul Thomas Mann was born to a bourgeois family in  |Lübeck|Lübeck| , the second son of Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann and his wife  |Júlia_da_Silva_Bruhns|Júlia_Da_Silva_Bruhns| , a Brazilian woman of German and Portuguese ancestry, who emigrated to Germany with her family when she was seven years old. His mother was  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  but Mann was baptised into his fathers  |Lutheran|Lutheranism|  religion. Manns father died in 1891, and after that his trading firm was liquidated. The family subsequently moved to  |Munich|Munich| . Mann first studied science at a Lübeck  gymnasium  , then attended the  |Ludwig_Maximillians_University_of_Munich|Ludwig_Maximilian_University_Of_Munich|  as well as the  |Technical_University_of_Munich|Technical_University_Of_Munich| , where, in preparation for a journalism career, he studied history, economics, art history and literature.      Mann lived in Munich from 1891 until 1933 , with the exception of a year spent in  |Palestrina|Palestrina| , Italy, with his elder brother, the novelist  |Heinrich|Heinrich_Mann| . Thomas worked at the South German Fire Insurance Company in 1894–95. His career as a writer began when he wrote for the magazine  Simplicissimus . Manns first short story, Little Mr Friedemann , was published in 1898.     In 1905, Mann married  |Katia_Pringsheim|Katia_Mann| , who came from a wealthy, secular Jewish industrialist family. She later joined the  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  church. The couple had six children.  Translation by Leslie Willson of Thomas Mann: Das Leben als Kunstwerk .               In 1912, he and his wife moved to a  |sanatorium|Sanatorium|  in  |Davos|Davos| , Switzerland, which was to inspire his 1924 novel  The Magic Mountain . He was also appalled by the risk of international confrontation between Germany and France, following the  |Agadir_Crisis|Agadir_Crisis|  in Morocco, and later by the outbreak of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| .     In 1929, Mann had a cottage built in the fishing village of Nidden,  |Memel_Territory|Klaipėda_Region|   on the  |Curonian_Spit|Curonian_Spit| , where there was a German art colony and where he spent the summers of 1930–1932 working on  Joseph and His Brothers . Today the cottage is a cultural center dedicated to him, with a small memorial exhibition.     In 1933, while travelling in the  |South_of_France|Southern_France| , Mann heard from his eldest children Klaus and Erika in Munich, that it would not be safe for him to return to Germany. The family emigrated to  |Küsnacht|Küsnacht| , near  |Zürich|Zürich| , Switzerland, but received  |Czechoslovak|Czechoslovakia|  citizenship and a passport in 1936. In 1939, following the  |German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia|German_Occupation_Of_Czechoslovakia| , he emigrated to the United States. He moved to  |Princeton,_New_Jersey|Princeton,_New_Jersey|  where he lived on 65 Stockton Road and began to teach at  |Princeton_University|Princeton_University| .  In 1942, the Mann family moved to  |1550_San_Remo_Drive|Thomas_Mann_House|  in the  |Pacific_Palisades|Pacific_Palisades,_Los_Angeles|  neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The Manns were prominent members of the German expatriate community of Los Angeles, and would frequently meet other emigres at  |the_house_of_Salka_and_Bertold_Viertel|Salka_And_Berthold_Viertel_House|  in Santa Monica, and at the  |Villa_Aurora|Villa_Aurora| , the home of fellow German exile  |Lion_Feuchtwanger|Lion_Feuchtwanger| . Jewish Womens Archive: , accessdate: 19 November 2016  On 23 June 1944 Thomas Mann was naturalized as a citizen of the United States. The Manns lived in Los Angeles until 1952.        The outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, prompted Mann to offer anti-Nazi speeches to the German people via the  |BBC|Bbc| . In October 1940 he began monthly broadcasts, recorded in the U.S. and flown to London, where the BBC broadcast them to Germany on the  |longwave|Longwave|  band. In these eight-minute addresses, Mann condemned Hitler and his paladins as crude philistines completely out of touch with European culture. In one noted speech he said, The war is horrible, but it has the advantage of keeping Hitler from making speeches about culture. Deutsche Hörer 25 Radiosendungen nach Deutschland. Insel Verlag, Leipzig 1970.     Mann was one of the few publicly active opponents of Nazism among German expatriates in the U.S. While some Germans claimed after the war that in his speeches he had endorsed the notion of  |collective_guilt|Collective_Guilt| , others felt he had been highly critical also of the politically unstable  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic|  that preceded the  |Third_Reich|Third_Reich| .          With the start of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  he was increasingly frustrated by rising  |McCarthyism|Mccarthyism| . As a suspected communist, he was required to testify to the  |House_Un-American_Activities_Committee|House_Un-American_Activities_Committee| , where he was termed one of the worlds foremost apologists for Stalin and company.  He was listed by HUAC as being affiliated with various peace organizations or Communist fronts. Being in his own words a non-communist rather than an  |anti-communist|Anti-Communist| , Mann openly opposed the allegations: As an American citizen of German birth I finally testify that I am painfully familiar with certain political trends. Spiritual intolerance, political inquisitions, and declining legal security, and all this in the name of an alleged state of emergency. ... That is how it started in Germany. As Mann joined protests against the jailing of the  |Hollywood_Ten|Hollywood_Ten|  and the firing of schoolteachers suspected of being Communists, he found the media had been closed to him .  Finally he was forced to quit his position as Consultant in Germanic Literature at the Library of Congress  and in 1952 he returned to Europe, to live in  |Kilchberg,_near_Zürich|Kilchberg,_Zürich| , Switzerland. He never again lived in Germany, though he regularly traveled there. His most important German visit was in 1949, at the 200th birthday of  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| , attending celebrations in  |Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt_Am_Main|  and  |Weimar|Weimar| , as a statement that German culture extended beyond the new political borders. In 1955, he died of  |atherosclerosis|Atherosclerosis|  in a hospital in  |Zürich|Zürich|  and was buried in Kilchberg. Wilson, Scott.

Many institutions are named in his honour, for instance the  |Thomas_Mann_Gymnasium|Thomas_Mann_Gymnasium|  of  |Budapest|Budapest| .              |Blanche_Knopf|Blanche_Knopf|  of  |Alfred_A._Knopf|Alfred_A._Knopf|  publishing house was introduced to Mann by  |H._L._Mencken|H._L._Mencken|  while on a book-buying trip to Europe.  Knopf became Manns American publisher, and Blanche hired scholar  |Helen_Tracy_Lowe-Porter|Helen_Tracy_Lowe-Porter|  to translate Manns books in 1924. Horton, David , Thomas Mann in English. A Study in Literary Translation, London, New Delhi, New York, Sydney: Bloomsbury.  Lowe-Porter subsequently translated Manns complete works. Blanche Knopf continued to look after Mann. After Buddenbrooks proved successful in its first year, they sent him an unexpected bonus. Later in the 1930s, Blanche helped arrange for Mann and his family to emigrate to America.     Mann was awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  in 1929, after he had been nominated by  |Anders_Österling|Anders_Österling| , member of the  |Swedish_Academy|Swedish_Academy| , principally in recognition of his popular achievement with the epic  Buddenbrooks  ,  The Magic Mountain   and his numerous short stories.   . Retrieved 11 November 2007 Based on Manns own family, Buddenbrooks relates the decline of a merchant family in Lübeck over the course of four generations. The Magic Mountain  follows an  |engineering|Engineering|  student who, planning to visit his  |tubercular|Tuberculosis|  cousin at a Swiss  |sanatorium|Sanatorium|  for only three weeks, finds his departure from the sanatorium delayed. During that time, he confronts medicine and the way it looks at the body and encounters a variety of characters, who play out ideological conflicts and discontents of contemporary European civilization. The tetralogy Joseph and His Brothers is an epic novel written over a period of sixteen years, and is one of the largest and most significant works in Manns oeuvre. Later, other novels included  Lotte in Weimar  , in which Mann returned to the world of Goethes novel  The Sorrows of Young Werther  ;  Doctor Faustus  , the story of composer Adrian Leverkühn and the corruption of  |German_culture|Culture_Of_Germany|  in the years before and during World War II; and  Confessions of Felix Krull  , which was unfinished at Manns death.     Throughout his  |Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky|  essay, he finds parallels between the Russian and the sufferings of  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche| . Speaking of Nietzsche, he says: his personal feelings initiate him into those of the criminal ... in general all creative originality, all artist nature in the broadest sense of the word, does the same. It was the French painter and sculptor  |Degas|Edgar_Degas|  who said that an artist must approach his work in the spirit of the criminal about to commit a crime.  Nietzsches influence on Mann runs deep in his work, especially in Nietzsches views on decay and the proposed fundamental connection between sickness and creativity. Mann held that disease is not to be regarded as wholly negative. In his essay on Dostoevsky we find: but after all and above all it depends on who is diseased, who mad, who epileptic or paralytic: an average dull-witted man, in whose illness any intellectual or cultural aspect is non-existent; or a Nietzsche or Dostoyevsky. In their case something comes out in illness that is more important and conductive to life and growth than any medical guaranteed health or sanity... in other words: certain conquests made by the soul and the mind are impossible without disease, madness, crime of the spirit.           Manns diaries reveal his struggles with his  |homosexuality|Homosexuality| , which found reflection in his works, most prominently through the obsession of the elderly Aschenbach for the 14-year-old Polish boy Tadzio in the novella  Death in Venice  . , quoted in e.g.  For a discussion of the relationship between his homosexuality and his writing, also see       |Anthony_Heilbuts|Anthony_Heilbut|  biography Thomas Mann: Eros and Literature uncovered the centrality of Manns sexuality to his oeuvre.  |Gilbert_Adairs|Gilbert_Adair|  work The Real Tadzio describes how, in the summer of 1911, Mann had stayed at the  |Grand_Hôtel_des_Bains|Grand_Hôtel_Des_Bains|  on the  |Lido|Lido_Di_Venezia|  of Venice with his wife and brother, when he became enraptured by the angelic figure of  |Władysław_Moes|Władysław_Moes| , a 10-year-old Polish boy . Manns diary records his attraction to his own 13-year-old son, Eissi – Klaus Mann: Klaus to whom recently I feel very drawn . In the background conversations about man-to-man eroticism take place; a long letter is written to Carl Maria Weber on this topic, while the diary reveals: In love with Klaus during these days . Eissi, who enchants me right now . Delight over Eissi, who in his bath is terribly handsome. Find it very natural that I am in love with my son ...

Robertson, Ritchie 2002. . Cambridge University Press. p. 5. Mann was a friend of the violinist and painter  |Paul_Ehrenberg|Paul_Ehrenberg| , for whom he had feelings as a young man . The attraction that he felt for Ehrenberg, which is corroborated by notebook entries, caused Mann difficulty and discomfort and may have been an obstacle to his marrying an English woman, Mary Smith, whom he met in 1901. In 1950, Mann met the 19 year old waiter Franz Westermeier, confiding to his diary Once again this, once again love . . In 1975, when Manns diaries were published, creating a national sensation in Germany, the retired Westermeier was tracked down in the United States: he was flattered to learn he had been the object of Manns obsession, but also shocked at its depth. Paul, James . Financial Times .     Although Mann had always denied his novels had autobiographical components, the unsealing of his diaries revealing how consumed his life had been with unrequited and sublimated passion resulted in a reappraisal of his work.   |Klaus_Mann|Klaus_Mann|  had dealt openly from the beginning with his own homosexuality in his literary work, critically referring to his fathers sublimation in his diary, whereas the daughter  |Erika_Mann|Erika_Mann|  and the younger son  |Golo_Mann|Golo_Mann|  came out only late in their lives.

During World War I, Mann supported  |Kaiser_Wilhelm_IIs|Wilhelm_Ii,_German_Emperor|  conservatism, attacked liberalism and supported the war effort, calling the Great War a purification, a liberation, an enormous hope . Yet in Von Deutscher Republik as a semi-official spokesman for parliamentary democracy, Mann called upon German intellectuals to support the new  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| . He also gave a lecture at the Beethovensaal in Berlin on 13 October 1922, which appeared in  Die neue Rundschau  in November 1922 in which he developed his eccentric defence of the Republic, based on extensive close readings of  |Novalis|Novalis|  and  |Walt_Whitman|Walt_Whitman| . Thereafter, his political views gradually shifted toward liberal left and democratic principles. See a recent translation of this lecture by Lawrence Rainey in , 14.1 , pp. 99–145.      He initially gave his support to the left-liberal  |German_Democratic_Party|Deutsche_Demokratische_Partei|  before shifting further left and urging unity behind the  |Social_Democrats|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany| .       In 1930, Mann gave a public address in Berlin titled An Appeal to Reason in which he strongly denounced  |Nazism|Nazism|  and encouraged resistance by the working class. This was followed by numerous essays and lectures in which he attacked the  |Nazis|Nazi_Party| . At the same time, he expressed increasing sympathy for socialist ideas. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Mann and his wife were on holiday in Switzerland. Due to his strident denunciations of Nazi policies, his son Klaus advised him not to return. In contrast to those of his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus, Manns books were not among those burnt publicly by Hitlers regime in May 1933, possibly since he had been the Nobel laureate in literature for 1929. In 1936, the Nazi government officially revoked his German citizenship.     During the war, Mann made a series of anti-Nazi radio-speeches, published as  Listen, Germany! . They were recorded on tape in the United States and then sent to Great Britain, where the  |BBC|Bbc|  transmitted them, hoping to reach German listeners.       Mann expressed his belief in the collection of letters written in exile, Listen, Germany! , that equating Russian communism with Nazi-fascism on the basis that both are  |totalitarian|Totalitarian|  systems was either superficial or insincere in showing a preference for fascism.  He clarified this view during a German press interview in July 1949, declaring that he was not a communist, but that communism at least had some relation to ideals of humanity and of a better future. He said that the transition of the communist revolution into an autocratic regime was a tragedy while Nazism was only devilish  |nihilism|Nihilism|  .                1905:  Fiorenza        1893: Vision       1894: Gefallen   1896: The Will to Happiness   1896: Disillusionment   1897: Death   1897:  |The_Clown|The_Clown|    1897: The Dilettante   1898:  |Tobias_Mindernickel|Tobias_Mindernickel|    1899: The Wardrobe   1900: Luischen - written in 1897   1900: The Road to the Churchyard   1903: The Hungry   1903: The Child Prodigy   1904: A Gleam   1904: At the Prophets   1905: A Weary Hour   1907: Railway Accident   1908: Anecdote   1911: The Fight between Jappe and the Do Escobar       1897:  Little Herr Friedemann     1936: Stories of Three Decades       1901:  Buddenbrooks     1909: Royal Highness    1924:  The Magic Mountain     1939:  Lotte in Weimar: The Beloved Returns   Doctor Faustus     1951:  The Holy Sinner         The Blood of the Walsungs    The Blood of the Walsungs      The Blood of the Walsungs     Felix Krull   Felix Krull     Confessions of Felix Krull , , unfinished      Joseph and His Brothers     The Stories of Jacob    Young Joseph    Joseph in Egypt    Joseph the Provider        1902: Gladius Dei  Tristan   Tonio Kröger   Death in Venice     1918: A Man and His Dog    1925:  Disorder and Early Sorrow     1930:  Mario and the Magician     1940:  The Transposed Heads     1944:  The Tables of the Law  - a commissioned work    1954:  The Black Swan         1915: Frederick and the Great Coalition   1918: Reflections of an Unpolitical Man   1922: The German Republic   1930: A Sketch of My Life - autobiographical   1950: Michelangelo according to his poems The original text is available    1947: Essays of Three Decades, translated from the German by H.
