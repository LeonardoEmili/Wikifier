Stimulated emission is the process by which an incoming  |photon|Photon|  of a specific frequency can interact with an excited atomic  |electron|Electron|  , causing it to drop to a lower  |energy|Energy|  level. The liberated energy transfers to the electromagnetic field, creating a new photon with a  |phase|Phase| ,  |frequency|Frequency| ,  |polarization|Polarization| , and  |direction|Direction|  of travel that are all identical to the photons of the incident wave. This is in contrast to  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission| , which occurs at random intervals without regard to the ambient electromagnetic field.     The process is identical in form to atomic  |absorption|Absorption|  in which the energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a  |population_inversion|Population_Inversion|  is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net  |optical_amplification|Optical_Amplification|  can be achieved. Such a  |gain_medium|Gain_Medium| , along with an optical resonator, is at the heart of a  |laser|Laser|  or  |maser|Maser| .   Lacking a feedback mechanism,  |laser_amplifiers|Laser_Amplifier|  and  |superluminescent|Amplified_Spontaneous_Emission|  sources also function on the basis of stimulated emission.        |Electrons|Electron|  and their interactions with  |electromagnetic_fields|Electromagnetic_Field|  are important in our understanding of  |chemistry|Chemistry|  and  |physics|Physics| .   In the  |classical_view|Classical_Electromagnetism| , the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is larger for orbits further from the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  of an  |atom|Atom| . However, quantum mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in  |orbitals|Atomic_Orbital| . Thus, electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom, two of which are shown below:          When an electron absorbs energy either from  |light|Light|  or  |heat|Heat|  , it receives that incident quantum of energy. But transitions are only allowed between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above.   This leads to  |emission_lines|Emission_Line|  and  |absorption_lines|Spectral_Line| .     When an electron is  |excited|Excited_State|  from a lower to a higher energy level, its unlikely for it to stay that way forever.   An electron in an excited state may decay to a lower energy state which is not occupied, according to a particular time constant characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission|  . The phase and direction associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many atoms in such an excited state may thus result in  |radiation|Radiation|  which has a narrow spectrum , but the individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would also emanate in random directions. This is the mechanism of  |fluorescence|Fluorescence|  and  |thermal_emission|Thermal_Emission| .     An external electromagnetic field at a frequency associated with a transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states , it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric  |dipole|Dipole| , and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this is the process of stimulated emission.       Stimulated emission was a theoretical discovery by  |Einstein|Einstein|    within the framework of the  |old_quantum_theory|Old_Quantum_Theory| , wherein the emission is described in terms of photons that are the quanta of the EM field. Stimulated emission can also occur in classical models, without reference to photons or quantum-mechanics.           Stimulated emission can be modelled mathematically by considering an atom that may be in one of two electronic energy states, a lower level state and an excited state , with energies E 1 and E 2 respectively.     If the atom is in the excited state, it may decay into the lower state by the process of  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission| , releasing the difference in energies between the two states as a photon. The photon will have  |frequency|Frequency|  ν 0 and energy hν 0 , given by:     : E2 - E1 h         where h is  |Plancks_constant|Planck_Constant| .     Alternatively, if the excited-state atom is perturbed by an electric field of frequency ν 0 , it may emit an additional photon of the same frequency and in phase, thus augmenting the external field, leaving the atom in the lower energy state. This process is known as stimulated emission.     In a group of such atoms, if the number of atoms in the excited state is given by N 2 , the rate at which stimulated emission occurs is given by     :     -    - B       N2     where the  |proportionality_constant|Proportionality_Constant|  B 21 is known as the  Einstein B coefficient  for that particular transition, and ρ is the radiation density of the incident field at frequency ν. The rate of emission is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the excited state N 2 , and to the density of incident photons.     At the same time, there will be a process of atomic absorption which removes energy from the field while raising electrons from the lower state to the upper state. Its rate is given by an essentially identical equation,     :     -    B       N1 .     The rate of absorption is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the lower state, N 1 . Einstein showed that the coefficient for this transition must be identical to that for stimulated emission:     : B B .     Thus absorption and stimulated emission are reverse processes proceeding at somewhat different rates. Another way of viewing this is to look at the net stimulated emission or absorption viewing it as a single process. The net rate of transitions from E 2 to E 1 due to this combined process can be found by adding their respective rates, given above:     :     -     B         B         N .     Thus a net power is released into the electric field equal to the photon energy hν times this net transition rate. In order for this to be a positive number, indicating net stimulated emission, there must be more atoms in the excited state than in the lower level:   N /math math  .
