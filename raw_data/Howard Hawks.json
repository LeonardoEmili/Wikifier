Griffiths throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, I thought he ought to be great in talking pictures because of that voice. However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffiths voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened for the first time in the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed. Hawkss contract with Fox ended in May 1929, and he never again signed a long-term contract with a major studio. He managed to remain an independent producer-director for the rest of his long career.          By 1930, Hollywood was in upheaval over the coming of talkies and the careers of many actors and directors were ruined. Hollywood studios were recruiting stage actors and directors that they believed were better suited for sound films. After having worked in the industry for 14 years and directed many financially successful films, Hawks found himself having to prove himself an asset to the studios once again. Leaving Fox on sour terms didnt help his reputation, but Hawks never backed down from fights with studio heads. After several months of unemployment, Hawks renewed his career with his first sound film in 1930.        Hawks first all-sound film was  The Dawn Patrol , based on an original story by ": null

To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women.  David Boxwell argues that the filmmakers body of work has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawkss fans rejoice in his oeuvres remarkable avoidance of Hollywoods religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.

Hawks also produced many of his own films, preferring not to work under major film studios, because it allowed him creative freedom in his writing, directing, and casting. Hawks would sometimes walk out on films that he wasnt producing himself. Hawks, however, never considered producing to come before his directing. For example, several of the film cards for his films show Directed and produced by Howard Hawks with produced underneath directed in much smaller font. Sometimes his films wouldnt credit any producer. Hawks discovered many well known film stars such as Paul Muni, George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Carole Lombard, Frances Farmer, Jane Russell, Montgomery Cliff, Joanne Dru, Angie Dickinson, James Caan, and most famously Lauren Bacall.       In the 1950s, Eugene Archer, a film fan, was planning on writing a book on important American film directors such as John Ford. However, after reading Cahiers du Cinema, Archer learned that the French film scene was more interested in Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. Books were not written on Hawks until the sixties and a full biography on Hawks wasnt published until 1997, twenty years after his death. Film critic ": null

        " cited Howard Hawks as the least known and least unappreciated Hollywood director of any stature . According to professor of film studies Ian Brookes, Hawks is not as well known as other directors, because of his lack of association with a particular genre such as Ford with Western and Hitchcock with thriller. Hawks worked across many genres including gangster, film noir, musical comedy, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, Western, aviation, and combat. Moreover, Hawks preferred not to associate with major studios during his film production. He worked for all major studios at least once on short term contract, but many of his films were produced under his own name. The simplicity of his narratives and stories may also have contributed to his under-recognition. Commercially, his films were successful, but he received little critical acclaim except for one Academy Award nomination for Best Director for Sergeant York , and an Honorary Academy Award presented to him two years before his death.     Some critics limit Hawks by his action films, describing Hawks as a director who produced films with a masculine bias , however action scenes in Hawkss films were often left to second-unit directors and Hawks actually preferred to work indoors. Howard Hawkss style is difficult to interpret, because there is no recognizable relationship between his visual and narrative style as in the films of his contemporary directors. Because his camera style was derived more from his working method rather than anecdotal or visual realization, his camera work is unobtrusive, making his films appear to have little to no cinematographic style. Hawkss style can, rather, by characterized as improvisational and collaborative.
