   NOTOC       |Macau|Macau|  is a  |Special_Administrative_Region|Special_Administrative_Regions_Of_China|  on the southern coast of China. It is located at the south of  |Guangdong|Guangdong|  Province, on the tip of the  |peninsula|Peninsula|  formed by the  |Zhujiang|Pearl_River| |estuary|Estuary|  on the east and the  |Xijiang|Xijiang_River|  on the west. Macau is situated  west of  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| , and  southwest of  |Guangzhou|Guangzhou| , the capital of Guangdong Province. It is situated immediately east and south of  |Zhuhai|Zhuhai| .     The region comprises the  |Macau_Peninsula|Macau_Peninsula|  and the islands of  |Taipa|Taipa|  and  |Coloane|Coloane| . Macau was once an island but gradually a connecting sandbar turned into a narrow  |isthmus|Isthmus| .  |Land_reclamation|Land_Reclamation|  in the 17th century made Macau into a peninsula, and a  |barrier_gate|Portas_Do_Cerco|  was built to mark the separation between the peninsula and the mainland. Pre-colonial records show that Macau totalled only  but began to increase as a result of  |Portuguese_settlement|Portuguese_Macau| . Land growth has accelerated since the last quarter of the 20th century, from  in 1972 to  in 1983 to  in 1994. Macaus size has gradually increased as result of continued land reclamation, especially on Taipa and Coloane. In 2014, the total land area was approximately .     There is a  long border between Macau and  |mainland_China|Mainland_China|  and a forty-kilometer-long coastline. The main border crossing between Macau and China is the  |Portas_do_Cerco|Portas_Do_Cerco|  Frontier Checkpoint on the Macau side, and the  |Gongbei_checkpoint|Gongbei_Port_Of_Entry|  on the Chinese side.

The modern high-rise skyline of Macau obscures much of the hilly landscape. The Macau skyline both defines and obscures its topography.     The Macau  |Peninsula|Peninsula|  is narrow in shape but varies in  |terrain|Terrain| .            Although Macau is located in the tropics, it has a  |humid_subtropical_climate|Humid_Subtropical_Climate|  , because the Siberian pressure system in the winter pushes cool air further south than similar semipermanent permanent high pressure systems. Its average year-round temperature is . Summers are very hot and humid: the July average temperature is  and the highest daytime temperature could reach . However, the heat is generally less intense than many places in mainland China due to the coastal location. Winters are short and mild: the January average is  and the lowest temperature could drop to , but very rarely any lower. There is about  of rainfall annually, with drier winters.     Macau is exposed to  |tropical_storms|Tropical_Storm|  originating from the southern Pacific Ocean during the summer. Major destruction occurred in September 1874, when a devastating  |typhoon|Typhoon|  hit Macau and high seas swept across the low-lying area of the peninsula. There are always a few tropical storm occurrences in Macau each year , although they vary in strengths. When they occur, they usually bring strong winds, rainfall and lower temperatures.     Prevailing winds and weather types change follow the monsoon pattern. It is warm and moist when the southeast and southwest winds coming from Pacific Ocean, and typhoons are relatively common during summertime; and is dry and slightly cold when the north winds coming from Siberia or the northern part of Mainland China.     During the transition period from northeast monsoon to southwest monsoon , the weather is moist and foggy. It is Macaus spring season. Summer is from May to September, when the southeast and southwest monsoon prevailing. It is rather hot and rainy. The weather in autumn is sunny and warm, when the southwest monsoon withdrawing gradually and the northeast monsoon advancing south. It is generally regarded as the most comfortable season there. Winter is from November to February next year, when the northeast monsoon prevailing. It is mainly dry, with occasional cold fronts arriving.     There are moderate to high levels of humidity year-round, with an annual average of 79.3%. Annual sunshine totals are moderate, at more than 1800 hours.            Negligible. In the past, large amounts of  |granite|Granite|  were extracted from Macaus hills for use as  |building_material|Building_Material| .       Relying on the water supply of  |Xijiang_River|Xijiang_River| , Macau is at present suffering its worst ever crisis of salinity in  |freshwater|Freshwater|  during dry season in 2006 which takes place in late winter and early spring time. The  |salinity|Salinity|  level of  |freshwater|Freshwater|  has recently aggrandised far above the standard set up by the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  or  |WHO|Who| .   By the end of 2007, Macau will be able to solve the problem of tap-water supply with relatively high level of salinity after the completion of the  Ping Gang  project. This project is aimed at shifting the intake of raw-water on the  |Xijiang_River|Xijiang_River|  20  km upstream in order to give a wide berth to the salt tide in the province of  |Guangdong|Guangdong| .                   Until early 20th century, the Macau peninsula was dotted with small farms on its northern area, beyond the walls protecting the city. Currently, in the Macau peninsula, no arable land, natural pastures or woodland exists and forests have been cleared and plant species have been subjected to profound changes. Coloane on the other hand, due to its later colonisation, still has its forests and is dotted with small farms, namely around the Coloane, Hac Sa and Ka Ho villages.     arable land: 0%   permanent crops: 0%   other: 100%     In 2010 plans were announced for an additional 3.5 square kilometres of land reclamation in Macau, to be carried out over five years and divided into six phases. These areas cover an area east of the  |Outer_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal|Outer_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal,_Macau| , an area south of Avenida Sun Yat Sen, and the north side of Taipa Island.
