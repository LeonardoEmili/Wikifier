                    The Moon is an  |astronomical_body|Astronomical_Object|  that  |orbits|Orbit|  the Earth as its only  |permanent|Claimed_Moons_Of_Earthtemporary_Satellites| |natural_satellite|Natural_Satellite| . It is  |the_fifth-largest|List_Of_Solar_System_Objects_By_Sizelist_Of_Objects_By_Radius|  satellite in the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| , and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the  |planet|Planet|  that it orbits . The Moon is, after  |Jupiters|Jupiter|  satellite  |Io|Io| , the second- |densest|Density|  satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.     The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago,  |not_long_after_Earth|Age_Of_The_Earth| . The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a  |giant_impact|Giant-Impact_Hypothesis|  between Earth and a  |Mars|Mars| -sized body called  |Theia|Theia| . New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.  Universe Today     The Moon is in  |synchronous_rotation|Tidal_Locking|  with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the  |near_side|Near_Side_Of_The_Moon| . The near side is marked by dark volcanic  |maria|Lunar_Mare|  that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent  |impact_craters|Impact_Crater| . After the  |Sun|Sun| , the Moon is the  |second-brightest_regularly_visible_celestial_object_in_Earths_sky|List_Of_Brightest_Natural_Objects_In_The_Sky| . Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the  |night_sky|Night_Sky|  it appears very bright, with a  |reflectance|Reflectance|  just slightly higher than that of worn  |asphalt|Asphalt_Concrete| . Its gravitational influence produces the  |ocean_tides|Tide| ,  |body_tides|Earth_Tide| , and the  |slight_lengthening|Tidal_Acceleration|  of the day.     The Moons average  |orbital_distance|Lunar_Distance|  is ,   or 1.28 light-seconds. This is about thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moons  |apparent_size|Angular_Diameter|  in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400 times the lunar distance and diameter. Therefore, the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely during a total  |solar_eclipse|Solar_Eclipse| . This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the  |far_future|Timeline_Of_The_Far_Future|  because the Moons distance from Earth is gradually increasing.     The Moon was first reached in September 1959 by the  |Soviet_Unions|Soviet_Union| |Luna_2|Luna_2| , an  |unmanned_spacecraft|Unmanned_Spacecraft| , followed by the first successful soft landing by  |Luna_9|Luna_9|  in 1966. The  |United_States|United_States|  NASA  |Apollo_program|Apollo_Program|  achieved the only manned lunar missions to date, beginning with the first manned orbital mission by  |Apollo_8|Apollo_8|  in 1968, and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being  |Apollo_11|Apollo_11|  in July 1969. These missions returned  |lunar_rocks|Moon_Rock|  which have been used to develop a  |geological_understanding|Geology_Of_The_Moon|  of the  |Moons_origin|Origin_Of_The_Moon| ,  |internal_structure|Internal_Structure_Of_The_Moon| , and the Moons later history. Since the 1972  |Apollo_17|Apollo_17|  mission the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.     Both the Moons natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of  |phases|Lunar_Phases|  as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial. Such cultural influences can be found in  |language|Moonname_And_Etymology| ,  |lunar_calendar|Lunar_Calendar|  systems,  |art|Moon_In_Fiction| , and  |mythology|Lunar_Deity| .                  The usual  |English|English_Language|  proper name for Earths natural satellite is the Moon , which in nonscientific texts is usually not capitalized.    Cambridge Learners Dictionary  The noun moon is derived from  |Old_English|Old_English|  mōna, which  stems from  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic|  mēnô, which comes from  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European|  mḗh₁n̥s moon , month , which comes from the Proto-Indo-European root meh₁- to measure , the month being the ancient unit of time measured by the Moon.  Occasionally, the name Luna is used. In literature, especially science fiction, Luna is used to distinguish it from other moons, while in poetry, the name has been used to denote personification of Earths moon.  Oxford English Dictionary ,  luna , Oxford University Press , 2009.     The modern English adjective pertaining to the Moon is lunar, derived from the Latin word for the Moon, luna. The adjective selenic  is so rarely used to refer to the Moon that this meaning is not recorded in most major dictionaries.    It is derived from the Ancient Greek word for the Moon,  , from which is however also derived the prefix seleno- , as in  selenography , the study of the physical features of the Moon, as well as the element name selenium. . Both the Greek goddess  |Selene|Selene|  and the Roman goddess  |Diana|Diana|  were alternatively called  |Cynthia|Cynthia| .  The names Luna, Cynthia, and Selene are reflected in terminology for  |lunar_orbits|Lunar_Orbit|  in words such as apolune, pericynthion, and selenocentric. The name Diana comes from the Proto-Indo-European diw-yo, heavenly , which comes from the PIE root dyeu- to shine, which in many derivatives means sky, heaven, and god and is also the origin of Latin dies, day .               The Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, some 60 million years after the origin of the Solar System. Several forming mechanisms have been proposed,  including the fission of the Moon from Earths crust through  |centrifugal_force|Centrifugal_Force|  , the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon , and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the  |primordial|Circumplanetary_Disk| |accretion_disk|Accretion_Disk|  . These hypotheses also cannot account for the high  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum|  of the Earth–Moon system.       The prevailing hypothesis is that the Earth–Moon system formed after an impact of a  |Mars|Mars| -sized body  with the  |proto-Earth|History_Of_The_Earth|  . The impact blasted material into Earths orbit and then the material accreted and formed the Moon.      The Moons far side has a crust that is  thicker than that of the near side. This is thought to be because the Moon fused from two different bodies.     This hypothesis, although not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Dont come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moons birth. At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most consensual theory. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three traditional theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward, there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.      Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.  However, more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.     Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and  |Vesta|4_Vesta|  have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten  |isotopic|Isotope|  compositions compared to Earth. However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.      The impact released a lot of energy and then the released material re-accreted into the Earth–Moon system. This would have melted the outer shell of Earth, and thus formed a magma ocean.  Similarly, the newly formed Moon would also have been affected and had its own  |lunar_magma_ocean|Lunar_Magma_Ocean| ; its depth is estimated from about  to .     While the giant impact hypothesis might explain many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moons composition.       In 2001, a team at the Carnegie Institute of Washington reported the most precise measurement of the  |isotopic_signatures|Isotopic_Signatures|  of lunar rocks.  To their surprise, the rocks from the  |Apollo_program|Apollo_Program|  had the same isotopic signature as rocks from Earth, however they differed from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Indeed, this observation was unexpected, because most of the material that formed the Moon was thought to come from  |Theia|Theia|  and it was announced in 2007 that there was less than a 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures.  Other Apollo lunar samples had in 2012 the same titanium isotopes composition as Earth, which  |conflicts|Giant_Impact_Hypothesisdifficulties|  with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth or is derived from Theia. These discrepancies may be explained by variations of the giant impact hypothesis.         The Moon is a very slightly  |scalene_ellipsoid|Scalene_Ellipsoid|  due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth . Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This fossil bulge indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit. Garrick-Bethell et al. The tidal-rotational shape of the Moon and evidence for polar wander , Nature 512, 181–184.               The Moon is a  |differentiated|Planetary_Differentiation|  body. It has a  |geochemically|Geochemistry|  distinct  |crust|Crust| ,  |mantle|Mantle| , and  |core|Planetary_Core| . The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as  and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly . Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about .   This structure is thought to have developed through the  |fractional_crystallization|Fractional_Crystallization|  of a global  |magma_ocean|Lunar_Magma_Ocean|  shortly after the Moons formation 4.5  billion years ago.      Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a  |mafic|Mafic|  mantle from the  |precipitation|Precipitation|  and sinking of the minerals  |olivine|Olivine| ,  |clinopyroxene|Clinopyroxene| , and  |orthopyroxene|Orthopyroxene| ; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density  |plagioclase|Plagioclase|  minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of  |incompatible|Compatibility|  and heat-producing elements.     Consistent with this perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests the crust of mostly  |anorthosite|Anorthosite| . The  |Moon_rock|Moon_Rock|  samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.   The crust is on average about  thick.     The Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after  |Io|Io| . However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about  or less, around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulphur and nickel; analyzes of the Moons time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.                           The  |topography_of_the_Moon|Topography_Of_The_Moon|  has been measured with  |laser_altimetry|Laser_Altimetry|  and  |stereo_image_analysis|Stereoscopy| .  Its most visible  |topographic_feature|List_Of_Features_On_The_Moon|  is the giant far-side  |South_Pole–Aitken_basin|South_Pole–Aitken_Basin| , some  in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact  |crater_in_the_Solar_System|List_Of_Largest_Craters_In_The_Solar_System| .  At  deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.  The highest elevations of the surface are located directly to the northeast, and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin.  Other large impact basins such as  |Imbrium|Mare_Imbrium| ,  |Serenitatis|Mare_Serenitatis| ,  |Crisium|Mare_Crisium| ,  |Smythii|Mare_Smythii| , and  |Orientale|Mare_Orientale|  also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims. The far side of the lunar surface is on average about  higher than that of the near side.     The discovery of  |fault_scarp|Fault_Scarp|  cliffs by the  |Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter|Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter|  suggest that the Moon has shrunk within the past billion years, by about 90 metres .  Similar shrinkage features exist on  |Mercury|Geology_Of_Mercury| . A recent study of over 12000 images from the orbiter has observed that Mare Frigoris near the north pole, a vast basin assumed to be geologically dead, has been cracking and shifting. Since the Moon doesnt have tectonic plates, its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat over the years.                The dark and relatively featureless lunar plains, clearly seen with the naked eye, are called  maria  , as they were once believed to be filled with water;  they are now known to be vast solidified pools of ancient  |basalt|Basalt| ic lava. Although similar to terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water.  The majority of these lavas erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with  |impact_basins|Impact_Crater| . Several  |geologic_provinces|Geologic_Province|  containing  |shield_volcano|Shield_Volcano| es and volcanic  |domes|Lunar_Dome|  are found within the near side maria .           Almost all maria are on the near side of the Moon, and cover 31% of the surface of the near side, compared with 2% of the far side.  This is thought to be due to a  |concentration_of_heat-producing_elements|Kreep|  under the crust on the near side, seen on geochemical maps obtained by  Lunar Prospector s gamma-ray spectrometer, which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up, partially melt, rise to the surface and erupt. Most of the Moons mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.0–3.5  billion years ago, although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as 4.2  billion years. Until recently, the youngest eruptions, dated by crater counting , appeared to have been only 1.2  billion years ago. In 2006, a study of Ina , a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis , found jagged, relatively dust-free features that, because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris, appeared to be only 2 million years old. Moonquake s and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity. In 2014 NASA announced widespread evidence of young lunar volcanism at 70 irregular mare patch es identified by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , some less than 50 million years old. This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed, at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements. Just prior to this, evidence has been presented for 2–10 million years younger basaltic volcanism inside Lowell crater, Orientale basin, located in the transition zone between the near and far sides of the Moon. An initially hotter mantle and/or local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities also on the far side in the Orientale basin.     The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called terrae, or more commonly highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4  billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean . In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events.     The concentration of maria on the Near Side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after their formation.         thu on the Moons far side     The other major geologic process that has affected the Moons surface is impact crater ing, with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface. There are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than on the Moons near side alone. The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events, including Nectaris , Imbrium , and Orientale , structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material, between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon . The lack of an atmosphere, weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved. Although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface. The radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1  billion years old: this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment of impacts.     Blanketed on top of the Moons crust is a highly comminuted and impact gardened surface layer called regolith , formed by impact processes. The finer regolith, the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass, has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder . The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces: it varies in thickness from in the highlands and in the maria.   Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith, a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick.     Comparison of high-resolution images obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimeters of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggested  – on a timescale of 81,000 years.     thu           Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moons surface. They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature , and have often a sinuous shape. Their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.           Liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind , leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon.       Computer simulations suggest that up to of the surface may be in permanent shadow. The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.     In years since, signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the  |Clementine|Clementine|  spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo , suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.     The 2008  |Chandrayaan-1|Chandrayaan-1|  spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice, using the on-board Moon Mineralogy Mapper . The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl , in reflected sunlight, providing evidence of large quantities of water ice, on the lunar surface. The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000   ppm . Using the mappers reflectance spectra, indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice within 20° latitude of both poles in 2018. In 2009,  |LCROSS|Lcross|  sent a impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater, and detected at least of water in a plume of ejected material. Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to .     In May 2011, 615–1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported, the famous high-titanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earths upper mantle . Although of considerable selenological interest, this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists  – the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.     Analysis of the findings of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper revealed in August 2018 for the first time definitive evidence for water-ice on the lunar surface. The data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice, as opposed to dust and other reflective substances. The ice deposits were found on the North and South poles, although it is more abundant in the South, where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices, allowing it to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun.         thum s gravity map of the Moon     The gravitational field of the Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons , large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins , partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins. The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.         The Moon has an external magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas , less than one-hundredth that of Earth . The Moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating. Theoretically, some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds. These clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.         thu .     The Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum , with a total mass of less than . The surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 × 10 −15   atm ; it varies with the lunar day. Its sources include outgassing and sputtering , a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions. Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium , produced by sputtering ; helium-4 and neon from the solar wind; and argon-40 , radon-222 , and polonium-210 , outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle. The absence of such neutral species as oxygen , nitrogen , carbon , hydrogen and magnesium , which are present in the regolith , is not understood. Water vapor has been detected by  |Chandrayaan-1|Chandrayaan-1|  and found to vary with latitude, with a maximum at ~60–70  degrees; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith. These gases either return into the regolith because of the Moons gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar winds magnetic field.         A permanent asymmetric Moon dust cloud exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets . Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moons surface every 24 hours. The particles striking the Moons surface eject Moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements were made by LADEE s Lunar Dust EXperiment , between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer Moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid , Quadrantid , Northern Taurid , and Omicron Centaurid meteor shower s, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near the boundary between the Moons dayside and nightside.       In October 2017, NASA scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston announced their finding, based on studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions, that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago. This atmosphere, sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions, was twice the thickness of that of present-day Mars . The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space.       The Moons axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5424°, much less than the 23.44° of Earth. Because of this, the Moons solar illumination varies much less with season, and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects. From images taken by  |Clementine|Clementine|  in 1994, it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of Peary Crater at the Moons north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day , creating peaks of eternal light . No such regions exist at the south pole. Similarly, there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters, and these craters of eternal darkness are extremely cold:  |Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter|Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter|  Orthostat 47 at Knowth , Ireland.     Understanding of the Moons cycles was an early development of astronomy: by the , Babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipse s,  and Indian astronomers had described the Moons monthly elongation. The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses.   Later, the physical form of the Moon and the cause of moonlight became understood. The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former. Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to  |qi|Qi| , their radiating influence theory also recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun, and Jing Fang noted the sphericity of the Moon. In the 2nd century AD, Lucian wrote the novel  |A_True_Story|True_History| , in which the heroes travel to the Moon and meet its inhabitants. In 499  AD, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his  |Aryabhatiya|Aryabhatiya|.
