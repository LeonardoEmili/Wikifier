              The Potsdam Agreement  was the August 1945 agreement between three of the  |Allies_of_World_War_II|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii| , the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , the  |United_States|United_States| , and the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . It concerned the military occupation and reconstruction of  |Germany|Allied-Occupied_Germany| , its  |borders|Former_Eastern_Territories_Of_Germany| , and the entire  |European_Theatre_of_War|European_Theatre_Of_World_War_Ii|  territory. It also addressed Germanys  |demilitarisation|Demilitarisation| ,  |reparations|German_Reparations_For_World_War_Ii|  and the prosecution of  |war_criminals|War_Criminal| .     Executed as a communiqué, the agreement was not a  |peace_treaty|Peace_Treaty|  according to  |international_law|International_Law| , although it created accomplished facts. It was superseded by the  |Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_with_Respect_to_Germany|Treaty_On_The_Final_Settlement_With_Respect_To_Germany|  signed on 12 September 1990.     As De Gaulle had not been invited to the Conference, the French resisted implementing the Potsdam Agreements within their occupation zone. In particular, the French refused to resettle any expelled Germans from the east. Moreover, the French did not accept any obligation to abide by the Potsdam Agreement in the proceedings of the Allied Control Council; in particular resisting all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole, and anything that they feared might lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government.        After the  |end_of_World_War_II_in_Europe|End_Of_World_War_Ii_In_Europe|  , and the decisions of the earlier  |Tehran|Tehran_Conference| ,  |Casablanca|Casablanca_Conference|  and  |Yalta_Conferences|Yalta_Conference| , the Allies by the  |Berlin_Declaration|Berlin_Declaration|  of June 5, 1945, had assumed supreme authority over Germany. In the Three Power Conference of Berlin  from 17 July to 2 August 1945, they agreed to and adopted the Protocol of the Proceedings, August 1, 1945, signed at  |Cecilienhof|Cecilienhof|  Castle in  |Potsdam|Potsdam| . The signatories were General Secretary  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin| , President  |Harry_S._Truman|Harry_S._Truman| , and Prime Minister  |Clement_Attlee|Clement_Attlee| , who, as a result of the  |British_general_election_of_1945|1945_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , had replaced  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  as the UKs representative. The three powers also agreed to invite  |France|France|  and  |China|Republic_Of_China|  to participate as members of the Council of Foreign Ministers established to oversee the agreement. The  |Provisional_Government_of_the_French_Republic|Provisional_Government_Of_The_French_Republic|  accepted the invitation on August 7, with the key reservation that it would not accept a priori any commitment to the eventual reconstitution of a central government in Germany.             In the Potsdam Agreement the Allies agree:    Establishment of a  |Council_of_Foreign_Ministers|Council_Of_Foreign_Ministers| , also including France and China; tasked the preparation of a peace settlement for Germany, to be accepted by the Government of Germany once a government adequate for the purpose had been established.   :See the London Conference of Foreign Ministers and the  |Moscow_Conference|Moscow_Conference|  which took place later in 1945.   The principles to govern the treatment of Germany in the initial control period.   :See  |European_Advisory_Commission|European_Advisory_Commission|  and  |Allied_Control_Council|Allied_Control_Council|    A. Political principles.   : Post-war Germany to be divided into four Occupation Zones under the control of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States and France; with the Commanders-in-chief of each countrys forces exercising sovereign authority over matters within their own zones, while exercising authority jointly through the Allied Control Council for Germany as a whole.   : |Democratization|Democratization| . Treatment of Germany as a single unit. Disarmament and  |Demilitarization|Demilitarization| . Elimination of all  |Nazi|Nazism|  influence.   B. Economic principles.   :Reduction or destruction of all civilian heavy-industry with war-potential, such as shipbuilding, machine production and chemical factories. Restructuring of German economy towards agriculture and light-industry.    |Reparations_from_Germany|German_Reparations_For_World_War_Ii| .   :This section covered reparation claims of the USSR from the  |Soviet_occupation_zone|Soviet_Occupation_Zone|  in Germany. The section also agreed that 10% of the industrial capacity of the western zones unnecessary for the German peace economy should be transferred to the Soviet Union within two years. The Soviet Union withdrew its previous objections to French membership of the Allied Reparations Commission, which had been established in Moscow following the Yalta conference.   Disposal of the  |German_Navy|Kriegsmarine|  and merchant marine.   :All but thirty submarines to be sunk and the rest of the German Navy was to be divided equally between the three powers.   :The German merchant marine was to be divided equally between the three powers, and they would distribute some of those ships to the other Allies. But until the end of the war with the  |Empire_of_Japan|Empire_Of_Japan|  all the ships would remain under the authority of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board and the United Maritime Authority.   City of  |Königsberg|Königsberg|  and the adjacent area .   :The United States and Britain declared that they would support the transfer of Königsberg and the adjacent area to the Soviet Union at the peace conference.   War criminals   : This was a short paragraph and covered the creation of the  |London_Charter|London_Charter|  and the subsequent  |Nuremberg_Trials|Nuremberg_Trials| |Moscow_Declaration|Moscow_Declaration|  of October 1943 have no particular geographical localization. The Three Governments reaffirm their intention to bring these criminals to swift and sure justice. They hope that the negotiations in London will result in speedy agreement being reached for this purpose, and they regard it as a matter of great importance that the trial of these major criminals should begin at the earliest possible date. The first list of defendants will be published before 1st September.    |Austria|Allied-Occupied_Austria| |Vienna|Vienna| , and that Austria should not pay any reparations.    |Poland|Peoples_Republic_Of_Poland|    :There should be a  |Provisional_Government_of_National_Unity|Provisional_Government_Of_National_Unity|  recognised by all three powers, and that those Poles who were serving in British Army formations should be free to return to Poland. The provisional western border should be the  |Oder–Neisse_line|Oder–Neisse_Line| , with territories to the east of this excluded from the Soviet Occupation zone and placed under Polish and Soviet civil administration. Poland would receive former German territories in the north and west, but the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement; which eventually took place as the  |Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_With_Respect_to_Germany|Treaty_On_The_Final_Settlement_With_Respect_To_Germany|  in 1990.   Conclusion on peace treaties and admission to the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  organization.   :See  |Moscow_Conference_of_Foreign_Ministers|Moscow_Conference_Of_Foreign_Ministers|  which took place later in 1945.   :It was noted that  |Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy|  had fought on the side of the Allies and was making good progress towards establishment of a democratic government and institutions and that after the peace treaty the three Allies would support an application from a democratic Italian government for membership of the United Nations. Further   : e three Governments have also charged the Council of Foreign Ministers with the task of preparing peace treaties for  |Bulgaria|Kingdom_Of_Bulgaria| ,  |Finland|Finland| ,  |Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  and  |Romania|Kingdom_Of_Romania| . The conclusion of Peace Treaties with recognized democratic governments in these States will also enable the three Governments to support applications from them for membership of the United Nations. The three Governments agree to examine each separately in the near future in the light of the conditions then prevailing, the establishment of diplomatic relations with Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary to the extent possible prior to the conclusion of peace treaties with those countries.   :The details were discussed later that year at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers and the treaties were signed in 1947 at the  |Paris_Peace_Conference|Paris_Peace_Conference|    :By that time the governments of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were Communist.   Territorial Trusteeship   :Italian former colonies would be decided in connection with the preparation of a peace treaty for Italy. Like most of the other former European Axis powers the Italian peace treaty was signed at the 1947 Paris Peace Conference.   Revised  |Allied_Control_Commission|Allied_Control_Commission|  procedure in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary   :Now that hostilities in Europe were at an end the Western Allies should have a greater input into the Control Commissions of Central and Eastern Europe, the Annex to this agreement included detailed changes to the workings of the  |Hungarian_Control_Commission|Allied_Commissionhungary| .   Orderly transfer of German Populations   :Main article  |Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans|    : The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland,  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.   : German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland refers to Germans living within the 1937 boundaries of Poland up to the  |Curzon_line|Curzon_Line|  going East. In theory, that German ethnic population could have been expelled to the Polish temporarily administered territories of  |Silesia|Silesia_Province| ,  |Farther_Pomerania|Farther_Pomerania| , East Prussia and eastern  |Brandenburg|Province_Of_Brandenburg| .   :Because the  |Allied_Occupation_Zones_in_Germany|Allied_Occupation_Zones_In_Germany|  were under great strain, the Czechoslovak government, the Polish provisional government and the control council in Hungary were asked to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out having regard to the present situation in Germany and suspend further expulsions until these estimates were integrated into plans for an equitable distribution of these removed Germans among the several zones of occupation.   Oil equipment in Romania    |Iran|Iran|    :Allied troops were to withdraw immediately from  |Tehran|Tehran|  and that further stages of the withdrawal of troops from Iran should be considered at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to be held in London in September 1945.   The international zone of  |Tangier|Tangier| .   :The city of Tangier and the area around it should remain international and discussed further.   The Black sea straits.   :The  |Montreux_Convention|Montreux_Convention|  should be revised and that this should be discussed with the Turkish government.   International inland waterways   European inland transport conference.   Directives to the military commanders on allied control council for Germany.   Use of Allied property for satellite reparations or war trophies   :These were detailed in Annex II   Military Talks   Annex I   Annex II     Moreover, towards concluding the  |Pacific_Theatre_of_War|Pacific_War| , the Potsdam Conference issued the  |Potsdam_Declaration|Potsdam_Declaration| , the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender wherein the Western Allies and the  |Nationalist_China|National_Government_Of_The_Republic_Of_China1927–49|  of General  |Chiang_Kai-shek|Chiang_Kai-Shek|  asked Japan to surrender or be destroyed.       Already during the Potsdam Conference, on 30 July 1945, the  |Allied_Control_Council|Allied_Control_Council|  was constituted in Berlin to execute the Allied resolutions :      |Denazification|Denazification|  of the German society to eradicate  |Nazi|Nazism|  influence    |Demilitarization|Demilitarization|  of the former  |Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht|  forces and the German  |arms_industry|Arms_Industry| ; however, the circumstances of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  soon led to Germanys  Wiederbewaffnung  including the re-establishment of both the  |Bundeswehr|Bundeswehr|  and the  |National_Peoples_Army|National_Peoples_Army| |Democratization|Democratization| , including the formation of  |political_parties|Political_Party|  and  |trade_unions|Trade_Union| ,  |freedom_of_speech|Freedom_Of_Speech| , of the  |press|Freedom_Of_The_Press|  and  |religion|Freedom_Of_Religion| |Decentralization|Decentralization|  resulting in  |German_federalism|Federalism_In_Germany| , along with disassemblement as part of the  |industrial_plans_for_Germany|Industrial_Plans_For_Germany| . Dismantling was stopped in  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  in 1951 according to the  |Truman_Doctrine|Truman_Doctrine| , whereafter  |East_Germany|East_Germany|  had to cope with the impact alone.       The northern half of the German province of  |East_Prussia|East_Prussia| , occupied by the  |Red_Army|Red_Army|  during its  |East_Prussian_Offensive|East_Prussian_Offensive|  followed by its  |evacuation|Evacuation_Of_East_Prussia|  in winter 1945, had already been incorporated into Soviet territory as the  |Kaliningrad_Oblast|Kaliningrad_Oblast| . The Western Allies promised to support the annexation of the territory north of the  |Braunsberg|Braniewo| – |Goldap|Gołdap|  line when a Final German Peace Treaty was held.     The Allies had acknowledged the legitimacy of the Polish  |Provisional_Government_of_National_Unity|Provisional_Government_Of_National_Unity| , which was about to form a Soviet  |satellite_state|Satellite_State| . Urged by Stalin, the UK and the US gave in to put the German territories east of the  |Oder–Neisse_line|Oder–Neisse_Line|  from the  |Baltic|Baltic_Sea|  coast west of  |Świnoujście|Świnoujście|  up to the  |Czechoslovak|Czechoslovakia|  border under Polish administration ; allegedly confusing the  |Lusatian_Neisse|Lusatian_Neisse|  and the  |Glatzer_Neisse|Nysa_Kłodzka|  rivers. The proposal of an Oder- |Bober|Bóbr| - |Queis|Kwisa|  line was rejected by the Soviet delegation. The cession included the former  |Free_City_of_Danzig|Free_City_Of_Danzig|  and the seaport of  |Stettin|Szczecin|  on the mouth of the  |Oder|Oder|  River , vital for the  |Upper_Silesian_Industrial_Region|Upper_Silesian_Industrial_Region| .     Post-war, Germany as a whole would consist solely of aggregate territories of the respective zones of occupation. As all former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were excluded from the Soviet Occupation Zone, they were consequently excluded from Germany as a whole.             In the course of the proceedings,  |Polish_communists|Polish_Communism|  had begun to suppress the German population west of the Bóbr river to underline their demand for a border on the Lusatian Neisse. The Allied resolution on the orderly transfer of German population became the legitimation of the expulsion of Germans from the nebulous parts of  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe| , if they had not already fled from the advancing Red Army.     The expulsion of ethnic Germans by the Poles concerned, in addition to Germans within areas behind the 1937 Polish border in the West , the territories placed under Polish administration pending a Final German Peace Treaty, i.e. southern East Prussia ,  |Farther_Pomerania|Farther_Pomerania| , the  |New_March|New_March|  region of the former  |Province_of_Brandenburg|Province_Of_Brandenburg| , the districts of the Grenzmark  |Posen-West_Prussia|Posen-West_Prussia| ,  |Lower_Silesia|Lower_Silesia|  and those parts of  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia|  that had remained with Germany after the 1921  |Upper_Silesia_plebiscite|Upper_Silesia_Plebiscite| . It further affected the German minority living within the territory of the former  |Second_Polish_Republic|Second_Polish_Republic|  in  |Greater_Poland|Greater_Poland| , eastern Upper Silesia,  |Chełmno_Land|Chełmno_Land|  and the  |Polish_Corridor|Polish_Corridor|  with Danzig.     The  |Germans_in_Czechoslovakia|Germans_In_Czechoslovakia|  , known as  |Sudeten_Germans|Sudeten_Germans|  but also  |Carpathian_Germans|Carpathian_Germans| , were expelled from the  Sudetenland  region where they formed a majority, from linguistic enclaves in central  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  and  |Moravia|Moravia| , as well as from the city of  |Prague|Prague| .     Though the Potsdam Agreement only refers to Poland, Czechoslovakia and  |Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| , expulsions also occurred in  |Romania|Kingdom_Of_Romania| , where the  |Transylvanian_Saxons|Transylvanian_Saxons|  were  |deported|Deportation_Of_Germans_From_Romania_After_World_War_Ii|  and their property disseized, and in  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| . In the Soviet territories, Germans not only were expelled from northern East Prussia  but also from the adjacent Lithuanian  |Klaipeda_Region|Klaipeda_Region|  and other lands settled by  |Baltic_Germans|Baltic_Germans|.
