Another point of contention for Christians concerning Judaism, which according to the modern KJV of the Protestant Bible, is attributed more to a religious bias, rather than an issue of race or being a Semite . Paul  clarifies this point in the letter to the Galatians where he makes plain his declaration ″28There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29And if ye be Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.″ Further Paul states: ″15Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a mans covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. 16Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.″ Many misled Christians read Matthew 23, John 8:44, Revelations 2:9, 3:9, and wrongly believe the term Jew is meaning a Hebrew or Semite...it does not, but rather to the religious belief of Judaism.

The most widely held explanation, believed by most Christians for early history, was that Jews had been the chosen people but broke the covenant with God, and were condemned to spend the rest of eternity suffering on earth, a symbol of degradation and sub-humanity. According to Jews, however, it is because Jesus failed to meet various messianic prophesies.

On April 26, 1933 Hitler declared during a meeting with Roman Catholic Bishop  of Osnabrück:     “I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.”       The transcript of the discussion contains no response by Bishop Berning.

This document states,   Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.   According to American historian Lucy Dawidowicz , antisemitism has a long history within Christianity.

Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luthers anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of Judenhass, which can be traced to Haman s advice to Ahasuerus . Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German nationalism and the liberal revolution of 1848, Christian antisemitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the Roman Catholic Church and upon which Luther built.

Bokenkotter, pp. 389–392, quote And when Hitler showed increasing belligerence toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical Mit brennender Sorge was the first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism and one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican. Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil and decried its neopaganism. The Nazis retaliated by closing and sealing all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of Catholic clergy.     In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God.

Bokenkotter, Thomas . A Concise History of the Catholic Church. Doubleday. pp. 480–481, quote: A recent article by American rabbi, David G. Dalin, challenges this judgment. He calls making Pius XII a target of moral outrage a failure of historical understanding, and he thinks Jews should reject any attempt to usurp the Holocaust for the partisan purposes at work in this debate. Dalin surmises that well-known Jews such as Albert Einstein, Golda Meir, Moshe Sharett, and Rabbi Isaac Herzog would likely have been shocked at these attacks on Pope Pius. ... Dalin points out that Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Israel, sent a message in February 1944 declaring the people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness ... doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history. Dalin cites these tributes as recognition of the work of the Holy See in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews. The Israeli historian Pinchas Lapide interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000  Jews from certain death at Nazi hands . Some historians dispute this estimate. Deák, István . Essays on Hitlers Europe.

The Christian Identity movement, the Ku Klux Klan and other White supremacist groups have expressed antisemitic views. They claim that their antisemitism is based on purported Jewish control of the media, international banks, radical left-wing politics , and the Jews promotion of multiculturalism , anti-Christian groups, liberalism and perverse organizations. They rebuke charges of racism by claiming that Jews who share their ideology maintain membership in their organizations. A racial belief which is common among these groups, but not universal among them, is an alternative history doctrine, which is sometimes called British Israelism . In some of its forms, this doctrine absolutely denies the view that modern Jews have any racial connection to the Israel of the Bible . Instead, according to extreme forms of this doctrine, the true racial Israelites and the true humans are the members of the Adamic race. These groups are often rejected and not even considered Christian groups by mainstream Christian denomination s and the vast majority of Christians around the world.

Antisemitism exists to a lesser or greater degree in many other nations as well, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and the increasingly frequent tensions between some Muslim immigrants and Jews across Europe. by Daniel Ben-Simon. Haaretz. 25/03/07 The US State Department reports that antisemitism has increased dramatically in Europe and Eurasia since 2000.     While in a decline since the 1940s, there is still a measurable amount of antisemitism in the United States of America as well, although acts of violence are rare. For example, the influential evangelical preacher Billy Graham and then-president Richard Nixon were captured on tape in the early 1970s discussing matters like how to address the Jews control of the American media . BBC , March 2, 2002. This belief in Jewish conspiracies and domination of the media was similar to those of Grahams former mentors: William Bell Riley chose Graham to succeed him as the second president of Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School and evangelist Mordecai Ham led the meetings where Graham first believed in Christ. Both held strongly antisemitic views. Himes, A The Sword of the Lord: The roots of fundamentalism in an American Family The 2001 survey by the Anti-Defamation League reported 1432 acts of antisemitism in the United States that year. The figure included 877 acts of harassment, including verbal intimidation, threats and physical assaults. A minority of American churches engage in anti-Israel activism, including support for the controversial BDS movement. While not directly indicative of anti-semitism, this activism often conflates the Israeli governments treatment of Palestinians with that of Jesus, thereby promoting the anti-semitic doctrine of Jewish guilt . http://ngo-monitor.org/data/images/File/NGOMIPMNJune2014.pdf Many Christian Zionists are also accused of anti-semitism, such as John Hagee , who argued that the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves by angering God.     Relations between Jews and Christians have improved dramatically since the 20th century. According to a global 2014 poll collecting data on 102 countries on their attitudes toward Jews by the Anti-Defamation League , a Jewish group devoted to fighting antisemitism and other forms of racism, only 24% of Christians worldwide held views considered to be antisemitic in their index, compared to nearly half of Muslims at 49%.         Many Christians do not consider anti-Judaism to be antisemitism . They regard anti-Judaism as a disagreement of religiously sincere people with the tenets of Judaism, while regarding antisemitism as an emotional bias or hatred not specifically targeting the religion of Judaism. Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as antisemitism as it only rejects the religious ideas of Judaism and does not involve actual hostility to the Jewish people.     Others see anti-Judaism as the rejection of or opposition to beliefs and practices essentially because": null
