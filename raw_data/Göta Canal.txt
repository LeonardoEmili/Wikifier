            The Göta Canal  is a  |Swedish|Sweden| |_canal|Canal|  constructed in the early 19th century. It formed the backbone of a waterway stretching some , linking a number of lakes and rivers to provide a route from  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg|  on the west coast to  |Söderköping|Söderköping|  on the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  via the river  |Göta_älv|Göta_Älv|  and the  |Trollhätte_kanal|Trollhätte_Canal| , through the large lakes  |Vänern|Vänern|  and  |Vättern|Vättern| .     The canal itself is  long, of which  were dug or blasted, with a width varying between  and a maximum depth of about .

Göta Canal is a sister canal of  |Caledonian_Canal|Caledonian_Canal|  in  |Scotland|Scotland| , which was also constructed by  |Thomas_Telford|Thomas_Telford| .          The idea of a canal across southern Sweden was first put forward as early as 1516, by  |Hans_Brask|Hans_Brask| , the bishop of  |Linköping|Linköping| . However, it was not until the start of the 19th century that Brasks proposals were put into action by  |Baltzar_von_Platen|Baltzar_Von_Platen| , a German-born former officer in the  |Swedish_Navy|Swedish_Navy| . He organised the project and obtained the necessary financial and political backing. His plans attracted the enthusiastic backing of the government and the new king,  |Charles_XIII|Charles_Xiii_Of_Sweden| , who saw the canal as a way of kick-starting the modernisation of Sweden. Litellus Russell Muirhead, Sweden, p. 105. Rand McNally, 1952. Von Platen himself extolled the modernising virtues of the canal in 1806, claiming that mining, agriculture and other industries would benefit from a navigation way through the country. Quoted in Lars Magnusson, An Economic History of Sweden, p. 115. Routledge, 2000.      The project was inaugurated on 11 April 1810 with a budget of 24 million  |Swedish_riksdalers|Swedish_Riksdaler| . R Nisbet Bain, Scandinavia: A Political History of Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 1513 to 1900, p. 432. University Press, Cambridge, 1905 It was by far the greatest civil engineering project ever undertaken in Sweden up to that time, taking 22 years of effort by more than 58,000 workers. Much of the expertise and equipment had to be acquired from abroad, notably from  |Britain|United_Kingdom| , whose  |canal_system|History_Of_The_British_Canal_System|  was the most advanced in the world at that time. The  |Scottish|Scotland| |_civil_engineer|Civil_Engineer| |_Thomas_Telford|Thomas_Telford|  developed the initial plans for the canal and travelled to Sweden in 1810 to oversee some of the early work on the route. Many other British engineers and craftsmen were imported to assist with the project, along with significant quantities of equipment - even apparently mundane items such as pickaxes, spades and wheelbarrows.     The Göta Canal was officially opened on 26 September 1832 in an event commemorated by the painter  |Johan_Christian_Berger|Johan_Christian_Berger|  in his work The Opening of the Göta Canal on 26 September 1832. Von Platen himself did not live to see the completion of the canal, having died shortly before its opening. However, it was never an economic success. The  |arrival_of_the_railways|Rail_Transport_In_Sweden|  in 1855 quickly made it redundant, as trains could carry passengers and goods far more rapidly and did not have to shut down with the arrival of winter, which made the canal impassable for five months of the year. Neil Kent, The Soul of the North: A Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940, p. 172. Reaktion Books, 2000.  By the 1870s, the canals goods traffic had dwindled to just three major types of bulk goods - forest products, coal and ore, none of which required rapid transportation. Traffic volumes stagnated after that and never recovered.        Bishop Hans Brasks original justifications for the canals construction were the onerous  |Sound_Dues|Sound_Dues|  imposed by  |Denmark–Norway|Denmark–Norway|  on all vessels passing through the narrow  |Øresund|Øresund|  channel between Sweden and Denmark and the trouble with the  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League| . The canal enabled vessels travelling to or from the Baltic Sea to bypass the Øresund and so evade the Danish toll. Gunnar Alexandersson, The Baltic Straits, p. 72. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1982.  In 1851, the tycoon  |André_Oscar_Wallenberg|Wallenberg_Family|  founded the Company for Swedish Canal Steamboat Transit Traffic to carry goods from England to Russia via the canal. However, it only ran two trips between  |St_Petersburg|St_Petersburg|  and  |Hull|Kingston_Upon_Hull|  via  |Motala|Motala|  before the  |Crimean_War|Crimean_War|  halted Anglo-Russian trade. After the war ended, the great powers pressured Denmark into ending the four-hundred-year-old tradition of the Sound Dues, thus eliminating at a stroke the canals usefulness as an alternative to the Øresund. Goran B. Nilsson, Founder: André Oscar Wallenberg , p. 231. Almqvist & Wiksell International, 2005.      The canal had one major industrial legacy in the shape of  |Motala_Verkstad|Motala_Verkstad|  - a factory established in Motala to produce the machines such as cranes and steam dredgers that were needed to build the canal. This facility has sometimes been referred to as the cradle of the Swedish engineering industry . After the canal was opened, Motala Verkstad focused on producing equipment, locomotives and rolling stock for the newly constructed railways, beginning a tradition of railway engineering that continues to this day in the form of  |AB_Svenska_Järnvägsverkstädernas_Aeroplanavdelning|Ab_Svenska_Järnvägsverkstädernas_Aeroplanavdelning|  that was bought by the aeroplane manufacturer  |SAAB|Saab_Ab|  in  |Linköping|Linköping| .  in  |Östgöta_Correspondenten|Östgöta_Correspondenten|          The Trollhätte Canal  is a canal in  |Sweden|Sweden|  that is now part of the Göta Canal. It connects the  |Göta_älv|Göta_Älv|  river with Lake  |Vänern|Vänern| .          Ships classified as Vänermax are of the maximum dimensions that will fit through the canal. The maximum dimensions for a boat to traverse this canal are:   Length: 88 m   Width: 13.20 m   Mast height: 27 m   Depth: 5.40 m   This allows ships of around 4000 tonnes in total. The allowed height allows ocean going ships. Around 3.5 million tonnes of goods is freighted annually on Trollhätte Canal.     Trollhätte Canal has six locks. They are from north to south:   Brinkebergskulle   Trollhättan övre   Trollhättan nedre, 3 locks   Lilla Edet       Parts of the canal are still used to transport cargo, but it is now primarily used as a tourist and recreational attraction, dubbed Sveriges blå band . Around two million people visit the canal each year on pleasure cruises - either on own boats or on one of the many cruise ships - and related activities. The canal is called the divorce ditch because of the troubles that couples have to endure while trying to navigate the narrow canal and the many locks by themselves.
