Nicaragua pursues an independent foreign policy. A participant of the Central American Security Commission , Nicaragua also has taken a leading role in pressing for regional demilitarization and peaceful settlement of disputes within states in the region.     Nicaragua has submitted three territorial disputes, one with  |Honduras|Honduras| , another with  |Colombia|Colombia| , and the third with  |Costa_Rica|Costa_Rica|  to the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice|  for resolution.       At the 1994  |Summit_of_the_Americas|Summit_Of_The_Americas| , Nicaragua joined six Central American neighbors in signing the  |Alliance_for_Sustainable_Development|Alliance_For_Sustainable_Development| , known as the Conjunta Centroamerica-USA or CONCAUSA, to promote sustainable economic development in the region.     Nicaragua belongs to the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  and several specialized and related agencies, including:    |World_Bank|World_Bank| |_International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund| |_World_Trade_Organization|World_Trade_Organization| |_UN_Educational_Scientific_and_Cultural_Organization|Un_Educational_Scientific_And_Cultural_Organization| |_World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization| |_Food_and_Agriculture_Organization|Food_And_Agriculture_Organization| |_International_Labour_Organization|International_Labour_Organization| |_UN_Human_Rights_Commission|Un_Human_Rights_Commission| |_Organization_of_American_States|Organization_Of_American_States| |_Non_Aligned_Movement|Non_Aligned_Movement|    International Atomic Energy Commission    |Inter_American_Development_Bank|Inter_American_Development_Bank| |_Central_American_Common_Market|Central_American_Common_Market| |_Central_American_Bank_for_Economic_Integration|Central_American_Bank_For_Economic_Integration|  .    |Bolivarian_Alliance_for_the_Americas|Bolivarian_Alliance_For_The_Americas| |_Caribbean_Community|Caribbean_Community| |_Association_of_Caribbean_States|Association_Of_Caribbean_States| |_Community_of_Latin_American_and_Caribbean_States|Community_Of_Latin_American_And_Caribbean_States| |_Latin_American_Economic_System|Latin_American_Economic_System| |_Central_American_Integration_System|Central_American_Integration_System| |_Colombia|Colombia|  over the  |Archipelago_de_San_Andres_y_Providencia|Archipelago_De_San_Andres_Y_Providencia|  and  |Quita_Sueno_Bank|Quita_Sueno_Bank|  with respect to the  |maritime_boundary|Maritime_Boundary|  question in the  |Golfo_de_Fonseca|Golfo_De_Fonseca| . The ICJ referred to the line determined by the 1900 Honduras-Nicaragua Mixed Boundary Commission and advised that some tripartite resolution among  |El_Salvador|El_Salvador| ,  |Honduras|Honduras|  and Nicaragua likely would be required;   Maritime boundary dispute with Honduras in the  |Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean_Sea| .   Nicaragua is  |sovereign|Sovereignty|  over the  |Rio_San_Juan|San_Juan_River| , and by treaty Costa Rica has the right to navigate over part of the river with objects of commerce. A dispute emerged when Costa Rica tried to navigate with armed members of its security forces.       Alleged trans-shipment point for  |cocaine|Cocaine|  destined for the US and trans-shipment point for arms-for-drugs dealing.         Nicaragua signed a 3-year  |Poverty_Reduction_and_Growth_Facility|Poverty_Reduction_And_Growth_Facility|  with the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  in October 2007. As part of the IMF program, the  |Government_of_Nicaragua|Government_Of_Nicaragua|  agreed to implement  |free_market|Free_Market|  policies linked to targets on fiscal discipline, poverty spending, and energy regulation. The lack of  |transparency|Transparency|  surrounding  |Venezuela|Venezuela| n bilateral assistance, channeled through state-run enterprises rather than the official budget, has become a serious issue for the IMF and international donors. On September 10, 2008, with misgivings about fiscal transparency, the IMF released an additional $30 million to Nicaragua, the second tranche of its $110 million PRGF.      The flawed municipal elections of November 2008 prompted a number of  |Europe|Europe| an donors to suspend direct budget support to Nicaragua, a move that created a severe budget shortfall for the government. This shortfall, in turn, caused the Government of Nicaragua to fall out of compliance with its PRGF obligations and led to a suspension of PRGF disbursements. The IMF is currently in negotiations with the Government of Nicaragua to reinstate disbursements.     Under current president  |Daniel_Ortega|Daniel_Ortega| , Nicaragua has stayed current with the  |Central_American_Dominican_Republic_Free_Trade_Agreement|Drcafta| , which entered into force for Nicaragua on April 1, 2006. Nicaraguan exports to the  |United_States|United_States| , which account for 59% of Nicaraguaâ€™s total exports, were $1.7 billion in 2008, up 45% from 2005.  |Textiles|Textiles|  and  |apparel|Apparel|  account for 55% of exports to the  |United_States|United_States| , while  |automobile|Automobile|  wiring harnesses add another 11%.     Other leading export products are  |coffee|Coffee| ,  |meat|Meat| ,  |cigars|Cigars| ,  |sugar|Sugar| ,  |ethanol|Ethanol| , and fresh  |fruit|Fruit|  and  |vegetables|Vegetables| , all of which have seen remarkable growth since  |CAFTA_DR|Cafta_Dr|  went into effect. Leading Nicaraguan exports also demonstrated increased diversity, with 274 new products shipped to the United States in the first year. U.S. exports to Nicaragua, meanwhile, were $1.1 billion in 2008, up 23% from 2005. Other important trading partners for Nicaragua are its Central American neighbors,  |Mexico|Mexico| , and the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Nicaragua is negotiating a trade agreement with the  |European_Union|European_Union|  as part of a Central American bloc.     Despite important protections for investment included in  |CAFTA_DR|Cafta_Dr| , the investment climate has become relatively insecure since Ortega took office. President Ortegas decision to support radical regimes such as  |Iran|Iran|  and  |Cuba|Cuba| , his harsh rhetoric against the  |United_States|United_States|  and  |capitalism|Capitalism| , and his use of government institutions to persecute political enemies and their businesses, has had a negative effect on perceptions of country risk, which by some accounts has quadrupled since he assumed office. The government reports foreign investment inflows totaled $506 million in 2008, including $123 million in telecommunications infrastructure and $120 million in energy generation.     There are over 100 companies operating in Nicaragua with some relation to a U.S. company, either as wholly or partly owned subsidiaries, franchisees, or exclusive distributors of U.S. products. The largest are in energy, financial services, textiles/apparel, manufacturing, and fisheries. However, many companies in the textile/apparel sector, including a $100 million U.S.-owned  |denim|Denim| |_mill|Factory| , have shuttered during the past 12 months due to falling demand for these goods in the United States.     Poor enforcement of  |property_rights|Property_Rights|  deters both foreign and domestic investment, especially in  |real_estate|Real_Estate|  development and  |tourism|Tourism| . Conflicting claims and weak enforcement of property rights has invited property disputes and litigation. Establishing verifiable title history is often entangled in legalities relating to the expropriation of 28,000 properties by the revolutionary government that Ortega led in the 1980s. The situation is not helped by a court system that is widely believed to be corrupt and subject to political influence.     Illegal property seizures by private parties, occasionally in collaboration with corrupt municipal officials, often go unchallenged by the authorities, especially in the Atlantic regions and interior regions of the north, where property rights are poorly defined and rule of law is weak. Foreign investor interest along the Pacific Coast has motivated some unscrupulous people to challenge ownership rights in the Departments of  |Rivas|Rivas_Department|  and  |Chinandega|Chinandega| , with the hope of achieving some sort of cash settlement.         |unt|Unt|   .
