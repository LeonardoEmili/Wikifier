      Radiocarbon dating  is a method for  |determining_the_age|Chronological_Dating|  of an object containing  |organic_material|Organic_Material|  by using the properties of  |radiocarbon|Carbon-14| , a radioactive  |isotope_of_carbon|Isotopes_Of_Carbon| .     The method was developed in the late 1940s at the  |University_of_Chicago|University_Of_Chicago|  by  |Willard_Libby|Willard_Libby| , who received the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  for his work in 1960. It is based on the fact that radiocarbon  is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of  |cosmic_rays|Cosmic_Ray|  with atmospheric  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| . The resulting  combines with atmospheric  |oxygen|Oxygen|  to form radioactive  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| , which is incorporated into plants by  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| ; animals then acquire  by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of  it contains begins to decrease as the  undergoes  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| . Measuring the amount of  in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less  there is to be detected, and because the  |half-life|Half-Life|  of  is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples.     Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of  in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, in the form of a calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the samples calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of  in different types of organisms , and the varying levels of  throughout the  |biosphere|Biosphere|  . Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to  |fossil_fuels|Fossil_Fuels|  is substantially longer than the time it takes for its  to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of  in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of  in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in about 1965 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.     Measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices, which counted the amount of  |beta_radiation|Beta_Radiation|  emitted by decaying  atoms in a sample. More recently,  |accelerator_mass_spectrometry|Accelerator_Mass_Spectrometry|  has become the method of choice; it counts all the  atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements; it can therefore be used with much smaller samples , and gives results much more quickly. The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on  |archaeology|Archaeology| . In addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods, it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances. Histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the radiocarbon revolution . Radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated, such as the end of the  |last_ice_age|Younger_Dryas| , and the beginning of the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  and  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  in different regions.           In 1939,  |Martin_Kamen|Martin_Kamen|  and  |Samuel_Ruben|Samuel_Ruben|  of the  |Radiation_Laboratory_at_Berkeley|Lawrence_Radiation_Laboratory|  began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized  using the laboratorys cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atoms  |half-life|Half-Life|  was far longer than had been previously thought. Taylor & Bar-Yosef , p. 268. This was followed by a prediction by  |Serge_A._Korff|Serge_A._Korff| , then employed at the  |Franklin_Institute|Franklin_Institute|  in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| , that the interaction of  |thermal_neutrons|W:Neutron_Temperature|  with  in the upper atmosphere would create . Taylor & Bar-Yosef , p. 269.  It had previously been thought that  would be more likely to be created by  |deuterons|Deuteron|  interacting with . At some time during World War II,  |Willard_Libby|Willard_Libby| , who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korffs research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.     In 1945, Libby moved to the  |University_of_Chicago|University_Of_Chicago|  where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include  as well as non-radioactive carbon. Bowman , pp.  9–15.  Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with  |methane|Methane|  collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after  |isotopically_enriching|Isotope_Enrichment|  their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained . By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in  Science  in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.      Libby and  |James_Arnold|James_R._Arnold|  proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings,  |Zoser|Zoser|  and  |Sneferu|Sneferu| , independently dated to 2625 BC plus or minus 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC plus or minus 250 years. These results were published in Science in 1949.  Aitken , pp.  60–61.  Within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide.  In 1960, Libby was awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  for this work.          In nature,  |carbon|Carbon|  exists as two stable, nonradioactive  |isotopes|Isotope| :  |carbon-12|Carbon-12|  , and  |carbon-13|Carbon-13|  , and a radioactive isotope,  |carbon-14|Carbon-14|  , also known as radiocarbon . The half-life of   is about 5,730 years, so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years, but  is constantly being produced in the lower  |stratosphere|Stratosphere|  and upper  |troposphere|Troposphere| , primarily by galactic  |cosmic_rays|Cosmic_Ray| , and to a lesser degree by solar cosmic rays.  These generate neutrons that in turn create  when they strike  |nitrogen-14|Nitrogen-14|   atoms. The following  |nuclear_reaction|Nuclear_Reaction|  is the main pathway by which  is created:   : n +  →  + p   where n represents a  |neutron|Neutron|  and p represents a  |proton|Proton| . Bianchi & Canuel , p.  35.      Once produced, the  quickly combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere to form first carbon monoxide ,  and ultimately carbon dioxide .   : +  →  + O     : + OH →  + H   Carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere, is dissolved in the ocean, and is taken up by plants via  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| . Animals eat the plants, and ultimately the radiocarbon is distributed throughout the  |biosphere|Biosphere| . The ratio of  to  is approximately 1.25 parts of  to 10 12 parts of . Tsipenyuk , p.  343. In addition, about 1% of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope .     The equation for the radioactive decay of  is:    :  →  +  +    By emitting a beta particle  and an  |electron_antineutrino|Antineutrino|  , one of the neutrons in the  nucleus changes to a proton and the  nucleus reverts to the stable isotope . Taylor & Bar-Yosef , p. 33.       During its life, a plant or animal is in equilibrium with its surroundings by exchanging carbon either with the atmosphere, or through its diet. It will therefore have the same proportion of  as the atmosphere, or in the case of marine animals or plants, with the ocean. Once it dies, it ceases to acquire , but the  within its biological material at that time will continue to decay, and so the ratio of  to  in its remains will gradually decrease. Because  decays at a known rate, the proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon  – the older the sample, the less  will be left.     The equation governing the decay of a radioactive isotope is:   : N N0e    where N 0 is the number of atoms of the isotope in the original sample , and N is the number of atoms left after time t. λ is a constant that depends on the particular isotope; for a given isotope it is equal to the reciprocal of the  |mean-life|Radioactive_Decaytime_Constant_And_Mean-Life|   – i.e. the average or expected time a given atom will survive before undergoing radioactive decay. The mean-life, denoted by τ, of  is 8,267 years, so the equation above can be rewritten as: Aitken , p. 59.   : t 8267         The sample is assumed to have originally had the same / ratio as the ratio in the atmosphere, and since the size of the sample is known, the total number of atoms in the sample can be calculated, yielding N 0 , the number of  atoms in the original sample. Measurement of N, the number of  atoms currently in the sample, allows the calculation of t, the age of the sample, using the equation above.     The half-life of a radioactive isotope is a more familiar concept than the mean-life, so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean-life, it is more usual to quote the value of s half-life than its mean-life. The currently accepted value for the half-life of  is 5,730 ± 40 years. This means that after 5,730 years, only half of the initial  will remain; a quarter will remain after 11,460 years; an eighth after 17,190 years; and so on.     The above calculations make several assumptions, such as that the level of  in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of  in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. Aitken , pp. 61–66. This is done by calibration curves , which convert a measurement of  in a sample into an estimated calendar age. The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the radiocarbon age , which is the age in radiocarbon years of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the atmospheric / ratio has not changed over time.     Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for . In Libbys 1949 paper he used a value of 5720 ± 47 years, based on research by Engelkemeir et al.  This was remarkably close to the modern value, but shortly afterwards the accepted value was revised to 5568 ± 30 years,  and this value was in use for more than a decade. It was revised again in the early 1960s to 5,730 ± 40 years,   which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect . For consistency with these early papers, it was agreed at the 1962 Radiocarbon Conference in Cambridge to use the “Libby half-life” of 5568 years. Radiocarbon ages are still calculated using this half-life, and are known as Conventional Radiocarbon Age . Since the calibration curve also reports past atmospheric  concentration using this conventional age, any conventional ages calibrated against the IntCal curve will produce a correct calibrated age. When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction has been applied for the historical variation of  in the atmosphere over time.
