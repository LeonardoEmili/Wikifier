           In the United States today, the organized  |environmental_movement|Environmental_Movement|  is represented by a wide range of organizations sometimes called  |non_governmental_organizations|Non_Governmental_Organization|  or NGOs. These organizations exist on local, national, and international scales. Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the amount they seek to influence the  |environmental_policy_of_the_United_States|Environmental_Policy_Of_The_United_States|  and other governments. The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns. Some resemble the old U.S. conservation movement - whose modern expression is The Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society and National Geographic Society - American organizations with a worldwide influence.       The early  |Conservation_movement|Conservation_Movement| , which began in the late 19th century, included fisheries and  |wildlife_management|Wildlife_Management| , water, soil conservation and  |sustainable_forestry|Sustainable_Forestry| . Today it includes sustainable yield of natural resources, preservation of wilderness areas and  |biodiversity|Biodiversity| .   The modern Environmental movement, which began in the 1960s with concern about air and water pollution, became broader in scope to including all landscapes and human activities. See  |List_of_environmental_issues|List_Of_Environmental_Issues| .   Environmental health movement dating at least to  |Progressive_Era|Progressive_Era|  urban reforms including clean water supply, more efficient removal of raw sewage and reduction in crowded and unsanitary living conditions. Today Environmental health is more related to nutrition, preventive medicine, aging well and other concerns specific to the human bodys well-being.    |Sustainability_movement|Sustainable_Living|  which started in the 1980s focused on  |Gaia_theory|Gaia_Theory| ,  |value_of_Earth|Value_Of_Earth|  and other interrelations between human sciences and human responsibilities. Its spinoff  |deep_ecology|Deep_Ecology|  was more spiritual but often claimed to be science.    |Environmental_justice|Environmental_Justice|  is a movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to  |environmental_racism|Environmental_Racism| . Often, low-income and minority communities are located close to highways, garbage dumps, and factories, where they are exposed to greater pollution and environmental health risk than the rest of the population. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link social and ecological environmental concerns, while at the same time keeping environmentalists conscious of the dynamics in their own movement, i.e. racism, sexism, homophobia, classicism, and other malaises of dominant culture.     As public awareness and the environmental sciences have improved in recent years, environmental issues have broadened to include key concepts such as  |sustainability|Sustainability|  and also new emerging concerns such as  |ozone_depletion|Ozone_Depletion| ,  |global_warming|Global_Warming| ,  |acid_rain|Acid_Rain| ,  |land_use|Land_Use|  and biogenetic pollution.     Environmental movements often interact or are linked with other social movements, e.g. for peace, human rights, and  |animal_rights|Animal_Rights| ; and  |against_nuclear_weapons_and_or_nuclear_power|Anti_Nuclear_Movement_In_The_United_States| , endemic diseases, poverty, hunger, etc.     Some US colleges are now going green by signing the Presidents Climate Commitment, a document that a college President can sign to enable said colleges to practice environmentalism by switching to solar power, etc.             Early European settlers came to the United States brought from Europe the concept of the  |commons|Commons| . In the colonial era, access to natural resources was allocated by individual towns, and disputes over fisheries or land use were resolved at the local level. Changing technologies, however, strained traditional ways of resolving disputes of resource use, and local governments had limited control over powerful special interests. For example, the damming of rivers for mills cut off upriver towns from fisheries; logging and clearing of forest in watersheds harmed local fisheries downstream. In New England, many farmers became uneasy as they noticed clearing of forest changed stream flows and a decrease in bird population which helped control insects and other pests. These concerns become widely known with the publication of  |Man_and_Nature|Man_And_Nature|  by  |George_Perkins_Marsh|George_Perkins_Marsh| . The environmental impact method of analysis is generally the main mode for determining what issues the environmental movement is involved in. This model is used to determine how to proceed in situations that are detrimental to the environment by choosing the way that is least damaging and has the fewest lasting implications.        Conservation first became a national issue during the  |progressive_eras|Progressive_Era| |_conservation_movement|Conservation_Movement|  . The early national conservation movement shifted emphasis to scientific management which favored larger enterprises and control began to shift from local governments to the states and the federal government. Some writers credit sportsmen, hunters and fishermen with the increasing influence of the conservation movement. In the 1870s sportsman magazines such as American Sportsmen, Forest and Stream, and  |Field_and_Stream|Field_And_Stream|  are seen as leading to the growth of the conservation movement. This conservation movement also urged the establishment of state and national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and national monuments intended to preserve noteworthy natural features.   Conservation groups focus primarily on an issue thats origins are routed in general expansion. As  |Industrialization|Industrialization|  became more prominent as well as the increasing trend towards  |Urbanization|Urbanization|  the conservative environmental movement began. Contrary to popular belief conservation groups are not against expansion in general, instead they are concerned with efficiency with resources and land development.           |Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt|  and his close ally  |George_Bird_Grinnell|George_Bird_Grinnell| , were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market hunting. This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government. The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the  |Boone_and_Crockett_Club|Boone_And_Crockett_Club|  in 1887. The Club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The  |Boone_and_Crockett_Clubs|Boone_And_Crockett_Club|  contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelts closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America.  As president,  |Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt|  became a prominent  |conservationist|Conservation_Movement| , putting the issue high on the national agenda. Douglas Brinkley, The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America ch 15-26 He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter,  |Gifford_Pinchot|Gifford_Pinchot| . Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nations first  |conservation|Conservation_Biology|  President. He encouraged the  |Newlands_Reclamation_Act|Newlands_Reclamation_Act|  of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land for  |national_parks|National_Park|  and  |nature_preserves|Nature_Preserve|  than all of his predecessors combined. W. Todd Benson, President Theodore Roosevelts Conservations Legacy     Roosevelt established the  |United_States_Forest_Service|United_States_Forest_Service| , signed into law the creation of five  |National_Parks|National_Parks| , and signed the 1906  |Antiquities_Act|Antiquities_Act| , under which he proclaimed 18 new  |U_S_National_Monuments|U_S_National_Monument| . He also established the first 51  |Bird_Reserves|Bird_Reserve| , four  |Game_Preserves|Game_Preserve| , and 150  |National_Forests|United_States_National_Forest| , including  |Shoshone_National_Forest|Shoshone_National_Forest| , the nations first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately .      |Gifford_Pinchot|Gifford_Pinchot|  had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves. Pinchot promoted private use under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated 16 million acres of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.     In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the  |Conference_of_Governors|Conference_Of_Governors|  held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: Conservation as a National Duty.     In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with  |John_Muir|John_Muir| , who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests. Working through the  |Sierra_Club|Sierra_Club|  he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the  |Mariposa_Grove|Mariposa_Grove|  and Yosemite Valley to the  |National_Park_Service|National_Park_Service| . While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchots formulation, to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees. Gifford Pinchot, Breaking New Ground, p. 32. Muir and the Sierra Club vehemently opposed the damming of the  |Hetch_Hetchy_Valley|Hetch_Hetchy_Valley|  in Yosemite in order to provide water to the city of San Francisco. Roosevelt and Pinchot supported the dam, as did President  |Woodrow_Wilson|Woodrow_Wilson| . The  |Hetch_Hetchy|Hetch_Hetchy|  dam was finished in 1923 and is still in operation, but the Sierra Club still wants to tear it down. Robert W. Righter, The Battle over Hetch Hetchy: Americas Most Controversial Dam and the Birth of Modern Environmentalism     Other influential conservationists of the  |Progressive_Era|Progressive_Era|  included  |George_Bird_Grinnell|George_Bird_Grinnell|  , the  |Izaak_Walton_League|Izaak_Walton_League|  and  |John_Muir|John_Muir| , the founder of the  |Sierra_Club|Sierra_Club|  in 1892. Conservationists organized the  |National_Parks_Conservation_Association|National_Parks_Conservation_Association| , the  |Audubon_Society|Audubon_Society| , and other groups that still remain active.        |Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt|Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt|  , like his cousin Theodore Roosevelt, was an ardent conservationist. He used numerous programs of the departments of Agriculture and Interior T.H. Watkins, Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952 to end wasteful land-use, mitigate the effects of the  |Dust_Bowl|Dust_Bowl| , and efficiently develop natural resources in the West. David B. Woolner and Henry L. Henderson, eds. FDR and the Environment One of the most popular of all  |New_Deal|New_Deal|  programs was the  |Civilian_Conservation_Corps|Civilian_Conservation_Corps|  , which sent two million poor young men to work in rural and wilderness areas, primarily on conservation projects. Neil M. Maher, Natures New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement       After World War II increasing encroachment on wilderness land evoked the continued resistance of conservationists, who succeeded in blocking a number of projects in the 1950s and 1960s, including the proposed  |Bridge_Canyon_Dam|Bridge_Canyon_Dam|  that would have backed up the waters of the Colorado River into the  |Grand_Canyon_National_Park|Grand_Canyon_National_Park| .     The Inter-American Conference on the Conservation of Renewable Natural Resources met in 1948 as a collection of nearly 200 scientists from all over the Americans forming the trusteeship principle that:     No generation can exclusively own the renewable resources by which it lives. We hold the commonwealth in trust for prosperity, and to lessen or destroy it is to commit treason against the future New York Times, September 18, 1948 in Fairchild, W.B. Renewable Resources: A World Dilemma: Recent Publications on Conservation , Geographical Review 39 pp. 86 - 98            During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, several events occurred which raised the public awareness of harm to the environment caused by man. In 1954, the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel  Lucky Dragon  was exposed to radioactive fallout from a hydrogen bomb test at  |Bikini_Atoll|Bikini_Atoll| , in 1969, an ecologically  |catastrophic_oil_spill|1969_Santa_Barbara_Oil_Spill|  from an offshore well in Californias Santa Barbara Channel, Barry Commoners protest against nuclear testing,  |Rachel_Carsons|Rachel_Carson|  book  |Silent_Spring|Silent_Spring| ,  |Paul_R_Ehrlichs|Paul_R_Ehrlich| |_The_Population_Bomb|The_Population_Bomb|  all added anxiety about the environment. Pictures of Earth from space emphasized that the earth was small and fragile.      As the public became more aware of environmental issues, concern about  |air_pollution|Air_Pollution_In_The_United_States| ,  |water_pollution|Water_Pollution_In_The_United_States| , solid waste disposal, dwindling energy resources, radiation,  |pesticide_poisoning|Pesticide_Poisoning|  , noise pollution, and other environmental problems engaged a broadening number of sympathizers. That public support for environmental concerns was widespread became clear in the  |Earth_Day|Earth_Day|  demonstrations of 1970.           In the modern wilderness preservation movement, important philosophical roles are played by the writings of  |John_Muir|John_Muir|  who had been activist in the late 19th and early 20th century. Along with Muir perhaps most influential in the modern movement is  |Henry_David_Thoreau|Henry_David_Thoreau|  who published  |Walden|Walden|  in 1854. Also important was  |forester|Forester|  and  |ecologist|Ecologist| |_Aldo_Leopold|Aldo_Leopold| , one of the founders of the Wilderness Society in 1935, who wrote a classic of nature observation and ethical philosophy,  A Sand County Almanac ,  |published_in_1949|1949_In_Literature| . Other philosophical foundations were established by  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|  and  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| .     There is also a growing movement of campers and other people who enjoy outdoor recreation activities to help preserve the environment while spending time in the wilderness.           The anti-nuclear movement in the United States consists of more than 80  |anti_nuclear|Anti_Nuclear|  groups that have acted to oppose  |nuclear_power|Nuclear_Power|  or  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapons| , or both, in the United States. These groups include the  |Abalone_Alliance|Abalone_Alliance| ,  |Clamshell_Alliance|Clamshell_Alliance| ,  |Institute_for_Energy_and_Environmental_Research|Institute_For_Energy_And_Environmental_Research| ,  |Nuclear_Information_and_Resource_Service|Nuclear_Information_And_Resource_Service| , and  |Physicians_for_Social_Responsibility|Physicians_For_Social_Responsibility| . The anti-nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants, and has pressured the  |Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission|Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission|  to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants.

Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety .      Some scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power, including:  |Barry_Commoner|Barry_Commoner| ,  |S_David_Freeman|S_David_Freeman| ,  |John_Gofman|John_Gofman| ,  |Arnold_Gundersen|Arnold_Gundersen| ,  |Mark_Z_Jacobson|Mark_Z_Jacobson| ,  |Amory_Lovins|Amory_Lovins| ,  |Arjun_Makhijani|Arjun_Makhijani| ,  |Gregory_Minor|Gregory_Minor| ,  |Joseph_Romm|Joseph_Romm|  and  |Benjamin_K_Sovacool|Benjamin_K_Sovacool| . Scientists who have opposed nuclear weapons include  |Linus_Pauling|Linus_Pauling|  and  |Eugene_Rabinowitch|Eugene_Rabinowitch| .              Antitoxics groups are a subgroup that is affiliated with the Environmental Movement in the United States, that is primarily concerned with the effects that cities and their by products have on humans. This aspect of the movement is a self-proclaimed movement of housewives . Concern around the issues of ground water contamination and air pollution rose in the early 1980s and individuals involved in antitoxics groups claim that they are concerned for the health of their families.   A prominent case can be seen in the Love Canal Homeowners association ; in this case a housing development was built on a site that had been used for toxic dumping by the Hooker Chemical Company. As a result of this dumping the residents had symptoms of skin irritation,  |Lois_Gibbs|Lois_Gibbs| , a resident of the development, started a grassroots campaign for reparations. Eventual success led to the government having to purchase homes that were sold in the development.       Prior to the 1970s the protection of basic air and water supplies was a matter mainly left to each state. During the 1970s, primary responsibility for clean air and water shifted to the federal government. Growing concerns, both environmental and economic, from cities and towns as well as sportsman and other local groups, and senators such as Maines  |Edmund_S_Muskie|Edmund_S_Muskie| , led to passage of extensive legislation, notably the  |Clean_Air_Act|Clean_Air_Act|  of 1970 and the  |Water_Pollution_Control_Act|Water_Pollution_Control_Act|  Amendments of 1972. Other legislation included the 1970  |National_Environmental_Policy_Act|National_Environmental_Policy_Act|  , which established the  |Council_on_Environmental_Quality|Council_On_Environmental_Quality| ; the  |Marine_Protection_Research_and_Sanctuaries_Act_of_1972|Marine_Protection_Research_And_Sanctuaries_Act_Of_1972| ; the  |Endangered_Species_Act|Endangered_Species_Act|  of 1973, the  |Safe_Drinking_Water_Act|Safe_Drinking_Water_Act|  , the  |Resource_Conservation_and_Recovery_Act|Resource_Conservation_And_Recovery_Act|  , the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977, which became known as the  |Clean_Water_Act|Clean_Water_Act| , and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as the  |Superfund_Act|Superfund|  . These laws regulated public drinking water systems, toxic substances, pesticides, and ocean dumping; and protected wildlife, wilderness, and wild and scenic rivers. Moreover, the new laws provide for pollution research, standard setting, contaminated site cleanup, monitoring, and enforcement.     The creation of these laws led to a major shift in the environmental movement. Groups such as the Sierra Club shifted focus from local issues to becoming a lobby in Washington and new groups, for example, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense, arose to influence politics as well.        In the 1980s President  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  sought to curtail scope of environmental protection taking steps such as appointing  |James_G_Watt|James_G_Watt|  who was called one of the most blatantly anti-environmental political appointees . The major environmental groups responded with mass mailings which led to increased membership and donations. The large environmental organization increasingly relied on ties within Washington, D.C. to advance their environmental agenda. At the same time membership in environmental groups became more suburban and urban. Groups such as animal rights, and the gun control lobby became linked with environmentalism while sportsmen, farmers and ranchers were no longer influential in the movement.     When industry groups lobbied to weaken regulation and a backlash against environmental regulations, the so-called  |wise_use_movement|Wise_Use_Movement|  gained importance and influence. The wise use movement and  |anti_environmental|Anti_Environmentalism|  groups were able to portray environmentalist as out of touch with mainstream values.        In 2004, with the environmental movement seemingly stalled, some environmentalists started questioning whether environmentalism was even a useful political framework. According to a controversial essay titled   American environmentalism has been remarkably successful in protecting the air, water, and large stretches of wilderness in  |North_America|North_America|  and Europe, but these environmentalists have stagnated as a vital force for cultural and political change.     Shellenberger and Nordhaus wrote, Today environmentalism is just another special interest. Evidence for this can be found in its concepts, its proposals, and its reasoning. What stands out is how arbitrary environmental leaders are about what gets counted and what doesnt as environmental. Most of the movements leading thinkers, funders, and advocates do not question their most basic assumptions about who we are, what we stand for, and what it is that we should be doing. Their essay was followed by a speech in San Francisco called Is Environmentalism Dead? by former Sierra Club President,  |Adam_Werbach|Adam_Werbach| , who argued for the evolution of environmentalism into a more expansive, relevant and powerful progressive politics. Werbach endorsed building an environmental movement that is more relevant to average Americans, and controversially chose to lead Wal-Marts effort to take sustainability mainstream.     These post-environmental movement thinkers argue that the ecological crises the human species faces in the 21st century are qualitatively different from the problems the environmental movement was created to address in the 1960s and 1970s. They argue that climate change and  |habitat_destruction|Habitat_Destruction|  are global and more complex, therefore demanding far deeper transformations of the economy, the culture and political life. The consequence of environmentalisms outdated and arbitrary definition, they argue, is political irrelevancy.     These politically neutral groups tend to avoid global conflicts and view the settlement of inter-human conflict as separate from regard for nature – in direct contradiction to the ecology movement and peace movement which have increasingly close links: while Green Parties,  |Greenpeace|Greenpeace| , and groups like the ACTivist Magazine regard ecology, biodiversity, and an end to non-human extinction as an absolute basis for peace, the local groups may not, and see a high degree of global competition and conflict as justifiable if it lets them preserve their own local uniqueness. However, such groups tend not to burn out and to sustain for long periods, even generations, protecting the same local treasures.     Local groups increasingly find that they benefit from collaboration, e.g. on consensus decision making methods, or making  |simultaneous_policy|Simultaneous_Policy| , or relying on common legal resources, or even sometimes a common glossary. However, the differences between the various groups that make up the modern environmental movement tend to outweigh such similarities, and they rarely co-operate directly except on a few major global questions. In a notable exception, over 1,000 local groups from around the country united for a single day of action as part of the  |Step_It_Up_2007|Step_It_Up_2007|  campaign for real solutions to global warming.     Groups such as The Bioregional Revolution are calling on the need to bridge these differences, as the converging problems of the 21st century they claim compel the people to unite and to take decisive action. They promote  |bioregionalism|Bioregionalism| ,  |permaculture|Permaculture| , and local economies as solutions to these problems,  |overpopulation|Human_Overpopulation| ,  |global_warming|Global_Warming| ,  |global_epidemics|Epidemics| , and  |water_scarcity|Water_Scarcity| , but most notably to  |peak_oil|Peak_Oil|  – the prediction that the country is likely to reach a maximum in global oil production which could spell drastic changes in many aspects of the residents everyday lives.       Many environmental lawsuits turn on the question of who has standing; are the legal issues limited to property owners, or does the general public have a right to intervene? Christopher D. Stones 1972 essay, Should trees have standing? seriously addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have  |legal_rights|Legal_Rights| , including the right to participate in lawsuits. Stone suggested that there was nothing absurd in this view, and noted that many entities now regarded as having legal rights were, in the past, regarded as things that were regarded as legally rightless; for example, aliens, children and women. His essay is sometimes regarded as an example of the  |fallacy_of_hypostatization|Reification| .     One of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and aesthetic harms was Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain in New York State. See also  |United_States_environmental_law|United_States_Environmental_Law|  and  |David_Sive|David_Sive| , an attorney who was involved in the case.           |Conservation_biology|Conservation_Biology|  is an important and rapidly developing field.     One way to avoid the stigma of an ism was to evolve early anti-nuclear groups into the more scientific Green Parties, sprout new NGOs such as Greenpeace and Earth Action, and devoted groups to protecting global biodiversity and preventing global warming and climate change. But in the process, much of the emotional appeal, and many of the original aesthetic goals were lost. Nonetheless, these groups have well-defined ethical and political views, backed by science.      |skeptical_of_the_environmental_movement|Environmental_Skepticism|  and feel that it is more deeply rooted in politics than science. Although there have been serious  |debates_about_climate_change|Global_Warming_Controversy|  and effects of some  |pesticides_and_herbicides_that_mimic_animal_sex_steroids|Endocrine_Disruptors| , science has shown that some of the claims of environmentalists have credence.     Claims made by environmentalists may be perceived as veiled attacks on industry and globalization rather than legitimate environmental concerns. Detractors note that a significant number of environmental theories and predictions have been inaccurate and suggest that the regulations recommended by environmentalists will more likely harm society rather than help nature.          Specific examples include when  |Rachel_Carson|Rachel_Carson| , in her book Silent Spring, suggested that the pesticide  |DDT|Ddt|  caused cancer and drastically harmed ecosystems. DDT is highly toxic to aquatic life, including crawfish, daphnids, sea shrimp and many species of fish. However,  |DDT_is_also_used_to_control_malaria|Ddtuse_Against_Malaria| .     Prominent novelist and Harvard Medical School graduate  |Michael_Crichton|Michael_Crichton|  appeared before the U.S.  |Senate_Committee_on_Environment_and_Public_Works|Senate_Committee_On_Environment_And_Public_Works|  to address such concerns and recommended the employment of  |double_blind_experiment|Double_Blind_Experiment| ation in environmental research. Crichton suggested that because environmental issues are so political in nature, policy makers need neutral, conclusive data to base their decisions on, rather than conjecture and rhetoric, and double-blind experiments are the most efficient way to achieve that aim.     A consistent theme acknowledged by both supporters and critics of the environmental movement is that we know very little about the Earth we live in. Most fields of environmental studies are relatively new, and therefore what research we have is limited and does not date far enough back for us to completely understand long-term environmental trends. This has led a number of environmentalists to support the use of the  |precautionary_principle|Precautionary_Principle|  in policy making, which ultimately asserts that we dont know how certain actions may affect the environment, and because there is reason to believe they may cause more harm than good we should refrain from such actions.          In the December 1994 Wild Forest Review, Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair wrote The mainstream environmental movement was elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to the working class, and a firm ally of big government.…The environmental movement is now accurately perceived as just another well-financed and cynical special interest group, its rancid infrastructure supported by Democratic Party operatives and millions in grants from corporate foundations.          Historian and President of the American Historical Association  |William_Cronon|William_Cronon|  has criticized the modern environmental movement for having a romantic idealizations of  |wilderness|Wilderness| . Cronon writes wilderness serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi-religious values of modern environmentalism rest. Cronon claims that to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness, to just that extent we give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead.     Similarly  |Michael_Pollan|Michael_Pollan|  has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book Second Nature, Pollan writes that once a landscape is no longer virgin it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable.       Within the environmental movement an ideological debate has taken place between those with an  |ecocentric|Ecocentric|  view point and an  |anthropocentric|Anthropocentric|  view point. The anthropocentric view has been seen as the conservationist approach to the environment with nature viewed, at least in part, as resource to be used by man. In contrast to the conservationist approach the ecocentric view, associated with  |John_Muir|John_Muir| ,  |Henry_David_Thoreau|Henry_David_Thoreau|  and  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  referred to as the preservationist movement. This approach sees nature in a more spiritual way. Many environmental historians consider the split between John Muir and  |Gifford_Pinchot|Gifford_Pinchot| . During the preservation / conservation debate the term preservationist become to be seen as a pejorative term.     While the ecocentric view focused on biodiversity and wilderness protection the anthropocentric view focus on urban pollution and social justice. Some environmental writers, for example  |William_Cronon|William_Cronon|  have criticized the ecocentric view as have a dualist view as man being separate from nature. Critics of the anthropocentric view point contend that the environmental movement has been taken over by so-called  |leftist|Leftist|  with an agenda beyond environmental protection.     Several books after the middle of the 20th century contributed to the rise of American environmentalism , especially among college and university students and the more literate public. One was the publication of the first textbook on  |ecology|Ecology| ,  Fundamentals of Ecology , by  |Eugene_Odum|Eugene_Odum|  and  |Howard_Odum|Howard_T_Odum| , in 1953. Another was the appearance of the best-seller  Silent Spring  by  |Rachel_Carson|Rachel_Carson| , in 1962. Her book brought about a whole new interpretation on pesticides by exposing their harmful effects in nature. From this book many began referring to Carson as the mother of the environmental movement . Another influential development was a 1965 lawsuit, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, opposing the construction of a power plant on  |Storm_King_Mountain|Storm_King_Mountain| , which is said to have given birth to modern  |United_States_environmental_law|United_States_Environmental_Law| . The wide popularity of The Whole Earth Catalog s, starting in 1968, was quite influential among the younger, hands-on, activist generation of the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, in addition to opposing environmental degradation and protecting wilderness, an increased focus on coexisting with natural biodiversity has appeared, a strain that is apparent in the movement for  |sustainable_agriculture|Sustainable_Agriculture|  and in the concept of  |Reconciliation_Ecology|Reconciliation_Ecology| .               Environmentalists became much more influential in American politics after the creation or strengthening of numerous US environmental laws, including the  |Clean_Air_Act|Clean_Air_Act|  and  |Clean_Water_Act|Clean_Water_Act|  and the formation of the  |United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|  in 1970. These successes were followed by the enactment of a whole series of laws regulating  |waste|Waste|  ,  |toxic_substances|Toxin|  ,  |pesticides|Pesticides|  , clean-up of polluted sites , protection of  |endangered_species|Endangered_Species|  , and more.     Fewer environmental laws have been passed in the last decade as corporations and other  |conservative|American_Conservatism|  interests have increased their influence over  |American_politics|Politics_Of_The_United_States| . Corporate cooperation against environmental lobbyists has been organized by the  |Wise_Use|Wise_Use|  group. At the same time, many environmentalists have been turning toward other means of persuasion, such as working with business, community, and other partners to promote  |sustainable_development|Sustainable_Development| .     Much environmental activism is directed towards  |conservation|Conservation_Movement|  Perez, Alejandro Colsa, Bernadette Grafton, Paul Mohai, Rebecca Hardin, Katy Hintzen, and Sara Orvis. Evolution of the environmental justice movement: activism, formalization and differentiation. Environmental Research Letters 10, no. 10 : 105002. as well as the prevention or elimination of pollution. However,  |conservation_movements|Conservation_Movement| ,  |ecology_movements|Ecology_Movement| ,  |peace_movements|Peace_Movement| ,  |green_parties|Green_Parties| ,  |green_|Green_Anarchism|  and  |eco_anarchists|Eco_Anarchism|  often subscribe to very different ideologies, while supporting the same goals as those who call themselves environmentalists . To outsiders, these groups or factions can appear to be indistinguishable.     As  |human_population|World_Population|  and industrial activity continue to increase, environmentalists often find themselves in serious conflict with those who believe that human and industrial activities should not be overly regulated or restricted, such as some  |libertarians|Libertarianism| .     Environmentalists often clash with others, particularly corporate interests, over issues of the management of  |natural_resources|Natural_Resources| , like in the case of the  |atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere|  as a carbon dump , the focus of  |climate_change|Climate_Change| , and  |global_warming|Global_Warming|  controversy. They usually seek to protect commonly owned or unowned resources for future generations.          While most environmentalists are mainstream and peaceful, a small minority are more radical in their approach. Adherents of  |radical_environmentalism|Radical_Environmentalism|  and  |ecological_anarchism|Green_Anarchism|  are involved in  |direct_action|Direct_Action|  campaigns to protect the environment. Some campaigns have employed controversial tactics including  |sabotage|Sabotage| ,  |blockades|Blockade| , and  |arson|Arson| , while most use peaceful protests such as marches, tree-sitting, and the like. There is substantial debate within the environmental movement as to the acceptability of these tactics, but almost all environmentalists condemn  |violent|Violence|  actions that can harm  |humans|Humans| .
