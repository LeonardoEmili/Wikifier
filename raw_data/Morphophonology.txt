      Morphophonology  is the branch of  |linguistics|Linguistics|  that studies the interaction between  |morphological|Morphology|  and  |phonological|Phonology|  or  |phonetic|Phonetic|  processes. Its chief focus is the sound changes that take place in  |morphemes|Morpheme|  when they combine to form words.     Morphophonological analysis often involves an attempt to give a series of formal rules that successfully predict the regular sound changes occurring in the morphemes of a given language. Such a series of rules converts a theoretical  |underlying_representation|Underlying_Representation|  into a surface form that is actually heard. The units of which the underlying representations of morphemes are composed are sometimes called morphophonemes. The surface form produced by the morphophonological rules may consist of  |phonemes|Phoneme|  , or else the morphophonological analysis may bypass the phoneme stage and produce the phones itself.       When  |morphemes|Morpheme|  combine, they influence each others sound structure , resulting in different variant pronunciations for the same morpheme. Morphophonology attempts to analyze these processes. A languages morphophonological structure is generally described with a series of rules which, ideally, can predict every morphophonological  |alternation|Alternation|  that takes place in the language.     An example of a morphophonological alternation in English is provided by the  |plural|Plural|  morpheme, written as -s or -es . Its pronunciation alternates between , , and , as in cats, dogs, and horses respectively. A purely phonological analysis would most likely assign to these three endings the phonemic representations , , . On a morphophonological level, however, they may all be considered to be forms of the underlying object , which is a morphophoneme. The different forms it takes are dependent on the segment at the end of the morpheme to which it attaches: the dependencies are described by morphophonological rules.      The plural suffix -s can also influence the form taken by the preceding morpheme, as in the case of the words leaf and knife, which end with  in the singular/but have  in the plural . On a morphophonological level, the morphemes may be analyzed as ending in a morphophoneme , which becomes  |voiced|Voiced_Consonant|  when a voiced consonant  is attached to it. The rule may be written symbolically as  -  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  .
