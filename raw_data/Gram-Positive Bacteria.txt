        Gram-positive bacteria are  |bacteria|Bacteria|  that give a positive result in the  |Gram_stain|Gram_Stain|  test, which is traditionally used to quickly classify bacteria into two broad categories according to their  |cell_wall|Cell_Wall| .     Gram-positive bacteria take up the  |crystal_violet|Crystal_Violet|  stain used in the test, and then appear to be purple-coloured when seen through an  |optical_microscope|Optical_Microscope| . This is because the thick  |peptidoglycan|Peptidoglycan|  layer in the bacterial cell wall retains the  |stain|Stain|  after it is washed away from the rest of the sample, in the decolorization stage of the test.      |Gram-negative_bacteria|Gram-Negative_Bacteria|  cannot retain the violet stain after the decolorization step; alcohol used in this stage degrades the outer membrane of gram-negative cells, making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain. Their peptidoglycan layer is much thinner and sandwiched between an inner cell membrane and a  |bacterial_outer_membrane|Bacterial_Outer_Membrane| , causing them to take up the  |counterstain|Counterstain|   and appear red or pink.     Despite their thicker peptidoglycan layer, gram-positive bacteria are more receptive to certain  |cell_wall|Cellwallbacterialcellwalls|  targeting  |antibiotics|Antibiotics|  than gram-negative bacteria, due to the absence of the outer membrane.                   In general, the following characteristics are present in gram-positive bacteria:      Cytoplasmic lipid membrane   Thick  |peptidoglycan|Peptidoglycan|  layer    |Teichoic_acids|Teichoic_Acids|  and lipoids are present, forming  |lipoteichoic_acids|Lipoteichoic_Acid| , which serve as  |chelating|Chelation|  agents, and also for certain types of adherence.   Peptidoglycan chains are cross-linked to form rigid cell walls by a bacterial enzyme  |DD-transpeptidase|Dd-Transpeptidase| .   A much smaller volume of  |periplasm|Periplasm|  than that in gram-negative bacteria.     Only some species have a  |capsule|Bacterial_Capsule| , usually consisting of  |polysaccharides|Polysaccharides| . Also, only some species are  |flagellates|Flagellate| , and when they do have  |flagella|Flagellum| , have only two  |basal_body|Basal_Body|  rings to support them, whereas gram-negative have four. Both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly have a surface layer called an  |S-layer|S-Layer| . In gram-positive bacteria, the S-layer is attached to the peptidoglycan layer. Gram-negative bacterias S-layer is attached directly to the  |outer_membrane|Bacterial_Outer_Membrane| . Specific to gram-positive bacteria is the presence of  |teichoic_acids|Teichoic_Acid|  in the cell wall. Some of these are lipoteichoic acids, which have a lipid component in the cell membrane that can assist in anchoring the peptidoglycan.         Along with  |cell_shape|Bacterial_Cell_Structurecell_Morphology| , Gram staining is a rapid method used to differentiate bacterial species. Such staining, together with growth requirement and antibiotic susceptibility testing, and other macroscopic and physiologic tests, forms the full basis for classification and subdivision of the bacteria .           |Historically|Bacterial_Taxonomyhistory| , the kingdom  |Monera|Monera|  was divided into four  |divisions|Taxonomic_Rank|  based primarily on Gram staining:  |Firmicutes|Firmicutes|  ,  |Gracilicutes|Gracilicutes|  ,  |Mollicutes|Mollicutes|  and Mendocutes .  Based on  |16S_ribosomal_RNA|16S_Ribosomal_Rna|  phylogenetic studies of the late microbiologist  |Carl_Woese|Carl_Woese|  and collaborators and colleagues at the  |University_of_Illinois|University_Of_Illinois| , the  |monophyly|Monophyly|  of the gram-positive bacteria was challenged,  with major implications for the therapeutic and general study of these organisms. Based on  |molecular_studies|Molecular_Phylogenetics|  of the 16S sequences, Woese recognised twelve  |bacterial_phyla|Bacterial_Phyla| . Two of these were gram-positive and were divided on the proportion of the  |guanine|Guanine|  and  |cytosine|Cytosine|  content in their  |DNA|Dna| . The high G + C phylum was made up of the  |Actinobacteria|Actinobacteria|  and the low G + C phylum contained the  |Firmicutes|Firmicutes| . The Actinobacteria include the  Corynebacterium ,  Mycobacterium ,  Nocardia  and  Streptomyces  genera. The Firmicutes, have a 45–60% GC content, but this is lower than that of the Actinobacteria.            Although bacteria are traditionally divided into two main groups, gram-positive and gram-negative, based on their Gram stain retention property, this classification system is ambiguous as it refers to three distinct aspects , which do not necessarily coalesce for some bacterial species.     The gram-positive and gram-negative staining response is also not a reliable characteristic as these two kinds of bacteria do not form phylogenetic coherent groups. However, although Gram staining response is an empirical criterion, its basis lies in the marked differences in the ultrastructure and chemical composition of the bacterial cell wall, marked by the absence or presence of an outer lipid membrane.      All gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single-unit lipid membrane, and, in general, they contain a thick layer of peptidoglycan responsible for retaining the Gram stain. A number of other bacteria—that are bounded by a single membrane, but stain gram-negative due to either lack of the peptidoglycan layer, as in the  |Mycoplasmas|Mycoplasma| , or their inability to retain the Gram stain because of their cell wall composition—also show close relationship to the Gram-positive bacteria. For the bacterial cells bounded by a single cell membrane, the term monoderm bacteria or monoderm prokaryotes has been proposed.     In contrast to gram-positive bacteria, all archetypical gram-negative bacteria are bounded by a cytoplasmic membrane and an outer cell membrane; they contain only a thin layer of peptidoglycan between these membranes. The presence of inner and outer cell membranes defines a new compartment in these cells: the  |periplasmic_space|Periplasmic_Space|  or the periplasmic compartment. These bacteria have been designated as diderm bacteria. The distinction between the monoderm and diderm bacteria is supported by conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins .  Of these two structurally distinct groups of bacteria, monoderms are indicated to be ancestral. Based upon a number of observations including that the gram-positive bacteria are the major producers of antibiotics and that, in general, gram-negative bacteria are resistant to them, it has been proposed that the outer cell membrane in gram-negative bacteria has evolved as a protective mechanism against  |antibiotic|Antibiotic|  selection pressure. Some bacteria, such as  Deinococcus , which stain gram-positive due to the presence of a thick peptidoglycan layer and also possess an outer cell membrane are suggested as intermediates in the transition between monoderm and diderm bacteria. The diderm bacteria can also be further differentiated between simple diderms lacking lipopolysaccharide, the archetypical diderm bacteria where the outer cell membrane contains lipopolysaccharide, and the diderm bacteria where outer cell membrane is made up of  |mycolic_acid|Mycolic_Acid| .          In general, gram-positive bacteria are monoderms and have a single  |lipid_bilayer|Lipid_Bilayer|  whereas gram-negative bacteria are diderms and have two bilayers. Some taxa lack peptidoglycan  and are gram-variable. This, however, does not always hold true. The  Deinococcus-Thermus  bacteria have gram-positive stains, although they are structurally similar to gram-negative bacteria with two layers. The  |Chloroflexi|Chloroflexi|  have a single layer, yet  stain negative.  Two related phyla to the Chloroflexi, the  |TM7|Tm7|  clade and the Ktedonobacteria, are also monoderms.       Some Firmicute species are not gram-positive. These belong to the class  |Mollicutes|Mollicutes|  , which lack peptidoglycan , and the class Negativicutes, which includes  |Selenomonas|Selenomonas|  and stain gram-negative. Additionally, a number of bacterial taxa  that are either part of the phylum Firmicutes or branch in its proximity are found to possess a diderm cell structure. However, a conserved signature indel in the  |HSP60|Hsp60|   protein distinguishes all traditional phyla of gram-negative bacteria  from these other atypical diderm bacteria, as well as other phyla of monoderm bacteria . The presence of this CSI in all sequenced species of conventional LPS -containing gram-negative bacterial phyla provides evidence that these phyla of bacteria form a monophyletic clade and that no loss of the outer membrane from any species from this group has occurred.            In the classical sense, six gram-positive genera are typically pathogenic in humans. Two of these,  Streptococcus  and  Staphylococcus , are  |cocci|Coccus|  . The remaining organisms are  |bacilli|Bacilli|  and can be subdivided based on their ability to form  |spores|Endospore| . The non-spore formers are  Corynebacterium  and  Listeria  , whereas  Bacillus  and  Clostridium  produce spores.  The spore-forming bacteria can again be divided based on their  |respiration|Cellular_Respiration| Bacillus is a  |facultative_anaerobe|Facultative_Anaerobic_Organism| , while Clostridium is an  |obligate_anaerobe|Obligate_Anaerobe| .  Also, Rathybacter, Leifsonia, and Clavibacter are three gram-positive genera that cause plant disease. Gram-positive bacteria are capable of causing serious and sometimes fatal  |infections|Neonatal_Infection|  in newborn infants.

In transformation, the genetic material passes through the intervening medium, and uptake is completely dependent on the recipient bacterium.     As of 2014 about 80 species of bacteria were known to be capable of transformation, about evenly divided between gram-positive and  |gram-negative_bacteria|Gram-Negative_Bacteria| ; the number might be an overestimate since several of the reports are supported by single papers. Transformation among gram-positive bacteria has been studied in medically important species such as  Streptococcus pneumoniae ,  Streptococcus mutans ,  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Streptococcus sanguinis  and in gram-positive soil bacterium  Bacillus subtilis .
