It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. Wilton, Peter. reggae. The Oxford Companion to Music. Ed.

Reggae is deeply linked to the  |Rastafari|Rastafari| , an  |Afrocentric|Afrocentrism|  religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting  |Pan_Africanism|Pan-Africanism| .    Soon after the  |Rastafari|Rastafari| an movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafarianism spreading the  |Rastafari|Rastafari|  gospel throughout the world. Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of  |Rastafarianism|Rastafarianism| . The musician becomes the messenger, and as Rastafarians see it, the soldier and the musician are tools for change.      Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of  |rhythm_and_blues|Rhythm_And_Blues| ,  |jazz|Jazz| ,  |mento|Mento|  ,  calypso, Anderson, Rick.

One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower paced than both ska and rocksteady.  The concept of  |call_and_response|Call_And_Response|  can be found throughout reggae music.The genre of reggae music is led by the drum and bass.    Some key players in this sound are Jackie Jackson from  |Toots_and_the_Maytals|Toots_And_The_Maytals| ,   |Carlton_Barrett|Carlton_Barrett|  from  |Bob_Marley_and_the_Wailers|Bob_Marley_And_The_Wailers| ,   |Lloyd_Brevett|Lloyd_Brevett|  from  |The_Skatalites|The_Skatalites| ,   |Paul_Douglas|Paul_Douglas|  from  |Toots_and_the_Maytals|Toots_And_The_Maytals| ,   |Lloyd_Knibb|Lloyd_Knibb|  from  |The_Skatalites|The_Skatalites| , Lloyd Knibb revolutionised Jamaican drumming, says PJ .

The  |bass_guitar|Bass_Guitar|  often plays the dominant role in reggae. The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and  |equalized|Equalization|  so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized.

It is common for reggae to be sung in  |Jamaican_Patois|Jamaican_Patois| ,  |Jamaican_English|Jamaican_English| , and  |Iyaric|Iyaric|  dialects. Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics,  although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing.     Reggae has spread to many countries across the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres.  |Reggae_en_Español|Reggae_En_Español|  spread from the Spanish speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American countries of  |Venezuela|Venezuela|  and  |Guyana|Guyana|  then to the rest of South America.  |Caribbean_music_in_the_United_Kingdom|Caribbean_Music_In_The_United_Kingdom| , including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of  |Bob_Marley|Bob_Marley|  to Zimbabwe in 1980. In Jamaica, authentic reggae is one of the biggest sources of income.

Reggae historian  |Steve_Barrow|Steve_Barrow|  credits  |Clancy_Eccles|Clancy_Eccles|  with altering the  |Jamaican_patois|Jamaican_Patois|  word streggae into reggae. However,  |Toots_Hibbert|Toots_Hibbert|  said:     Theres a word we used to use in Jamaica called streggae. If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say Man, shes streggae it means she dont dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, OK man, lets do the reggay. It was just something that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing Do the reggay, do the reggay and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now its in the Guinness World of Records. Sturges, Fiona   ,  The Independent , 4 June 2004, retrieved 11 December 2009; cf. many similar statements by Hibbert in recent years. In earlier interviews, Hibbert used to claim the derivation was from English regular, in reference to the beat.      |Bob_Marley|Bob_Marley|  claimed that the word reggae came from a Spanish term for the kings music .  The liner notes of To the King, a compilation of Christian gospel reggae, suggest that the word reggae was derived from the Latin regi meaning to the king .              Reggaes direct origins are in the  |ska|Ska|  and  |rocksteady|Rocksteady|  of 1960s Jamaica, strongly influenced by traditional Caribbean  |mento|Mento|  and  |calypso_music|Calypso_Music| , as well as American  |jazz|Jazz|  and  |rhythm_and_blues|Rhythm_And_Blues| . Ska was originally a generic title for Jamaican music recorded between 1961 and 1967 and emerged from Jamaican R & B, which was based largely on American R & B and doo-wop. Ska.

Rastafari entered some countries primarily through reggae music; thus, the movement in these places is more stamped by its origins in reggae music and social milieu. Salter, Richard C.. Sources and Chronology in Rastafari Origins . Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions 9.1 : 5–31. The  |Rastafari_movement|Rastafari_Movement|  was a significant influence on reggae, with  |Rasta|Rastafarian|  drummers like  |Count_Ossie|Count_Ossie|  taking part in seminal recordings.  One of the predecessors of reggae drumming is the  |Nyabinghi_rhythm|Nyabinghi_Rhythm| , a style of ritual drumming performed as a communal meditative practice in the Rastafarian life.      In the latter half of the 20th century,  |phonograph_records|Phonograph|  became of central importance to the Jamaican music industry, playing a significant cultural and economic role in the development of reggae music.  In the early 1950s , Jamaican entrepreneurs began issuing 78s but this format would soon be superseded by the 7 single, first released in 1949.  In 1951 the first recordings of mento music were released as singles and showcased two styles of mento: an acoustic rural style, and a jazzy pop style. Garnice, Michael. Bob Marley and the Wailers Mento Roots. Beat 25.2 : p.50. Other 7 singles to appear in Jamaica around this time were covers of popular American R & B hits, made by Kingston  |sound_system|Sound_System|  operators to be played at public dances. Meanwhile, Jamaican  |expatriates|Expatriate|  started issuing 45s on small independent labels in the United Kingdom, many mastered directly from Jamaican 45s.     Ska arose in Jamaican studios in the late 1950s, developing from this mix of American R & B,  |mento|Mento|  and  |calypso_music|Calypso_Music| .  Notable for its jazz-influenced horn riffs, ska is characterized by a quarter note  |walking_bass|Walking_Bass|  line, guitar and piano  |offbeats|On-Beat| , and a drum pattern with cross-stick snare and bass drum on the backbeat and open hi-hat on the offbeats. When Jamaica gained independence in 1962, ska became the music of choice for young Jamaicans seeking music that was their own. Ska also became popular among  |mods|Mod|  in Britain.     In the mid-1960s, ska gave rise to  |rocksteady|Rocksteady| , a genre slower than ska featuring more romantic lyrics and less prominent horns.   Theories abound as to why Jamaican musicians slowed the ska tempo to create rocksteady; one is that the singer Hopeton Lewis was unable to sing his hit song Take It Easy at a ska tempo. The name rocksteady was codified after the release of a single by  |Alton_Ellis|Alton_Ellis| . Many rocksteady rhythms later were used as the basis of reggae recordings, whose slower tempos allowed for the double skank guitar strokes on the offbeat.       Reggae developed from  |ska|Ska|  and  |rocksteady|Rocksteady|  in the late 1960s. Larry And Alvins Nanny Goat and the Beltones’ No More Heartaches were among the songs in the genre. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R & B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggaes great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry’s People Funny Boy , to the uptown sounds of Third World’s Now That We’ve Found Love , it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae. Reggae. Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Feb. 2016. The shift from rocksteady to reggae was illustrated by the organ  |shuffle|Swung_Note|  pioneered by Jamaican musicians like  |Jackie_Mittoo|Jackie_Mittoo|  and Winston Wright and featured in transitional singles Say What Youre Saying by  |Eric_Monty_Morris|Eric_Monty_Morris|  and People Funny Boy by  |Lee_Scratch_Perry|Lee_Scratch_Perry| .          Early 1968 was when the first bona fide reggae records were released: Nanny Goat by  |Larry_Marshall|Larry_Marshall|  and No More Heartaches by The Beltones. That same year, the newest Jamaican sound began to spawn big-name imitators in other countries. American artist  |Johnny_Nashs|Johnny_Nash|  1968 hit  |Hold_Me_Tight|Hold_Me_Tight|  has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. Around the same time, reggae influences were starting to surface in  |rock|Rock_Music|  and  |pop_music|Pop_Music| , one example being 1968s  |Ob-La-Di,_Ob-La-Da|Ob-La-Di,_Ob-La-Da|  by  |The_Beatles|The_Beatles| . Kevin OBrien Chang, 1998, Reggae Routes, p. 44.      |The_Wailers|The_Wailers| , a band started by  |Bob_Marley|Bob_Marley| ,  |Peter_Tosh|Peter_Tosh|  and  |Bunny_Wailer|Bunny_Wailer|  in 1963, is perhaps the most recognized band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Over a dozen Wailers songs are based on or use a line from Jamaican mento songs. Other significant ska artists who made the leap to reggae include  |Prince_Buster|Prince_Buster| ,  |Desmond_Dekker|Desmond_Dekker| ,  |Ken_Boothe|Ken_Boothe| , and  |Millie_Small|Millie_Small| , best known for her 1964 blue-beat/ska  |cover_version|Cover_Version|  of  |My_Boy_Lollipop|My_Boy_Lollipop|  which was a smash hit internationally.

While the quality of Reggae records produced in Jamaica took a turn for the worse following the oil crisis of the 1970s, reggae produced elsewhere began to flourish.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK  |punk_rock|Punk_Rock|  scene flourished, and reggae was a notable influence. The DJ  |Don_Letts|Don_Letts|  would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as  |The_Roxy|The_Roxy| . Punk bands such as  |The_Clash|The_Clash| ,  |The_Ruts|The_Ruts| ,  |The_Members|The_Members|  and  |The_Slits|The_Slits|  played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of Englands inner cities and exemplified by groups like  |Steel_Pulse|Steel_Pulse| ,  |Aswad|Aswad|  and  |UB40|Ub40| , as well as artists such as  |Smiley_Culture|Smiley_Culture|  and  |Carroll_Thompson|Carroll_Thompson| . The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK  |inner_city|Inner_City|  themes, and Jamaican  |patois|Patois|  became intermingled with  |Cockney|Cockney|  slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of  |Lovers_Rock|Lovers_Rock| , was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as  |Gregory_Isaacs|Gregory_Isaacs| , the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and  |Janet_Kay|Janet_Kay| . The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include  |Third_World|Third_World| ,  |Black_Uhuru|Black_Uhuru|  and  |Sugar_Minott|Sugar_Minott| . The Grammy Awards introduced the  |Grammy_Award_for_Best_Reggae_Album|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Reggae_Album|  category in 1985.

In November 2018 reggae music of Jamaica was added to the  |UNESCOs|Unesco| |Representative_List_of_the_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_of_Humanity|Unesco_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists|  the decision recognised reggaes contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual.               Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of  |rhythm_and_blues|Rhythm_And_Blues|  ,  |jazz|Jazz| ,  |mento|Mento| ,  |calypso|Calypso_Music| , African, and Latin American music, as well as other genres. Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead—drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple vocalists. Lynn, V. M. . Sound. Chicago Tribune      Reggae is played in  |time|Time_Signature|  because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as . One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the  |skank|Ska_Stroke| . Hombach, Jean-Pierre . Bob Marley the Father of Music, p.14. . Reggae is most easily recognized by...the skank.     This rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each  |bar|Bar|  and combines with the drums emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an and or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the downbeat . Levitin, Daniel J. .  This Is Your Brain On Music , pp. 113–114 .     The tempo of reggae is usually slower than both  |ska|Ska|  and  |rocksteady|Rocksteady| . It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of  |syncopated|Syncopation| , melodic bass lines that differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.     Harmonically the music is essentially the same as any other modern popular genre with a tendency to make use of simple  |chord|Chord|  progressions. Reggae sometimes uses the dominant chord in its minor form therefore never allowing a perfect cadence to be sounded; this lack of resolution between the tonic and the dominant imparts a sense of movement without rest and harmonic ambiguity. Extended chords like the  |major_seventh_chord|Major_Seventh_Chord|   and  |minor_seventh_chord|Minor_Seventh_Chord|  are used though suspended chords or diminished chords are rare. Minor keys are commonly used especially with the minor chord forms of the subdominant and dominant chord . A simple progression borrowed from  |rhythm_and_blues|Rhythm_And_Blues|  and  |soul_music|Soul_Music|  is the tonic chord followed by the minor supertonic chord with the two chords repeated continuously to form a complete verse .     The concept of call and response can be found throughout reggae music, in the vocals but also in the way parts are composed and arranged for each instrument. The emphasis on the third beat of the bar also results in a different sense of musical phrasing, with bass lines and melody lines often emphasizing what might be considered pick up notes in other genres.       A standard drum kit is generally used in reggae, but the  |snare_drum|Snare_Drum|  is often tuned very high to give it a  |timbales|Timbales| -type sound. Some reggae drummers use an additional timbale or high-tuned snare to get this sound. Cross-stick technique on the snare drum is commonly used, and  |tom-tom_drums|Tom-Tom_Drums|  are often incorporated into the drumbeat itself.      Reggae  |drumbeats|Drumbeats|  fall into three main categories:  One drop , Rockers, and Steppers. With the One drop, the emphasis is entirely on the backbeat . Beat one is empty except for a closed high hat commonly used, which is unusual in popular music. There is some controversy about whether reggae should be counted so that this beat falls on two and four, or whether it should be counted twice as fast, so it falls on three. An example played by Barrett can be heard in the  |Bob_Marley_and_the_Wailers|Bob_Marley_And_The_Wailers|  song One Drop . Barrett often used an unusual  |triplet|Irrational_Rhythm| |cross-rhythm|Polyrhythm|  on the  |hi-hat|Hi-Hat| , which can be heard on many recordings by Bob Marley and the Wailers, such as Running Away on the  Kaya  album.        An emphasis on the backbeat is found in all reggae drumbeats, but with the Rockers beat, the emphasis is on all four beats of the bar . This beat was pioneered by  |Sly_and_Robbie|Sly_And_Robbie| , who later helped create the Rub-a-Dub sound that greatly influenced dancehall. Sly has stated he was influenced to create this style by listening to American drummer Earl Young as well as other disco and R & B drummers in the early to mid-1970s, as stated in the book Wailing Blues . The prototypical example of the style is found in  |Sly_Dunbars|Sly_Dunbar|  drumming on Right Time by the Mighty Diamonds. The Rockers beat is not always straightforward, and various  |syncopations|Syncopation|  are often included. An example of this is the  |Black_Uhuru|Black_Uhuru|  song Sponji Reggae .     In Steppers, the bass drum plays every quarter beat of the bar, giving the beat an insistent drive. An example is Exodus by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Another common name for the Steppers beat is the four on the floor .  |Burning_Spears|Burning_Spear|  1975 song Red, Gold, and Green is one of the earliest examples. The Steppers beat was adopted by some  |2_Tone|2_Tone| |ska|Ska|  revival bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s.     An unusual characteristic of reggae drumming is that the drum fills often do not end with a climactic cymbal. A wide range of other percussion instrumentation are used in reggae.  |Bongos|Bongo_Drum|  are often used to play free, improvised patterns, with heavy use of African-style  |cross-rhythms|Cross-Rhythm| . Cowbells,  |claves|Claves|  and shakers tend to have more defined roles and a set pattern.     Reggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents. Dawson, M. . Jamaican drum sounds. Modern Drummer, 36, 70.          The  |bass_guitar|Bass_Guitar|  often plays the dominant role in reggae, and the drum and bass is often the most important part of what is called, in Jamaican music, a  riddim  , a piece of music thats used repeatedly by different artists to write and record songs with. Literally hundreds of reggae singers have released different songs recorded over the same rhythm. The central role of the bass can be particularly heard in  |dub_music|Dub_Music|  – which gives an even bigger role to the drum and bass line, reducing the vocals and other instruments to peripheral roles.     The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and  |equalized|Equalization|  so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The bass line is often a repeated two or four bar  |riff|Riff|  when simple chord progressions are used. The simplest example of this might be Robbie Shakespeares bass line for the Black Uhuru hit Shine Eye Gal . In the case of more complex harmonic structures, such as  |John_Holts|John_Holt|  version of Stranger in Love , these simpler patterns are altered to follow the chord progression either by directly moving the pattern around or by changing some of the interior notes in the phrase to better support the chords.          The  |guitar|Guitar|  in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in  time and counting 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ... , one would play a downstroke on the and part of the beat.  A musical figure known as  |skank|Skank|  or the bang has a very dampened, short and scratchy  |chop|Chop_Chord|  sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to  |Stir_It_Up|Stir_It_Up|  by The Wailers. Artist and producer  |Derrick_Harriott|Derrick_Harriott|  says, What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it. Bradley, Lloyd. This Is Reggae Music:The Story Of Jamaicas Music. New York : Grove Press, 2001       From the earliest days of Ska recordings, a piano was used to double the rhythm guitars skank, playing the  |chords|Chord|  in a  staccato  style to add body, and playing occasional extra beats, runs and riffs. The piano part was widely taken over by  |synthesizers|Synthesizer|  during the 1980s, although synthesizers have been used in a peripheral role since the 1970s to play incidental melodies and  |countermelodies|Countermelodies| . Larger bands may include either an additional keyboardist, to cover or replace  |horn|Brass_Instrument|  and  |melody|Melody|  lines, or the main keyboardist filling these roles on two or more keyboards.     The reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument. Simon, A. .

This may be the most difficult reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not played—that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second basic pattern, the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.       Horn sections are frequently used in reggae, often playing introductions and counter-melodies. Instruments included in a typical reggae horn section include saxophone, trumpet or trombone. In more recent times, real horns are sometimes replaced in reggae by  |synthesizers|Synthesizer|  or recorded samples. The horn section is often arranged around the first horn, playing a simple melody or counter melody. The first horn is usually accompanied by the second horn playing the same melodic phrase in unison, one octave higher. The third horn usually plays the melody an octave and a fifth higher than the first horn. The horns are generally played fairly softly, usually resulting in a soothing sound. However, sometimes punchier, louder phrases are played for a more up-tempo and aggressive sound.          The vocals in reggae are less of a defining characteristic of the genre than the instrumentation and rhythm, as almost any song can be performed in a reggae style. However, it is very common for reggae to be sung in  |Jamaican_Patois|Jamaican_Patois| ,  |Jamaican_English|Jamaican_English| , and  |Iyaric|Iyaric|  dialects. Vocal harmony parts are often used, either throughout the melody , or as a counterpoint to the main vocal line . More complex vocal arrangements can be found in the works of groups like  |The_Abyssinians|The_Abyssinians|  and  |British|United_Kingdom|  reggae band  |Steel_Pulse|Steel_Pulse| .     An unusual aspect of reggae singing is that many singers use  tremolo  rather than  vibrato  . Notable exponents of this technique include  |Horace_Andy|Horace_Andy|  and vocal group  |Israel_Vibration|Israel_Vibration| . The  |toasting|Deejay|  vocal style is unique to reggae, originating when  |DJs|Disc_Jockey|  improvised spoken introductions to songs to the point where it became a distinct rhythmic vocal style, and is generally considered to be a precursor to  |rap|Hip_Hop_Music| . It differs from rap mainly in that it is generally melodic, while rap is generally more a spoken form without melodic content.       Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered  |Motown|Motown|  or  |Atlantic|Atlantic_Records|  soul and  |funk|Funk|  songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing  |materialism|Economic_Materialism| , or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as  |Apartheid|South_Africa_Under_Apartheid| . Many reggae songs promote the use of  |cannabis|Cannabis|  , considered a sacrament in the  |Rastafari_movement|Rastafari_Movementreggae| . There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music – whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God . Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include  |black_nationalism|Black_Nationalism| ,  |anti-racism|Anti-Racism| , anti- |colonialism|Colonialism| ,   |anti-capitalism|Anti-Capitalism|  and criticism of political systems and  |Babylon|Rastafarian_Vocabularyother_Words| .     In recent years, Jamaican reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as Give a Little Love , One Love , or Three Little Birds , all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics. Mills, Susan W. Reggae For Standards-Based Music Learning. General Music Today 17.1 : 11–17. Music Index. Web. 15 Feb. 2016.          The wide cultural exposure which has enhanced the recognizability of reggae has been achieved primarily through a corporate commercialization effected at the expense of both the lyrical and instrumental essence of the music. This process has involved coerced or voluntary assimilation of more commercially compatible characteristics, appropriation by white mainstream artists, and an overall dispersal of ideological and musical meaning and creative value.The mainstream Euro-American audience has continually demonstrated a propensity for adopting reggae-oriented material on the basis of its aesthetically pleasing surface qualities rather than for explicitly political or deeper musical content, causing authenticity problems for reggae fans. Alleyne, M. . White reggae: Cultural dilution in the record industry. Popular Music and Society, 24, 15–30.       Some dancehall and ragga artists have been criticised for  |homophobia|Homophobia| ,  including threats of violence.   |Buju_Bantons|Buju_Banton|  song Boom Bye-Bye states that gays haffi dead . Other notable dancehall artists who have been accused of homophobia include  |Elephant_Man|Elephant_Man| ,  |Bounty_Killer|Bounty_Killer|  and  |Beenie_Man|Beenie_Man| . The controversy surrounding anti-gay lyrics has led to the cancellation of UK tours by Beenie Man and Sizzla. Toronto, Canada has also seen the cancellation of concerts due to artists such as Elephant Man and Sizzla refusing to conform to similar censorship pressures.        After lobbying from the  |Stop_Murder_Music|Stop_Murder_Music|  coalition, the dancehall music industry agreed in 2005 to stop releasing songs that promote hatred and violence against gay people. Flick, Larry, , The Advocate, April 12, 2005  In June 2007, Beenie Man,  |Sizzla|Sizzla|  and  |Capleton|Capleton|  signed up to the Reggae Compassionate Act, in a deal brokered with top dancehall promoters and Stop Murder Music activists. They renounced homophobia and agreed to not make statements or perform songs that incite hatred or violence against anyone from any community . Five artists targeted by the anti-homophobia campaign did not sign up to the act, including Elephant Man,  |TOK|T.O.K.| , Bounty Killa and  |Vybz_Kartel|Vybz_Kartel| .  Buju Banton and Beenie Man both gained positive press coverage around the world for publicly renouncing homophobia by signing the Reggae Compassion Act. However, both of these artists have since denied any involvement in anti-homophobia work and both deny having signed any such act.              Reggae has spread to many countries across the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres.  In November 2018  |UNESCO|Unesco|  added the reggae music of Jamaica to the  |Representative_List_of_the_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_of_Humanity|Unesco_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists| .             |Reggae_en_Español|Reggae_En_Español|  spread from mainland South American Caribbean from  |Venezuela|Venezuela|  and  |Guyana|Guyana|  to the rest of South America.

The Puerto Rican band  |Cultura_Profética|Cultura_Profética|  is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them. Davis, S. F. . Reggae in cuba and the hispanic caribbean: Fluctuations and representations of identities. Black Music Research Journal, 29, 25–49.     Brazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the  |civil_rights_movement|Civil_Rights_Movement|  and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafarianism. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations. Béhague, G. . Globalization/Modernization – rap, reggae, rock, or samba: The local and the global in brazilian popular music . Latin American Music Review/Revista De Música Latinoamericana, 27, 79–90.     Musically, it was the bloco afro  |Olodum|Olodum|  and its lead percussionist,  |Neguinho_do_Samba|Neguinho_Do_Samba| , that began to combine the basic samba beat of the blocos with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms and debuted their experimentations in the carnival of 1986. The new toques were labeled samba-reggae and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.

The UK was a primary destination for Caribbean people looking to emigrate as early as the 1950s. Because of this,  |Caribbean_music_in_the_United_Kingdom|Caribbean_Music_In_The_United_Kingdom| , including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is  |lovers_rock|Lovers_Rock| , but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like  |drum_and_bass|Drum_And_Bass|  and  |dubstep|Dubstep| . The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the worlds most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist  |Maxi_Priest|Maxi_Priest|  began his career with seminal British sound system  |Saxon_Studio_International|Saxon_Studio_International| .     Three reggae-tinged singles from  |the_Polices|The_Police|  1978 debut album,  Outlandos dAmour , laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the 70s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials leader and keyboardist,  |Jerry_Dammers|Jerry_Dammers| , founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness.

In Germany, the three successful Reggae JSnrfti mer Jam open-air fastivals were crucial parts of the renaissance of Caribbean music in Germany but at that year war broke out between the two main German promoters who had cooperated so well during the previous seasons. With a lot of infighting and personal quarrels, each of them pursued his own preparations for a big summer festival. The result was that two open-air events look place on the same day.     The Reggae Sammer Jam 90 was staged as usual, but this year for only one day. The event took place at the Lorelei Rock amphit heater with artists like Mad Professors Ariwa Posse with Macka B and Kofi, Mutabaruka, the Mighty Diamonds, the Twinkle Brothers, Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.
