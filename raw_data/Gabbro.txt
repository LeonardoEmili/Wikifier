         Gabbro  is a  |phaneritic|Phaneritic|  ,  |mafic|Mafic| |intrusive|Intrusion| |igneous_rock|Igneous_Rock|  formed from the slow cooling of magnesium-rich and iron-rich  |magma|Magma|  into a  |holocrystalline|Crystallinity|  mass deep beneath the  |Earths|Earth|  surface. Slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro is chemically equivalent to rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt. Much of the Earths  |oceanic_crust|Oceanic_Crust|  is made of gabbro, formed at  |mid-ocean_ridges|Mid-Ocean_Ridge| . Gabbro is also found as  |plutons|Pluton|  associated with continental  |volcanism|Volcanism| . Due to its variant nature, the term gabbro may be applied loosely to a wide range of intrusive rocks, many of which are merely gabbroic .       The term gabbro was used in the 1760s to name a set of rock types that were found in the ophiolites of the  |Apennine_Mountains|Apennine_Mountains|  in Italy. Bortolotti, V. et al.

It was named after Gabbro, a hamlet near  |Rosignano_Marittimo|Rosignano_Marittimo|  in  |Tuscany|Tuscany| . Then, in 1809, the German geologist  |Christian_Leopold_von_Buch|Christian_Leopold_Von_Buch|  used the term more restrictively in his description of these Italian ophiolitic rocks.

He assigned the name gabbro to rocks that geologists nowadays would more strictly call metagabbro .  at SandAtlas geology blog. Retrieved on 2015-07-09.             Gabbro is dense, greenish or dark-colored and contains  |pyroxene|Pyroxene| ,  |plagioclase|Plagioclase| , and minor amounts of  |amphibole|Amphibole|  and  |olivine|Olivine| .     The pyroxene content is mostly  |clinopyroxene|Clinopyroxene| , generally  |augite|Augite| , but small amounts of  |orthopyroxene|Orthopyroxene|  may also be present. If the amount of orthopyroxene is more than 95% of the total pyroxene content , then the rock is termed  |norite|Norite| . On the other hand, gabbro has more than 95% of its pyroxenes in the form of the  |monoclinic|Monoclinic|  clinopyroxene/s. Intermediate rocks are termed gabbro-norite. The  |calcium|Calcium|  rich  |plagioclase_feldspar|Plagioclase_Feldspar|   and pyroxene content vary between 10â€“90% in gabbro. If more than 90% plagioclase is present, then the rock is an  |anorthosite|Anorthosite| . If on the other hand, the rock contains more than 90% pyroxenes , it is termed  |pyroxenite|Pyroxenite| . Gabbro may also contain small amounts of  |olivine|Olivine|  ,  |amphibole|Amphibole|  and  |biotite|Biotite| . The  |quartz|Quartz|  content in gabbro is less than 5% of total volume. Quartz gabbros or monzogabbros are also known to occur, for example the cizlakite at  |Pohorje|Pohorje|  in northeastern Slovenia, Le Maitre, R. W.; et al., eds., 2005, Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2nd ed., p. 69,  and are probably derived from magma that was over-saturated with  |silica|Silica| .  |Essexites|Essexite|  represent gabbros whose parent magma was under-saturated with silica, resulting in the formation of the  |feldspathoid|Feldspathoid|  minerals  |nepheline|Nepheline| ,  |cancrinite|Cancrinite| , and  |sodalite|Sodalite|  as accessory minerals rather than quartz. . Gabbros contain minor amounts, typically a few percent, of iron-titanium oxides such as  |magnetite|Magnetite| ,  |ilmenite|Ilmenite| , and  |ulvospinel|Ulvospinel| .     Gabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1  mm or greater. Finer grained equivalents of gabbro are called  |diabase|Diabase|  , although the term microgabbro is often used when extra descriptiveness is desired. Gabbro may be extremely coarse grained to  |pegmatitic|Pegmatitic| , and some pyroxene-plagioclase  |cumulates|Cumulate_Rock|  are essentially coarse grained gabbro, some may exhibit acicular crystal habits.     Gabbro is usually  |equigranular|Equigranular|  in texture, although it may be  |porphyritic|Porphyritic|  at times, especially when plagioclase oikocrysts have grown earlier than the groundmass minerals.          Gabbro can be formed as a massive, uniform intrusion via in-situ crystallisation of  |pyroxene|Pyroxene|  and  |plagioclase|Plagioclase| , or as part of a  |layered_intrusion|Layered_Intrusion|  as a  |cumulate|Cumulate_Rock|  formed by settling of pyroxene and plagioclase. Cumulate gabbros are more properly termed pyroxene-plagioclase adcumulate.     Gabbro is an essential part of the oceanic crust, and can be found in many  |ophiolite|Ophiolite|  complexes as parts of zones III and IV . Long belts of gabbroic intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient  |rift|Rift|  zone margins, intruding into the rift flanks.  |Mantle_plume|Mantle_Plume|  hypotheses may rely on identifying mafic and ultramafic intrusions and coeval  |basalt|Basalt|  volcanism.     Nearly all gabbros are found in plutonic bodies, but to restrict the term just to plutonic rocks is inappropriate, because gabbro may be found as a coarse- grained interior facies of certain thick lavas . It is better to base a rock definition on descriptive characteristics of the rock rather than how or where it was formed. Robin Gill. Igneous Rocks and Processes, 2010          Gabbro often contains valuable amounts of  |chromium|Chromium| ,  |nickel|Nickel| ,  |cobalt|Cobalt| ,  |gold|Gold| ,  |silver|Silver| ,  |platinum|Platinum| , and  |copper|Copper| |sulfides|Sulfide| .      |Orbicular|Orbicular_Granite|  varieties of gabbro can be used as ornamental facing stones, paving stones and it is also known by the trade name of black granite .
