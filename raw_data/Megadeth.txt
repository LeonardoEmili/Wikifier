        Megadeth is an American  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music|  band from  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| ,  |California|California| . Guitarist  |Dave_Mustaine|Dave_Mustaine|  and bassist  |David_Ellefson|David_Ellefson|  formed the band in 1983 shortly after Mustaines dismissal from  |Metallica|Metallica| . Along with Metallica,  |Anthrax|Anthrax| , and  |Slayer|Slayer| , Megadeth is one of the big four of American  |thrash_metal|Thrash_Metal| , responsible for its development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast  |rhythm_sections|Rhythm_Section| , and lyrical themes of death, war, politics, and religion.     In 1985, Megadeth released its debut album,  Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! , on the independent record label  |Combat_Records|Combat_Records| , to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with  |Capitol_Records|Capitol_Records| . Their first major-label album,  Peace Sells... but Whos Buying? , was released in 1986 and influenced the underground metal scene. Substance abuse and personal disputes brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period.     After the lineup stabilized, Megadeth released a number of  |platinum-selling_albums|Music_Recording_Sales_Certification| , including  Rust in Peace  and  Countdown to Extinction  . These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival,  |Gigantour|Gigantour| , several times since July 2005.     Megadeth has sold over 38 million records worldwide,  earned platinum certification in the United States for six of its fifteen studio albums, and received twelve  |Grammy_nominations|Grammy_Award| . Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in  |2017|59Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards|  for the song Dystopia in the  |Best_Metal_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Metal_Performance|  category.  The bands mascot,  |Vic_Rattlehead|Vic_Rattlehead| , regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. The group has drawn controversy for its music and lyrics, including album bans and canceled concerts;  |MTV|Mtv|  refused to play two of the bands music videos that the network considered to condone suicide.           On April 11, 1983,  |Dave_Mustaine|Dave_Mustaine|  was fired from  |Metallica|Metallica|  just prior to the band recording their debut album  Kill Em All  due to substance abuse and personal conflicts with  |James_Hetfield|James_Hetfield|  and  |Lars_Ulrich|Lars_Ulrich| . As Metallicas lead guitarist since 1981, Mustaine had composed some of the groups early songs and helped hone the band into a tight live unit. Afterward, Mustaine vowed revenge by forming a band that was faster and heavier than Metallica. On the bus trip back to Los Angeles, Mustaine found a pamphlet by California senator  |Alan_Cranston|Alan_Cranston|  that read: The arsenal of megadeath cant be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to.  The term Megadeath stuck with Mustaine and he wrote a song with the spelling slightly changed to Megadeth, which, according to Mustaine, represented the annihilation of power.      After arriving back in Los Angeles, Mustaine began the search for new bandmates. He formed a band with his new neighbors  |David_Ellefson|David_Ellefson|  and Greg Handevidt, who had moved from Minnesota and played bass and guitar respectively. While Handevidt would only last a few months, Mustaine and Ellefson formed a tight musical bond. Despite his enthusiasm, Mustaine had trouble finding other members to fill out the lineup. He and Ellefson auditioned about fifteen drummers, hoping to find one who understood  |metre|Metre|  changes in music. After briefly playing with Dijon Carruthers, they selected Lee Rausch. Following six months of trying to find a lead singer, Mustaine decided to fill the role himself.     In 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song  |demo|Demo|  tape featuring Mustaine, Ellefson, and Rausch. The demo tape, Last Rites, was released on March 9, 1984. The demo featured early versions of Last Rites/Loved to Death , The Skull Beneath the Skin , and Mechanix , all of which appeared on the bands debut album. The band were unable to find a compatible second guitarist.  |Kerry_King|Kerry_King|  of  |Slayer|Slayer|  filled in on rhythm guitar for several shows in the San Francisco area in the spring of 1984.  Afterwards, King went back to Slayer and Megadeth replaced Rausch with  |jazz_fusion|Jazz_Fusion|  drummer  |Gar_Samuelson|Gar_Samuelson| . Samuelson had previously been in the jazz band the New Yorkers with guitarist  |Chris_Poland|Chris_Poland| . After seeing Samuelson perform with Megadeth as a trio, Poland went backstage and suggested an impromptu audition as lead guitarist for the band; he joined Megadeth in December 1984.     Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!   After considering several labels, Mustaine signed the band to  |Combat_Records|Combat_Records| , a New York-based  |Independent_record_label|Independent_Record_Label|  that offered Megadeth the highest budget to record and tour. In 1985, Combat Records gave the band $8,000 to record and produce its debut album. After spending $4,000 of the budget on drugs, alcohol, and food, the band fired the original producer and finished the recording themselves.     Despite its low  |fidelity|Fidelity|  sound,  Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!  was relatively successful in underground metal circles and attracted major-label interest. Music writer  |Joel_McIver|Joel_Mciver|  praised its blistering technicality and stated that the album raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully . The front cover marked the debut of band mascot  |Vic_Rattlehead|Vic_Rattlehead| , who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork.      Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! features Mechanix , a song Mustaine wrote during his time with Metallica. Though Mustaine told the band after his dismissal not to use the music he had written, Metallica recorded a different version of the song, The Four Horsemen , with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section.  The album also included a cover of  |Nancy_Sinatras|Nancy_Sinatra| |These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin|These_Boots_Are_Made_For_Walkin| , at a faster tempo and with altered lyrics. Megadeths version generated controversy during the 1990s, when its writer,  |Lee_Hazlewood|Lee_Hazlewood| , called Mustaines changes vile and offensive .  Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from pressings released from 1995 to 2001.      In mid-1985, on a bill with Canadian speed metal band  |Exciter|Exciter| , Megadeth played its first North American tour: the Killing for a Living Tour. Touring guitarist  |Mike_Albert|Mike_Albert|  replaced Poland, who was battling drug addiction. Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, shortly before the group began recording its second album for Combat.     Peace Sells... but Whos Buying?     According to Mustaine, Megadeth was under pressure to deliver another successful album: That sophomore offering is the be-all or end-all of any band. You either go to the next level, or its the beginning of the nadir.  The songs were developed relatively quickly in an old warehouse south of Los Angeles before recording began. Mustaine composed the music, with the other members adding arrangement ideas.     The album was produced on a $25,000 budget from Combat Records. Dissatisfied with its financial limitations, the band left Combat and signed with  |Capitol_Records|Capitol_Records| . Capitol bought the rights to the album, and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings. Released in late 1986,  Peace Sells... but Whos Buying?  has clearer production and more sophisticated songwriting. Mustaine wanted to write socially conscious lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who sang about hedonistic pleasures .  The album was noted for its political commentary and helped Megadeth expand its fanbase. The  |title_track|Peace_Sells|  was the albums lead single and was accompanied by a music video that received regular airplay on  |MTV|Mtv| .          In February 1987, Megadeth was the opening act on  |Alice_Coopers|Alice_Cooper|  Constrictor tour,  and the following month began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom. The 72-week tour was supported by  |Overkill|Overkill|  and  |Necros|Necros| , and continued in the United States. During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse. According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer  |Chuck_Behler|Chuck_Behler|  traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson would not be able to continue. Poland quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin. As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the bands full-time drummer.     Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of  |Malice|Malice| , but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher,  |Jeff_Young|Jeff_Young| , when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.      So Far, So Good... So What! So Far, So Good... So What!  took over five months to record. The production was plagued with problems, partially due to Mustaines struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: The production of So Far, So Good... So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didnt have at the time. Mustaine clashed with Lani, beginning with Lanis insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers.  Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the mixing, and Lani was replaced by  |Michael_Wagener|Michael_Wagener| , who remixed the album.     So Far, So Good... So What! was released in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics.  The album featured a cover version of the  |Sex_Pistols|Sex_Pistols| |Anarchy_in_the_U.K.|Anarchy_In_The_U.K.|  ; Mustaine changed the lyrics, later saying that he had simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour, opening for  |Dio|Dio|  in Europe and then joining  |Iron_Maidens|Iron_Maiden| |Seventh_Tour_of_a_Seventh_Tour|Seventh_Tour_Of_A_Seventh_Tour|  in the United States.      In June 1988, Megadeth appeared in  |Penelope_Spheeris|Penelope_Spheeris|  documentary  The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years . The documentary chronicled the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of the late 1980s, and Spheeris, who had directed Megadeth in the video for Wake Up Dead , decided to include them to feature a more serious band in contrast to the  |glam_metal|Glam_Metal|  groups.  Mustaine remembered the film as a disappointment, as it aligned Megadeth with a bunch of shit bands .      In August, the band appeared at the  |Monsters_of_Rock|Monsters_Of_Rock|  festival at  |Castle_Donington|Castle_Donington|  in the United Kingdom, performing to an audience of more than 100,000. One show featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. The band was added to the Monsters of Rock European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefsons drug problems, for which he was treated immediately.     Shortly after the Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and canceled Megadeths Australian tour. On the road, things escalated from a small border skirmish into a full-on raging war, Mustaine later recalled. I think a lot of us were inconsistent because of  During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer  |Nick_Menza|Nick_Menza|  as Behlers  |drum_technician|Road_Crew| . As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Youngs dismissal resulted from Mustaines suspicions that he was having an affair with Mustaines girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.      The band was unable to quickly find a suitable replacement for Young. At this time, Megadeth recorded a cover version of Alice Coopers  |No_More_Mr._Nice_Guy|No_More_Mr._Nice_Guy|  which appeared on the soundtrack to the  |Wes_Craven|Wes_Craven|  horror movie  Shocker . The video was directed by  |Penelope_Spheeris|Penelope_Spheeris| , who recalled the filming as a Herculean task as Mustaine was unable to play guitar because of his drug addiction. During the March 1989 auditions for a new lead guitarist, Mustaine was arrested for  |driving_under_the_influence|Driving_Under_The_Influence|  and possession of narcotics after crashing into a parked vehicle occupied by an off-duty police officer. Mustaine entered court-ordered  |drug_rehabilitation|Drug_Rehabilitation|  shortly afterwards, and became drug-free for the first time in ten years.     Rust in Peace |Lee_Altus|Lee_Altus|  of  |Heathen|Heathen|  and  |Eric_Meyer|Eric_Meyer|  of  |Dark_Angel|Dark_Angel| . Meyer was invited to join the band after Polands departure, but chose to remain with Dark Angel.   |Guns_N_Roses|Guns_N_Roses|  guitarist  |Slash|Slash|  had been jamming with Mustaine and Ellefson, and although it seemed that he might join Megadeth, he remained with Guns N Roses.  |Dimebag_Darrell|Dimebag_Darrell|  of  |Pantera|Pantera|  was offered the job, but the deal fell through after Mustaine refused his request to recruit his brother, Pantera drummer  |Vinnie_Paul|Vinnie_Paul| , as he had already hired Menza.  The offer was also extended to  |Criss_Oliva|Criss_Oliva|  who also declined as he did not want to leave  |Savatage|Savatage| .   |Jeff_Loomis|Jeff_Loomis| , who would later go on to form progressive metal titans  |Nevermore|Nevermore| , also auditioned though Mustaine deemed him too young to join as Loomis was only 16 at the time.          |Marty_Friedman|Marty_Friedman|  filled the guitarist position at the recommendation of Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard  Dragons Kiss , a solo recording by Friedman when he was in  |Cacophony|Cacophony| . Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Friedmans style and thought that he understood Megadeths music. With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans consider the definitive Megadeth lineup. The revitalized band entered Rumbo Studios in March 1990 with co-producer  |Mike_Clink|Mike_Clink|  to begin Megadeths most critically acclaimed album,  Rust in Peace . For the first time the bands members remained sober in the studio, alleviating many problems which plagued previous albums. Clink was the first producer to complete a Megadeth album without being fired. Its recording was documented in  Rusted Pieces , a home video released in 1991 with six music videos and an interview with the band.     Released in September 1990, Rust in Peace debuted at number 23 in the United States and number eight in the United Kingdom.  Mustaine had developed a writing style with a rhythmically complex, progressive edge, and the songs featured longer guitar solos and frequent tempo changes. Described as a genre-defining work by  Decibel ,  the album solidified Megadeths reputation in the music industry. It features the singles  |Holy_Wars..._The_Punishment_Due|Holy_Wars..._The_Punishment_Due|  and  |Hangar_18|Hangar_18|  , both of which were accompanied by music videos and became live staples. Rust in Peace received a Grammy nomination in 1991 for  |Best_Metal_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Metal_Performance| ,  and was the groups third platinum album, certified in December 1994.      Early in 1990, Megadeth joined Slayer,  |Testament|Testament| , and  |Suicidal_Tendencies|Suicidal_Tendencies|  for the successful European  |Clash_of_the_Titans|Clash_Of_The_Titans|  tour, featuring several American thrash metal bands. An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and  |Anthrax|Anthrax| , with  |Alice_in_Chains|Alice_In_Chains|  as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time slots. In addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth played with  |Judas_Priest|Judas_Priest|  in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second  |Rock_in_Rio|Rock_In_Rio|  festival in January 1991. In July 1991 the song Go to Hell was featured in the film  |Bill_&_Teds_Bogus_Journey|Bill_&_Teds_Bogus_Journey|  and on its soundtrack.      Countdown to Extinction     The recording sessions for Megadeths fifth studio album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in  |Burbank,_California|Burbank,_California| .  |Max_Norman|Max_Norman|  was chosen to produce, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace.  Megadeth spent nearly four months in the studio with Norman, writing and recording what became the bands most commercially successful album,  Countdown to Extinction .  The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member.  Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.     Released in July 1992, Countdown to Extinction entered the  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200|  chart at number two and was certified triple platinum in the United States. The albums overseas success helped the band to develop a larger following outside the US. It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the  |1993_Grammy_Awards|35Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards| ,  and its title track won a  |Genesis_Award|Genesis_Award|  from the  |Humane_Society|The_Humane_Society_Of_The_United_States|  in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues.  Ellefson later said that he and Friedman were disappointed that Megadeth did not win the Grammy: It was such a bizarre moment, because it was as if the amount of work it had taken to ramp up to that hopeful night was literally gone in a second.      A world tour in support of the album was launched in late 1992, with Pantera and  |White_Zombie|White_Zombie|  as supporting acts. The tour included a North American leg in early 1993, with  |Stone_Temple_Pilots|Stone_Temple_Pilots|  as the opening act. One month into the leg, the remaining shows, including dates in Japan, were canceled when Mustaine returned to substance abuse, ending up in a hospital emergency room.  After seven weeks in rehab, Mustaine emerged sober again and the band returned to the studio to record  |Angry_Again|Angry_Again|  . The song is featured on the soundtrack of the 1993 film  Last Action Hero  and received a Grammy nomination in 1994.      During mid-1993, Megadeth performed at a number of shows with Metallica in Europe. The first was at  |Milton_Keynes_Bowl|National_Bowl|  in England, and included  |Diamond_Head|Diamond_Head| . In July, Megadeth was added as the opening act for  |Aerosmiths|Aerosmith| |Get_a_Grip_Tour|Get_A_Grip_Tour| , but was removed from the bill after three shows.  Aerosmith said that Megadeth was dumped because of Mustaines erratic behavior, while Capitol Records said it was due to artistic restrictions .  After the canceled US tour, Megadeth returned to the studio to record 99 Ways to Die , which appeared on  The Beavis and Butt-head Experience , a compilation album released in November featuring songs interspersed with commentary by the main characters of the animated series  Beavis and Butt-head . The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the  |1995_Grammy_Awards|37Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards| .  During these sessions, Megadeth recorded a cover version of  |Black_Sabbaths|Black_Sabbath| |Paranoid|Paranoid|  , which appeared on the Black Sabbath tribute album  Nativity in Black ; it was nominated for a Grammy the following year.      YouthanasiaCountdown to Extinction. With three band members living in  |Arizona|Arizona| , initial work began at Phase Four Studios in  |Phoenix|Phoenix,_Arizona| . A few days into pre-production, problems with Phase Fours equipment forced the band to look for another studio. Mustaine insisted on recording in Arizona, but no suitable recording facility could be found. At Normans request, the band built its own recording studio in Phoenix in a rented warehouse, later called Fat Planet in Hangar 18 .  During the studios construction, much of the pre-production songwriting and arrangements were done at Vintage Recorders in Phoenix. At Normans suggestion, the tracks on Youthanasia had a slower tempo than previous albums, at about 120  |beats_per_minute|Beats_Per_Minute| . The band abandoned the progressive approach from its previous albums and focused on stronger vocal melodies and more accessible, radio-friendly arrangements.  For the first time, Megadeth wrote and arranged the entire album in the studio, including basic tracks recorded live by the entire band. The albums recording was video recorded and released as Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia in 1995.      After eight months of studio work,  Youthanasia  was released in November 1994. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and charted in several European countries.  The album was certified gold in Canada the day it was released,  and was certified platinum in the US two months later. Megadeth hired fashion photographer  |Richard_Avedon|Richard_Avedon|  to enhance the bands image. Avedon had the band members exchange their jeans and T-shirts for a more conscious appearance.  To promote Youthanasia, the band played a Halloween show in  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  called Night of the Living Megadeth , which was broadcast live on MTV. In November, the band performed twice on the  Late Show with David Letterman , playing  |Train_of_Consequences|Train_Of_Consequences|  on the first appearance and  |À_Tout_le_Monde|À_Tout_Le_Monde|  on the second.       An eleven-month tour began in South America in November 1994. In 1995, Megadeth played in Europe and North America with several opening acts, including  |Corrosion_of_Conformity|Corrosion_Of_Conformity| ,  |Korn|Korn|  and  |Fear_Factory|Fear_Factory| .  The tour culminated with an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Brazil, co-headlining with Alice Cooper and  |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne| .  In January 1995, Megadeth appeared on the soundtrack of the horror movie  Demon Knight  with the song Diadems .  In July, Megadeth released  Hidden Treasures , an  |extended_play|Extended_Play|  featuring songs which originally appeared on movie soundtracks and tribute albums.      Cryptic WritingsYouthanasia, Megadeth took time off late in 1995. Mustaine began work on  |MD.45|Md.45| , a side project with vocalist  |Lee_Ving|Lee_Ving|  of  |Fear|Fear| . The duo hired drummer  |Jimmy_DeGrasso|Jimmy_Degrasso| , who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year.  Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996. In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Pragers influence, Mustaine later wrote: I figured maybe this guy could help me get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted.  The album, recorded in  |Nashville|Nashville,_Tennessee| , was Megadeths first collaboration with  |country_pop|Country_Pop|  producer  |Dann_Huff|Dann_Huff| , who had met Mustaine in 1990.      Cryptic Writings  was released in June 1997. The album peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200, and was eventually certified gold in the United States. Its lead single,  |Trust|Trust|  , became Megadeths highest charting song on the  |Mainstream_Rock_Tracks|Mainstream_Rock|  at number five,  and was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the  |1998_Grammy_Awards|40Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards| .  Although all four singles from the album entered the top 20 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Tracks chart,  press response to the album was mixed. The album featured a diverse set of songs which the  Los Angeles Times  described as a rousing balance between older material and experimental songs.  Asked about the albums eclecticism, Mustaine said that Cryptic Writings was divided into thirds. One part was based around faster, more aggressive material, another was radio-orientated music like Youthanasia , and the final third was more melodic.      After more than a year since the bands last concert, Megadeth returned as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the  |Misfits|Misfits|  and touring in the United States with  |Life_of_Agony|Life_Of_Agony|  and  |Coal_Chamber|Coal_Chamber| . In July, the band participated in  |Ozzfest|Ozzfest|  98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery.  Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza for the remainder of the tour.  Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.     RiskCryptic Writings, Megadeth again worked with Dann Huff on its eighth studio album. The band began writing in January 1999, supervised by manager Bud Prager, who was credited with co-writing five of the albums twelve songs.  With high expectations following the chart success of Trust , Prager convinced Mustaine to grant Huff even more control over the albums recording, a decision Mustaine later regretted.       Risk , released in August 1999, was a critical and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal.   About the bands musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after that we were going to get back to our roots. It took a little bit of time to do that.  Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States.  The albums lead single,  |Crush_Em|Crush_Em|  , appeared on the soundtrack for  Universal Soldier: The Return  and was used as an entrance theme for  |NHL|Nhl|  hockey games and professional wrestling events.      On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died of  |liver_failure|Liver_Failure|  at age 41 in  |Orange_City,_Florida|Orange_City,_Florida| .  Three days later, during Megadeths performance at  |Woodstock_1999|Woodstock_1999| , Mustaine dedicated Peace Sells to Samuelsons memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover version of the Black Sabbaths  |Never_Say_Die|Never_Say_Die|  for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences.  Mustaine later said: I told after Risk that we had to go back to our roots and play metal, and he quit.  In January 2000, guitarist  |Al_Pitrelli|Al_Pitrelli| , formerly of  |Savatage|Savatage|  and the  |Trans-Siberian_Orchestra|Trans-Siberian_Orchestra| , became Friedmans replacement.      In April, Megadeth returned to the studio to work on its ninth studio album. A month into production, the band received an offer to join the Maximum Rock tour with Anthrax and  |Mötley_Crüe|Mötley_Crüe| . Megadeth put the recording on hold and toured North America during the second quarter of 2000. Early in the tour, Anthrax was removed from the bill, allowing Megadeth to play an extended co-headlining set. The tour, however, had poor ticket sales.     The World Needs a Hero Capitol returned the bands newest recordings and released a greatest hits album,  Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years , with two new tracks: Kill the King and Dread and the Fugitive Mind .  In November, Megadeth signed with  |Sanctuary_Records|Sanctuary_Records| . The band returned to the studio in October to finish its next album,  The World Needs a Hero , which was near completion when Megadeth joined the Maximum Rock tour six months earlier. Following the negative response to Risk,  Mustaine fired Bud Prager and produced the album himself.  The songs were written by Mustaine alone, except for Promises , which had contributions from Pitrelli.  Two days before the release of The World Needs a Hero, Megadeth appeared in an episode of  |VH1s|Vh1|   Behind the Music  showcasing Mustaine, Ellefson, several past members, and Mustaines old Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.      The World Needs a Hero was released in May 2001, and debuted at number sixteen on the Billboard 200. It was banned in Malaysia when the national government determined that the albums artwork was unsuitable for the nations youth . Consequently, the band canceled its concert of August 2 in  |Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala_Lumpur| .  The album marked Megadeths return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of its previous two albums, but critics felt it fell short of expectations.  Mustaine compared the album to a huge ship at sea, turning and trying to right itself to get back on course. Its lead single, Moto Psycho , reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.     A European tour with  |AC/DC|Ac/Dc|  in support of The World Needs a Hero began in mid-2001, followed by an American tour with  |Iced_Earth|Iced_Earth|  and  |Endo|Endo|  in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the  |September_11_attacks|September_11_Attacks| ; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeths first live release,  Rude Awakening . That year, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.            In January 2002, Mustaine was hospitalized for the removal of a  |kidney_stone|Kidney_Stone|  and was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas. While there, Mustaine fell asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, causing compression of the  |radial_nerve|Radial_Nerve| . He was subsequently diagnosed with  |radial_neuropathy|Radial_Neuropathy| , which left him unable to grasp or make a fist with his left hand.       On April 3, Mustaine announced in a press release that he was disbanding Megadeth, as his arm injury rendered him unable to play guitar.  For the next four months, he had physical therapy five days a week, and slowly began to re-teach his left hand.  To fulfill contract obligations to Sanctuary, Megadeth released the compilation album  Still Alive... and Well? . The first half of the album contains live tracks recorded at the Web Theatre in Phoenix, and the second half has studio recordings from The World Needs a Hero.      Following nearly a year of recovery, including physical and  |electroshock_therapy|Electroshock_Therapy| , Mustaine began work on what was to have been his first solo album. The new material was recorded with session musicians  |Vinnie_Colaiuta|Vinnie_Colaiuta|  and  |Jimmie_Lee_Sloas|Jimmie_Lee_Sloas|  in October 2003. The project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeths eight-album back catalog on Capitol Records,  re-recording portions that were missing or altered without his knowledge in the original mixing.      The System Has Failed     In May 2004, Mustaine returned to his solo project. Contractual obligations to the bands European label,  |EMI|Emi| , resulted in the recordings release as a Megadeth album.  Mustaine reformed the band and contacted the fan-favorite Rust in Peace lineup to re-record backing tracks. While drummer Nick Menza agreed to return, both Marty Friedman and David Ellefson were unable to come to an agreement with Mustaine.  Menza was sent home shortly after rehearsals began, a few days before the start of a tour supporting Megadeths upcoming album. Mustaine said Menza was insufficiently prepared for the physical demands of a US tour, and it just didnt work out .  This was the first album without Ellefson. Chris Poland, who played lead guitar on Megadeths first two albums, was hired to contribute guitar solos to the new album, working with Mustaine for the first time since the 1980s. Poland opted to serve only as a session musician, wanting to remain focused on his jazz fusion project  |OHM|Ohm| .       The System Has Failed  was released in September 2004. Critics heralded it as a return to form;  Revolver  gave the album a favorable review, calling it Megadeths most vengeful, poignant and musically complex offering since 1992s Countdown to Extinction .  The album marked a shift toward the bands earlier sound; journalist Amy Sciarretto of  CMJ New Music Report  wrote that the album contained  |neo-thrash|Neo-Thrash|  riffing with biting, politically charged lyrics .  The System Has Failed debuted at number eighteen on the Billboard 200  and was led by Die Dead Enough , which reached number 21 on the US  |Mainstream_Rock_chart|Mainstream_Rock| .  Mustaine announced that the album would be the bands last and would be followed by a farewell tour, after which he would focus on a solo career.      Megadeth began the Blackmail the Universe world tour in October, enlisting touring bassist  |James_MacDonough|James_Macdonough|  of Iced Earth and guitarist  |Glen_Drover|Glen_Drover|  of  |Eidolon|Eidolon|  and  |King_Diamond|King_Diamond| . Five days before the first show, Menza was replaced by  |Shawn_Drover|Shawn_Drover| , who remained with the band as a regular member.  The band toured the US with  |Exodus|Exodus|  and Europe with Diamond Head and  |Dungeon|Dungeon| .   In June 2005, Capitol released a greatest-hits compilation,  Greatest Hits: Back to the Start , featuring remixed and remastered versions of songs chosen by fans from Megadeths Capitol albums.             In mid-2005, Mustaine organized an annual thrash metal festival tour,  |Gigantour|Gigantour| . Megadeth headlined the inaugural tour with acts such as  |Dream_Theater|Dream_Theater| ,  |Nevermore|Nevermore| , Anthrax, and Fear Factory. Performances at the  |Montreal|Montreal|  and  |Vancouver|Vancouver|  shows were filmed and recorded for a live DVD-and-CD set released in the second quarter of 2006.  On October 9, following the successes of The System Has Failed and the Blackmail the Universe world tour, Mustaine announced to a sold-out crowd at the  |Pepsi_Music_Rock_Festival|Pepsi_Music_Festival|  in Argentina that Megadeth would continue to record and tour.  The concert, held at  |Obras_Sanitarias|Estadio_Obras_Sanitarias|  stadium in  |Buenos_Aires|Buenos_Aires|  in front of 25,000 fans, was filmed and released on DVD as  That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires  in 2007.      In February 2006, bassist James MacDonough left the band over personal differences .  He was replaced by  |James_LoMenzo|James_Lomenzo| , who had worked with  |David_Lee_Roth|David_Lee_Roth| ,  |White_Lion|White_Lion| , and  |Black_Label_Society|Black_Label_Society| .  The new Megadeth lineup made its live debut headlining the  |Dubai_Desert_Rock_Festival|Dubai_Desert_Rock_Festival|  in the  |United_Arab_Emirates|United_Arab_Emirates|  with Testament.  In March, Capitol released a two-disc DVD,  Arsenal of Megadeth , which included archive footage, interviews, live shows, and many of the bands music videos. Due to licensing issues, soundtrack and non-Capitol videos were not included.  The second Gigantour began during the third quarter of 2006; Megadeth again headlined, this time with  |Lamb_of_God|Lamb_Of_God| ,  |Opeth|Opeth| ,  |Arch_Enemy|Arch_Enemy|  and Overkill.  The 2006 tour included three dates in Australia, supported by  |Soulfly|Soulfly| ,  |Arch_Enemy|Arch_Enemy| , and  |Caliban|Caliban| .      United Abominations     In May 2006, Megadeth announced that its eleventh studio album,  United Abominations , was near completion. Originally scheduled for release in October, Mustaine said that the band was putting the finishing touches on it and postponed its release to May of the following year.  He commented on the release: Metal needs a really good old-school record again. I believe I have delivered.  United Abominations was the bands first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of À Tout le Monde entitled  |À_Tout_le_Monde|À_Tout_Le_Monde2007_Version|  . The 2007 version is a duet with  |Cristina_Scabbia|Cristina_Scabbia|  of  |Lacuna_Coil|Lacuna_Coil| ; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.      Released in May 2007, United Abominations debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200, selling 54,000 copies in the first week.  In March, Megadeth began a North American tour opening for the newly reformed  |Heaven_&_Hell|Heaven_&_Hell| . The band played with  |Down|Down|  for Canadian shows and with  |Machine_Head|Machine_Head|  for the US dates.  A European summer festival tour followed. Late in the year, Megadeth returned to the United States to headline its Tour of Duty.  In November, the band brought Gigantour to Australia with a lineup including  |Static-X|Static-X| ,  |DevilDriver|Devildriver|  and Lacuna Coil.      In January 2008, Glen Drover quit Megadeth, stating that he was tired of the frequent touring and wanted to spend more time with his family. He also cited personal issues with other band members.  Drover was replaced by  |Chris_Broderick|Chris_Broderick| , formerly of  |Nevermore|Nevermore|  and  |Jag_Panzer|Jag_Panzer| .  Broderick was initially asked by Mustaines management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaines house, Broderick was introduced as the bands new guitarist.  Mustaine complimented Brodericks playing skills and called him the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had .  Brodericks former Nevermore bandmate,  |Van_Williams|Van_Williams| , congratulated Megadeth on getting one hell of a good player, more importantly theyre getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend .      The new lineup made its live debut at the  |Helsinki_Ice_Hall|Helsinki_Ice_Hall|  on February 4. The 2008 Gigantour, with 29 North American dates, began shortly afterwards.  Mustaine wanted a shorter lineup, allowing each band a chance to perform well. The third tour featured  |In_Flames|In_Flames| ,  |Children_of_Bodom|Children_Of_Bodom| ,  |Job_for_a_Cowboy|Job_For_A_Cowboy|  and  |High_on_Fire|High_On_Fire| .  Megadeth continued the Tour of Duty in South America and Mexico in May and June. A compilation album,  Anthology: Set the World Afire , was released in September 2008.      Endgame At this time, Metallica, who had been inducted into the  |Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame|Rock_And_Roll_Hall_Of_Fame| , invited Mustaine to attend the ceremony. Mustaine was informed that he would not be inducted to the Hall of Fame because such honors were granted only to those members who received recording credit on a Metallica album. Mustaine congratulated the group respectfully, and honored his commitment to the European tour with Judas Priest.  In April, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined the Canadian Carnage. This was the first time they had performed together in more than 15 years. Machine Head and  |Suicide_Silence|Suicide_Silence|  opened for the four shows that occurred later in June.      In May, Megadeth finished recording its twelfth album,  Endgame .  The release date for Endgame was announced on the Megadeth official website, and  Metal Hammer  was the first to review the album track-by-track.  Megadeth began its Endgame tour in October, and finished it in December. The tour featured a number of supporting acts, including Machine Head, Suicide Silence, and  |Warbringer|Warbringer| .  In January 2010, Megadeth was set to embark on the American Carnage tour with Slayer and Testament, but the tour was postponed due to  |Tom_Arayas|Tom_Araya|  back surgery.  Several weeks later, Megadeths  |Head_Crusher|Head_Crusher|  was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the  |2010_Grammy_Awards|52Nd_Annual_Grammy_Awards| , the bands eighth Grammy nomination in 19 years.      In March, Megadeth embarked on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour, which took place in North America and had support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played Rust in Peace in its entirety.  Prior to the start of the tour, original bassist Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. In an interview for  Classic Rock , he stated that Shawn Drover contacted him, informing him that bassist LoMenzo was leaving the band, saying if ever there was a time for you and Dave to talk, now is it .      Thirteen     Megadeth, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, collectively known as the big four of thrash metal, agreed to perform on the same bill during mid-2010. These performances were part of the  |Sonisphere_Festival|Sonisphere_Festival|  and were held in a number of European countries.  One such performance in  |Sofia|Sofia| , Bulgaria, was filmed and released as a video album entitled  The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria .  These shows continued the following year in the United States. The first took place in  |Indio,_California|Indio,_California| , and was the only scheduled show in the United States at the time,  although a second American production was held at  |Yankee_Stadium|Yankee_Stadium|  in New York City shortly afterwards.      In July 2010, after the European big four shows, Megadeth and Slayer commenced the first leg of the  |American_Carnage_Tour|American_Carnage_Tour| , where Megadeth played Rust in Peace in its entirety, while Slayer performed its album  Seasons in the Abyss , both of which were released in 1990.  From these shows onward, Vic Rattlehead started making sustained onstage appearances, to improve the visual facet of Megadeths live performances.  Shortly afterward, the two bands united with Anthrax for the  |Jägermeister_Music_Tour|Jägermeister_Music_Tour|  in late 2010.  During the final show of the tour, Kerry King joined Megadeth on stage at the  |Gibson_Amphitheatre|Gibson_Amphitheatre|  in Hollywood to perform Megadeths Rattlehead . It was the first time that King had performed onstage with Megadeth as the latters early shows in 1984.  Megadeth and Slayer again shared the stage for the  |European_Carnage_Tour|European_Carnage_Tour|  in March and April 2011.  Megadeth also headlined the fourth annual  |Rockstar_Mayhem_Festival|Rockstar_Mayhem_Festival|  in July and August the same year.      In September, the band released the DVD album  Rust in Peace Live , recorded at the  |Hollywood_Palladium|Hollywood_Palladium|  in Los Angeles.  Later that month, Megadeth released  |Sudden_Death|Sudden_Death|  for the video game  Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock .  The song was commissioned by the publishers of the  |Guitar_Hero|Guitar_Hero|  franchise, who wanted the track to feature dark lyrics and multiple guitar solos.  It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the  |2011_Grammy_ceremony|53Rd_Annual_Grammy_Awards| .      Megadeth returned to its own Vics Garage studio to record its thirteenth album, to be produced by  |Johnny_K|Johnny_K| , because Andy Sneap, the producer of Megadeths previous two albums, was unavailable.  The album was titled  Thirteen  and featured previously released tracks such as Sudden Death and Never Dead .  The album was released in November 2011, and charted at number eleven on the Billboard 200; its lead single  |Public_Enemy_No._1|Public_Enemy_No._1|  received a Grammy nomination for  |Best_Hard_Rock/Metal_Performance|Best_Hard_Rock/Metal_Performance| , but did not win.  Shortly after the album was released, Dave Mustaine stated that, after a four-year hiatus, there would be a new Gigantour tour in early 2012.  The lineup consisted of  |Motörhead|Motörhead| ,  |Volbeat|Volbeat| , and Lacuna Coil alongside Megadeth.  After the conclusion of Gigantour,  |Rob_Zombie|Rob_Zombie|  and Megadeth embarked on a nine-date co-headlining US tour in the summer of 2012.      Super ColliderCountdown to Extinction in honor of the albums 20th anniversary. To mark the occasion, Megadeth launched a tour in which the band performed the album live in its entirety.  One performance, filmed at the  |Pomona_Fox_Theater|Pomona_Fox_Theater| , was released as a live album,  Countdown to Extinction: Live , the following year.  Another track from Thirteen, Whose Life , was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the  |2013_Grammy_Awards|55Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards| , but lost to  |Halestorms|Halestorm| |Love_Bites|Love_Bites|  .           In August, Megadeth announced the recording of its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K.  At the start of 2013, Megadeth left  |Roadrunner_Records|Roadrunner_Records|  for Mustaines newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through  |Universal_Music_Group|Universal_Music_Group| .   The album,  Super Collider , was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the bands highest chart position since 1994s Youthanasia.  Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative.  Shortly after the release of Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist  |Jeff_Hanneman|Jeff_Hanneman| , which gave him a sense of mortality.  Mustaine elaborated: You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long theyre gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can.      The 2013 edition of Gigantour featured  |Black_Label_Society|Black_Label_Society| ,  |Hellyeah|Hellyeah| ,  |Device|Device| , and  |Newsted|Newsted|  as opening bands.  At the final show,  |Jason_Newsted|Jason_Newsted| , Metallicas former bassist, joined Megadeth onstage to perform Phantom Lord , a song Mustaine had co-written during his stint with Metallica.  Early in 2014, Megadeth was slated to play the  |Soundwave|Soundwave|  festival in Australia, but pulled out over a disagreement with tour promoter A.  J. Maddah concerning the bands sideshows with Newsted.   |Icon|Icon| , an eleven-song compilation of Megadeths Capitol-era material, was released as part of Universal Musics  |Icon_series|Icon|  in February.      Dystopia and upcoming sixteenth studio album     The band encountered several setbacks through the second half of 2014. The August concert in  |Tel_Aviv|Tel_Aviv|  was canceled due to an  |armed_conflict_between_Israel_and_Gaza|2014_Israel–Gaza_Conflict| .  Megadeth was scheduled to appear on  |Motörheads|Motörhead|  Motörboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaines complications following his cervical spine surgery.  In late November, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences.  Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music.  Mustaine said that one of the reasons for Brodericks and Drovers departure was the frustration caused by Megadeths fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza.  Tragically, former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza died from a heart attack on May 21, 2016 while performing with OHM at a  |jazz_club|The_Baked_Potato|  in Los Angeles.   |Lamb_of_God|Lamb_Of_God|  drummer  |Chris_Adler|Chris_Adler|  and guitarist  |Kiko_Loureiro|Kiko_Loureiro|  of  |Angra|Angra|  were brought in to perform on Megadeths fifteenth studio album.           In October 2015, Megadeth streamed Fatal Illusion off the album  Dystopia , which was released in January 2016.  In support of Dystopia, Megadeth embarked on a North American tour in February and March with  |Suicidal_Tendencies|Suicidal_Tendencies| ,  |Children_of_Bodom|Children_Of_Bodom|  and  |Havok|Havok|  .  Mustaine announced that Adler, who was performing with both Lamb of God and Megadeth, was no longer in the band due to scheduling conflicts between the two bands. He was replaced by  |Dirk_Verbeuren|Dirk_Verbeuren|  from  |Soilwork|Soilwork| , on Adlers recommendation.  A second US tour took place in September and October, with support from  |Amon_Amarth|Amon_Amarth| ,  |Suicidal_Tendencies|Suicidal_Tendencies| ,  |Metal_Church|Metal_Church| ,  and  |Butcher_Babies|Butcher_Babies| .      Asked about any further Big Four gigs, Mustaine called for the powers-that-be to help put together a new Big Four tour in 2017 as all the respective bands were promoting new albums.  Dystopias title track won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards , the bands first win after 12 nominations. Mustaine, Loureiro, Ellefson, and Verbeuren attended the ceremony; however, album drummer and award recipient Chris Adler did not. While accepting the award, the house band played Mustaines former band Metallicas Master of Puppets causing some controversy among fans.     The band joined with Scorpions for a co-headlining tour in the fall of 2017.     In June 2017 interview with No Brown M & Ms, Mustaine said that Megadeth would enter the studio at the end of the year to begin working on their sixteenth studio album. He explained, We plan on going back in the studio, were probably gonna go back in and start throwing some ideas around at the end of the year. Were thinking about November or December. A month later, Mustaine stated on Twitter that he has begun collecting ideas for the new Megadeth album, but stated that they would probably enter the studio in mid-2018 to begin recording it for a 2019 release.     On April 6, 2018, the band announced a re-issue of Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good! containing remastered versions of all songs and a re-cut version of These Boots being lyrically adjusted to Hazlewood s version, bonus discs also included rare live performances of songs off the album during Alice Coopers Live in the Flesh Tour. The re-issued album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! – The Final Kill, was released on June 8, 2018.     On September 25, 2018, Megadeth announced that they had launched its first-ever cruise called MegaCruise, which was set to take place in the Pacific Ocean in 2019. Two weeks later, it was announced that MegaCruise was due to sail on October 13, 2019 from Los Angeles and hit ports of San Diego and Ensenada before returning on October 18, and would include performances by heavy metal acts such as Anthrax , Testament , Overkill , Corrosion of Conformity , Queensrÿche , Armored Saint , Metal Church , Suicidal Tendencies , DragonForce , Doro , John 5 , Sacred Reich , Death Angel and Toothgrinder . Mustaine was not present at MegaCruise, due to his illness, nor did Megadeth perform at the event.     On November 6, 2018, Mustaine shared a video on his Instagram teasing a track from the bands sixteenth album, which was originally set for release in 2019. Megadeth announced on May 10, 2019 that they had entered a studio in Franklin, Tennessee to begin pre-production of the album, once again teaming up with Dystopia co-producer Chris Rakestraw.     On June 17, 2019, it was announced that several of Megadeths shows of that year would be cancelled due to Mustaine being diagnosed with throat cancer; of all the cancelled dates, the band was supposed to support Ozzy Osbourne on the North American leg of the latters No More Tours II , which had been postponed from the summer of 2019 to the next year, and Megadeth was replaced by Marilyn Manson . Despite Mustaines illness, the band vowed to continue working on their new album.     On July 17, 2019, Megadeth announced their partnership with Gimme Radio and Richard Childress Racing on the No. 2 Gimme Radio Chevrolet Camaro , to be driven by Xfinity Series driver Tyler Reddick at the New Hampshire 200 on July 20.     On August 21, 2019, it was announced that Megadeth would embark on their first tour since Mustaines illness in January and February 2020, supporting Five Finger Death Punch on the latters European tour.       Mustaine has made numerous inflammatory statements in the press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie  |Metallica:_Some_Kind_of_Monster|Metallica:_Some_Kind_Of_Monster| , in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.     During a live performance of Anarchy in the U.K. at a 1988 show in Antrim , Northern Ireland , Mustaine drunkenly and confusedly dedicated the song to the cause of giving Ireland back to the Irish! Before the final song, Mustaine said, This ones for the cause! Give Ireland back to the Irish! This elicited a riot and fighting between Catholics and Protestants among the audience. The band had to travel in a bulletproof bus back to Dublin . Mustaine later said that he had been misled by T-shirt bootleggers about the meaning of the expression the cause . This incident served as inspiration for the song Holy Wars... The Punishment Due .     Controversial and misinterpreted lyrics have caused complications for the band. In 1988, MTV deemed that the song In My Darkest Hour encouraged suicide and banned the video. The station banned the video for A Tout le Monde for the same reason, though Mustaine said the song was written from the perspective of a dying man saying his last words to his loved ones. According to him, MTV considered the videos for Skin o My Teeth and Symphony of Destruction a little bit too harsh and refused to play them.     During a world tour in 2001, the Malaysian government canceled the bands show in the nations capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the groups image and music. The government pointed the bands mascot Vic Rattlehead as inappropriate and told the members that they would be arrested if they performed. Dave Mustaine responded: I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it is admirable of them trying to protect the young people in the country. But it just shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem.     In 2003, after recovering from an arm injury that threatened to end his career, Mustaine became a born-again Christian. Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaines announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his conversion. In May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with extreme metal bands Rotting Christ and Dissection due to the bands anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.         In July 2004, Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 million in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York . Ellefson alleged that Mustaine short-changed him on profits including tour merchandise and publishing royalties. The suit was dismissed in 2005, and Mustaine filed a countersuit alleging that Ellefson had used the bands name in an advertisement for musical equipment; the suit was settled out of court.         Traditional heavy metal bands such as UFO , Black Sabbath , Budgie , new wave of British heavy metal bands such as Judas Priest , Motörhead , Iron Maiden , Diamond Head , and Venom , and punk rock bands such as the Sex Pistols and Ramones had a significant influence on Megadeths sound. Hard rock bands such as AC/DC , Led Zeppelin , and Scorpions https://loudwire.com/bands-who-influenced-megadeth/ were also influential on the groups guitar style. Although the music has roots in punk, university professor Jason Bivins wrote that Megadeth followed the basic blueprint of Motörhead and Iron Maiden. He described the style as a mix of the instrumental virtuosity of the NWOBHM with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk , while also drawing lyrical inspiration from the horror-obsessed punk band Misfits . Mustaine has also listed albums by the Beatles and David Bowie as recordings that influenced him.     Mustaine is the bands primary songwriter. He develops songs starting with a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes the central part of the song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the bands lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell .     The music of Megadeth and its underground metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, power chords , tremolo picking , and screeching lead guitar work; albums from this period were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeths music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and snarling vocals. When asked to describe Megadeths guitar style, Mustaine answered: When you go to a show and see a guitar player who just stands there, thats a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitars guts out. Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.   In 2017, David Ellefson talked in an interview about how the band recently started to use a lower tuning saying: its just natural with age, for singers it can be a struggle, so rather than quit, than not play, how do you work it around? Well, lets drop the guitars, lets find a way to work around it.     During the bands early days, Mustaine was the rhythm guitarist, while Chris Poland played lead. Although Poland performed only on Megadeths first two albums, music journalists Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist credit him with making the music more colorful because of his jazz influences. According to former  |Metal_Maniacs|Metal_Maniacs|  editor Jeff Wagner, the bands songwriting techniques peaked with the fourth album, Rust in Peace, which he described as a flurry of precision and fluidity, making good on Megadeths claim to being the worlds state-of-the-art speed metal band . Musicologist Glenn Pillsbury stated the guitar work on the album was a mixture of Mustaines controlled chaos and the technical brilliance of Marty Friedman. Studio efforts released in the mid- and late 1990s featured songs with compact structures and less complicated riffing.     Megadeths lyrics often focus on death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but occasionally deals with topics such as alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeths commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said that he wanted to write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations ; Mustaine criticized the organizations ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.       Having sold about 38 million units worldwide, Megadeth is one of the few bands from the 1980s American underground metal scene to have achieved mass commercial success.
