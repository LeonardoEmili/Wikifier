However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces, Schulenberg, David. Music of the Baroque. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. . to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature. or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes. Cooper, David. The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005. . In a few cases Petrie has given what is clearly a modal melody a key signature which suggests that it is actually in a minor key. For example, Banish Misfortune is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode.     Later on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common ; but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethovens very late piano sonatas.

In principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern ": null

If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.         In traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.     Similarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.     When the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.

The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.     If both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed . For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.     In key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.     The A which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff.
