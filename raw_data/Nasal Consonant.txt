               In  |phonetics|Phonetics| , a nasal, also called a nasal occlusive or nasal stop in contrast with an  |oral_stop|Stop_Consonant|  or  |nasalized_consonant|Nasalization| , is an  |occlusive|Occlusive| |_consonant|Consonant| |_produced|Manner_Of_Articulation|  with a lowered  |velum|Soft_Palate| , allowing air to escape freely through the nose. The vast majority of consonants are  |oral_consonants|Oral_Consonant| . Examples of nasals in  |English|English_Language|  are ,  and , in words such as nose, bring and mouth. Nasal occlusives are nearly universal in human languages. There are also other kinds of nasal consonants in some languages.       Nearly all nasal consonants are nasal occlusives, in which air escapes through the nose but not through the mouth, as it is blocked by the lips or tongue. The oral cavity still acts as a resonance chamber for the sound. Rarely, non-occlusive consonants may be  |nasalized|Nasalization| .     Most nasals are  |voiced|Voice| , and in fact, the nasal sounds  and  are among the most common sounds cross-linguistically. Voiceless nasals occur in a few languages such as  |Burmese|Burmese_Language| ,  |Welsh|Welsh_Language| ,  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language|  and  |Guaraní|Guaraní_Language| .      In terms of acoustics, nasals are  |sonorants|Sonorant| , which means that they do not significantly restrict the escape of air . However, nasals are also  |obstruents|Obstruent|  in their articulation because the flow of air through the mouth is blocked. This duality, a sonorant airflow through the nose along with an obstruction in the mouth, means that nasal occlusives behave both like sonorants and like obstruents. For example, nasals tend to pattern with other sonorants such as  and , but in many languages, they may develop from or into stops.     Acoustically, nasals have bands of energy at around 200 and 2,000  Hz.        1.  The symbol  is commonly used to represent the  |dental|Dental_Consonant|  nasal as well, rather than , as it is rarely distinguished from the  |alveolar|Alveolar_Consonant|  nasal.     Examples of languages containing nasal occlusives:     The voiced retroflex nasal is  is a common sound in  |Languages_of_India|Languages_Of_India| .     The voiced palatal nasal  is a common sound in  |European_languages|Languages_Of_Europe| , such as:  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  ,  |French|French_Language|  and  |Italian|Italian_Language|  ,  |Catalan|Catalan_Language|  and  |Hungarian|Hungarian_Language|  ,  |Czech|Czech_Language|  and  |Slovak|Slovak_Language|  ,  |Polish|Polish_Language|  ,  |Occitan|Occitan_Language|  and  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  , and  |Modern_Greek|Modern_Greek|  .     Many  |Germanic_languages|Germanic_Languages| , including  |German|German_Language| ,  |Dutch|Dutch_Language| ,  |English|English_Language|  and  |Swedish|Swedish_Language| , as well as  |varieties_of_Chinese|Varieties_Of_Chinese|  such as  |Mandarin|Standard_Chinese|  and  |Cantonese|Cantonese| , have ,  and .  |Tamil|Tamil_Language|  has a six-fold distinction between , , , ,  and  .     Catalan,  |Occitan|Occitan_Language| , Spanish, and Italian have , ,  as  |phonemes|Phoneme| , and  and  as allophones. Nevertheless, in several  |American_dialects_of_Spanish|Spanish_Language_In_The_Americas| , there is no palatal nasal but only a palatalized nasal, , as in English canyon.     In  |Brazilian_Portuguese|Brazilian_Portuguese|  and  |Angolan_Portuguese|Angolan_Portuguese|  , written , is typically pronounced as , a  |nasal_palatal_approximant|Nasal_Palatal_Approximant| , a nasal glide . Semivowels in  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  often nasalize before and always after nasal vowels, resulting in  and . What would be  |coda|Syllablecoda|  nasal occlusives in other  |West_Iberian_languages|West_Iberian_Languages|  is only slightly pronounced before  |dental_consonants|Dental_Consonant| . Outside this environment the nasality is spread over the vowel or become a nasal diphthong .     The  |Japanese|Japanese_Language| |_syllabary_kana|Kana|  ん, typically romanized as n and occasionally m, can manifest as one of several different nasal consonants depending on what consonant follows it; this allophone, colloquially written in IPA as , is known as the  |moraic_nasal|Japanese_Phonologymoraic_Nasal| , per the languages moraic structure.      |Welsh|Welsh_Language|  has a set of voiceless nasals, and which occur predominantly as a result of  |nasal_mutation|Nasal_Mutation|  of their voiced counterparts .     The  |Mapos_Buang|Mapos_Buang_Language|  language of New Guinea has a phonemic uvular nasal, which contrasts with a velar nasal. It is extremely rare for a language to have as a phoneme.      |Yanyuwa|Yanyuwa_Language|  is highly unusual in that it has a seven-way distinction between , , and . This may be the only language in existence that contrasts nasals at seven distinct points of articulation.     The term nasal occlusive is generally abbreviated to nasal. However, there are also nasalized fricatives, nasalized flaps,  |nasal_glides|Nasal_Glide| , and  |nasal_vowels|Nasal_Vowel| , as in French, Portuguese, and Polish. In the  |IPA|Help_Ipa| , nasal vowels and nasalized consonants are indicated by placing a tilde over the vowel or consonant in question: French sang , Portuguese bom .       A few languages have phonemic voiceless nasal occlusives. Among them are  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language| ,  |Faroese|Faroese_Language| ,  |Burmese|Burmese_Language| ,  |Jalapa_Mazatec|Jalapa_Mazatec| ,  |Kildin_Sami|Kildin_Sami| ,  |Welsh|Welsh_Language| , and  |Central_Alaskan_Yupik|Central_Alaskan_Yupik_Language| .  |Iaai|Iaai_Language|  of New Caledonia has an unusually large number of them, with , along with a number of  |voiceless_approximants|Voiceless_Approximant| .       Ladefoged and Maddieson distinguish purely nasal consonants, the nasal occlusives such as m n ng in which the airflow is purely nasal, from partial nasal consonants such as  prenasalized consonant s and nasal  |pre_stopped_consonants|Pre_Stopped_Consonant| , which are nasal for only part of their duration, as well as from nasalized consonants, which have simultaneous oral and nasal airflow.  In some languages, such as  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language| , a nasal consonant may have occlusive and non-occlusive  |allophones|Allophone| . In general, therefore, a nasal consonant may be:     a nasal occlusive, such as English m, n, ng  |nasal_approximant|Nasal_Approximant| , as in nh in some  |Portuguese_dialects|Portuguese_Phonology| |_flap|Flap_Consonant| , such as the nasal  |retroflex_lateral_flap|Retroflex_Lateral_Flap|  in  |Pashto|Pashto| |nasal_clicks|Nasal_Click|  such as  |Zulu|Zulu_Language|  nq, nx, nc  |nasalized|Nasalization|  consonants, such as  |nasalized_fricatives|Fricative_Consonantnasalized_Fricatives|      Languages without nasals. Accessed on 2008-09-15. contain no phonemically distinctive nasals. This led Ferguson to assume that all languages have at least one primary nasal occlusive. However, there are exceptions.       When a language is claimed to lack nasals altogether, as with several  |Niger–Congo_languages|Niger–Congo_Languages|  These languages lie in a band from western Liberia to southeastern Nigeria, and north to southern Burkina. They include:   Liberia: Kpelle ; Grebo, Klao   Burkina Faso: Bwamu   Ivory Coast: Dan, Guro-Yaoure, Wan-Mwan, Gban/Gagu, Tura ; Senadi/Senufo ; Nyabwa, Wè ; Ebrié, Avikam, Abure   Ghana: Abron, Akan, Ewe   Benin: Gen, Fon   Nigeria: Mbaise Igbo, Ikwere   CAR: Yakoma    or the  |Pirahã_language|Pirahã_Language|  of the Amazon, nasal and non-nasal or prenasalized consonants usually alternate  |allophonically|Allophone| , and it is a theoretical claim on the part of the individual linguist that the nasal is not the basic form of the consonant. In the case of some Niger–Congo languages, for example, nasals occur before only nasal vowels. Since nasal vowels are phonemic, it simplifies the picture somewhat to assume that nasalization in occlusives is allophonic. There is then a second step in claiming that nasal vowels nasalize oral occlusives, rather than oral vowels denasalizing nasal occlusives, that is, whether  are phonemically  without full nasals, or  without prenasalized stops. Postulating underlying oral or prenasalized stops rather than true nasals helps to explain the apparent instability of nasal correspondences throughout Niger–Congo compared with, for example, Indo-European. As noted by  |Kay_Williamson|Kay_Williamson|  .     This analysis comes at the expense, in some languages, of postulating either a single nasal consonant that can only be syllabic, or a larger set of nasal vowels than oral vowels, both typologically odd situations. The way such a situation could develop is illustrated by a  |Jukunoid_language|Jukunoid_Language| ,  |Wukari|Wukari_Language| . Wukari allows oral vowels in syllables like ba, mba and nasal vowels in bã, mã, suggesting that nasals become prenasalized stops before oral vowels. Historically, however, mb became mm before nasal vowels, and then reduced to m, leaving the current asymmetric distribution. Larry Hyman, 1975. Nasal states and nasal processes. In Nasalfest: Papers from a Symposium on Nasals and Nasalization, pp. 249–264     In older speakers of the  |Tlingit_language|Tlingit_Language| ,  and  are allophones. Tlingit is usually described as having an unusual, perhaps unique lack of  despite having five  |lateral_obstruents|Lateral_Consonant| ; the older generation could be argued to have  but at the expense of having no nasals.       Several of languages surrounding  |Puget_Sound|Puget_Sound| , such as  |Quileute|Quileute_Language|  ,  |Lushootseed|Lushootseed|  , and  |Makah|Makah_Language|  , are truly without any nasalization whatsoever, in consonants or vowels, except in special speech registers such as  |baby_talk|Baby_Talk|  or the archaic speech of mythological figures . This is an  |areal_feature|Areal_Feature| , only a few hundred years old, where nasals became voiced stops  after colonial contact. For example,  |Snohomish|Snohomish|  is currently pronounced sdohobish, but was transcribed with nasals in the first English-language records.     The only other places in the world where this is known to occur is in Melanesia. In the central dialect of the  |Rotokas_language|Rotokas_Language|  of Bougainville Island, nasals are only used when imitating foreign accents. The  |Lakes_Plain_languages|Lakes_Plain_Languages|  of West Irian are similar.     The unconditioned loss of nasals, as in Puget Sound, is unusual. However, currently in  |Korean|Korean_Language| , word-initial  and  are shifting to  and . This started out in nonstandard dialects and was restricted to the beginning of prosodic units  .
