   In  |phonetics|Phonetics| , rhotic consonants, or R-like sounds, are  |liquid_consonants|Liquid_Consonant|  that are traditionally represented  |orthographically|Orthography|  by symbols derived from the  |Greek|Greek_Alphabet|  letter  |rho|Rho| , including  |_|R|  in the  |Latin_script|Latin_Script|  and  |_|Er|  in the  |Cyrillic_script|Cyrillic_Script| .  They are transcribed in the  |International_Phonetic_Alphabet|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  by upper- or lower-case variants of Roman , , , , , , , , and .     This class of sounds is difficult to characterise phonetically; from a phonetic standpoint, there is no single articulatory  |correlate|Correlate|   common to rhotic consonants.  Rhotics have instead been found to carry out similar phonological functions or to have certain similar phonological features across different languages.  Although some have been found to share certain acoustic peculiarities, such as a lowered third  |formant|Formant| , further study has revealed that this does not hold true across different languages. For example, the acoustic quality of lowered third formants pertains almost exclusively to American varieties of  |English|English_Language| . Being R-like is an elusive and ambiguous concept phonetically and the same sounds that function as rhotics in some systems may pattern with  |fricatives|Fricative| ,  |semivowels|Approximant|  or even stops in others—for example, the  |alveolar_tap|Alveolar_Tap|  is a rhotic consonant in many languages; but in American English it is an allophone of the stop phoneme /t/, as in water. It is likely that rhotics, then, are not a phonetically natural class, but a phonological one instead.      Some languages have rhotic and non-rhotic varieties, which differ in the incidence of rhotic consonants. In  |non_rhotic_accents_of_English|Rhoticity_In_English| , /r/ is not pronounced unless it is followed directly by a vowel.       The most typical rhotic sounds found in the worlds languages are the following:       Trill   vibrates, closing and opening the air passage. If a trill is made with the tip of the tongue against the upper gum, it is called an apical  alveolar trill ; the  |IPA|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  symbol for this sound is . Most non-alveolar trills, such as the  |bilabial_one|Bilabial_Trill| , however, are not considered rhotic.   Many languages, such as  |Bulgarian|Bulgarian_Language| ,  |Swedish|Swedish_Language| ,  |Norwegian|Norwegian_Language| ,  |Frisian|Frisian_Languages| ,  |Italian|Italian_Language| ,  |Spanish|Spanish_Language| ,  |Russian|Russian_Language| ,  |Polish|Polish_Language| ,  |Ukrainian|Ukrainian_Language| ,  |Dutch|Dutch_Language|  and most  |Occitan_variants|Occitan_Language| , use trilled rhotics. In the  |English|English_Language| -speaking world, the stereotyped  |Scottish|Scottish_English|  rolled  is well known. The stage pronunciation of  |German|German_Language|  specifies the alveolar trill for clarity. Rare kinds of trills include  |Czech|Czech_Language|     and  |Welsh|Welsh_Phonology|    .   The  uvular trill  is another kind of rhotic trill; see below for more.    Tap or flap  : Similar to a trill, but involving just one brief interruption of airflow. In many languages taps are used as reduced variants of trills, especially in fast speech. However, in Spanish, for example, taps and trills contrast, as in pero  versus perro  . Also flaps are used as basic rhotics in  |Japanese|Japanese_Language|  and  |Korean|Korean_Language|  languages. In  |Australian_English|Australian_English|  and some  |American|American_English|  dialects of English, flaps do not function as rhotics but are realizations of intervocalic apical stops . The IPA symbol for this sound is .    Alveolar  or  retroflex approximant  : The front part of the tongue approaches the upper gum, or the tongue-tip is curled back towards the roof of the mouth . No or little friction can be heard, and there is no momentary closure of the vocal tract. The IPA symbol for the alveolar approximant is  and the symbol for the retroflex approximant is . There is a distinction between an unrounded retroflex approximant and a rounded variety that probably could have been found in  |Anglo_Saxon|Old_English_Language|  and even to this day in some dialects of English, where the orthographic key is r for the unrounded version and usually wr for the rounded version . Also used as a rhotic in some dialects of Armenian, Dutch, German, Brazilian Portuguese .    Uvular   |European_Portuguese|Portuguese_Language| ,  |French|French_Language| ,  |German|German_Language| ,  |Danish|Danish_Language| , and  |Modern_Hebrew|Modern_Hebrew|    are variants of this rhotic. If fricative, the sound is often impressionistically described as harsh or grating. This includes the  |voiced_uvular_fricative|Voiced_Uvular_Fricative| ,  |voiceless_uvular_fricative|Voiceless_Uvular_Fricative| , and  |uvular_trill|Uvular_Trill| . In northern England, there were accents that once employed a uvular R, which was called a burr .     developmental non-rhotic Rs |labialization|R_Labialization|  to  of their Rs, which is between idiosyncratic and dialectal , and since it includes some  |RP|Received_Pronunciation|  speakers, somewhat prestigious. Apart from English, in all  |Brazilian_Portuguese|Brazilian_Portuguese|  dialects the  phoneme, or , may be actually realized as other, traditionally non-rhotic,  |fricatives|Fricative_Consonant|    , unless it occurs single between vowels, being so realized as a dental, alveolar, postalveolar or  |retroflex_flap|Retroflex_Flap| . In the syllable coda, it varies individually as a fricative, a flap or an approximant, though fricatives are ubiquitous in the  |Northern|North_Region_Brazil|  and  |Northeastern|Northeast_Region_Brazil|  regions and all states of  |Southeastern_Brazil|Southeast_Region_Brazil|  but  |São_Paulo|São_Paulo|  and surrounding areas. The total inventory of  allophones is rather long, or up to , the latter eight being particularly common, while none of them except archaic , that contrast with the flap in all positions, may occur alone in a given dialect. Few dialects, such as  |sulista|South_Region_Brazil|  and  |fluminense|Rio_De_Janeiro| , give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants. Additionally, some other languages and variants, such as  |Haitian_Creole|Haitian_Creole|  and Timorese Portuguese use velar and glottal fricatives instead of traditional rhotics, too. In  |Vietnamese|Vietnamese_Phonology| , depending on dialect, the rhotic can occur as ,  or . In  |modern_Mandarin_Chinese|Standard_Chinese_Phonology| , the phoneme  is represented as  in  |Hanyu_Pinyin|Hanyu_Pinyin| , resembles the rhotics in other languages in realization, thus, it can be considered a rhotic consonant.       In broad transcription rhotics are usually symbolised as  unless there are two or more types of rhotic in the same language; for example, most  |Australian_Aboriginal_languages|Australian_Aboriginal_Languages| , which contrast approximant  and trill , use the symbols r and rr respectively. The IPA has a full set of different symbols which can be used whenever more phonetic precision is required: an r rotated 180°  for the alveolar approximant, a small capital R  for the uvular trill, and a flipped small capital R  for the voiced uvular fricative or approximant.     The fact that the sounds conventionally classified as rhotics vary greatly in both place and manner in terms of articulation, and also in their acoustic characteristics, has led several linguists to investigate what, if anything, they have in common that justifies grouping them together . One suggestion that has been made is that each member of the class of rhotics shares certain properties with other members of the class, but not necessarily the same properties with all; in this case, rhotics have a  |family_resemblance|Family_Resemblance|  with each other rather than a strict set of shared properties. Another suggestion is that rhotics are defined by their behaviour on the  |sonority_hierarchy|Sonority_Hierarchy| , namely, that a rhotic is any sound that patterns as being more sonorous than a  |lateral_consonant|Lateral_Consonant|  but less sonorous than a  |vowel|Vowel| . The potential for variation within the class of rhotics makes them a popular area for research in sociolinguistics.                English has rhotic and non-rhotic accents. Rhotic speakers pronounce a historical  in all instances, while non-rhotic speakers only pronounce  before or between vowels.       The rhotic consonant is dropped or vocalized under similar conditions in other Germanic languages, notably  |German|German_Language| ,  |Danish|Danish_Language|  and  |Dutch|Dutch_Language|  from the eastern Netherlands and southern  |Sweden|Sweden|  . In most varieties of German ,  in the  |syllable_coda|Syllable_Coda|  is frequently realized as a vowel or a  |semivowel|Semivowel| ,  or . In the traditional standard pronunciation, this happens only in the unstressed ending -er and after long vowels: for example besser , sehr . In common speech, the vocalization is usual after short vowels as well, and additional contractions may occur: for example Dorn  ~ , hart  ~ . Similarly, Danish  after a vowel is, unless followed by a stressed vowel, either pronounced   or merged with the preceding vowel while usually influencing its  |vowel_quality|Vowel_Quality|   .       In  |Asturian|Asturian_Language| , word final  is always lost in infinitives if they are followed by an enclitic pronoun, and this is reflected in the writing; e.g. The infinitive form dar  plus the 3rd plural dative pronoun -yos da-yos  or the accusative form los dalos  . This will happen even in  |southern_dialects|Leonese_Language|  where the infinitive form will be dare , and both the  and the vowel will drop . However, most of the speakers also drop the rhotics in the infinitive before a lateral consonant of a different word, and this doesnt show in the writing. e.g. dar los dos  . This doesnt occur in the middle of words. e.g. the name Carlos .       In some  |Catalan|Catalan_Language|  dialects, word final  is lost in coda position not only in suffixes on nouns and adjectives denoting the masculine singular and plural  but also in the -ar, -er, -ir suffixes of infinitives; e.g. forner  baker , forners , fer  to do , lluir  to shine, to look good . However, rhotics are recovered when followed by the feminine suffix -a , and when infinitives have single or multiple  |enclitic|Clitic|  pronouns ; e.g. fornera  baker , fer-lo  to do it , fer-ho  to do it/that/so , lluir-se  to excel, to show off .       Final R is generally not pronounced in words ending in -er. The R in parce que is not pronounced in informal speech in French.       In  |Indonesian|Indonesian_Language| , which is a form of  |Malay|Malay_Language| , the final  is pronounced, while it is not in the various forms of Malay spoken on the  |Malay_Peninsula|Malay_Peninsula| .       Historical final  has been lost from all  |Khmer|Khmer_Language|  dialects but Northern.       In some dialects of  |Brazilian_Portuguese|Brazilian_Portuguese| ,  is unpronounced or aspirated. This occurs most frequently with verbs in the  |infinitive|Infinitive| , which is always indicated by a word-final . In some states, however, it happens mostly with any  when preceding a consonant. The  |Carioca|Carioca|  accent  is notable for this.       Among the  |Spanish_dialects|Spanish_Dialects_And_Varieties| ,  |Andalusian_Spanish|Andalusian_Spanish| ,  |Caribbean_Spanish|Caribbean_Spanish|  ,  |Castúo|Castúo|  , Northern  |Colombian_Spanish|Colombian_Spanish|   and the  |Argentine_dialect|Languages_Of_Argentinaspanish|  spoken in the  |Tucumán|Tucumán_Province|  province may have an unpronounced word-final , especially in infinitives, which mirrors the situation in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese. However, in Antillean Caribbean forms, word-final  in infinitives and non-infinitives is often in free variation with word-final  and may relax to the point of being articulated as .       L and R are used interchangeably in  |Thai|Thai_Language| . That is, Thai speakers generally replace an R with an L and when they hear L they may write R .        Among the  |Turkic_languages|Turkic_Languages| ,  |Turkish|Turkish_Language|  displays more or less the same feature, as syllable-final  is dropped. For example, it is very common to hear phrases like gidiyo instead of gidiyor , in spoken  |Turkish|Turkish_Language| . In some parts of  |Turkey|Turkey| , e.g.  |Kastamonu|Kastamonu| , the syllable-final  is almost never pronounced, e.g. gidiya instead of gidiyor , gide instead of gider . In gide ,  |the_preceding_vowel_e_is_lengthened|Compensatory_Lengthening|  and pronounced somewhat between an e and a.       Among the  |Turkic_languages|Turkic_Languages| ,  |Uyghur|Uyghur_Language|  displays more or less the same feature, as syllable-final  is dropped, while  |the_preceding_vowel_is_lengthened|Compensatory_Lengthening| Uyghurlar  ‘ |Uyghurs|Uyghur_People| ’. The  may, however, sometimes be pronounced in unusually careful or pedantic speech; in such cases, it is often  |mistakenly_inserted|Linking_And_Intrusive_R|  after long vowels even when there is no phonemic  there.       Similarly in  |Yaqui|Yaqui_Language| , an indigenous language of northern  |Mexico|Mexico| , intervocalic or syllable-final  is often dropped with lengthening of the previous vowel: pariseo becomes , sewaro becomes .       Lacid, whose exonyms in various literature include Lashi, Lachik, Lechi, and Leqi, is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by the Lacid people. There are various reports of their population size ranging from 30,000 to 60,000 people. The majority are in Myanmar but there are also small groups located in China and Thailand. Noftz 2017, A Literature Review on Segments in Lacid Noftz reports finding an example of a rhotic alveolar fricative in Lacid while doing phonological research at Payap University in Thailand in 2015. He was not able to continue his research and expressed the need for further examination of the segment to verify his results. It is postulated that the segment is a remnant of the rhotic fricative in Proto-Tibeto-Burman. A Literature Review on Segments in Lachid , Robert Noftz, 2017       The Shekaki accent of the Kurmanji dialect of Kurdish is non-rhotic, that is the postvocalic flap r is not pronounced but the trill R is. When r is omitted, a compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel takes place. For example:   sar is pronounced /saː/   torr .
