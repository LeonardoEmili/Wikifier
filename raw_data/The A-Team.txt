              The A-Team is an American  |action_adventure|Adventure_Film|  television series that ran on  |NBC|Nbc|  from 1983 to 1987 about former members of a fictitious  |United_States_Army_Special_Forces|Special_Forces|  unit. The members, after being  |court_martial|Court_Martial| ed for a crime they didnt commit , escaped from  |military_prison|Military_Prison|  and, while still on the run, worked as  |soldiers_of_fortune|Mercenary| . The series was created by  |Stephen_J_Cannell|Stephen_J_Cannell|  and  |Frank_Lupo|Frank_Lupo| . A  |feature_film|The_A_Team|  based on the series was released by  |20th_Century_Fox|20Th_Century_Fox|  in 2010.       The A-Team was created by writers and producers  |Stephen_J_Cannell|Stephen_J_Cannell|  and  |Frank_Lupo|Frank_Lupo|  at the behest of  |Brandon_Tartikoff|Brandon_Tartikoff| , NBCs Entertainment president. Cannell was fired from  |ABC|American_Broadcasting_Company|  in the early 1980s, after failing to produce a hit show for the network, and was hired by NBC; his first project was The A-Team.  |Brandon_Tartikoff|Brandon_Tartikoff|  pitched the series to Cannell as a combination of  The Dirty Dozen ,  Mission Impossible ,  The Magnificent Seven ,  Mad Max  and  Hill Street Blues , with  |Mr_T|Mr_T|  driving the car .    Stephen J. Cannell on The A-Team Season Five DVD boxset.     The A-Team was not generally expected to become a hit, although Stephen J. Cannell has said that  |George_Peppard|George_Peppard|  suggested it would be a huge hit before we ever turned on a camera .  The show became very popular; the first regular episode, which aired after  |Super_Bowl_XVII|Super_Bowl_Xvii|  on January 30, 1983, reached 26.4% of the television audience, placing fourth in the top 10  |Nielsen_rated|Nielsen_Ratings|  shows.      The show remains prominent in  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture|  for its  |cartoon|Cartoon| ish violence , formulaic episodes, its characters ability to form weaponry and vehicles out of old parts, and its distinctive theme tune. The show boosted the career of  |Mr_T|Mr_T| , who portrayed the character of  |B_A_Baracus|B_A_Baracus| , around whom the show was initially conceived.  Bring Back... The A-Team , Mr. T.

The term  |A_Team|A_Team|  is a nickname coined for  |U_S_Special_Forces|Green_Berets|  Operational Detachments Alpha during the Vietnam War. The  |US_Army_Special_Forces|Us_Army_Special_Forces|  still uses the term ODA for their 12-man direct operations teams.     In a 2003 Yahoo! survey of 1,000 television viewers, The A-Team was voted the oldie television show viewers would most like to see revived, beating out such popular television series from the 1980s as  The Dukes of Hazzard  and  Knight Rider . A-Team is viewers most-wanted oldie for prime-time revival by Matthew Beard in Independent, The , published on October 23, 2003.            The A-Team is a naturally episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure. In describing the ratings drop that occurred during the shows fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome .  Similarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots stunningly simple in a 2006 article for  The Express  , citing such recurring elements as BAs fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items .  The show became emblematic of this kind of fit-for-TV warfare due to its depiction of high-octane  |combat|Combat|  scenes, with lethal weapons, wherein the participants are never killed and rarely seriously injured .     As the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the shows final season in 1986– |87|1987_In_American_Television|  in a bid to win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by  |Robert_Vaughn|Robert_Vaughn| , propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie Dishpan Man Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while  |Eddie_Velez|Eddie_Velez|  and  |Robert_Vaughn|Robert_Vaughn|  received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of  Mission: Impossible , and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. In what was supposed to be the final episode,  |The_Grey_Team|The_Grey_Team|  , Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, Fini .       During the Vietnam War, the A-Team were members of the  |5th_Special_Forces_Group|5Th_Special_Forces_Group|  . In the episode  |Bad_Time_on_the_Border|Bad_Time_On_The_Border|  , Colonel John Hannibal Smith, portrayed by George Peppard, indicated that the A-Team were ex-Green Berets . During the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , the A-Teams  |commanding_officer|Commanding_Officer| , Colonel Morrison, gave them orders to rob the Bank of  |Hanoi|Hanoi|  to help bring the war to an end. They succeeded in their mission, but on their return to base four days after the end of the war, they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the  |Viet_Cong|National_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Vietnam| , and that his headquarters had been burned to the ground. This meant that the proof that the A-Team members were  |acting_under_orders|Superior_Orders|  had been destroyed. They were arrested, and imprisoned at  |Fort_Bragg|Fort_Bragg| , from which they quickly escaped before standing trial.     The origin of the A-Team is directly linked to the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , during which the team formed. The shows introduction in the first four seasons mentions this, accompanied by images of soldiers coming out of a helicopter in an area resembling a forest or jungle. Besides this, The A-Team would occasionally feature an episode in which the team came across an old ally or enemy from those war days. For example, the first seasons final episode  |A_Nice_Place_To_Visit|A_Nice_Place_To_Visit|  revolved around the team traveling to a small town to honor a fallen comrade and end up avenging his death, and in season twos  |Recipe_For_Heavy_Bread|Recipe_For_Heavy_Bread|  , a chance encounter leads the team to meet both the POW cook who helped them during the war, and the American officer who sold his unit out.     An article in the  New Statesman  published shortly after the premiere of The A-Team in the United Kingdom, also pointed out The A-Teams connection to the Vietnam War, characterizing it as the representation of the idealization of the Vietnam War, and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture.      One of the teams primary antagonists, Col. Roderick Decker , had his past linked back to the Vietnam War, in which he and Hannibal had come to fisticuffs in the DOOM Club .  |When_You_Comin_Back_Range_Rider?_|When_You_Comin_Back_Range_Rider?|  , broadcast on October 25, 1983. At other times, members of the team would refer back to a certain tactic used during the War, which would be relevant to the teams present predicament. Often, Hannibal would refer to such a tactic, after which the other members of the team would complain about its failure during the War. This was also used to refer to some of Faces past accomplishments in scamming items for the team, such as in the first-season episode  |Holiday_In_The_Hills|Holiday_In_The_Hills|  , in which Murdock fondly remembers Face being able to secure a 53 Cadillac while in the Vietnam jungle.     The teams ties to the Vietnam War were referred to again in the fourth-season finale,  |The_Sound_of_Thunder|The_Sound_Of_Thunder|  , in which the team is introduced to Tia , a war orphan and daughter of fourth season antagonist General Fulbright. Returning to Vietnam, Fulbright is shot in the back and gives his last words as he dies. The 2006 documentary Bring Back The A-Team joked that the scene lasted seven and a half minutes, but his death actually took a little over a minute. His murderer, a Vietnamese colonel, is killed in retaliation. Tia then returns with the team to the United States . This episode is notable for having one of the shows few truly serious dramatic moments, with each team member privately reminiscing on their war experiences, intercut with news footage from the war with  |Barry_McGuires|Barry_Mcguire|   Eve of Destruction  playing in the background.     The shows ties to the Vietnam War are fully dealt with in the opening arc of the fifth season, dubbed The Court-Martial , in which the team is finally court-martialed for the robbery of the bank of  |Hanoi|Hanoi| . The character of Roderick Decker makes a return on the witness stand, and various newly introduced characters from the A-Teams past also make appearances. The team, after a string of setbacks, decides to plead guilty to the crime and they are sentenced to be executed. They escape this fate and come to work for a General Hunt Stockwell, leading into the remainder of the fifth season.            The show ran for five seasons on the  |NBC|Nbc|  television network, from January 23, 1983 to December 30, 1986 , for a total of 98 episodes.               The A-Team revolves around the four members of a former commando outfit, now mercenaries. Their leader is Lieutenant Colonel/Colonel  |John_Hannibal_Smith|John_Hannibal_Smith|  , whose plans tend to be unorthodox but effective. Lieutenant  |Templeton_Peck|Templeton_Peck|  , usually called Face or Faceman , is a smooth-talking con man who serves as the teams appropriator of vehicles and other useful items, as well as the teams second-in-command. The teams pilot is Captain  |H_M_Howling_Mad_Murdock|Howling_Mad_Murdock|  , who has been declared insane and lives in a  |Veterans_Administration|United_States_Department_Of_Veterans_Affairs|  mental institution for the shows first four seasons. Finally, there is the teams strong man, mechanic and Sergeant First Class  |Bosco_B_A_or_Bad_Attitude_Baracus|B_A_Baracus|  .     The team belonged to the 5th Special Forces as seen in the left side shoulder patch on Hannibals uniform in the episode A Nice Place to Visit. A patch on Hannibals uniform on the right shoulder in the episode  |A_Nice_Place_To_Visit|A_Nice_Place_To_Visit|  indicates he belonged to the  |101st_Airborne|101St_Airborne|  during a prior combat assignment, but that patch was replaced by the 1st Air Cavalry Division patch in the episode  |Trial_by_Fire|Trial_By_Fire|  . The patch worn on the left sleeve according to uniform wear in the Army is the current assignment of the person wearing it and in the episode A Nice Place to Visit shows that the team was assigned to the Special Forces with a tab Airborne over the shoulder patch. Also their berets in that episode are green and have the tab of the 5th Special Forces in Vietnam on them. In the episode  |West_Coast_Turnaround|West_Coast_Turnaround|  , Hannibal stated they were with the 5th Special Forces Group. Then, in episode  |Bad_Time_on_the_Border|Bad_Time_On_The_Border|  , Hannibal refers to his friends as ex-Green Berets . Though the name they have adopted comes from the A-Teams , the nickname coined for Special Forces Operational Detachments Alpha, these detachments usually consisted of twelve members; whether the four were considered a detachment of their own or had once had eight compatriots who were killed in action was never revealed. In the episode A Nice Place to Visit Ray Brenner is stated to have been a Major and part of Hannibals team in Vietnam.     For its first season and the first half of the second season, the team was assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen . In the second half of the second season, Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker . The character of Tia , a Vietnam war orphan now living in the United States, was meant to join the Team in the fifth season, For NBC, Trouble At A-Team,  The New York Times , May 18, 1986, written by Aljean Harmetz. but she was replaced by Frankie Santana , who served as the teams special effects expert. Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth season after its second episode.     During their adventures, the A-Team was constantly met by opposition from the  |Military_Police|Military_Police_Corps| . In the shows first season, the MPs were led by Colonel Francis Lynch , but he was replaced for the second, third, and earlier fourth season by Colonel Roderick Decker  and his aide Captain Crane . Lynch returned for one episode in the shows third season  but was not seen after. Decker was also briefly replaced by a Colonel Briggs  in the third season for one episode  when LeGault was unavailable, but returned shortly after. For the latter portion of the shows fourth season, the team was hunted by General Harlan Bull Fulbright , who would later hire the A-Team to find Tia in the season four finale, during which Fulbright was killed.     The fifth season introduced General Hunt Stockwell  who, while serving as the teams primary antagonist, was also the teams boss and joined them on several missions. He was often assisted by Carla .       John Hannibal Smith is a master of disguise. His most used disguise is Mr. Lee, the dry cleaner. This is one of the final parts of the client screening process, as he tells the client where to go in order to make full contact with the A-Team. He dresses most often in a tan safari jacket and black leather gloves. He also is constantly seen smoking a cigar. Hannibal carries either a  |Browning_Hi_Power|Browning_Hi_Power| ,  |Colt_M1911A1|Colt_M1911A1|  or a  |Smith_Wesson_Model_39|Smith_Wesson_Model_39|  as a sidearm, most often Mexican carried although he uses a holster when on missions. His catchphrase is I love it when a plan comes together . Often said, usually by B.A., to be on the jazz when in the fury of completing a mission.     Templeton Faceman Peck is a master of the persuasive arts. The teams scrounger, he can get virtually anything he sets his mind to, usually exploiting women with sympathy-appeal and flirtation. He grew up an orphan, and is not without integrity, as stated by Murdock in the episode  |Family_Reunion|Family_Reunion|  : He would rip the shirt off his back for you, and then scam one for himself. Faceman is also the A-Teams accountant. He dresses suavely, often appearing in suits. Faceman carries a  |Colt_Lawman_Mk_III|Colt_Trooperlawman|  revolver for protection, and drives a custom white 1984  |Corvette|Chevrolet_Corvette|  with red trim.     Bosco B.A. Baracus is the muscle for the A-Team, able to perform exceptional feats of strength. He is also the teams mechanic. Baracus affects a dislike for Murdock, calling him a crazy fool , but his true feelings of friendship are revealed when he prevents Murdock from drowning in his desire to live like a fish. Baracus also has a deep fear of flying, and the others usually have to trick and/or knock him out in order to get him on an aircraft. It is very rare that Baracus is awake while flying, and even rarer for him actually to consent to it. When he does, however, he then goes into a catatonic state. Baracus generally wears overalls and leopard or tiger print shirts in the early seasons, and wears a green jumpsuit in the later seasons. He is almost always seen with many gold chains and rings on every finger, and also wears a weightlifting belt. Baracus hairstyle is always in a mohawk-like cut. He drives a customized black GMC van that acts as the teams usual mode of transport.     H.M. Howling Mad Murdock is the A-Teams pilot, and can fly any kind of aircraft with considerable skill. However, due to a helicopter crash in Vietnam, Murdock apparently went insane. He lives in a Veterans Hospital in the mental wing. Whenever the rest of the team requires a pilot, they have to break him out of the hospital, generally using Faceman to do so. In Seasons 1–4, Murdock has a different pet, imaginary friend, or alter-ego in each episode. Whenever one of his pets or imaginary friends is killed by an enemy, Murdock snaps and takes revenge . Many times, when Baracus is mad at Murdock for being crazy, Hannibal will side with Murdock in a sympathetic way. Once he is discharged from the hospital in Season 5, Murdock has a different job each episode. Murdock usually wears a leather flight jacket, a baseball cap, and basketball sneakers.       Although the part of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind, NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor, instead. Therefore, in the pilot, Face was portrayed by  |Tim_Dunigan|Tim_Dunigan| , who was later replaced by Dirk Benedict, with the comment that Dunigan was too tall and too young .  According to Dunigan: I look even younger on camera than I am. So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school.       |Tia_Carrere|Tia_Carrere|  was intended to join the principal cast of the show in its fifth season after appearing in the season four finale, providing a tie to the teams inception during the war. Unfortunately for this plan, Carrere was under contract to  General Hospital , which prevented her from joining The A-Team. Her character was abruptly dropped as a result.     According to Mr. Ts account in Bring Back... The A-Team in 2006, the role of B. A. Baracus was written specifically for him. This is corroborated by Stephen J. Cannells own account of the initial concept proposed by Tartikoff.      |James_Coburn|James_Coburn| , who co-starred in  The Magnificent Seven , was considered for the role of Hannibal in The A-Team, while  |George_Peppard|George_Peppard|  was the original consideration for the role of Vin  in The Magnificent Seven.

The first regular episode , reached 26.4% of the television watching audience, placing fourth in the top 10 rated shows, according to the  |Nielsen_ratings|Nielsen_Ratings| . By March, The A-Team, now on its regular Tuesday timeslot, dropped to the eight spot, but rated a 20.5%.  During the  |sweeps|Sweeps|  week in May of that year, The A-Team dropped again but remained steady at 18.5%,  and rose to 18.8% during the second week of May sweeps.  These were the highest ratings NBC had achieved in five years.  During the second season, the ratings continued to soar, reaching third place in the twenty-highest rated programs, behind  Dallas  and  Simon & Simon , in January ,  while during the third season, it was beaten out only by four other NBC shows, including  The Cosby Show .     The fourth season saw The A-Team experience a dramatic fall in ratings, as it started to lose its position while television viewership increased. As such, the ratings, while stable, were relatively less. The season premiere ranked a 17.4% on the Nielsen Rating scale,  but after ratings quickly declined. In October, The A-Team had fallen to the 19th and by Super Bowl Night had fallen still to 29th the night on which the show had originally scored its first hit three years before.  For the remainder of its fourth season The A-Team managed to hang around the 20th spot, far from original top 10 position it had enjoyed during its first three seasons.     After four years on Tuesday, NBC decided to move The A-Team to a new timeslot on Friday for what would be its final season. Ratings continued to drop, and after seven episodes, The A-Team fell out of the top 50 altogether with a 13.3 Nielsen Rating.  In November 1986, NBC cancelled the series, declining to order the last nine episodes of what would have been a 22-episode season.              The series has achieved  |cult_status|Cult_Television|  through heavy  |syndication|Television_Syndication|  in the U.S. and internationally. It has also remained popular overseas, such as in the United Kingdom, since it was first shown in July 1983. It is airing on satellite and cable channel  |Esquire_Network|Esquire_Network| . The series was to begin airing over NBC-TVs  |OTA_digital_subchannel|Digital_Television|  network,  |Cozi_TV|Cozi_Tv| , in January 2016.  Forces TV started showing the series every weekday since October 17, 2016. The series has been airing in Spanish on Telemundo-TVs OTA digital subchannel network,  |TeleXitos|Telexitos|  since December 2014. The series is currently available through  |Starz|Starz| ,  |ELREY|Elrey| ,  |Tubi|Tubi| , and  |COZY_TV|Cozy_Tv| .       The A-Team has been broadcast all over the world; international response has been varied. In 1984, the main cast members of The A-Team, George Peppard, Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands. George Peppard was the first to receive the invitation and thus thought the invitation applied only to him. When the other cast members were also invited, Peppard declined, leaving only Mr. T, Benedict and Schultz to visit the Netherlands. As told by Dirk Benedict in  Jensen! , a Dutch talk show, broadcast on May 11, 2007. The immense turn-out for the stars was unforeseen, and they were forced to leave early as a security measure. A video was released with the present actors in which Dwight Schultz apologized and thanked everyone that had attended. Repeated showing on Jensen!, a Dutch talk show, broadcast on May 11, 2007.     In Australia The A-Team was broadcast on Channel Ten. From 2010  |7mate|7Mate|  has been showing reruns of show. The show was broadcast in New Zealand on TV2. In Brazil, the series was broadcast on  |SBT|Sistema_Brasileiro_De_Televisão|  from 1984 to 1989, later moving to  |Rede_Globo|Rede_Globo|  in the early 1990s. In the UK, the program was shown on  |ITV|Itv| , starting on Friday, July 22, 1983; when it returned for its second run it moved to Saturday evenings. The series continued to be repeated on ITV until 1994. The series was later repeated on  |UK_Gold|Uk_Gold|  from 1997 through 2007 at various times. It was also repeated on  |Bravo|Bravo|  from 1997 to 1999. It returned to the channel in 2008 until the channels closure in 2011. In 2017 the digital channel  |Spike|Spike|  began showing the series from the beginning.  |Channel_5|Channel_5|  also repeated it in 2017. Although ratings soared during its early seasons, many television critics described the show largely as cartoonish and thereby wrote the series off. Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes, most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans.     The show was a huge hit in Italy in the mid-1980s to the 1990s.                The violence presented in The A-Team is highly sanitized. People do not bleed or bruise when hit , nor do the members of the A-Team kill people. The results of violence were only ever presented when it was required for the script. In almost every car crash there is a short take showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck, even in helicopter crashes. However, more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season. According to Stephen J. Cannell, this part of the show did become a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of realism on purpose.  Bring Back... The A-Team , Stephen J. Cannell. Broadcast on May 18, 2006.     The show has been described as cartoonish and likened to  Tom and Jerry . Dean P. of the  Courier-Mail  described the violence in the show as hypocritical and that the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects.  Television reviewer  |Ric_Meyers|Ric_Meyers|  joked that the A-Team used  |antineutron|Antineutron|  bullets—they destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being .  |DeAndrea_William_L_|William_L_Deandrea|  . Encyclopedia Mysteriosa, p. 1. MacMillan, 1994, . According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue. Originally, The A-Teams status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Whos the Boss?  and  Growing Pains . John J. OConnor of  The New York Times  wrote in a 1986 article that ...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety .           During its tenure, the show was occasionally criticized for being sexist. These critiques were based on the notion that most female roles on the show were either a lead-in to the episodes plot, the recipient of Faces affections, or both. The only two regular female members of the cast, Melinda Culea and Marla Heasley did not have long tenures with the show. Both Culea and Heasley had been brought in by the network and producers to stem these critiques, hoping that a female character would properly balance the otherwise all-male cast.  Bring Back... The A-Team ,  |Marla_Heasley|Marla_Heasley| . Broadcast on May 18, 2006. Culea was fired during the second season because of creative differences between her and the shows writers; she wanted more lines and more action scenes.  Bring Back... The A-Team ,  |Dirk_Benedict|Dirk_Benedict| . Broadcast on May 18, 2006. Culeas character of Amy Allen suddenly disappeared between two episodes, and was only briefly referred to once in the episode In Plane Sight , and a couple of times in The Battle of Bel Air in which she was cited to have taken a correspondence job overseas . The latter episode also introduced Heasleys character, Tawnia Baker. The new character was also an assisting reporter character, but with a more fragile and seductive quality to her. Ultimately, she was written out of the show at the start of the third season when the network determined that a female cast member was not necessary. Tawnia left the team on-screen, choosing to marry and move out of Los Angeles.     As Marla Heasley recounts in  Bring Back... The A-Team  , although sexism was not prevalent on the set per se, there was a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her We dont want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason youre here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl. The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: Im sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didnt want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl. In Bring Back... the A-Team,  |Dirk_Benedict|Dirk_Benedict|  also remarked that: It was a guys show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. Its about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show.          The 1983  |GMC_Vandura|Chevrolet_Van1983|  van used by the A-Team, with its characteristic red stripe, black and red turbine mag wheels, and rooftop spoiler,  has become an enduring  |pop_culture|Pop_Culture|  icon. The customized 1994 Chevrolet G20 used on  |the_A_Team_movie|The_A_Team|  was also on display at the 2010  |New_York_International_Auto_Show|New_York_International_Auto_Show| .      A number of devices were seen in the back of the van in different episodes, including a mini printing press , an audio surveillance recording device , Hannibals disguise kits in various episodes, and a gun storage locker.     Early examples of the van had a red GMC logo on the front grille, and an additional GMC logo on the rear left door. Early in the second season, these logos were blacked out, although GMC continued to supply vans and receive a credit on the closing credits of each episode.     The van was almost all-black, as the section above the red stripe was metallic gray. The angle of the rear spoiler can also be seen to vary on different examples of the van within the series. Additionally, some versions of the van have a sunroof, whereas others, typically those used for stunts do not. This led to continuity errors in some episodes, such as in the third seasons The Bells of St. Marys , in a scene where Face jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof but moments later, in an interior studio shot, climbs in through the sunroof.       The huge success of the series saw a vast array of merchandise, including toys and snacks released both in America and internationally. There were several sets of trading cards and stickers, action figures of the characters were produced by  |Galoob|Galoob|  as well as vehicles, including B.A.s van and Faces Corvette , as well as items such as helicopters, trucks and jeeps to fit in with the line, from model car manufacturer  |Ertl|Ertl_Company| .
