        The geologic time scale  is a system of  |chronological_dating|Chronological_Dating|  that relates geological strata  to time. It is used by  |geologists|Geologist| ,  |paleontologists|Paleontology| , and other  |Earth_scientists|Earth_Sciences|  to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during  |Earths_history|History_Of_The_Earth| . The table of geologic time spans, presented here, agree with the  |nomenclature|Taxonomy| , dates and standard color codes set forth by the  |International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy|International_Commission_On_Stratigraphy|  .     TOC        eons, in sequence the  |Hadean|Hadean| , the  |Archean|Archean| , the  |Proterozoic|Proterozoic|  and the  |Phanerozoic|Phanerozoic| .   The first three of these can be referred to collectively as the  |Precambrian|Precambrian|  supereon.   Eons are divided into  |eras|Era| , which are in turn divided into  |periods|Period| ,  |epochs|Epoch|  and  |ages|Age| .          Corresponding to eons, eras, periods, epochs and ages, the terms  |eonothem|Eonothem|  ,  |erathem|Erathem|  ,  |system|System|  ,  |series|Series|  ,  |stage|Stage|  are used to refer to the layers of rock that belong to these stretches of geologic time in Earths history.     Geologists qualify these units as early , mid , and late when referring to time, and lower , middle , and upper when referring to the corresponding rocks. For example, the lower Jurassic Series in  |chronostratigraphy|Chronostratigraphy|  corresponds to the early Jurassic Epoch in  |geochronology|Geochronology| .  The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized, and lower case when not; thus early Miocene but Early Jurassic.       Evidence from  |radiometric_dating|Radiometric_Dating|  indicates that Earth is about  |4_54_billion_years_old|Age_Of_The_Earth| .     The geology or  deep time  of Earths past has been organized into various units according to events which took place. Different spans of time on the GTS are usually marked by corresponding  |changes_in_the_composition_of_strata|Stratigraphy|  which indicate major geological or  |paleontological|Paleontology|  events, such as  |mass_extinctions|Mass_Extinction| . For example, the boundary between the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  period and the  |Paleogene|Paleogene|  period is defined by the  |Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Extinction_Event| , which marked the demise of the non-avian  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|  and many other groups of life. Older time spans, which predate the reliable fossil record , are defined by their absolute age.     Geologic units from the same time but different parts of the world often look different and contain different fossils, so the same time-span was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America, the Lower  |Cambrian|Cambrian|  is called the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of  |trilobites|Trilobita| . In  |East_Asia|East_Asia|  and  |Siberia|Siberia| , the same unit is split into  |Alexian|Alexian| ,  |Atdabanian|Atdabanian| , and  |Botomian|Botomian|  stages. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal  |horizons|Horizon|  that can be used around the world.      Some other  |planets|Planetsolar_System|  and  |moons|Natural_Satellite|  in the Solar System have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories, for example,  |Venus|Geology_Of_Venus| ,  |Mars|Geology_Of_Mars|  and the  |Earths_Moon|Geology_Of_The_Moon| . Dominantly fluid planets, such as the  |gas_giants|Gas_Giant| , do not preserve their history in a comparable manner. Apart from the  |Late_Heavy_Bombardment|Late_Heavy_Bombardment| , events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the Earth, and events on Earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets. Construction of a time scale that links the planets is, therefore, of only limited relevance to the Earths time scale, except in a Solar System context. The existence, timing, and terrestrial effects of the Late Heavy Bombardment are still a matter of debate.                    In  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| ,  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  observed that  |fossils|Fossil|  of seashells in rocks resembled those found on beaches – he inferred that the fossils in rocks were formed by organisms, and he reasoned that the positions of land and sea had changed over long periods of time.  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  concurred with Aristotles interpretation that fossils represented the remains of ancient life.      The 11th-century  |Persian_polymath|Islamic_Geography| |_Avicenna|Avicenna|  and the 13th-century  |Dominican|Dominican_Order| |_bishop|Bishop| |_Albertus_Magnus|Albertus_Magnus|  extended Aristotles explanation into a theory of a  |petrifying|Petrification|  fluid.  Avicenna also first proposed one of the principles underlying geologic time scales, the  |law_of_superposition|Law_Of_Superposition|  of strata, while discussing the origins of mountains in  The Book of Healing  .  The  |Chinese_naturalist|History_Of_Science_And_Technology_In_China| |_Shen_Kuo|Shen_Kuo|  also recognized the concept of  |deep_time|Deep_Time|  .            In the late 17th century  |Nicholas_Steno|Nicholas_Steno|  pronounced the principles underlying geologic time scales. Steno argued that rock layers were laid down in succession, and that each represents a slice of time. He also formulated the law of superposition, which states that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it. While Stenos principles were simple, applying them proved challenging. Stenos ideas also lead to other important concepts geologists use today, such as  |relative_dating|Relative_Dating| . Over the course of the 18th century geologists realized that:     Sequences of strata often become eroded, distorted, tilted, or even inverted after deposition   Strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances   The strata of any given area represented only part of Earths long history   The  |Neptunist|Neptunist|  theories popular at this time  proposed that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. A major shift in thinking came when  |James_Hutton|James_Hutton|  presented his Theory of the Earth; or, an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe        before the  |Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh|Royal_Society_Of_Edinburgh|  in March and April 1785.  |John_McPhee|John_Mcphee|  asserts that as things appear from the perspective of the 20th century, James Hutton in those readings became the founder of modern geology .         Hutton proposed that the interior of Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock: land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory, known as  |Plutonism|Plutonism|  , stood in contrast to the Neptunist flood-oriented theory.       The first serious attempts to formulate a geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth were made in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts  divided the rocks of Earths crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a Tertiary Period as well as of Tertiary Rocks. Indeed, Tertiary remained in use as the name of a geological period well into the 20th century and Quaternary remains in formal use as the name of the current period.     The identification of strata by the fossils they contained, pioneered by  |William_Smith|William_Smith| ,  |Georges_Cuvier|Georges_Cuvier| ,  |Jean_dOmalius_dHalloy|Jean_Baptiste_Julien_Domalius_Dhalloy| , and  |Alexandre_Brongniart|Alexandre_Brongniart|  in the early 19th century, enabled geologists to divide Earth history more precisely. It also enabled them to correlate strata across national boundaries. If two strata contained the same fossils, chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geologic periods still used today.       Early work on developing the geologic time scale was dominated by British geologists, and the names of the geologic periods reflect that dominance. The Cambrian ,  and the Ordovician , and Silurian , named after ancient Welsh tribes, were periods defined using stratigraphic sequences from Wales.  The Devonian was named for the English county of  |Devon|Devon| , and the name Carboniferous was an adaptation of the Coal Measures , the old British geologists term for the same set of strata. The Permian was named after  |Perm|Perm| , Russia, because it was defined using strata in that region by Scottish geologist  |Roderick_Murchison|Roderick_Murchison| . However, some periods were defined by geologists from other countries. The Triassic was named in 1834 by a German geologist  |Friedrich_Von_Alberti|Friedrich_Von_Alberti|  from the three distinct layers — |red_beds|Red_Bed| , capped by  |chalk|Chalk| , followed by black  |shales|Shale| —that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, called the ‘Trias’. The Jurassic was named by a French geologist  |Alexandre_Brongniart|Alexandre_Brongniart|  for the extensive marine  |limestone|Limestone|  exposures of the  |Jura_Mountains|Jura_Mountains| . The Cretaceous  as a separate period was first defined by Belgian geologist  |Jean_dOmalius_dHalloy|Jean_Baptiste_Julien_Domalius_Dhalloy|  in 1822, using strata in the  |Paris_basin|Paris_Basin|   and named for the extensive beds of chalk  found in Western Europe.     British geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs. In 1841  |John_Phillips|John_Phillips|  published the first global geologic time scale based on the types of fossils found in each era. Phillips scale helped standardize the use of terms like  Paleozoic  which he extended to cover a larger period than it had in previous usage, and  Mesozoic  which he invented.             When William Smith and  |Sir_Charles_Lyell|Sir_Charles_Lyell|  first recognized that rock strata represented successive time periods, time scales could be estimated only very imprecisely since estimates of rates of change were uncertain. While  |creationists|Creationism|  had been proposing dates of around six or seven thousand years for the age of Earth based on the  |Bible|Bible| , early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods, and some were even suggesting a virtually infinite age for Earth. Geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils, and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of  |weathering|Weathering| ,  |erosion|Erosion| ,  |sedimentation|Sedimentation| , and  |lithification|Lithification| . Until the discovery of  |radioactivity|Radioactive_Decay|  in 1896 and the development of its geological applications through  |radiometric_dating|Radiometric_Dating|  during the first half of the 20th century, the ages of various rock strata and the age of Earth were the subject of considerable debate.     The first geologic time scale that included absolute dates was published in 1913 by the British geologist  |Arthur_Holmes|Arthur_Holmes| .  He greatly furthered the newly created discipline of  |geochronology|Geochronology|  and published the world-renowned book The Age of the Earth in which he estimated Earths age to be at least 1.6 billion years.      In 1977, the Global Commission on Stratigraphy  began to define global references known as GSSP  for geologic periods and faunal stages. The commissions work is described in the 2012 geologic time scale of Gradstein et al.  A  |UML|Unified_Modeling_Language|  model for how the timescale is structured, relating it to the GSSP, is also available.        Popular culture and a growing number of scientists use the term  |Anthropocene|Anthropocene|  informally to label the current epoch in which we are living. The term was coined by  |Paul_Crutzen|Paul_J_Crutzen|  and  |Eugene_Stoermer|Eugene_F_Stoermer|  in 2000 to describe the current time in which humans have had an enormous impact on the environment. It has evolved to describe an epoch starting some time in the past and on the whole defined by anthropogenic carbon emissions and production and consumption of plastic goods that are left in the ground.      Critics of this term say that the term should not be used because it is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to define a specific time when humans started influencing the rock strata—defining the start of an epoch.  Others say that humans have not even started to leave their biggest impact on Earth, and therefore the Anthropocene has not even started yet.     The ICS has not officially approved the term .  The Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch. Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend Anthropocene as the new geological age in August 2016.    Should the International Commission on Stratigraphy approve the recommendation, the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences before its formal adoption as part of the geologic time scale.            The following table summarizes the major events and characteristics of the periods of time making up the geologic time scale. This table is arranged with the most recent geologic periods at the top, and the most ancient at the bottom. The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time.     The content of the table is based on the current official geologic time scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy,  with the epoch names altered to the early/late format from lower/upper as recommended by the ICS when dealing with  |chronostratigraphy|Chronostratigraphy| .     A service providing a  |Resource_Description_Framework|Resource_Description_Framework| / |Web_Ontology_Language|Web_Ontology_Language|  representation of the timescale is available through the  |Commission_for_the_Management_and_Application_of_Geoscience_Information|Commission_For_The_Management_And_Application_Of_Geoscience_Information| |_GeoSciML|Geosciml|  project as a service  and at a  |SPARQL|Sparql|  end-point.
