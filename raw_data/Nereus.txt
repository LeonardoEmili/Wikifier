        In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Nereus  was the eldest son of  |Pontus|Pontus|   and  |Gaia|Gaia|  , who with  |Doris|Doris|  fathered the  |Nereids|Nereid|  and  |Nerites|Nerites| , with whom Nereus lived in the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea| .  |Hesiod|Hesiod| ,  Theogony  233-36, is unequivocal that Nereus is the  |Old_Man_of_the_Sea|Old_Man_Of_The_Sea|  , whereas the  Odyssey  refers the sobriquet to Nereus to  |Proteus|Proteus|  , and to  |Phorkys|Phorkys|  .        |R._S._P._Beekes|Robert_S._P._Beekes|  suggests a  |Pre-Greek|Pre-Greek|  origin.  |R._S._P._Beekes|Robert_S._P._Beekes| , Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 1017.       In the  Iliad  Iliad i.358, 538, 556; xviii.141; xx.107; xxiv.562. the  |Old_Man_of_the_Sea|Old_Man_Of_The_Sea|  is the father of Nereids, though Nereus is not directly named. He was never more manifestly the Old Man of the Sea than when he was described, like  |Proteus|Proteus| , as a  |shapeshifter|Shapeshifting|  with the power of prophecy, who would aid heroes such as  |Heracles|Heracles|  Or, as  |Proteus|Proteus| ,  |Menelaus|Menelaus| . who managed to catch him even as he changed shapes. Nereus and  |Proteus|Proteus|  seem to be two manifestations of the god of the sea who was supplanted by  |Poseidon|Poseidon|  when  |Zeus|Zeus|  overthrew  |Cronus|Cronus| .     The earliest poet to link Nereus with the  |labours_of_Heracles|Twelve_Labors_Of_Heracles|  was  |Pherekydes|Pherecydes_Of_Leros| , according to a  scholion  on  |Apollonius_of_Rhodes|Apollonius_Of_Rhodes| . On Argonautica iv.1396f, noted by Ruth Glynn, Herakles, Nereus and Triton: A Study of Iconography in Sixth Century Athens American Journal of Archaeology 85.2 p 121f.     During the course of the 5th century BC, Nereus was gradually replaced by  |Triton|Triton| , who does not appear in Homer, in the imagery of the struggle between Heracles and the sea-god who had to be restrained in order to deliver his information that was employed by the vase-painters, independent of any literary testimony. Glynn 1981:121â€“132.     In a late appearance, according to a fragmentary  |papyrus|Papyrus| ,  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  paused at the Syrian seashore before the climacteric  |battle_of_Issus|Battle_Of_Issus|  , and resorted to prayers, calling on  |Thetis|Thetis| , Nereus and the Nereids, nymphs of the sea, and invoking  |Poseidon|Poseidon|  the sea-god, for whom he ordered a  |four-horse_chariot|Quadriga|  to be cast into the waves. Papyrus Oxyrrhincus  FGH  148, 44, col. 2; quoted by Robin Lane Fox, Alexander the Great 1986:168 and note. Thetis was the mother of Alexanders hero  |Achilles|Achilles| .     Nereus was known for his truthfulness and virtue:          The Attic vase-painters showed the draped torso of Nereus issuing from a long coiling scaly fishlike tail. ; Glynn 1981. Bearded Nereus generally wields a staff of authority. He was also shown in scenes depicting the flight of the Nereides as Peleus wrestled their sister Thetis.     In  |Aelians|Claudius_Aelianus|  natural history, written in the early third century CE,  Nereus was also the father of a watery consort of  |Aphrodite|Aphrodite|  named  |Nerites|Nerites|  who was transformed into a shellfish with a spiral shell, small in size but of surpassing beauty.     Nereus was father to  |Thetis|Thetis| , one of the Nereids, who in turn was mother to the great Greek hero  |Achilles|Achilles| , and  |Amphitrite|Amphitrite| , who married  |Poseidon|Poseidon| .
