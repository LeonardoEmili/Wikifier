            Enki  is the  |Sumerian_god|Sumerian_Religion|  of  |water|Water_Deity| , knowledge , mischief,  |crafts|Crafts|  , and  |creation|Creation_Deity|  , and one of the  |Anunnaki|Anunnaki| . He was later known as Ea in Akkadian and  |Babylonian_mythology|Babylonian_Mythology| . He was originally patron god of the city of  |Eridu|Eridu| , but later the influence of his  |cult|Cult|  spread throughout  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  and to the  |Canaanites|Canaanites| ,  |Hittites|Hittites|  and  |Hurrians|Hurrians| . He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, the Field .  by J.H. Rogers Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for 40 , occasionally referred to as his sacred number . Jeremy A.

The planet Mercury, associated with Babylonian  Nabu   was, in  |Sumer|Sumer| ian times, identified with Enki.     Many myths about Enki have been collected from various sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the  |Levant|Levant| ine coast. He is mentioned in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times.     The exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is Lord of the Earth . The Sumerian  En  is translated as a title equivalent to  |lord|Lord|  and was originally a title given to the High Priest. Ki means earth , but there are theories that ki in this name has another origin, possibly kig of unknown meaning, or kur meaning mound .   The name Ea is allegedly  |Hurrian|Hurrian|  in origin while others Huffmon, Herbert B. , Amorite Personal Names in the Mari Texts: A Structural and Lexical Study . Noah Kramer, Samuel and John Maier, , Myths of Enki, the Crafty God claim that his name Ea is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root hyy meaning life in this case used for spring , running water . In Sumerian E-A means the house of water , and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the god at  |Eridu|Eridu| . It has also been suggested that the original non-anthropomorphic divinity at Eridu was not Enki but  |Abzu|Abzu| . The emergence of Enki as the divine lover of  |Ninhursag|Ninhursag| , and the divine battle between the younger Igigi divinities and Abzu, saw the Abzu, the underground waters of the Aquifer, becoming the place in which the foundations of the temple were built. Espak, Peter Enki and Ea p.20 With some Sumerian deity names as Enlil there are variations like Elil. En means Lord and E means temple . It is likely that E-A is the Sumerian short form for Lord of Water , as Enki is a god of water. Ab in Abzu also means water.       The main temple to Enki was called E-abzu, meaning  |abzu|Abzu|  temple , a  |ziggurat|Ziggurat|  temple surrounded by  |Euphratean|Euphrates|  marshlands near the ancient  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf|  coastline at  |Eridu|Eridu| . It was the first temple known to have been built in Southern Iraq. Four separate excavations at the site of  |Eridu|Eridu|  have demonstrated the existence of a shrine dating back to the earliest  |Ubaid_period|Ubaid_Period| , more than 6,500 years ago. Over the following 4,500 years, the temple was expanded 18 times, until it was abandoned during the Persian period. file:/-Enki-Ea-Peeter-Espak.pdf accessed 31/08/2014 On this basis Thorkild Jacobsen Jacobsen, Thorkild Mesopotamian Gods and Pantheons , p.22 has hypothesized that the original deity of the temple was Abzu, with his attributes later being taken by Enki over time. P. Steinkeller believes that, during the earliest period, Enki had a subordinate position to a goddess , taking the role of divine consort or high priest, Steinkeller P. Priests and Officials , p.129 later taking priority. The Enki temple had at its entrance a pool of fresh water, and excavation has found numerous carp bones, suggesting collective feasts. Carp are shown in the twin water flows running into the later God Enki, suggesting continuity of these features over a very long period. These features were found at all subsequent Sumerian temples, suggesting that this temple established the pattern for all subsequent Sumerian temples. All rules laid down at Eridu were faithfully observed . van Buren, E.D. OsNs 21, p.293            Enki was the keeper of the divine powers called  Me , the gifts of  |civilization|Civilization| . He is often shown with the horned crown of divinity.     On the Adda Seal, Enki is depicted with two streams of water flowing into each of his shoulders: one the Tigris, the other the Euphrates.  Alongside him are two trees, symbolizing the male and female aspects of nature. He is shown wearing a flounced skirt and a cone-shaped hat. An eagle descends from above to land upon his outstretched right arm. This portrayal reflects Enkis role as the god of water, life, and replenishment.      Considered the master shaper of the world, god of  |wisdom|Wisdom|  and of all  |magic|Magic| , Enki was characterized as the lord of the  |Abzu|Abzu|  , the freshwater sea or  |groundwater|Groundwater|  located within the  |earth|Earth| . In the later Babylonian epic  Enûma Eliš , Abzu, the begetter of the gods , is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu casting him into a deep sleep , thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home in the depths of the Abzu. Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of  |semen|Semen| . Leick, Gwendolyn , Mesopotamia: the invention of the city p.20     Early royal inscriptions from the  |third_millennium_BCE|Third_Millennium_Bce|  mention the reeds of Enki .  |Reeds|Phragmites|  were an important local building material, used for baskets and containers, and collected outside the city walls, where the dead or sick were often carried. This links Enki to the  Kur  or  |underworld|Underworld|  of  |Sumerian_mythology|Sumerian_Mythology| . In another even older tradition,  |Nammu|Nammu| , the goddess of the primeval creative matter and the mother-goddess portrayed as having  given birth to the great gods,  was the mother of Enki, and as the watery creative force, was said to preexist Ea-Enki. Dalley, S , Myths of Mesopotamia , p.50 Benito states With Enki it is an interesting change of gender symbolism, the fertilising agent is also water, Sumerian  a  or  Ab  which also means semen . In one evocative passage in a Sumerian hymn, Enki stands at the empty riverbeds and fills them with his water . Benito, C.A. Enki and Ninmah and Enki and the World Order              The cosmogenic myth common in Sumer was that of the  |hieros_gamos|Hieros_Gamos| , a sacred marriage where divine principles in the form of dualistic opposites came together as male and female to give birth to the cosmos. In the epic Enki and Ninhursag, Enki, as lord of Ab or fresh water , is living with his wife in the paradise of  |Dilmun|Dilmun|  where          Despite being a place where the raven uttered no cries and the lion killed not, the wolf snatched not the lamb, unknown was the kid-killing dog, unknown was the grain devouring boar , Dilmun had no water and Enki heard the cries of its goddess, Ninsikil, and orders the sun-god Utu to bring fresh water from the Earth for Dilmun. As a result,          Dilmun was identified with  |Bahrain|Bahrain| , whose name in  |Arabic|Arabic|  means two seas , where the fresh waters of the Arabian  |aquifer|Aquifer|  mingle with the salt waters of the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf| . This mingling of waters was known in Sumerian as  |Nammu|Nammu| , and was identified as the mother of Enki.     The subsequent tale, with similarities to the Biblical story of the forbidden fruit, repeats the story of how fresh water brings life to a barren land. Enki, the Water-Lord then caused to flow the water of the heart and having fertilised his consort  |Ninhursag|Ninhursag| , also known as  |Ki|Ki|  or Earth, after Nine days being her nine months, the months of womanhood... like good butter, Nintu, the mother of the land, ...like good butter, gave birth to  |Ninsar|Ninsar| , . When Ninhursag left him, as Water-Lord he came upon Ninsar . Not knowing her to be his daughter, and because she reminds him of his absent consort, Enki then seduces and has intercourse with her. Ninsar then gave birth to  |Ninkurra|Ninkurra|  , and leaves Enki alone again. A second time, Enki, in his loneliness finds and seduces Ninkurra, and from the union Ninkurra gave birth to  |Uttu|Uttu|  .     A third time Enki succumbs to temptation, and attempts seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enkis reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, upset at the promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely to be affected by flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth Ninhursag takes Enkis semen from Uttus womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward  |Isimud|Isimud| , Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, What is this , what is this . His messenger Isimud, answers him; My king, this is the tree-plant, he says to him. He cuts it off for him and he eats it . And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss to know what to do; chagrined they sit in the dust . As Enki lacks a birth canal through which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil, King of the Gods, If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward? Ninhursags sacred fox then fetches the goddess.     Ninhursag relents and takes Enkis Ab into her body, and gives birth to gods of healing of each part of the body: Abu for the jaw, Nintul for the hip, Ninsutu for the tooth, Ninkasi for the mouth, Dazimua for the side, Enshagag for the limbs. The last one,  |Ninti|Ninti|  , is also a pun on Lady Life, a title of Ninhursag herself. The story thus symbolically reflects the way in which life is brought forth through the addition of water to the land, and once it grows, water is required to bring plants to fruit. It also counsels balance and responsibility, nothing to excess.     Ninti, the title of Ninhursag, also means the mother of all living , and was a title later given to the  |Hurrian|Hurrian| |_goddess|Goddess| |_Kheba|Hebat| . This is also the title given in the Bible to  |Eve|Eve| , the Hebrew and Aramaic Ḥawwah , who was made from the rib of Adam, in a strange reflection of the Sumerian myth, in which Adam – not Enki – walks in the Garden of Paradise.        After six generations of gods, in the Babylonian  Enûma Eliš , in the seventh generation, , the younger  |Igigi|Igigi|  gods, the sons and daughters of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping creation working.  |Abzu|Abzu| , god of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of  |Eridu|Eridu| . But the universe is still threatened, as  |Tiamat|Tiamat| , angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier  |Kingu|Kingu| , decides to take back creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki – who harnessed  |Abzu|Abzu| , Tiamats consort, for irrigation – refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal  |Enlil|Enlil| , their father, god of  |Nippur|Nippur| , promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlils role is taken by  |Marduk|Marduk| , Enkis son, and in the Assyrian version it is  |Asshur|Asshur| . After dispatching Tiamat with the arrows of his winds down her throat and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of who will keep the cosmos working . Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother  |Nammu|Nammu|  brings the tears of the gods before Enki and says          Enki then advises that they create a servant of the gods, humankind, out of clay and blood. Kramer 1963 pp. 149-151; Kramer 1961 pp. 69-72 Christopher B. Siren based on John C. Gibsons Canaanite Mythology and S. H. Hookes Middle Eastern Mythology Against Enkis wish, the gods decide to slay Kingu, and Enki finally consents to use Kingus blood to make the first human, with whom Enki always later has a close relationship, the first of the seven sages, seven wise men or  Abgallu  , also known as  |Adapa|Adapa| . Enki assembles a team of divinities to help him, creating a host of good and princely fashioners . He tells his mother:      .
