     In elementary  |number_theory|Number_Theory| , Bézouts identity  is the following  |theorem|Theorem|      The integers x and y are called Bézout coefficients for ; they are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients can be computed by the  |extended_Euclidean_algorithm|Extended_Euclidean_Algorithm| . If both a and b are nonzero, the extended Euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that  x          and  y          .     Many other theorems in elementary number theory, such as  |Euclids_lemma|Euclids_Lemma|  or  |Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese_Remainder_Theorem| , result from Bézouts identity.     A  |Bézout_domain|Bézout_Domain|  is an  |integral_domain|Integral_Domain|  in which Bézouts identity holds. In particular, Bézouts identity holds in  |principal_ideal_domains|Principal_Ideal_Domain| . Every theorem that results from Bézouts identity is thus true in all these domains.         When one pair of Bézout coefficients  has been computed , all pairs can be represented in the form     :     where  is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.     Among these pairs of Bézout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy   :  x               y          ,   and equality may occur only if one of  and  divides the other.     This relies on a property of  |Euclidean_division|Euclidean_Division| c and d, if d does not divide c, there is exactly one pair  such that  and .
