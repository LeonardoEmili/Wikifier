     Equuleus  is a  |constellation|Constellation| . Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for little horse , a  |foal|Foal| . It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| , and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations , spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the  |fourth_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude| .                 The brightest star in Equuleus is  |Alpha_Equulei|Alpha_Equulei| , traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3.9, 186 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means the section of the horse .     There are few  |variable_stars|Variable_Star|  in Equuleus. Only around 25 are known, most of which are faint.  |Gamma_Equulei|Gamma_Equulei|  is an  |alpha_CVn_star|Alpha_Cvn_Star| , ranging between magnitudes 4.58 and 4.77 over a period of around 12½ minutes. It is a white star 115 light-years from Earth, and has an  |optical_companion|Optical_Binary|  of magnitude 6.1,  |6_Equulei|6_Equulei| . It is divisible in binoculars.  |R_Equulei|R_Equulei|  is a  |Mira_variable|Mira_Variable|  that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 15.7 over nearly 261 days.     Equuleus contains some  |double_stars|Double_Star|  of interest. γ Equ consists of a primary star with a magnitude around 4.7 and a secondary star of magnitude 11.6, separated by 2  |arcseconds|Arcsecond| .  |Epsilon_Equulei|Epsilon_Equulei|  is a triple star also designated 1 Equulei. The system, 197 light-years away, has a primary of magnitude 5.4 that is itself a binary star; its components are of magnitude 6.0 and 6.3 and have a period of 101 years. The secondary is of magnitude 7.4 and is visible in small telescopes. The components of the primary are becoming closer together and will not be divisible in amateur telescopes beginning in 2015.  |δ_Equ|Delta_Equulei|  is a  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  with an orbital period of 5.7 years, which at one time was the shortest known orbital period for an optical binary. The two components of the system are never more than 0.35 arcseconds apart.       Due to its small size and its distance from the plane of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| , Equuleus contains no notable deep sky objects. Some very faint  |galaxies|Galaxy|  between magnitudes 13 and 15 include  |NGC_7015|Ngc_7015| ,  |NGC_7040|Ngc_7040| ,  |NGC_7045|Ngc_7045|  and  |NGC_7046|Ngc_7046| .               In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , one myth associates Equuleus with the foal Celeris , who was the offspring or brother of the winged horse  |Pegasus|Pegasus| . Celeris was given to  |Castor|Castor_And_Pollux|  by  |Mercury|Mercury| . Other myths say that Equuleus is the horse struck from  |Poseidons|Poseidon|  trident, during the contest between him and  |Athena|Athena|  when deciding which would be the superior. Because this section of stars rises before  |Pegasus|Pegasus| , it is often called Equus Primus, or the First Horse. Equuleus is also linked to the story of  |Philyra|Philyra|  and  |Saturn|Saturn| .     Created by  |Hipparchus|Hipparchus|  and included by  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| , it abuts Pegasus; unlike the larger horse it is depicted as a horses head alone.

In  |Chinese_astronomy|Chinese_Astronomy| , the stars that correspond to Equuleus are located within the  |Black_Tortoise_of_the_North|Black_Tortoise|  .         Equuleus is briefly mentioned in the  Martha Speaks  .
