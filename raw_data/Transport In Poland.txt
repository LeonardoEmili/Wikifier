Transport in Poland involves air, water, road and rail transportation. The country has a large network of municipal public transport, such as buses, trams and the metro. As a country located at the cross-roads of Europe,  |Poland|Poland| , with its highly  |developed_economy|Economy_Of_Poland| , is a nation with a large and increasingly modern network of transport infrastructure.     The countrys most important waterway is the  |Vistula|Vistula|  river. The largest seaports are the  |Port_of_Gdańsk|Port_Of_Gdańsk| , the  |Port_of_Gdynia|Port_Of_Gdynia|  and the  |Port_of_Szczecin|Port_Of_Szczecin| . Air travel is generally used for international travel, with many flights originating at  |Warsaw_Chopin_Airport|Warsaw_Chopin_Airport| . Railways connect all of Polands major cities and the state-owned  |Polish_State_Railways|Polish_State_Railways|  corporation, through its subsidiaries, runs a great number of domestic and international services of varying speed and comfort. In addition to this, five out of sixteen Polish  |voivodeships|Voivodeship|  have their own provincial rail service providers.                            Poland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities the main railway station is located near a city centre and is well connected to the local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by  |PKP|Polish_State_Railways|  Group. The rail network is very dense in western and northern Poland, while eastern part of the country is less developed. The capital city,  |Warsaw|Warsaw| , has the countrys only  |rapid_transit_system|Rapid_Transit| |Warsaw_Metro|Warsaw_Metro| .     The only high-speed rail line  in central-eastern Europe is the  |Central_Rail_Line|Central_Rail_Line| , Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa . It has a length of , and was built in 1971–1977; it links  |Warsaw|Warsaw|  with  |Kraków|Kraków|  and  |Katowice|Katowice| . Most trains on the CMK operate at speeds up to , but since December 2014 new  |Alstom|Alstom| |Pendolino|Pendolino|  ED250 trains operate on a 90  km section of the CMK at , and improvements under way should raise the authorized speed to  on most of the line.

In December 2014 new  |Alstom|Alstom| |Pendolino|Pendolino|  ED250 high-speed trains were put into service between Gdańsk, Warsaw,  |Katowice|Katowice|  and  |Kraków|Kraków|  reducing the rail travel time from Gdańsk to Warsaw to 2 hours 58 minutes, Polish Pendolino launches 200 km/h operation, Railway Gazette International, 15 December 2014,  Pendolino z Trójmiasta do Warszawy,  to be reduced in late 2015 to 2 hours 37 minutes. ;Jeszcze szybciej z Warszawy do Gdańska, Kurier Kolejowy 9 01 2015    Warsaw– |Kutno|Kutno| – |Poznań|Poznań| –   Warsaw– |Siedlce|Siedlce| – |Terespol|Terespol| – – being upgraded to 160  km/h   Warsaw– |Puławy|Puławy| – |Lublin|Lublin| |Opole|Opole| – |Wrocław|Wrocław|  and further upgraded via  |Legnica|Legnica|  to Berlin and  |Hamburg|Hamburg|      Projects   The Warsaw– |Łódź|Łódź|  line is being upgraded to allow speed up to 160  km/h .

In addition to Warsaw Chopin,  |Wrocław|Copernicus_Airport_Wrocław| ,  |Gdańsk|Gdańsk_Lech_Wałęsa_Airport| ,  |Katowice|Katowice_International_Airport| ,  |Kraków|John_Paul_Ii_International_Airport_Kraków-Balice|  and  |Poznań|Poznań-Ławica_Airport|  all have international airports.     In preparation for the  |Euro_2012|Euro_2012|  football championships jointly hosted by Poland and  |Ukraine|Ukraine| , a number of airports around the country were renovated and redeveloped. This included the building of new terminals with an increased number of jetways and stands at both  |Copernicus_Airport_in_Wrocław|Copernicus_Airport_Wrocław|  and  |Lech_Wałęsa_Airport_in_Gdańsk|Gdańsk_Lech_Wałęsa_Airport| .       The Polish airline market was until 2004 a closed market, with bilateral agreements between countries served from the national hub – Warsaw. The regional airports were mostly serving as spokes, and were controlled by PPL, the state-owned airport authority. However, in the 1990s it was decided to deregulate the airport market and abolish the dominant position of PPL. Nearly all local airports became separate companies, with local governments involved in their management, which led to the partial decentralisation. Soon after opening of Polish sky for competition, flights “avoiding” the Warsaw hub became more common.     There are twelve passenger airports in operation, and there is also an airport Heringsdorf in German village Garz, 7 kilometers from Polish seaside spa Świnoujście.        |List_of_airports_in_Poland|List_Of_Airports_In_Poland|    The following are the largest airports in Poland :    |Warsaw_Frederic_Chopin_International_Airport|Warsaw_Frederic_Chopin_Airport| |Kraków_John_Paul_II_International_Airport|John_Paul_Ii_International_Airport_Kraków-Balice| |Gdańsk_Lech_Wałęsa_International_Airport|Gdańsk_Lech_Wałęsa_Airport| |Katowice_International_Airport|Katowice_International_Airport| |Wrocław_Mikołaj_Kopernik_International_Airport|Copernicus_Airport_Wrocław| |Poznań_International_Airport|Poznań-Ławica_Airport| |Rzeszów-Jasionka_Airport|Rzeszów-Jasionka_Airport| |Łódź_Władysław_Reymont_Airport|Łódź_Władysław_Reymont_Airport| |Szczecin-Goleniów_Solidarność_Airport|Szczecin-Goleniów_Solidarność_Airport| |Warsaw_Modlin|Warsaw_Modlin| |Bydgoszcz_Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski_Airport|Bydgoszcz_Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski_Airport| |Lublin_Airport|Lublin_Airport| |Radom_Airport|Radom_Airport| |Olsztyn-Mazury_Regional_Airport|Olsztyn-Mazury_Regional_Airport|      Domestic:    |Zielona_Góra-Babimost_Airport|Zielona_Góra_Airport|      Airports with paved runways:   Total: 84   over 3,047 m: 4   2,438 to 3,047 m: 29   1,524 to 2,437 m: 41   914 to 1,523 m: 7   under 914 m: 3     Airports – with unpaved runways:   Total: 39   2,438 to 3,047 m: 1   1,524 to 2,437 m: 4   914 to 1,523 m: 13   under 914 m: 21     Heliports: 2               The countrys most important waterway is the river  |Vistula|Vistula| .

On the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  coast, a number of large seaports exist to serve the international freight and passenger trade; these are typically deep water ports and are able to serve very large ships, including the  |ro-ro|Ro-Ro|  ferries of  |Unity_Line|Unity_Line| ,  |Polferries|Polferries|  and  |Stena_Line|Stena_Line|  which operate the  |Poland|Poland|  –  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia|  passenger lines.

Typically, a city possesses its own local bus service, however, in some cases they have private competitors operating on certain lines upon the agreement with local authorities.     Until the 1990s, interurban connections were operated by a single, state-owned company  |PKS|Przedsiębiorstwo_Komunikacji_Samochodowej| . Since then, it has been broken into a number of independent national and municipal enterprises. In addition, several private operators emerged. There are two classes of service distinguished by vehicle length:   autobus — longer vehicles ,   bus — shorter vehicles with smaller capacity, very popular on local connections, run by individual persons and smaller companies.   While they often use the same bus stops, they tend to use different stations.               Bigger cities run dense  |tram_networks|Tram| , which are the primary mean of public transport. Currently, there are 14 systems serving over 30 cities including  |Bydgoszcz|Bydgoszcz| ,  |Gdańsk|Gdańsk| ,  |Katowice|Katowice| ,  |Kraków|Kraków| ,  |Łódź|Łódź| ,  |Poznań|Poznań| ,  |Szczecin|Szczecin| ,  |Warsaw|Warsaw|  and  |Wrocław|Wrocław| , with the total track length varying from   to less than  .

See the  |list_of_town_tramway_systems_in_Poland|List_Of_Town_Tramway_Systems_In_Poland|      Since the 1990s, a number of cities attempts to upgrade certain parts of their networks to the  |light_rail|Light_Rail|  standard .

The first  |metro|Rapid_Transit|  line was opened in  |Warsaw|Warsaw|  in 1995. Part of the  |second_line|Warsaw_Metro|  was opened in 2015. This is part of the countrys rail transport infrastructure. There are no official plans to build metro in other cities due to the lack of funds, but there is an ongoing debate whether they should be built, especially in  |Kraków|Kraków|   .
