        A slingshot or catapult , ging , shanghai or kettie is normally a small hand-powered projectile  |weapon|Weapon| . The classic form consists of a Y-shaped frame held in the off hand , with two  |natural-rubber|Natural_Rubber|  strips attached to the uprights. The other ends of the strips lead back to a pocket that holds the  |projectile|Projectile| . The  |dominant_hand|Dominant_Hand|  grasps the pocket and draws it back to the desired extent to provide power for the projectile—up to a full span of the arm with sufficiently long bands.       Slingshots depend on strong  |elastic|Elasticity|  materials, typically  |vulcanized|Vulcanization| |natural_rubber|Natural_Rubber|  or the equivalent, and thus date no earlier than the invention of vulcanized rubber by  |Charles_Goodyear|Charles_Goodyear|  in 1839 . By 1860, this new engine had already established a reputation for juvenile use in vandalism. For much of their early history, slingshots were a do-it-yourself item, typically made from a forked branch to form the Y shaped handle, with rubber strips sliced from items as  |inner_tubes|Tireinner_Tube|  or other sources of good vulcanized rubber and firing suitably sized stones.     While early slingshots were most associated with young vandals, they were also capable hunting arms in the hands of a skilled user. Firing projectiles, such as  |lead|Lead| |musket|Musket|  balls,  |buckshot|Shotgun_Shellbuckshot| ,  |steel|Steel| |ball_bearings|Ball_Bearing| ,  |air_gun_pellets|Pellet| , or small  |nails|Nail| , slingshot was capable of taking game such as quail, pheasant, rabbit, dove, and squirrel. Placing multiple balls in the pouch produces a  |shotgun|Shotgun|  effect , such as firing a dozen  |BBs|Bb_Gun|  at a time for hunting small birds. With the addition of a suitable rest, the slingshot can also be used to shoot  |arrows|Arrow| , allowing the hunting of medium-sized game at short ranges.        While commercially made slingshots date from at least 1918, with the introduction of the Zip-Zip, a cast iron model,  it was not until the post  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  years saw a surge in the popularity, and legitimacy, of slingshots. They were still primarily a home-built proposition; a 1946  |Popular_Science|Popular_Science|  article details a slingshot builder and hunter using home-built slingshots made from forked  |dogwood|Cornus|  sticks to take small game at ranges of up to  with No. 0 lead buckshot .      The  |Wham-O|Wham-O|  company, founded in 1948, was named after their first product, the Wham-O slingshot. It was made of  |ash_wood|Fraxinus|  and used flat rubber bands. The Wham-O was suitable for hunting with a draw weight of up to , and was available with an arrow rest.      The 1940s also saw the creation of the National Slingshot Association, headquartered in  |San_Marino,_California|San_Marino,_California| , which organised slingshot clubs and competitions nationwide. Despite the slingshots reputation as a tool of juvenile delinquents, the NSA reported that 80% of slingshot sales were to men over 30 years old, many of them professionals. John Milligan, a part-time manufacturer of the  |aluminium|Aluminium| -framed John Milligan Special, a hunting slingshot, reported that about a third of his customers were physicians.     The middle 1950s saw two major innovations in slingshot manufacture, typified by the Wrist-Rocket® which was produced by the Saunders Archery Co. of  |Columbus,_Nebraska|Columbus,_Nebraska| . The Wrist-Rocket was made from bent aluminum alloy rods that formed not only the handle and fork, but also a brace that extended backwards over the wrist, and provided support on the forearm to counter the  |torque|Torque|  of the bands. The Wrist-Rocket® also used surgical rubber tubing rather than flat bands, attached to the backwards-facing fork ends by sliding the tubing ends over the tips of the forks, where it was held by friction or adhered with the addition of liquid rosin.     The early production of the Wrist-Rocket® slingshot was a joint effort between Saunders Archery Co., who came up with the trademark and developed the automated forming machinery, and Mark Ellenburg who came up with the basic design. A few years later Mark Ellenburg split away forming his own company called Tru-mark Manufacturing Company. Today Saunders Archery is still a major innovator in the slingshot industry with its line of flatband slingshots which use locking clips for band attachment and  tuning.     Slingshots are also occasionally used in  |angling|Angling|  to disperse bait into the water over a wide area, so that multiple fish are attracted near the anglers  |fishing_rod|Fishing_Rod| .     A home-made derivative of a slingshot also exists, consisting of a rubber  |balloon|Balloon| |ergonomic|Human_Factors_And_Ergonomics| |clashes_on_February_18,_2014|2014_Ukrainian_Revolution| , in Kiev, Ukraine         The world record for the most energetic shot with a handheld slingshot was 135  |Joules|Joule| . It was shot with a forward extended slingshot, also known as a starship , which achieves more power by increasing draw length. Monster Slingshot New World Record Shot        Slingshots have been used as military weapons, but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the primitive resources and technology required to construct one. Such guerrilla groups included the  |Irish_Republican_Army|Irish_Republican_Army| ; prior to the  |2003_invasion_of_Iraq|2003_Invasion_Of_Iraq| ,  |Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein|  released a  |propaganda|Propaganda|  video demonstrating slingshots as a possible  |insurgency_weapon|Insurgency_Weapons_And_Tactics|  for use against invading forces.      Slingshots have also been used by the military to launch  |unmanned_aerial_vehicles|Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle|  . Two crew members form the fork, with an elastic cord stretched between them to provide power to launch the small aircraft.      On the  |Battle_of_Marawi|Battle_Of_Marawi| , the soldiers of the Philippine Armys elite  |Scout_Rangers|1St_Scout_Ranger_Regiment|  were observed using slingshots with grenades as an improvised mortar to eliminate the  |Maute|Maute_Group|  and  |Abu_Sayyaf|Abu_Sayyaf|  Terrorists.               There are  |competitions|Competition| , quite popular in  |Spain|Spain| ,  |Italy|Italy|  and  |China|China| .                One of the dangers inherent in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from  |latex|Latex| , which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load.  Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the fork end, however, send the band back towards the shooters face, which can cause eye and facial injuries.  One method to minimize the chance of a fork end failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the fork end.  Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooters face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy Natural line of slingshots . The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure. Another big danger is the fork breakage, some commercial slingshots made from cheap zinc alloy may break and severely injure shooters eyes & face.        Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of arm braced slingshots. For example,  |New_York|New_York|  law 265.01 defines it as a Class-4 misdemeanor.        The slingshot is heavily featured in the popular gaming franchise  Angry Birds , used as the primary launching device for shooting birds at enemy pigs.       |Bart_Simpson|Bart_Simpson|  is often depicted using a slingshot to engage many pranks.     The slingshot is the signature weapon of protagonist  |Jimmy_Hopkins|Jimmy_Hopkins|  in the video game  Bully   |ammunition|Ammunition|.
