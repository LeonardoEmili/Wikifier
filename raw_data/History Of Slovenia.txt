   The history of Slovenia chronicles the period of the  |Slovenian_territory|Slovenian_Lands|  from the 5th century BC to the present. In the  |Early_Bronze_Age|Early_Bronze_Age| , Proto- |Illyrian|Illyrians|  tribes settled an area stretching from present-day  |Albania|Albania|  to the city of  |Trieste|Trieste| . Slovenian territory was part of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , and it was devastated by Barbarian incursions in  |late_Antiquity|Late_Antiquity|  and  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| , since the main route from the  |Pannonian_plain|Pannonian_Plain|  to  |Italy|Italy|  ran through present-day Slovenia.  |Alpine_Slavs|Alpine_Slavs| , ancestors of modern-day  |Slovenians|Slovenians| , settled the area in the late 6th Century A.D. The  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  controlled the land for nearly 1,000 years, and between the mid 14th century and 1918 most of Slovenia was under  |Habsburg|Habsburg_Monarchy|  rule. In 1918, Slovenes formed  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia|  along with  |Serbs|Serbs|  and  |Croats|Croats| , while a minority came under  |Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy| . The state of Slovenia was created in 1945 as part of  |federal_Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| . Slovenia gained its independence from  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia|  in June 1991, and is today a member of the  |European_Union|European_Union|  and  |NATO|Nato| .              The earliest signs of human settlement in present-day Slovenia were found in  |Hell_Cave|Hell_Cave|  in the Loza Woods near Orehek in  |Inner_Carniola|Inner_Carniola| , where two stone tools approximately 250,000 years old were recovered. During the  |last_glacial_period|Last_Glacial_Period| , present-day Slovenia was inhabited by  |Neanderthals|Neanderthal| ; the best-known Neanderthal archaeological site in Slovenia is a cave close to the village of  |Šebrelje|Šebrelje|  near  |Cerkno|Cerkno| , where the  |Divje_Babe_Flute|Divje_Babe_Flute| , the oldest known musical instrument in the world, was found in 1995. The worlds oldest securely dated wooden  |wheel_and_axle|Wheel_And_Axle|  was found near the  |Ljubljana_Marshes|Ljubljana_Marshes|  in 2002.  In the transition period between the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  to the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| , the  |Urnfield_culture|Urnfield_Culture|  flourished. Numerous archeological remains dating from the  |Hallstatt_period|Hallstatt_Period|  have been found in Slovenia, with important settlements in  |Most_na_Soči|Most_Na_Soči| ,  |Vače|Vače| , and  |Šentvid_pri_Stični|Šentvid_Pri_Stični| .  |Novo_Mesto|Novo_Mesto|  in  |Lower_Carniola|Lower_Carniola| , one of the most important archaeological sites of the Hallstatt culture, has been nicknamed the City of Situlas after numerous  |situlas|Situla|  found in the area.           In the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| , present-day Slovenia was inhabited by  |Illyrian|Illyrians|  and  |Celtic|Celts|  tribes until the 1st century BC, when the  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  conquered the region establishing the provinces of  |Pannonia|Pannonia|  and  |Noricum|Noricum| . What is now western Slovenia was included directly under  |Roman_Italia|Roman_Italy|  as part of the X region Venetia et Histria. Important Roman towns located in present-day Slovenia included  |Emona|Emona| ,  |Celeia|Celeia|  and  |Poetovio|Poetovio| . Other important settlements were  |Nauportus|Nauportus| ,  |Neviodunum|Neviodunum| ,  |Haliaetum|Haliaetum| ,  |Atrans|Atrans| , and  |Stridon|Stridon| .     During the  |Migration_Period|Migration_Period| , the region suffered invasions of many barbarian armies, due to its strategic position as the main passage from the  |Pannonian_Plain|Pannonian_Plain|  to the  |Italian_Peninsula|Italian_Peninsula| . Rome finally abandoned the region at the end of the 4th century. Most cities were destroyed, while the remaining local population moved to the highland areas, establishing fortified towns. In the 5th century, the region was part of the  |Ostrogothic_Kingdom|Ostrogothic_Kingdom| , and was later contested between the  |Ostrogoths|Ostrogoths| , the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  and the  |Lombards|Lombards| .             The Slavic ancestors of present-day  |Slovenes|Slovenes|  settled in the  |East_Alpine|Eastern_Alps|  area at the end of the 6th century. Coming from two directions, North , settling in the area of todays Carinthia and west Styria, and South , settling in the area of todays central Slovenia.       This Slavic tribe, also known as the  |Alpine_Slavs|Alpine_Slavs| , was submitted to  |Avar|Pannonian_Avars|  rule before joining the Slavic King  |Samos|Samo|  tribal union in 623 AD. After Samos death, the Slavs of  |Carniola|Carniola|  again fell to Avar rule, while the Slavs north of the  |Karavanke|Karavanke|  range  established the independent principality of  |Carantania|Carantania| .              In 745, Carantania and the rest of Slavic-populated territories of present-day Slovenia, being pressured by newly consolidated Avar power, submitted to Bavarian overrule and were, together with the Duchy of Bavaria, incorporated into the  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire| , while  |Carantanians|Carantanians|  and other Slavs living in present Slovenia  |converted_to_Christianity|Christianization| . The eastern part of Carantania was ruled again by Avars between 745 and 795.     Carantania retained its internal independence until 818 when the local princes, following the anti- |Frankish|Franks|  rebellion of  |Ljudevit_Posavski|Ljudevit_Posavski| , were deposed and gradually replaced by a Germanic  ascendancy. Under Emperor  |Arnulf_of_Carinthia|Arnulf_Of_Carinthia| , Carantania, now ruled by a mixed Bavarian-Slav nobility, briefly emerged as a regional power, but was destroyed by the  |Hungarian|Hungarian_People|  invasions in the late 9th century.     Carantania-Carinthia was established again as an autonomous administrative unit in 976, when Emperor Otto I, the Great , after deposing the Duke of Bavaria, Henry II, the Quarreller , split the lands held by him and made  |Carinthia|Duchy_Of_Carinthia|  the sixth duchy of the Holy Roman Empire, but old Carantania never developed into a unified realm.     In the late 10th and beginning of the 11th century, primarily because of the Hungarian threat, the south-eastern border region of the German Empire was organized into so called  |marks|March| , that became the core of the development of the historical Slovenian lands, the Carniola, the Styria and the western Goriška/Gorizia. The consolidation and formation of the historical Slovenian lands took place in a long period between 11th and 14th century being led by a number of important feudal families such as the  |Dukes_of_Spannheim|Bernhard_Von_Spanheim| , the  |Counts_of_Gorizia|Meinhardiner| , the  |Counts_of_Celje|Counts_Of_Celje|  and finally the  |House_of_Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg| .           The first mentions of a common Slovene ethnic identity, transcending regional boundaries, date from the 16th century. Edo Škulj, ed., Trubarjev simpozij .     During the 14th century, most of the Slovene Lands passed under the  |Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg|  rule. In the 15th century, the Habsburg domination was challenged by the  |Counts_of_Celje|Counts_Of_Celje| , but by the end of the century the great majority of Slovene-inhabited territories were incorporated into the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy| . Most Slovenes lived in the administrative region known as  |Inner_Austria|Inner_Austria| , forming the majority of the population of the  |Duchy_of_Carniola|Duchy_Of_Carniola|  and the  |County_of_Gorizia_and_Gradisca|County_Of_Gorizia_And_Gradisca| , as well as of  |Lower_Styria|Lower_Styria|  and southern  |Carinthia|Duchy_Of_Carinthia| .     Slovenes also inhabited most of the territory of the  |Imperial_Free_City|Imperial_Free_City|  of  |Trieste|Trieste| , although representing the minority of its population. Spezialortsrepertorium der Oesterreichischen Laender. VII. Oesterreichisch-Illyrisches Kuestenland. Wien, 1918, Verlag der K.K. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei               In the 16th century, the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  spread throughout the Slovene Lands. During this period, the first books in the Slovene language were written by the  |Protestant|Protestantism|  preacher  |Primož_Trubar|Primož_Trubar|  and his followers, establishing the base for the development of the standard Slovene language. In the second half of the 16th century, numerous books were printed in Slovene, including an integral translation of the Bible by  |Jurij_Dalmatin|Jurij_Dalmatin| . During the  |Counter-Reformation|Counter-Reformation|  in the late 16th and 17th centuries, led by the bishop of Ljubljana  |Thomas_Chrön|Thomas_Chrön|  and Seckau  |Martin_Brenner|:De:Martin_Brenner| , almost all Protestants were expelled from the Slovene Lands . Nevertheless, they left a strong legacy in the tradition of Slovene culture, which was partially incorporated in the Catholic  |Counter-Reformation|Counter-Reformation|  in the 17th century. The  |old_Slovene_orthography|Bohorič_Alphabet| , also known as  |Bohoričs|Adam_Bohorič|  alphabet, which was developed by the Protestants in the 16th century and remained in use until the mid-19th century, testified to the unbroken tradition of Slovene culture as established in the years of the Protestant Reformation.     Between the 15th and the 17th centuries, the Slovene Lands suffered many calamities. Many areas, especially in southern Slovenia, were devastated by the  |Ottoman–Habsburg_wars|Ottoman–Habsburg_Wars| . Many flourishing towns, like  |Vipavski_Križ|Vipavski_Križ|  and  |Kostanjevica_na_Krki|Kostanjevica_Na_Krki| , were completely destroyed by incursions of the  |Ottoman_Army|Ottoman_Army| , and never recovered. The nobility of the Slovene-inhabited provinces had an important role in the fight against the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . The  |Carniola|Carniola| n noblemens army thus defeated the Ottomans in the  |Battle_of_Sisak|Battle_Of_Sisak|  of 1593, marking the end of the immediate Ottoman threat to the Slovene Lands, although sporadic Ottoman incursions continued well into the 17th century.        In the 16th and 17th centuries, the western Slovene regions became the battlefield of the wars between the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  and the  |Venetian_Republic|Venetian_Republic| , most notably the  |War_of_Gradisca|War_Of_Gradisca| , which was largely fought in the Slovene  |Goriška|Goriška|  region. Between the late 15th and early 18th centuries, the Slovene lands also witnessed many peasant wars, the best-known being the  |Carinthian_Peasant_Revolt|Carinthian_Peasant_Revolt|  of 1478, the  |Slovene_Peasant_Revolt|Slovene_Peasant_Revolt|  of 1515, the  |Croatian–Slovene_Peasant_Revolt|Croatian–Slovene_Peasant_Revolt|  of 1573, the  |Second_Slovene_Peasant_Revolt|Second_Slovene_Peasant_Revolt|  of 1635, and the  |Tolmin_Peasant_Revolt|Tolmin_Peasant_Revolt|  of 1713.     The late 17th century was also marked by a vivid intellectual and artistic activity. Many  |Italian_Baroque|Italian_Baroque|  artists, mostly architects and musicians, settled in the Slovene Lands, and contributed greatly to the development of the local culture. Artists like  |Francesco_Robba|Francesco_Robba| ,  |Andrea_Pozzo|Andrea_Pozzo| ,  |Vittore_Carpaccio|Vittore_Carpaccio|  and  |Giulio_Quaglio|Giulio_Quaglio_The_Elder|  worked in the Slovenian territory, while scientists such as  |Johann_Weikhard_von_Valvasor|Johann_Weikhard_Von_Valvasor|  and  |Johannes_Gregorius_Thalnitscher|Johannes_Gregorius_Thalnitscher|  contributed to the development of the scholarly activities. By the early 18th century, however, the region entered another period of stagnation, which was slowly overcome only by the mid-18th century.               Between the early 18th century and early 19th century, the Slovene lands experienced a period of peace, with a moderate economic recovery starting from mid-18th century onward. The  |Adriatic|Adriatic|  city of  |Trieste|Trieste|  was declared a  |free_port|Free_Port|  in 1718, boosting the economic activity throughout the western parts of the Slovene Lands. The political, administrative and economic reforms of the Habsburg rulers  |Maria_Theresa_of_Austria|Maria_Theresa_Of_Austria|  and  |Joseph_II|Joseph_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  improved the economic situation of the peasantry, and were well received by the emerging bourgeoisie, which was however still weak.     In the late 18th century, a process of  |standardarization|Standard_Language|  of Slovene language began, promoted by  |Carniola|Carniola| n clergymen like  |Marko_Pohlin|Marko_Pohlin|  and  |Jurij_Japelj|Jurij_Japelj| . During the same period, peasant-writers began using and promoting the Slovene  |vernacular|Vernacular|  in the countryside. This popular movement, known as  bukovnik i, started among  |Carinthian_Slovenes|Carinthian_Slovenes|  as part a wider revival of Slovene literature. The Slovene cultural tradition was strongly reinforced in the  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  period in the 18th century by the endeavours of the  |Zois_Circle|Sigmund_Zois| . After two centuries of stagnation,  |Slovene_literature|Slovene_Literature|  emerged again, most notably in the works of the playwright  |Anton_Tomaž_Linhart|Anton_Tomaž_Linhart|  and the poet  |Valentin_Vodnik|Valentin_Vodnik| . However, German remained the main language of culture, administration and education well into the 19th century.     Between 1805 and 1813, the Slovene-settled territory was part of the  |Illyrian_Provinces|Illyrian_Provinces| , an autonomous province of the Napoleonic  |French_Empire|First_French_Empire| , the capital of which was established at  |Ljubljana|Ljubljana| . Although the French rule in the  |Illyrian_Provinces|Illyrian_Provinces|  was short-lived it significantly contributed to greater national self-confidence and awareness of freedoms. The French did not entirely abolish the  |feudal_system|Feudal_System| , their rule familiarised in more detail the inhabitants of the  |Illyrian_Provinces|Illyrian_Provinces|  with the achievements of the  |French_revolution|French_Revolution|  and with contemporary  |bourgeois_society|Bourgeois_Society| . They introduced equality before the law, compulsory  |military_service|Military_Service|  and a uniform tax system, and also abolished certain tax privileges, introduced modern administration, separated powers between the state and the Church, and nationalised the judiciary.      In August 1813, Austria declared war on France. Austrian troops led by General  |Franz_Tomassich|Franz_Tomassich|  invaded the Illyrian Provinces. After this short  |French_interim|First_French_Empire|  all Slovene Lands were, once again, included in the  |Austrian_Empire|Austrian_Empire| . Slowly, a distinct Slovene national consciousness developed, and the quest for a political unification of all Slovenes became widespread. In the 1820s and 1840s, the interest in Slovene language and folklore grew enormously, with numerous philologists collecting folk songs and advancing the first steps towards a standardization of the language. A small number of Slovene activist, mostly from  |Styria|Lower_Styria|  and  |Carinthia|Carinthia| , embraced the  |Illyrian_movement|Illyrian_Movement|  that started in neighboring  |Croatia|Croatia|  and aimed at uniting all South Slavic peoples.  |Pan-Slavic|Pan-Slavic|  and  |Austro-Slavic|Austro-Slavism|  ideas also gained importance. However, the intellectual circle around the philologist  |Matija_Čop|Matija_Čop|  and the Romantic poet  |France_Prešeren|France_Prešeren|  was influential in affirming the idea of Slovene linguistic and cultural individuality, refusing the idea of merging the Slovenes into a wider Slavic nation.     In 1848, a mass political and popular movement for the  |United_Slovenia|United_Slovenia|   emerged as part of the  |Spring_of_Nations|Revolutions_Of_1848|  movement within the Austrian Empire. Slovene activists demanded a unification of all Slovene-speaking territories in a unified and autonomous Slovene kingdom within the Austrian Empire. Although the project failed, it served as an almost undisputed platform of Slovene political activity in the following decades.                  Between 1848 and 1918, numerous institutions were founded in the so-called  |Slovene_National_Awakening|Slovene_National_Awakening| . Despite their political and institutional fragmentation and lack of proper political representation, the Slovenes were able to establish a functioning national infrastructure.     With the introduction of a constitution granting civil and political liberties in the Austrian Empire in 1860, the Slovene national movement gained force. Despite its internal differentiation among the conservative  |Old_Slovenes|Old_Slovenes|  and the progressive  |Young_Slovenes|Young_Slovenes| , the Slovene nationals defended similar programs, calling for a cultural and political autonomy of the Slovene people. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, a series of mass rallies called  tabori , modeled on the Irish  |monster_meetings|Monster_Meetings| , were organized in support of the United Slovenia program. These rallies, attended by thousands of people, proved the allegiance of wider strata of the Slovene population to the ideas of national emancipation.     By the end of the 19th century, Slovenes had established a standardized literary language, and a thriving civil society. Literacy levels were among the highest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and numerous national associations were present at grassroots level. Bojan Balkovec et al. eds, Slovenska kronika XX stoletja, vol. 1 The idea of a common political entity of all  |South_Slavs|South_Slavs| , known as  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia| , emerged.  |Lojze_Ude|Lojze_Ude| , Slovenci in jugoslovanska skupnost .     Since the 1880s, a fierce  |culture_war|Culture_War|  between Catholic traditionalists and  |integralists|Integralism|  on one side, and liberals, progressivists and  |anticlericals|Anticlericalism|  dominated Slovene political and public life, especially in  |Carniola|Carniola| . During the same period, the growth of industrialization intensified social tensions. Both  |Socialist|Socialist|  and  |Christian_socialist|Christian_Socialist|  movements mobilized the masses. In 1905, the first Socialist mayor in the Austro-Hungarian Empire was elected in the Slovene mining town of  |Idrija|Idrija|  on the list of the  |Yugoslav_Social_Democratic_Party|Yugoslav_Social_Democratic_Party| . In the same years, the Christian socialist activist  |Janez_Evangelist_Krek|Janez_Evangelist_Krek|  organized hundreds of workers and agricultural  |cooperatives|Cooperative|  throughout the Slovene countryside.     At the turn of the 20th century, national struggles in ethnically mixed areas  dominated the political and social lives of the citizenry. By the 1910s, the national struggles between Slovene and Italian speakers in the  |Austrian_Littoral|Austrian_Littoral| , and Slovene and German speakers, overshadowed other political conflicts and brought about a nationalist radicalization on both sides.     In the last two decades before World War One, Slovene arts and literature experienced one of its most flourishing periods, with numerous talented modernist authors, painters and architects.  |Dušan_Pirjevec|Dušan_Pirjevec| , Ivan Cankar in evropska literatura The most important authors of this period were  |Ivan_Cankar|Ivan_Cankar| ,  |Oton_Župančič|Oton_Župančič|  and  |Dragotin_Kette|Dragotin_Kette| , while  |Ivan_Grohar|Ivan_Grohar|  and  |Rihard_Jakopič|Rihard_Jakopič|  were among the most talented Slovene visual artists of the time.      After the  |Ljubljana_earthquake|Ljubljana_Earthquake|  of 1895, the city experienced a rapid modernization under the charismatic  |Liberal_nationalist|Liberal_Nationalism|  mayors  |Ivan_Hribar|Ivan_Hribar|  and  |Ivan_Tavčar|Ivan_Tavčar| . Architects like  |Max_Fabiani|Max_Fabiani|  and  |Ciril_Metod_Koch|Ciril_Metod_Koch|  introduced their own version of the  |Vienna_Secession|Vienna_Secession|  architecture to Ljubljana. In the same period, the Adriatic port of  |Trieste|Trieste|  became an increasingly important center of Slovene economy, culture and politics. By 1910, around a third of the city population was Slovene, and the number of Slovenes in Trieste was higher than in Ljubljana.  |Boris_M._Gombač|Boris_M._Gombač| , Trst-Trieste – dve imeni, ena identiteta .     At the turn of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of Slovenes emigrated to other countries, mostly to the  |United_States|United_States| , but also to  |South_America|South_America| ,  |Germany|Germany| , Božidar Tensundern, Vestfalski Slovenci  |Egypt|Egypt|   and to larger cities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, especially  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  and  |Vienna|Vienna| . It has been calculated that around 300,000 Slovenes emigrated between 1880 and 1910, which means that one in six Slovenes left their homeland. Such disproportionally high emigration rates resulted in a relatively small population growth in the Slovene Lands. Comparatively to other Central European regions, the Slovene Lands lost demographic weight between the late 18th and early 20th century.       The period between the 1880s and  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  saw a mass emigration from the present-day Slovenia to America. The largest group of Slovenes eventually settled in  |Cleveland,_Ohio|Cleveland,_Ohio| , and the surrounding area. The second-largest group settled in Chicago, principally on the  |Lower_West_Side|Lower_West_Side,_Chicago| . Many Slovene immigrants went to southwestern Pennsylvania, southeastern Ohio and the state of  |West_Virginia|West_Virginia|  to work in the coal mines and lumber industry. Some also went to the  |Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh|  or  |Youngstown,_Ohio|Youngstown,_Ohio|  areas, to work in the steel mills, as well as  |Minnesotas|Minnesota| |Iron_Range|Iron_Range| , to work in the iron mines.     During the First World War, which severely affected Slovenia in particular with the bloody soviet front and the politics of the great powers that threatened to dismantle the Slovene territory between several countries , Slovenes have already tried to regulate their national position in the common state unit Croats and Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy. The demand, known as the May Declaration, was given by the Slovene, Croatian and Serbian parliamentarians in the Vienna Parliament in the spring of 1917. The ruling circles of the Habsburg monarchy initially rejected the request, and subsequent government initiatives for the federalisation of the monarchy was rejected by most Slovenian politicians, which has already leaned towards independence. The preservation of the reformed state was longest defended by the former head of the Slovenian Peoples Party and the last Provincial Commander-in-Chief of Carniola, Ivan Šusteršič, who had few supporters and influence.               The  |Slovene_Peoples_Party|Slovene_Peoples_Party|  launched a movement for self-determination, demanding the creation of a semi-independent South Slavic state under  |Habsburg|Habsburg_Dynasty|  rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the  |Declaration_Movement|May_Declaration| , followed. By early 1918, more than 200,000 signatures were collected in favor of the Slovene People Partys proposal.      During the War, some 500 Slovenes served as volunteers in the Serbian army, while a smaller group led by Captain  |Ljudevit_Pivko|Ljudevit_Pivko| , served as volunteers in the Italian Army. In the final year of the war, many predominantly Slovene regiments in the Austro-Hungarian Army staged a mutiny against their military leadership; the best-known mutiny of Slovene soldiers was the  |Judenburg_Rebellion|Judenburg_Rebellion|  in May 1918.      Following the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire in the aftermath of the  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , a  |National_Council_of_Slovenes,_Croats_and_Serbs|National_Council_Of_Slovenes,_Croats_And_Serbs|  took power in Zagreb on 6 October 1918. On 29 October independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new  |State_of_Slovenes,_Croats_and_Serbs|State_Of_Slovenes,_Croats_And_Serbs| . On 1 December 1918 the  |State_of_Slovenes,_Croats_and_Serbs|State_Of_Slovenes,_Croats_And_Serbs|  merged with  |Serbia|Serbia| , becoming part of the new  |Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats_and_Slovenes|Kingdom_Of_Serbs,_Croats_And_Slovenes| , itself being renamed in 1929 to  |Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia|Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia| .     Slovenes whose territory fell under the rule of neighboring states Italy, Austria and Hungary, were subjected to policies of  |assimilation|Cultural_Assimilation| .       After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in late 1918, an  |armed_dispute_started|Austrian-Slovene_Clashes_In_Carinthia|  between the Slovenes and  |German_Austria|German_Austria|  for the regions of  |Lower_Styria|Lower_Styria|  and southern  |Carinthia|Duchy_Of_Carinthia| . In November 1918,  |Rudolf_Maister|Rudolf_Maister|  seized the in majority German-speaking  city of  |Maribor/Marburg|Maribor|  and surrounding areas of Lower Styria in the name of the newly formed Yugoslav state. The Austrian government of Styria refrained from mililary invention, willing to accept a ceding of lands in accordance with the self-determination of peoples. However, no referendum was held in Lower Styria and lands with German majority such as Maribor/Marbor conquered by forces under  |Rudolf_Maister|Rudolf_Maister|  were awarded to the new state in the  |Treaty_of_Saint-Germain|Treaty_Of_Saint-Germain-En-Laye| .     Around the same time a group of volunteers led by  |Franjo_Malgaj|Franjo_Malgaj|  attempted to take control of southern Carinthia. Fighting in Carinthia lasted between December 1918 and June 1919, when the Slovene volunteers and the regular Serbian Army managed to occupy the city of  |Klagenfurt|Klagenfurt| . In compliance with the  |Treaty_of_Saint-Germain|Treaty_Of_Saint-Germain-En-Laye| , the Yugoslav forces had to withdraw from Klagenfurt, while a referendum was to be held in other areas of southern Carinthia. In October 1920, the majority of the population of southern Carinthia  |voted|Carinthian_Plebiscite|  to remain in Austria, and only a small portion of the province  was awarded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. With the  |Treaty_of_Trianon|Treaty_Of_Trianon| , on the other hand,  |Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia|Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia|  was awarded the Slovene-inhabited  |Prekmurje|Prekmurje|  region, which had belonged to  |Hungary|Hungary|  since the 10th century.        In exchange for joining the  |Allied_Powers|Allies_Of_World_War_I|  in the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , the  |Kingdom_of_Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy| , under the secret  |Treaty_of_London|Treaty_Of_London|  and later  |Treaty_of_Rapallo|Treaty_Of_Rapallo| , was granted rule over much of the  |Slovene|Slovenes|  territories. These included a quarter of the Slovene ethnic territory, including areas that were exclusively ethnic Slovene. The population of the affected areas was approximately 327,000 Lipušček, U. Sacro egoismo: Slovenci v krempljih tajnega londonskega pakta 1915, Cankarjeva založba, Ljubljana.  of the total population of 1.3 million Slovenes. , Italian Historical Society Journal, Vol. 12, No. 2, p. 4            In 1921, against the vote of the great majority of Slovene MPs a centralist constitution was passed in the  |Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats_and_Slovenes|Kingdom_Of_Serbs,_Croats_And_Slovenes| . Despite it, Slovenes managed to maintain a high level of  |cultural_autonomy|Cultural_Autonomy| , and both economy and the arts prospered. Slovene politicians participated in almost all Yugoslav governments, and the Slovene conservative leader  |Anton_Korošec|Anton_Korošec|  briefly served as the only non- |Serbian|Serbs| |Prime_Minister_of_Yugoslavia|Prime_Minister_Of_Yugoslavia|  in the period between the two world wars.     In 1929, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was renamed to  |Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia|Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia| . The constitution was abolished, civil liberties suspended, while the centralist pressure intensified. Slovenia was renamed to  |Drava_Banovina|Drava_Banovina| . During the whole interwar period, Slovene voters strongly supported the conservative  |Slovene_Peoples_Party|Slovene_Peoples_Party| , which unsuccessfully fought for the autonomy of Slovenia within a federalized Yugoslavia. In 1935, however, the Slovene Peoples Party joined the pro-regime  |Yugoslav_Radical_Community|Yugoslav_Radical_Community| , opening the space for the development of a left wing autonomist movement. In the 1930s, the economic crisis created a fertile ground for the rising of both leftist and rightist radicalisms. In 1937, the  |Communist_Party_of_Slovenia|Communist_Party_Of_Slovenia|  was founded as an autonomous party within the  |Communist_Party_of_Yugoslavia|Communist_Party_Of_Yugoslavia| . Between 1938 and 1941,  |left_liberal|Left_Liberal| ,  |Christian_left|Christian_Left|  and  |agrarian|Agrarianism|  forces established close relations with members of the illegal Communist party, aiming at establishing a broad  |anti-Fascist|Anti-Fascist|  coalition.     The main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized among others less developed parts of Yugoslavia became the main center of industrial production: in comparison to  |Serbia|Serbia| , for example, in Slovenia the industrial production was four times greater and even twenty-two times greater than in  |Yugoslav_Macedonia|Republic_Of_Macedonia| .     The interwar period brought a further industrialization in Slovenia, with a rapid economic growth in the 1920s followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the  |1929_economic_crisis|1929_Economic_Crisis| . This development however affected only certain areas, especially the  |Ljubljana_Basin|Ljubljana_Basin| , the  |Central_Sava_Valley|Central_Sava_Valley| , parts of  |Slovenian_Carinthia|Slovenian_Carinthia| , and the urban areas around  |Celje|Celje|  and  |Maribor|Maribor| .  |Tourism|Tourism|  experienced a period of great expansion, with resort areas like  |Bled|Bled|  and  |Rogaška_Slatina|Rogaška_Slatina|  gaining an international reputation. Elsewhere, agriculture and forestry remained the predominant economic activities. Nevertheless, Slovenia emerged as one of the most prosperous and economically dynamic areas in Yugoslavia, profiting from a large Balkan market. Arts and literature also prospered, as did architecture. The two largest Slovenian cities, Ljubljana and Maribor, underwent an extensive program of urban renewal and modernization. Architects like  |Jože_Plečnik|Jože_Plečnik| ,  |Ivan_Vurnik|Ivan_Vurnik|  and  |Vladimir_Šubic|Vladimir_Šubic|  introduced modernist architecture to Slovenia.               With a secret  |Treaty_of_London|Treaty_Of_London|  in 1915, the  |Kingdom_of_Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy|  was promised large portions of Austrian-Hungarian territory by the  |Triple_Entente|Triple_Entente| , in exchange for joining the Entente against the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  in  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . After the Central Powers were defeated in 1918, Italy went on to annex some of the promised territories, after signing the  |treaty_of_Rapallo|Treaty_Of_Rapallo|  with the new  |Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats_and_Slovenes|Kingdom_Of_Serbs,_Croats_And_Slovenes|  in 1920. However, these areas also included a  |quarter_of_Slovene_ethnic_territory|Slovene_Minority_In_Italy|  and approximately 327.000 out of total population of 1.3 million Slovenes, were annexed by the  |Kingdom_of_Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy|  The treaty left half a million Slavs inside Italy, while only a few hundred Italians in the fledgling Yugoslav state . Hehn, Paul N. , Chapter 2, Mussolini, Prisoner of the Mediterranean      |Trieste|Trieste|  was at the end of 19th century de facto the largest Slovene city, having had more  |Slovene|Slovenes|  inhabitants than even  |Ljubljana|Ljubljana| . After being ceded from the multi-ethnic Austria, Italian lower middle class—who felt most threatened by the citys Slovene middle class—sought to make Trieste città italianissima , committing series of attacks, led by  |Black_Shirts|Black_Shirts| , on Slovene shops, libraries, lawyer offices, and the central place of the rival community in  Narodni dom . Morton, Graeme; R. J. Morris; B. M. A. de Vries .,  |Ashgate_Publishing|Ashgate_Publishing| , UK Forced  |Italianization|Italianization|  followed and by the mid-1930s, several thousand Slovenes, especially intellectuals from Trieste region, emigrated to the  |Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia|Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia|  and to  |South_America|South_America| .     The present-day Slovenian municipalities of  |Idrija|Idrija| ,  |Ajdovščina|Ajdovščina| ,  |Vipava|Vipava,_Slovenia| ,  |Kanal|Kanal_Ob_Soči| ,  |Postojna|Postojna| ,  |Pivka|Pivka| , and  |Ilirska_Bistrica|Ilirska_Bistrica| , were subjected to forced  |Italianization|Italianization| . The  |Slovene_minority_in_Italy|Slovene_Minority_In_Italy|  lacked any minority protection under international or domestic law.  Clashes between the Italian authorities and  |Fascist_squads|Blackshirts|  on one side, and the local Slovene population on the other, started as early as 1920, culminating with the burning of the  |Narodni_dom|Narodni_Dom| , the Slovenian National Hall of  |Trieste|Trieste| . After all Slovene minority organizations in Italy had been suppressed, the  |militant_anti-fascist|Militant_Anti-Fascist|  organization  |TIGR|Tigr|  was formed in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence. The anti-Fascist guerrilla movement continued throughout the late 1920s and 1930s.       When Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania joined the  |Tripartite_pact|Tripartite_Pact|  in 1940, pressure greatly increased on Yugoslavia to join in as Hitler was trying to protect its southern flank before  |launching_the_attack_on_the_Soviet_Union|Operation_Barbarossa| . The signing of the Treaty of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with Germany on March 25, 1941, was followed two days later by a coup led by aviation general Dusan Simovic. Regent prince Pavel was thrown out and authority was granted to young Peter. General Simovic took over the provisional administration of the government. Thus, Yugoslavia did not seem to be reliable anymore to Hitler, and so on April 6 1941, according to the operation Marita and without a formal declaration of war, Axis forces invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The attack began with the bombing of Belgrade, killing 20,000 people. The resistance of the Yugoslav royal army was only symbolic, as only half of the recruits were able to collect due to slow mobilization, and the military equipment and doctrine of Serbia from the Balkan wars and the First World War were obsolete. Thus, on April 10, German troops have already reached Zagreb and on April 12 Belgrade. The Italian army launched its attack only on April 11, when Hungary joined. At that time, the German army was already in Karlovac. The Italian army split into two parts: it penetrated the part towards both Ljubljana and beyond via Kočevje, and the second part penetrated via Dalmatia. The German army also broke out of Bulgaria and with the mobilized units easily prevented the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army into the Thessaloniki front.     Shortly after the attack, the National Peoples Council was formed under the leadership of Marko Natlačen, who called for a peaceful handover of weapons and expelled the occupier. After the capitulation of the Yugoslav army, Hungary took over most of Prekmurje. In 1941, five Slovene settlements were established under the authority of NDH: Bregansko selo , Nova vas near Bregana , Jesenice in Dolenjska, Obrežje and Čedem. The territory was about 20 square kilometers, with about 800 inhabitants at that time.   The Italians in the beginning held a moderate policy in their occupied territory. In this way, bilingualism coincided, the Italian language was introduced into schools only as a teaching subject, all non-political, cultural and sports associations allowed it. In the occupied territory, composed of Ljubljana, Notranjska and Dolenjska with approximately 320,000 inhabitants, Italy established the Province of Ljubljana . After the first successful rebel actions of the occupants in the occupied territory, the Italian authorities changed the policy and began the program of ethnic cleansing The execution of this plot led to the expulsion of approximately 35,000 civilians, of whom in the Italian concentration camps, in 1942 and 1943, about 3500 men, women and children died of hunger and disease That this was an attempt to ethnic cleansing, results not only from the very large number of people killed and displaced, but also from the statements and orders of the high Italian officers, and in particular from the content of the notorious 3C circular, signed by General Mario Roatta on March 1, 1942.   The German form of occupation was the tiniest of all three, since they banned all Slovenian newspapers, the German language was introduced into schools as a language, the adults were violently enrolled in the Styrian Homeland Association and the Carinthian Peoples Union or their armed sections. The official language has also become German. They violently took away 600 children who seemed to satisfy the criteria of the Aryan race and assigned them to the Lebensborn organization, they introduced Nazi laws, and later began to mobilize the military, which was contrary to international law, ...     On April 26, 1941, the Anti-Imperialist Front was set up in Ljubljana in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began an armed struggle against the occupiers. The founding groups of the Anti-Imperialist Front were: the Communist Party of Slovenia, part of the Christian Socialists, the democratic part of the Liberal Gymnastical Society Sokol and a part of the cultural workers who were unconnected. In memory of this event was determined April 27 as the day of the resistance against the occupier.     In Volkmerjev prehod in Maribor, on April 29, 1941, two anti-German-style young men under the leadership of Bojan Ilich burned two personal cars of the German Civil Administration. This was the first rebuffing anti-occupation campaign in occupied Slovenia, which was born out of a revolt at the trance, which was visited by Hitler during the three days before that of most of the German Germans. Nazi police closed about 60 young men, but they soon missed them because they could not prove their participation in the fire. On June 22, 1941, the main command of the Partisan forces was established and on the same day, the Secrets of the Liberation Movement OF were published. Subsequently, on November 1, 1941, the Basic Points of the OF, whose points 8 and 9 were written under the influence of the Atlantic Charter, were also published. By the signing of the Dolomite Declaration on March 1, 1943, the leading role in the Liberation Front was taken over by the Communist Party of Slovenia, which in the victorious national liberation struggle itself assumed all power.     In 1943, a liberated territory was formed in Kočevje, where the OF organized the Kočevski Choir, in which it elected the highest organ of the Slovenian state, adopted a decision on joining the Primorska Slovenia and elected a delegation for the II. sitting AVNOJ.     At the end of the war, the Slovene Partisan army, together with the Yugoslav Army and the Soviet Red Army, freed the entire Slovenian ethnic territory. The VOS departments under the command of the Communist Party and the Soviet model, after the end of the war, mostly performed t. i. post-war extrajudicial killings against civilian and military personnel. Up to 600 graveyards have been evacuated so far throughout Slovenia.                Following the re-establishment of Yugoslavia at the end of World War II, Slovenia became part of the  |Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| , declared on 29 November 1943. A socialist state was established, but because of the  |Tito–Stalin_split|Tito–Stalin_Split| , economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the  |Eastern_Bloc|Eastern_Bloc| . In 1947, Italy ceded most of the  |Julian_March|Julian_March|  to Yugoslavia, and Slovenia thus regained the  |Slovenian_Littoral|Slovenian_Littoral| . The towns of  |Koper|Koper| ,  |Izola|Izola| , and  |Piran|Piran| , Italian-populated urban enclaves saw mass ethnic Italian and anti-Communist emigration  due to the ongoing  |Foibe_massacres|Foibe_Massacres|  and other revenge against them for  |Italian_war_crimes|Italian_War_Crimes|  and due to their fear of Communism, which by 1947 had  |nationalised|Nationalisation|  all private property.     The dispute over the port of  |Trieste|Trieste|  however remained opened until 1954, until the short-lived  |Free_Territory_of_Trieste|Free_Territory_Of_Trieste|  was divided among Italy and Yugoslavia, thus giving Slovenia access to the sea. This division was ratified only in 1975 with the  |Treaty_of_Osimo|Treaty_Of_Osimo| , which gave a final legal sanction to Slovenias long disputed western border. From the 1950s, the  |Socialist_Republic_of_Slovenia|Socialist_Republic_Of_Slovenia|  enjoyed a relatively wide autonomy.       Between 1945 and 1948, a wave of political repressions took place in Slovenia and in Yugoslavia. Thousands of people were imprisoned for their political beliefs. Several tens of thousands of Slovenes left Slovenia immediately after the war in fear of Communist persecution. Many of them settled in  |Argentina|Argentina| , which became the core of Slovenian anti-Communist emigration. More than 50,000 more followed in the next decade, frequently for economic reasons, as well as political ones. These later waves of Slovene immigrants mostly settled in  |Canada|Canada|  and in  |Australia|Australia| , but also in other western countries.          In 1948, the  |Tito–Stalin_split|Tito–Stalin_Split|  took place. In the first years following the split, the political repression worsened, as it extended to Communists accused of  |Stalinism|Stalinism| . Hundreds of Slovenes were imprisoned in the concentration camp of  |Goli_Otok|Goli_Otok| , together with thousands of people of other nationalities. Among the show trials that took place in Slovenia between 1945 and 1950, the most important were the  |Nagode_Trial|Nagode_Trial|  against democratic intellectuals and left liberal activists and the  |Dachau_trials|Dachau_Trials|  , where former inmates of  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps|  were accused of collaboration with the Nazis. Many members of the Roman Catholic clergy suffered persecution. The case of bishop of Ljubljana  |Anton_Vovk|Anton_Vovk| , who was doused with gasoline and set on fire by Communist activists during a pastoral visit to  |Novo_Mesto|Novo_Mesto|  in January 1952, echoed in the western press.     Between 1949 and 1953, a  |forced_collectivization|Collective_Farming|  was attempted. After its failure, a policy of gradual liberalization was followed.       In the late 1950s, Slovenia was the first of the Yugoslav republics to begin a process of relative pluralization. A decade of  |industrialisation|Industrialisation|  was accompanied also by a fervent cultural and literary production with many tensions between the regime and the dissident intellectuals. From the late 1950s onward, dissident circles started to be formed, mostly around short-lived independent journals, such as  Revija 57  , which was the first independent intellectual journal in Yugoslavia and one of the first of this kind in the Communist bloc,  |Taras_Kermauner|Taras_Kermauner| , Slovensko perspektivovstvo . and  Perspektive  . Among the most important critical public intellectuals in this period were the sociologist  |Jože_Pučnik|Jože_Pučnik| , the poet  |Edvard_Kocbek|Edvard_Kocbek| , and the literary historian  |Dušan_Pirjevec|Dušan_Pirjevec| .       By the late 1960s, the reformist faction gained control of the  |Slovenian_Communist_Party|Slovenian_Communist_Party| , launching a series of reforms, aiming at the modernization of Slovenian society and economy. A new economic policy, known as  |workers_self-management|Workers_Self-Management|  started to be implemented under the advice and supervision of the main theorist of the Yugoslav Communist Party, the Slovene  |Edvard_Kardelj|Edvard_Kardelj| .       In 1973, this trend was stopped by the conservative faction of the Slovenian Communist Party, backed by the Yugoslav Federal government. A period known as the Years of Lead  followed.       In the 1980s, Slovenia experienced a rise of cultural pluralism. Numerous grass-roots political, artistic and intellectual movements emerged, including the  |Neue_Slowenische_Kunst|Neue_Slowenische_Kunst| , the  |Ljubljana_school_of_psychoanalysis|Ljubljana_School_Of_Psychoanalysis| , and the  Nova revija  intellectual circle. By the mid-1980s, a reformist fraction, led by  |Milan_Kučan|Milan_Kučan| , took control of the Slovenian Communist Party, starting a gradual reform towards a  |market_socialism|Market_Socialism|  and controlled  |political_pluralism|Pluralism| .     The Yugoslav economic crisis of the 1980s increased the struggles within the Yugoslav Communist regime regarding the appropriate economic measures to be undertaken. Slovenia, which had less than 10% of overall Yugoslav population, produced around a fifth of the countrys GDP and a fourth of all Yugoslav exports. The political disputes around economic measures was echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenes felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.     In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging  |civil_society|Civil_Society|  and the Communist regime culminated with the  |Slovene_Spring|Slovene_Spring| . In 1987, a group of liberal intellectuals published a manifesto in the alternative  Nova revija  journal; in their so-called  |Contributions_for_the_Slovenian_National_Program|Contributions_For_The_Slovenian_National_Program| , they called for democratization and a greater independence for Slovenia. Some of the articles openly contemplated Slovenias independence from Yugoslavia and the establishment of a full-fedged parliamentary democracy. The manifesto was condemned by the Communist authorities, but the authors did not suffer any direct repression, and the journal was not suppressed . At the end of the same year, a massive strike broke out in the Litostroj manufacturing plant in  |Ljubljana|Ljubljana| , which led to the establishment of the first independent trade union in Yugoslavia. The leaders of the strike established an independent political organization, called the  |Social_Democratic_Union_of_Slovenia|Social_Democratic_Union_Of_Slovenia| . Soon afterwards, in mid May 1988, an independent  |Peasant_Union_of_Slovenia|Peasant_Union_Of_Slovenia|  was organized. Later in the same month, the Yugoslav Army arrested four Slovenian journalists of the alternative magazine  Mladina , accusing them of revealing state secrets. The so-called  |Ljubljana_trial|Ljubljana_Trial|  triggered mass protests in Ljubljana and other Slovenian cities.     A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the  |Committee_for_the_Defense_of_Human_Rights|Committee_For_The_Defense_Of_Human_Rights| , pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms. These revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated by almost one year the  |Revolutions_of_1989|Revolutions_Of_1989|  in Eastern Europe, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.     At the same time, the confrontation between the Slovenian Communists and the Serbian Communist Party , became the most important political struggle in Yugoslavia. The poor economic performance of the Federation, and rising clashes between the different republics, created a fertile soil for the rise of secessionist ideas among Slovenes, both anti-Communists and Communists. On 27 of September 1989 the Slovenian Assembly made many amendments to the 1974 constitution including the abandonment of the  |League_of_Communists_of_Slovenia|League_Of_Communists_Of_Slovenia|  monopoly on political power and the right of Slovenia to leave Yugoslavia.      In an action named Action North in 1989, Slovene police forces, members of which later organized their own veteran organization, prevented several hundred Miloševićs supporters to meet in Ljubljana on 1 December, on a so-called  |Rally_of_Truth|Rally_Of_Truth| , with an attempt to overthrow Slovenian leadership because of its opposition to Serb centralist policy. The action can be considered the first defense action for Slovenian independence.        On 23 January 1990, the  |League_of_Communists_of_Slovenia|League_Of_Communists_Of_Slovenia| , in protest against the domination of the Serb nationalist leadership, walked out of the 14th Congress of the  |League_of_Communists_of_Yugoslavia|League_Of_Communists_Of_Yugoslavia|  which effectively ceased to exist as a national party – they were followed soon after by the  |League_of_Communists_of_Croatia|League_Of_Communists_Of_Croatia| .     In September 1989, numerous  |constitutional_amendments|Constitutional_Amendment|  were passed by the  |Assembly|Assembly_Of_The_Socialist_Republic_Of_Slovenia| , which introduced  |parliamentary_democracy|Parliamentary_Democracy|  to Slovenia.   On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly passed the amendment XCI changing the official name of the state to the  |Republic_of_Slovenia|Republic_Of_Slovenia|  dropping the word Socialist. The new name has been official since 8 March 1990.                  On 30 December 1989 Slovenia officially opened the spring 1990 elections to opposition parties thus inaugurating  |multi-party_democracy|Multi-Party_Democracy| . The Democratic Opposition of Slovenia coalition of democratic political parties was created by an agreement between the  |Slovenian_Democratic_Union|Slovenian_Democratic_Union| , the  |Social_Democrat_Alliance_of_Slovenia|Slovenian_Democratic_Party| , the  |Slovene_Christian_Democrats|Slovene_Christian_Democrats| , the  |Farmers_Alliance|Slovenian_Peoples_Party|  and the  |Greens_of_Slovenia|Greens_Of_Slovenia| . The leader of the coalition was the well-known  |dissident|Dissident| |Jože_Pučnik|Jože_Pučnik| . The A to Z of Slovenia  p. 343     On 8 April 1990,  |the_first_free_multiparty_parliamentary_elections|1990_Slovenian_Parliamentary_Election| , and the first round of the Presidential elections, were held.  |DEMOS|Demos|  defeated the former Communist party in the parliamentary elections, by gathering 54% of the votes. A coalition government led by the  |Christian_Democrat|Slovene_Christian_Democrats| |Lojze_Peterle|Lojze_Peterle|  was formed, and began economic and political reforms that established a  |market_economy|Market_Economy|  and a liberal democratic political system. At the same time, the government pursued the independence of Slovenia from Yugoslavia.      |Milan_Kučan|Milan_Kučan|  was elected President in the second round of the Presidential elections on 22 Apr 1990, defeating the  |DEMOS|Demos_Coalition|  candidate  |Jože_Pučnik|Jože_Pučnik| .           Milan Kučan strongly opposed the preservation of Yugoslavia through violent means. After the concept of a loose  |confederation|Confederation|  failed to gain support by the republics of Yugoslavia, Kučan favoured a controlled process of non-violent disassociation that would enable the collaboration of the former Yugoslav nations on a new, different basis.     On 23 December 1990, a  |referendum_on_the_independence_of_Slovenia|1990_Slovenian_Independence_Referendum|  was held, in which the more than 88% of Slovenian residents voted for the independence of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. Slovenia became independent through the passage of the appropriate acts on 25 June 1991.   In the morning of the next day, a short  |Ten-Day_War|Ten-Day_War|  began, in which the Slovenian forces successfully rejected Yugoslav military interference.  In the evening, the independence was solemnly proclaimed in Ljubljana by the Speaker of the Parliament  |France_Bučar|France_Bučar| . The Ten-Day War lasted till 7 July 1991, when the  |Brijuni_Agreement|Brijuni_Agreement|  was made, with the  |European_Community|European_Community|  as a mediator, and the  |Yugoslav_National_Army|Yugoslav_National_Army|  started its withdrawal from Slovenia. On 26 October 1991, the last Yugoslav soldier left Slovenia.     On 23 December 1991 the Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia passed a new Constitution, which became the first  |Constitution_of_independent_Slovenia|Constitution_Of_Slovenia| .         Kučan represented Slovenia at the peace conference on former Yugoslavia in  |the_Hague|The_Hague|  and  |Brussels|Brussels|  which concluded that the former Yugoslav nations were free to determine their future as independent states. On May 22, 1992 Kučan represented Slovenia as it became a new member of the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| .     The most important achievement of the Coalition, however, was the declaration of independence of Slovenia on 25 June 1991, followed by a  |Ten-Day_War|Ten-Day_War|  in which the  |Slovenia|Slovenia| ns rejected  |Yugoslav|Yugoslavia|  military interference.   As a result of internal disagreements the coalition fell apart in 1992. It was officially dissolved in April 1992 in agreement with all the parties that had composed it. Following the collapse of  |Lojze_Peterles|Lojze_Peterle|  government, a new coalition government, led by  |Janez_Drnovšek|Janez_Drnovšek|  was formed, which included several parties of the former DEMOS.  |Jože_Pučnik|Jože_Pučnik|  became vice-president in Drnovšeks cabinet, guaranteeing some continuity in the government policies.     The first country to recognise Slovenia as an independent country was Croatia on 26 June 1991. In the second half of 1991, some of the countries formed after the collapse of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  recognized Slovenia. These were the Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and Georgia, Ukraine, and Belarus. On 19 December 1991, Iceland and Sweden recognised Slovenia, and Germany passed a resolution on the recognition of Slovenia, realised alongside the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community|  on 15 January 1992. On 13, respectively 14 January 1992, the  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  and San Marino recognised Slovenia. The first transmarine countries to recognise Slovenia were Canada and Australia on the 15, respectively 16 January 1992. The United States was at first very reserved towards the Slovenian independence and recognised Slovenia only on 7 April 1992.     The recognition by the EEC was particularly significant for Slovenia, as in December 1991 the EEC passed criteria for the international recognition of newly founded countries, which included  |democracy|Democracy| , the respect for  |human_rights|Human_Rights| , the government of  |law|Law| , and the respect for the  |national_minority_rights|Minority_Rights| . The recognition of Slovenia therefore indirectly also meant that Slovenia had been meeting the passed criteria.      In December 1992, after the independence and the international recognition of Slovenia, Kučan was elected as the first  |President_of_Slovenia|List_Of_Presidents_Of_Slovenia|  in the  |1992_presidential_election|1992_Slovenian_Presidential_Election| , with the support of the citizens list. He won another five-year term in the  |1997_election|1997_Slovenian_Presidential_Election| , running again as an independent and again winning the majority in the first round.          Drnovšek was the second  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister|  of independent Slovenia. He was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy, transcending ideological and programmatic divisions between parties. Drnovšeks governments reoriented Slovenias trade away from Yugoslavia towards the West and contrary to some other former Communist countries in  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| , the economic and social transformation followed a  |gradualist|Gradualist|  approach.  The Independent Feb 25th 2008 After six months in opposition from May 2000 to Autumn 2000, Drnovšek returned to power again and helped to arrange the first meeting between  |George_W._Bush|George_W._Bush|  and  |Vladimir_Putin|Vladimir_Putin|  .          Drnovšek held the position of the  |President_of_Republic|President_Of_Slovenia|  from 2002 to 2007. During the term, in March 2003, Slovenia held  |two_referendums_on_joining_the_EU_and_NATO|2003_Slovenian_European_Union_And_Nato_Membership_Referendum| . Slovenia joined NATO on 29 March 2004 and the European Union on 1 May 2004.              |Janez_Janša|Janez_Janša|  was  |Prime_Minister_of_Slovenia|Prime_Minister_Of_Slovenia|  from November 2004 to November 2008 for the first time.
