One of the aliens mentally assaults Deanna and also tries to physically assault her in her quarters. She is saved by Worf and one of his security teams. In the film, Star Trek Nemesis, she is mentally violated by Shinzons viceroy, who is also telepathic. This occurs in her quarters when she is with her new husband, Commander Riker; it also occurs in the Star Trek: Nemesis bonus deleted scenes, where she is attacked in the turbolift.

Prior to Deanna Troi, her acting career was going nowhere: What they told us about The Next Generation when we first started was that we were guaranteed 26 episodes. So that was the longest job Ive ever had. She knew little about the Star Trek franchise and at first just thought of it as a good means to pay her bills.      Initially, Sirtis/Trois character was planned as a sexually attractive woman on the show. Gene Roddenberry intended her to have four breasts, before his wife told him this was a poor idea.  Prior to filming, Sirtis was told to lose , but thought to herself that she had to drop even more, and was often wearing plunging necklines and form-fitting dresses. After six years, the producers decided to drop the sexy and brainless Troi and make her a stronger character: I was thrilled when I got my regulation Starfleet uniform... it covered up my cleavage and I got all my brains back, because when you have cleavage you cant have brains in Hollywood... I was allowed to do things that I hadnt been allowed to do for five or six years. I went on away teams, I was in charge of staff, I had my pips back, I had phasers, I had all the equipment again, and it was fabulous. I was absolutely thrilled.
