The Book of Proverbs  is the second book of the third section of the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible|  and a book of the  |Christian|Christianity| |_Old_Testament|Old_Testament| . When translated into  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  and  |Latin|Latin| , the title took on different forms: in the Greek  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  it became Παροιμίαι Paroimiai ; in the Latin  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  the title was Proverbia, from which the English name is derived.     Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a collection of collections relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. It is an example of the Biblical  |wisdom_tradition|Wisdom_Tradition| , and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct. The repeated theme is that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.  Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.            The superscriptions divide the collections as follows:   Proverbs 1–9: Proverbs of Solomon, Son of David, King of Israel   Proverbs 10–22:16: Proverbs of Solomon   Proverbs 22:17–24:22: The Sayings of the Wise   Proverbs 24:23–34: These Also are Sayings of the Wise   Proverbs 25–29: These are Other Proverbs of Solomon that the Officials of King Hezekiah of Judah Copied   Proverbs 30: The Words of Agur   Proverbs 31:1–9: The Words of King Lemuel of Massa, Which his Mother Taught Him   Proverbs 31:10–31: the ideal wise woman .         Proverbs translates to the Hebrew word mashal, but mashal has a wider range of meaning than the short catchy sayings implied by the English word. Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of sayings of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include instructions formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the words of the wise sayings, longer than the Solomonic sayings but shorter and more diverse than the instructions .     The first section consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten instructions , and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom. Proverbs 10:1–22:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first contrasting the wise man and the fool , the second addressing wise and foolish speech. Chapters 25–29, attributed to editorial activity of the men of  |Hezekiah|Hezekiah| , contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor. Chapter 30:1–4, the sayings of Agur , introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance.            It is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a collection of collections relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, mishley shelomoh, Proverbs of Solomon , is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship.     The book is an anthology made up of six discrete units. The first, chapters 1–9, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods. This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings.  The second, chapters 10–22:16, carries the superscription the proverbs of Solomon , which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon. The third unit is headed bend your ear and hear the words of the wise : a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the  |Instruction_of_Amenemope|Instruction_Of_Amenemope| , and may have reached the Hebrew author through an Aramaic translation. Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, these too are from the wise. The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed by the men of  |Hezekiah|Hezekiah|  , indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE. Chapters 30 and 31 are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters.     The wisdom genre was widespread throughout the  |ancient_Near_East|Ancient_Near_East| , and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom. The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction; nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages.               Along with the other examples of the Biblical  |wisdom_tradition|Wisdom_Tradition|  –  |Job|Book_Of_Job|  and  |Ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes|  and some other writings – Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness. Wisdom is as close as Biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of  |ontology|Ontology| ,  |epistemology|Epistemology| ,  |metaphysics|Metaphysics| , and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks.     Proverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions . The reader is told, for example, both to not answer a fool according to his folly , according to 26:4, and to answer a fool according to his folly , as 26:5 advises. More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1–14, the words of Agur, we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom.     The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom . Wisdom is praised for her role in creation . God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos . Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life. Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful .     For the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster. In contrast,  |Job|Book_Of_Job|  and  |Ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes|  appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the wise . Noteworthy also is the fact that the mighty acts of God  which make up Israels history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority , wisdom appeals to human reason and observation.       The pre-Exilic Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an  |assembly_of_subordinate_servant_deities|Heavenly_Host| . The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe: Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields.  Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that Gods Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the  |Epistle_to_the_Colossians|Epistle_To_The_Colossians|  calls Jesus ...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation... , while the  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John|  identifies him with the creative word .     In the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs,  was used both to support and refute the claims of the  |Arians|Arian_Controversy| . The Arians, assuming that Christ could be equated with the Wisdom of God , argued that the Son, like Wisdom, was created , and therefore subordinate to the Creator; their opponents, who argued that the relevant Hebrew word should be translated as begot , won the debate, and the  |Nicene_Creed|Nicene_Creed|  declared that the Son was begotten, not made , meaning that God and Christ were  |consubstantial|Consubstantiality| .
