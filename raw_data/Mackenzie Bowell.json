Attorney General of Manitoba, A.C. 202 .       Bowell and his predecessors struggled to solve this problem, which divided the country, the government, and even Bowells own Cabinet. He was further hampered in his handling of the issue by his own indecisiveness on it and by his inability, as a Senator, to take part in debates in the House of Commons. Bowell backed legislation, already drafted, that would have forced Manitoba to restore its Catholic schools, but then postponed it due to opposition within his Cabinet. With the ordinary business of government at a standstill, Bowells Cabinet decided that he was incompetent to lead and so, to force him to step down, seven ministers resigned and then foiled the appointment of successors.       Though Bowell denounced the rebellious ministers as a nest of traitors, he had to agree to resign.
