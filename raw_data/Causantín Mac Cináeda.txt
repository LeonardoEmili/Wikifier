 or   was a  |king_of_the_Picts|List_Of_Kings_Of_The_Picts| . He is often known as Constantine I in reference to his place in modern lists of  |kings_of_Scots|Kings_Of_Scots| , but contemporary sources described  only as a Pictish king. A son of  , he succeeded his uncle  as Pictish king following the latters death on 13 April 862. It is likely that s reign witnessed increased activity by  |Vikings|Vikings| , based in  |Ireland|Ireland| ,  |Northumbria|Northumbria|  and northern  |Britain|Great_Britain| . He died fighting one such invasion.       Very few records of ninth century events in northern Britain survive. The main local source from the period is the  Chronicle of the Kings of Alba , a list of kings from Cináed mac Ailpín to  |Cináed_mac_Maíl_Coluim|Cináed_Mac_Maíl_Coluim|  . The list survives in the  |Poppleton_Manuscript|Poppleton_Manuscript| , a thirteenth-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added from the tenth century onwards. Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 87–93; Dumville, Chronicle of the Kings of Alba . In addition to this, later king lists survive. Anderson, Kings and Kingship, reproduces these lists and discusses their origins, further discussed by Broun, Irish origins. The earliest  |genealogical|Genealogical|  records of the descendants of Cináed mac Ailpín may date from the end of the tenth century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain. Broun, Irish Identity, pp. 133–164; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 220–221. The Pictish king-lists originally ended with this Causantín, who was reckoned the seventieth and last king of the Picts. Broun, Irish Identity, p. 168–169; Anderson, Kings and Kingship, p. 78     For narrative history the principal sources are the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  and the Irish annals. While  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| n  |sagas|Sagas|  describe events in 9th century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed. Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 277–285; Ó Corrain, Vikings in Scotland and Ireland ... If the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of  |Northumbria|Northumbria|  and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the  |Irish_Sea|Irish_Sea|  and  |Atlantic|Atlantic_Ocean|  coasts—the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland—are non-existent, and  |archaeology|Archaeology|  and  |toponymy|Toponymy|  are of primary importance. Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 12.       Writing a century before Causantín was born,  |Bede|Bede|  recorded five languages in Britain.  |Latin|Latin| , the common language of the church;  |Old_English|Old_English_Language| , the language of the Angles and Saxons;  |Irish|Irish_Language| , spoken on the western coasts of Britain and in Ireland;  |Brythonic|British_Language| , ancestor of the  |Welsh_language|Welsh_Language| , spoken in large parts of western Britain; and  |Pictish|Pictish_Language| , spoken in northern Britain. By the ninth century a sixth language,  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse| , had arrived with the Vikings.       Viking activity in northern Britain appears to have reached a peak during Causantíns reign. Viking armies were led by a small group of men who may have been kinsmen. Among those noted by the Irish annals, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are  |Ívarr|Ímar| —Ímar in Irish sources—who was active from  |East_Anglia|Kingdom_Of_East_Anglia|  to Ireland, Halfdán—Albdann in Irish, Healfdene in Old English— and  |Amlaíb|Amlaíb_Conung|  or Óláfr. As well as these leaders, various others related to them appear in the surviving record. Downham, Smyth, Woolf.     Viking activity in Britain increased in 865 when the  |Great_Heathen_Army|Great_Heathen_Army| , probably a part of the forces which had been active in  |Francia|Francia| , landed in East Anglia. Check Nelson. The following year, having obtained tribute from the East Anglian King  |Edmund|Edmund_The_Martyr| , the Great Army moved north, seizing  |York|York| , chief city of the Northumbrians. Downham, Keynes, Woolf. The Great Army defeated an attack on York by the two rivals for the Northumbrian throne,  |Osberht|Osberht_Of_Northumbria|  and  |Ælla|Ælla_Of_Northumbria| , who had put aside their differences in the face of a common enemy. Both would-be kings were killed in the failed assault, probably on 21 March 867. Following this, the leaders of the Great Army are said to have installed one  |Ecgberht|Ecgberht_I_Of_Northumbria|  as king of the Northumbrians. Downham, Higham, Keynes, O Corrain, Smyth, Woolf. Their next target was  |Mercia|Mercia|  where King  |Burgred|Burgred_Of_Mercia| , aided by his brother-in-law King  |Æthelred_of_Wessex|Æthelred_Of_Wessex| , drove them off. Keynes ...     While the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia and Northumbria were under attack, other Viking armies were active in the far north. Amlaíb and  |Auisle|Auisle|  , said to be his brother, brought an army to Fortriu and obtained tribute and hostages in 866. Historians disagree as to whether the army returned to Ireland in 866, 867 or even in 869. Downham, O Corrain, Smyth, Woolf, AU 866.1. Late sources of uncertain reliability state that Auisle was killed by Amlaíb in 867 in a dispute over Amlaíbs wife, the daughter of Cináed. It is unclear whether, if accurate, this woman should be identified as a daughter of Cináed mac Ailpín, and thus Causantíns sister, or as a daughter of  |Cináed_mac_Conaing|Cináed_Mac_Conaing| ,  |king_of_Brega|King_Of_Brega| . Downham, ??, FAA. While Amlaíb and Auisle were in north Britain, the  Annals of Ulster  record that  |Áed_Findliath|Áed_Findliath| ,  |High_King_of_Ireland|High_King_Of_Ireland| , took advantage of their absence to destroy the  |longphorts|Longphort|  along the northern coasts of Ireland. Byrne? O Corrain? AU 866.4 Áed Findliath was married to Causantíns sister Máel Muire. She later married Áeds successor  |Flann_Sinna|Flann_Sinna| . Her death is recorded in 913. Woolf, AU 913.1, Byrne p. 857, poss. same as Amlaíbs wife.     In 870, Amlaíb and Ívarr attacked  |Dumbarton_Rock|Dumbarton_Rock| , where the  |River_Leven|River_Leven_Dunbartonshire|  meets the  |River_Clyde|River_Clyde| , the chief place of the kingdom of  |Alt_Clut|Alt_Clut| , south-western neighbour of Pictland. The siege lasted four months before the fortress fell to the Vikings who returned to Ireland with many prisoners, Angles, Britons and Picts , in 871. Archaeological evidence suggests that Dumbarton Rock was largely abandoned and that  |Govan|Govan|  replaced it as the chief place of the kingdom of Strathclyde, as Alt Clut was later known. AU 870.6, AU 871.2, Woolf, Downham, Smyth. King  |Artgal_of_Alt_Clut|Artgal_Of_Alt_Clut|  did not long survive these events, being killed at the instigation of Causantín son of Cináed two years later. Artgals son and successor  |Run|Run_Of_Alt_Clut|  was married to a sister of Causantín. AU 872.5, Smyth, Woolf.     Amlaíb disappears from Irish annals after his return to Ireland in 871. According to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba he was killed by Causantín either in 871 or 872 when he returned to Pictland to collect further tribute. Woolf, Downham. His ally Ívarr died in 873. Woolf, Downham, AU 873.3       In 875, the Chronicle and the Annals of Ulster again report a Viking army in Pictland. A battle, fought near  |Dollar|Dollar_Clackmannanshire| , was a heavy defeat for the Picts; the Annals of Ulster say that a great slaughter of the Picts resulted . In 877, shortly after building a new church for the  |Culdees|Culdees|  at St Andrews, Causantín was captured and executed after defending against Viking raiders. Raymond Lamont-Brown, St Andrews: City by the Northern Sea , 9. Although there is agreement on the time and general manner of his death, it is not clear where this happened. Some believe he was beheaded on a Fife beach, following a battle at  |Fife_Ness|Fife_Ness| , near Crail.  |William_Forbes_Skene|William_Forbes_Skene|  reads the Chronicle as placing Causantíns death at Inverdovat , which appears to match the  |Prophecy_of_Berchán|Prophecy_Of_Berchán| . The account in the  Chronicle of Melrose  names the place as the Black Cave, and  |John_of_Fordun|John_Of_Fordun|  calls it the Black Den . Causantín was buried on  |Iona|Iona| .       Causantíns son  |Domnall|Donald_Ii_Of_Scotland|  and his descendants represented the main line of the  |kings_of_Alba|Kings_Of_Alba|  and later  |Scotland|Scotland| .
