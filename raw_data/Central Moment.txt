      In  |probability_theory|Probability_Theory|  and  |statistics|Statistics| , a central moment is a  |moment|Moment|  of a  |probability_distribution|Probability_Distribution|  of a  |random_variable|Random_Variable|  about the random variables  |mean|Mean| ; that is, it is the  |expected_value|Expected_Value|  of a specified integer power of the deviation of the random variable from the mean. The various moments form one set of values by which the properties of a probability distribution can be usefully characterized. Central moments are used in preference to ordinary moments, computed in terms of deviations from the mean instead of from zero, because the higher-order central moments relate only to the spread and shape of the distribution, rather than also to its  |location|Location_Parameter| .     Sets of central moments can be defined for both univariate and multivariate distributions.         The nth  |moment|Moment|  about the  |mean|Mean|   of a real-valued  |random_variable|Random_Variable|  X is the quantity μ n : E n , where E is the  |expectation_operator|Expected_Value| . For a  |continuous|Continuous_Probability_Distribution| |univariate|Univariate| |probability_distribution|Probability_Distribution|  with  |probability_density_function|Probability_Density_Function|  f, the nth moment about the mean μ is   :         n f  x.      For random variables that have no mean, such as the  |Cauchy_distribution|Cauchy_Distribution| , central moments are not defined.     The first few central moments have intuitive interpretations:   The zeroth central moment μ 0 is 1.   The first central moment μ 1 is 0 .   The second central moment μ 2 is called the  |variance|Variance| , and is usually denoted σ 2 , where σ represents the  |standard_deviation|Standard_Deviation| .   The third and fourth central moments are used to define the  |standardized_moments|Standardized_Moment|  which are used to define  |skewness|Skewness|  and  |kurtosis|Kurtosis| , respectively.       The nth central moment is translation-invariant, i.e. for any random variable X and any constant c, we have     :       For all n, the nth central moment is  |homogeneous|Homogeneous_Function|  of degree nOnly for n such that n equals 1, 2, or 3 do we have an additivity property for random variables X and Y that are  |independent|Statistical_Independence| n ∈ .     A related functional that shares the translation-invariance and homogeneity properties with the nth central moment, but continues to have this additivity property even when n  ≥  4 is the nth  |cumulant|Cumulant|  κ n . For n    1, the nth cumulant is just the  |expected_value|Expected_Value| ; for n   either 2 or 3, the nth cumulant is just the nth central moment; for n  ≥  4, the nth cumulant is an nth-degree monic polynomial in the first n moments , and is also a nth-degree polynomial in the first n central moments.       Sometimes it is convenient to convert moments about the origin to moments about the mean. The general equation for converting the nth-order moment about the origin to the moment about the mean is     :                   where μ is the mean of the distribution, and the moment about the origin is given by     :       xm f                For the cases n 2, 3, 4 — which are of most interest because of the relations to  |variance|Variance| ,  |skewness|Skewness| , and  |kurtosis|Kurtosis| , respectively — this formula becomes :,     :     -   which is commonly referred to as     -       :     - 3     +2       :     - 4     + 6     - 3       ... and so on,  following  |Pascals_triangle|Pascals_Triangle| , i.e.     :     - 5     + 10     - 10     + 4       because 5  -     5  -   5   -   4       The following sum is a stochastic variable having a compound distribution     : W   Yi,     where the Yi are mutually independent random variables sharing the same common distribution and M a random integer variable independent of the Yk with its own distribution. The moments of W are obtained as      :     sumi         where     is defined as zero for j0 .         In a  |symmetric_distribution|Symmetric_Distribution|  , all odd central moments equal zero, because in the formula for the nth moment, each term involving a value of X less than the mean by a certain amount exactly cancels out the term involving a value of X greater than the mean by the same amount.
