A fanzine  is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by  |enthusiasts|Fan|  of a particular cultural  |phenomenon|Phenomenon|  for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940  |science_fiction_fanzine|Science_Fiction_Fanzine|  by  |Russ_Chauvenet|Russ_Chauvenet|  and first popularized within  |science_fiction_fandom|Science_Fiction_Fandom| , and from there it was adopted by other communities.     Typically,  |publishers|Publishers| ,  |editors|Editing| , writers and other contributors of  |articles|Article|  or  |illustrations|Illustration|  to fanzines are not paid. Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. Copies are often offered in exchange for similar publications, or for contributions of art, articles, or letters of comment , which are then published.     Some fanzines are typed and photocopied by amateurs using standard home office equipment. A few fanzines have developed into professional publications , and many professional writers were first published in fanzines; some continue to contribute to them after establishing a professional reputation. The term fanzine is sometimes confused with  |fan_magazine|Fan_Magazine|  , but the latter term most often refers to commercially produced publications for  fans.       The origins of amateur  |fanac|Fanac|  fan publications are obscure, but can be traced at least back to 19th century literary groups in the United States which formed  |amateur_press_associations|Amateur_Press_Association|  to publish collections of amateur fiction, poetry and commentary, such as  |H_P_Lovecrafts|H_P_Lovecraft|  United Amateur.      As professional printing technology progressed, so did the technology of fanzines. Early fanzines were hand-drafted or typed on a manual typewriter and printed using primitive reproduction techniques . Only a very small number of copies could be made at a time, so circulation was extremely limited. The use of  |mimeograph_machines|Mimeograph_Machine|  enabled greater press runs, and the photocopier increased the speed and ease of publishing once more. Today, thanks to the advent of  |desktop_publishing|Desktop_Publishing|  and  |self_publication|Self_Publishing| , there is often little difference between the appearance of a fanzine and a professional magazine.                   When  |Hugo_Gernsback|Hugo_Gernsback|  published the first  |science_fiction_magazine|Science_Fiction_Magazine| ,  Amazing Stories  in 1926, he allowed for a large letter column which printed readers addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine. Science fiction fanzines had their beginnings in Serious & Constructive  correspondence. Fans finding themselves writing the same letter to several correspondents sought to save themselves a lot of typing by duplicating their letters.     Early efforts included simple  |carbon_copies|Carbon_Copy|  but that proved insufficient. The first science fiction fanzine,  The Comet , was published in 1930 by the  |Science_Correspondence_Club|Science_Correspondence_Club|  in  |Chicago|Chicago|  and edited by  |Raymond_A_Palmer|Raymond_A_Palmer|  and  |Walter_Dennis|Walter_Dennis| .  The term fanzine was coined by  |Russ_Chauvenet|Russ_Chauvenet|  in the October 1940 edition of his fanzine Detours. Fanzines were distinguished from prozines, : that is, all professional  |magazines|Magazine| . Prior to that, the fan publications were known as fanmags or letterzines .     Science fiction fanzines used a variety of printing methods. Typewriters, school dittos, church mimeos and multi-color letterpress or other mid-to-high level printing. Some fans wanted their news spread, others reveled in the artistry and beauty of fine printing. The  |hectograph|Hectograph| , introduced around 1876, was so named because it could produce up to a hundred copies. Hecto used an  |aniline|Aniline|  dye, transferred to a tray of gelatin, and paper would be placed on the gel, one sheet at a time, for transfer. Messy and smelly, the process could create vibrant colors for the few copies produced, the easiest aniline dye to make being purple . The next small but significant technological step after hecto is the  |spirit_duplicator|Spirit_Duplicator| , essentially the hectography process using a drum instead of the gelatin. Introduced by  |Ditto_Corporation|Ditto_Corporation|  in 1923, these machines were known for the next six decades as Ditto Machines and used by fans because they were cheap to use and could print in color.     The  |mimeograph|Mimeograph|  machine, which forced ink through a wax paper stencil cut by the keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and print in color. The  |electronic_stencil_cutter|Electronic_Stencil_Cutter|  could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeod zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the  |internet|Internet|  made correspondence cheaper and much faster, and the  |World_Wide_Web|World_Wide_Web|  has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.     The printing technology affected the style of writing. For example, there were alphanumeric contractions which are actually precursors to  |leet|Leet| -speak .   |Fanspeak|Fanspeak|  is rich with abbreviations and concatenations. Where teenagers labored to save typing on ditto masters, they now save keystrokes when text messaging. Ackerman invented nonstoparagraphing as a space-saving measure.  When the typist comes to the end of a paragraph, they simply moved the platen down one line.     Never commercial enterprises, most  |science_fiction_fanzines|Science_Fiction_Fanzine|  were available for the usual, meaning that a sample issue will be mailed on request; to receive further issues, a reader sends a letter of comment about the fanzine to the editor. The LoC might be published in the next issue; some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet  |newsgroups|Newsgroup|  and  |mailing_lists|Mailing_List|  today, though at a relatively glacial pace. Often fanzine editors would simply swap issues with each other, not worrying too much about matching trade for trade, somewhat like being on one anothers  |friends_list|Livejournalthe_Word_22Friend_22| . Without being closely connected with the rest of fandom, a budding faned could read fanzine reviews in prozines, and fanzines reviewed other fanzines. Recent technology has changed the speed of communication between fans and the technology available, but the basic concepts developed by science fiction fanzines in the 1930s can be seen online today.  |Blogs|Blog|  – with their threaded comments, personalized illustrations, shorthand in-jokes, wide variety in quality and wider variety of content—follow the structure developed in science fiction fanzines, without realizing the antecedent.     Since 1937,  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  fans have formed  |amateur_press_associations|Amateur_Press_Association|  ; the members contribute to a collective assemblage or bundle that contains contributions from all of them, called  |apazines|Apazine|  and often containing  |mailing_comments|Mailing_Comment| .  Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual e-zines, distributed on the  |Internet|Internet| .  Specific  |Hugo_Awards|Hugo_Award|  are given for  |fanzines|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Fanzine| ,  |fan_writing|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Fan_Writer|  and  |fanart|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Fan_Artist| .       Media fanzines were originally merely a subgenre of SF fanzines, written by science fiction fans already familiar with apazines. The first media fanzine was a  Star Trek  fan publication called  Spockanalia , published in September 1967    by members of the  |Lunarians|Lunacon| .  They hoped that fanzines such as Spockanalia would be recognized by the broader science-fiction fan community in traditional ways, such as a  |Hugo_Award_for_Best_Fanzine|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Fanzine| . All five of its issues were published while the show was still on the air, and included letters from  |D_C_Fontana|D_C_Fontana| ,  |Gene_Roddenberry|Gene_Roddenberry| , and most of the cast members, and an article by future Hugo and Nebula winner  |Lois_McMaster_Bujold|Lois_Mcmaster_Bujold| .     Many other Star Trek zines followed, then slowly zines appeared for other media sources, such as  Starsky and Hutch ,  Man from U.N.C.L.E.  and  Blakes 7 . By the mid-1970s, there were enough media zines being published that  |adzines|Adzines|  existed just to advertise all of the other zines available. Although Spockanalia had a mix of stories and essays, most zines were all fiction. Like SF fanzines, these media zines spanned the gamut of publishing quality from  |digest_sized|Digest_Sized|  mimeos to offset printed masterpieces with four-color covers.     Men wrote and edited most previous science fiction fanzines, which typically published articles reporting on trips to conventions, and reviews of books and other fanzines. Camille Bacon-Smith later stated that One thing you almost never find in a science fiction fanzine is science fiction. Rather ... fanzines were the social glue that created a community out of a worldwide scattering of readers.  Women published most media fanzines, which by contrast also included  |fan_fiction|Fan_Fiction| . By doing so, they fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen.  In addition to long and short stories, as well as poetry, many media fanzines included illustrated stories, as well as stand alone art, often featuring portraits of the show or films principal characters. The art could range from simple sketches, to reproductions of large elaborate works painted in oil or acrylic, though most are created in ink.     In the late 1970s, fiction that included a sexual relationship between two of the male characters of the media source  started to appear in zines. This became known as  |slash|Slash_Fiction|  from the / mark used in adzines to differentiate a K & S story from a K/S story, which would have been one with a romantic or sexual bent between the characters. Slash zines eventually became their own sub-subgenre; in many  |fandoms|Fandoms|  you rarely saw slash and non-slash stories appear in the same zines. By 2000, when web publishing of stories became more popular than zine publishing, thousands of media fanzines had been published;  over 500 of them were k/s zines.     Another popular franchise for fanzines was the  |Star_Wars|Star_Wars|  saga. By the time the film  |The_Empire_Strikes_Back|The_Empire_Strikes_Back|  was released in 1980 Star Wars fanzines had surpassed Star Trek zines in sales. An unfortunate episode in fanzine history occurred in 1981 when Star Wars director  |George_Lucas|George_Lucas|  threatened to sue fanzine publishers who distributed zines featuring the Star Wars characters in sexually explicit stories or art.       Comics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the  |fanzines|Science_Fiction_Fanzines|  of  |science_fiction_fandom|Science_Fiction_Fandom| . Famously, the first version of  |Superman|Superman|  appeared in the third issue of  |Jerry_Siegel|Jerry_Siegel|  and  |Joe_Shusters|Joe_Shuster|  1933 fanzine Science Fiction. In 1936,  |David_Kyle|David_Kyle|  published  The Fantasy World , possibly the first  |comics|Comics|  fanzine. Kyle, David. .  |Mimosa|Mimosa|  no. 24, pp. 25–28. Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started  The Comic Collectors News  in October, 1947.  By 1952,  |Ted_White|Ted_White|  had mimeographed a four-page pamphlet about  |Superman|Superman| , and  |James_Taurasi|James_Taurasi|  issued the short-lived Fantasy Comics. In 1953,  |Bhob_Stewart|Bhob_Stewart|  published The EC Fan Bulletin,  which launched  |EC|Ec_Comics|  fandom of imitative EC fanzines. A few months later, Stewart, White and  |Larry_Stark|Larry_Stark|  produced Potrzebie, planned as a literary journal of critical commentary about EC by Stark. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was  |Ron_Parkers|Ron_Parker|  Hoo-Hah!. After that came fanzines by the followers of  |Harvey_Kurtzmans|Harvey_Kurtzman|   Mad ,  Trump  and  Humbug . Publishers of these included future  |underground_comics|Underground_Comics|  stars like  |Jay_Lynch|Jay_Lynch|  and  |Robert_Crumb|Robert_Crumb| .     In 1960,  |Richard_and_Pat_Lupoff|Richard_A_Lupoff|  launched their  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction_Fandom|  and comics fanzine  Xero . In the second issue, The Spawn of M.C. Gaines by Ted White was the first in a series of nostalgic, analytical articles about comics by Lupoff,  |Don_Thompson|Don_Thompson| ,  |Bill_Blackbeard|Bill_Blackbeard| ,  |Jim_Harmon|Jim_Harmon|  and others under the heading, All In Color For A Dime. In 1961,  |Jerry_Bails|Jerry_Bails|   Alter Ego , devoted to  |costumed_heroes|Superhero| , f became a focal point for superhero comics fandom and is thus sometimes mistakenly cited as the first comics fanzine.     Contacts through these magazines were instrumental in creating the culture of modern  |comics_fandom|Comics_Fandom| |science_fiction_conventions|Science_Fiction_Convention| , but comics fans have developed their own traditions. Comics fanzines often include fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine , interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. During the 1970s, many fanzines  also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.     At times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via prozines, in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers.  The Amazing World of DC Comics  and the Marvel magazine  FOOM  began and ceased publication in the 1970s. Priced significantly higher than standard comics of the period , each house-organ magazine lasted a brief period of years. Since 2001 in Britain, there have been created a number of fanzines pastiching childrens comics of the 1970s, and 1980s . These adopt a style of storytelling rather than specific characters from their sources, usually with a knowing or  |ironic|Irony|  twist.          As with comics zines, horror film fanzines grew from related interest within science fiction fan publications. Trumpet, edited by  |Tom_Reamy|Tom_Reamy| , was a 1960s SF zine that branched into horror film coverage. Alex Somas Horrors of the Screen,   |Calvin_T_Becks|Calvin_T_Beck|  Journal of Frankenstein  and Gary Svehlas Gore Creatures were the first horror fanzines created as more serious alternatives to the popular  |Forrest_J_Ackerman|Forrest_J_Ackerman|  1958 magazine  Famous Monsters of Filmland . Gore Creatures began in 1961 and continues today as the prozine Midnight Marquee.  Garden Ghouls Gazette – a 1960s horror title under the editorship of Dave Keil, then Gary Collins—was eventually headed by the late  |Frederick_S_Clarke|Frederick_S_Clarke|  and in 1967 became the respected journal  Cinefantastique . It later became a prozine under  |journalist|Journalist| - |screenwriter|Screenwriter| |_Mark_A_Altman|Mark_A_Altman|  and has continued as a webzine.      Mark Franks Photon—notable for the inclusion of an 8x10  |photo|Photograph|  in each issue—was another 1960s zine that lasted into the 1970s.  Richard Klemensens  Little Shoppe of Horrors ,  having a particular focus on  |Hammer_Horrors|Hammer_Film_Productions| , began in 1972 and is still publishing as of 2019.     The  |Baltimore|Baltimore| -based Black Oracle from writer-turned- |John_Waters|John_Waters|  repertory member  |George_Stover|George_Stover|  was a diminutive zine that evolved into the larger-format Cinemacabre. Stovers Black Oracle partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine The Late Show , and later became editor of the Cinefantastique prozine spinoff  Femme Fatales . In the mid-1970s,  |North_Carolina|North_Carolina|  teenager  |Sam_Irvin|Sam_Irvin|  published the horror/science-fiction fanzine Bizarre which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right.  Japanese Fantasy Film Journal from the late Greg Shoemaker covered  |Tohos|Toho|   Godzilla  and his Asian brethren when no other publications much cared. In 1993,  G-FAN  picked up where JFFJ left off, and reached its 100th regularly published issue in Fall 2012.  FXRH  was a specialized zine co-created by future  |Hollywood|Cinema_Of_The_United_States| |_FX|Special_Effect|  artist  |Ernest_D_Farino|Ernest_D_Farino| .        By the mid-1960s, several fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born.  |Paul_Williams|Paul_Williams|  and  |Greg_Shaw|Greg_Shaw|  were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams  Crawdaddy!  and Shaws two California-based zines, Mojo Navigator  and  Who Put the Bomp , , are among the most important early rock fanzines.      Crawdaddy!  quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music prozines, with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. Bomp remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including  |Lester_Bangs|Lester_Bangs| ,  |Greil_Marcus|Greil_Marcus| , Ken Barnes,  |Ed_Ward|Ed_Ward| ,  |Dave_Marsh|Dave_Marsh| ,  |Mike_Saunders|Mike_Saunders|  and  |R_Meltzer|Richard_Meltzer| . Bomp featured cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler, both veterans of SF and Comics fandom. Bomp was not alone; an August 1970 issue of  Rolling Stone  included an article about the explosion of rock fanzines. Other rock fanzines of this period include  denim delinquent  1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, Flash, 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, Eurock Magazine edited by Archie Patterson and Bam Balam, written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s,  Back Door Man .     In the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax  Ugly Things , Billy Miller and  |Miriam_Linnas|Miriam_Linna|  Kicks, Jake Austens  Roctober , Kim Coopers  Scram , P. Edwin Letchers  Garage & Beat , and the UKs  |Shindig_|Shindig_|  and Italys  Misty Lane .     In the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of  |Bruce_Springsteens|Bruce_Springsteen|  megastardom following the  Born in the U.S.A.  album and  |Born_in_the_U_S_A_Tour|Born_In_The_U_S_A_Tour|  in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmonds Candys Room, coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan Frenchs Point Blank, Dave Percivals The Fever, Jeff Matthews Rendezvous, and Paul Limbricks Jackson Cage. In the US,  Backstreets Magazine  started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteens management and official website. In the late 1990s, notorious fanzines and e-zines flourished about electronic and  |post_rock|Post_Rock|  music. Crème Brûlée fanzine was one of those that documented post-rock genre and experimental music.                      The  |punk_subculture|Punk_Subculture|  in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK punk zine was  Sniffin Glue , produced by  |Deptford|Deptford_London|  punk fan  |Mark_Perry|Mark_Perry| . Sniffin Glue ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue was produced by Perry immediately following the London debut of  |The_Ramones|The_Ramones|  on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included  Blam! ,  Bombsite , , Burnt Offering,  Chainsaw ,  New Crimes ,  Vague ,  Jamming ,  |Artcore_Fanzine|Artcore_Fanzine| ,  Love and Molotov Cocktails ,  To Hell With Poverty ,  New Youth ,  Peroxide ,  ENZK ,  Juniper beri-beri ,  No Cure , Communication Blur ,  Rox ,  Grim Humour ,  Spuno     ,  Cool Notes  and  Fumes . Of these, Tony Fletchers Jamming was the most far reaching, becoming a nationally distributed mainstream magazine for several years before its demise.       In the US,  Flipside  and  Slash  were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and  |Clinton_Walker|Clinton_Walker|  fused their respective punk zines Plastered Press and Suicide Alley to launch Pulp; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with Fast Forward, in 1980.   Starting earlier, in 1976,  Punk  was published in New York and played a major part in popularizing  |punk_rock|Punk_Rocketymology|   as the term for the music and the bands being written about.     Among later titles,  Maximum RocknRoll  is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as  |Sonic_Youth|Sonic_Youth| ,  |Nirvana|Nirvana| ,  |Fugazi|Fugazi| ,  |Bikini_Kill|Bikini_Kill| ,  |Green_Day|Green_Day|  and  |The_Offspring|The_Offspring| , a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as  Punk Planet ,  Razorcake ,  Tail Spins ,  Sobriquet ,  Profane Existence  and  Slug and Lettuce . The early American punkzine  Search and Destroy  eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine  Re/Search .     Some punk fanzines from the 80s, like No Class fanzine,  and Ugly American  are experiencing a second life by placing all past content online for free and adding new content. For the past 6 years, Suburban Rebels in Northern California has been leading the Punk zine way.     Many of the punk zines were printed in small quantities and promoted the local scene. They were often cheaply photocopied and many never survived beyond a few issues. Their greatest contribution was in promoting punk music, clothing and lifestyle in their local communities. Punk bands and independent labels often sent records to the zines for review and many of the people who started the zines became critical connections for punk bands on tour.         In the UK  Fracture  and  Reason To Believe  were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, but both ended in late 2003.  Rancid News  filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue Rancid News changed its name to  Last Hours  with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. Last Hours still operates as a  |webzine|Webzine|  though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title.  Artcore Fanzine  continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30 year anniversary issues. There are many smaller fanzines in existence throughout the UK that focus on punk.      |Mystic_Records|Mystic_Records| , had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited The Mystic News Newsletter which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine Wild Times and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.       In  |Perugia|Perugia| ,  |Italy|Italy| , Mazquerade ran from 1979 to 1981.      In  |Basilicata|Basilicata| ,  |Italy|Italy| , Raw Art Fanzine ran from 1995 to 2000.      In  |Milano|Milano| ,  |Italy|Italy| , Gorezilla ran from 1988 to 1991.        In the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , the 1979  |Mod_revival|Mod_Revival| , which was inspired by the 1960s  |Mod_subculture|Mod_Subculture| , brought with it a burst of fresh creativity from fanzines, and for the next decade, the youth  |subculture|Subculture|  inspired the production of dozens of independent publications. The most successful of the first wave was Maximum Speed, which successfully captured the frenetic world of a  |mod|Mod|  revival scene that was propelling bands like  |Secret_Affair|Secret_Affair| ,  |Purple_Hearts|Purple_Hearts|  and  |The_Chords|The_Chords|  into the UK charts.     After the genre had started to go out of fashion with mainstream audiences in 1981, the mod revival scene went underground and successfully reinvented itself through a series of clubs, bands and fanzines that breathed fresh life into the genre, culminating in another burst of creative acceptance in 1985. This success was largely driven by the network of underground fanzines, the most important and far reaching of which were Extraordinary Sensations, produced by future radio DJ  |Eddie_Piller|Eddie_Piller| , and Shadows & Reflections, published by future national magazine editor  |Chris_Hunt|Chris_Hunt| . The latter in particular pushed back the boundaries of fanzine production, producing glossy, professionally written and printed publications at a time when most fanzines were produced via photocopier and letraset.       In the UK, there were also fanzines that covered the local music scene in a particular town or city. Mainly prevalent in the 1970s, and 1980s, all music styles were covered, whether the bands were playing rock, punk, metal, futurist, ska or dance. Featured were local gig reviews and articles that were below the radar of the mainstream music press. They were produced using the technology of the time, i.e. typewriter and  |Letraset|Letraset| . Examples include  Bombsite Fanzine  ,  ,  City Fun  , 1984,   No Cure  and  Town Hall Steps  and more recently  |mono_|Mono| , with many more across the country, such as Premonition Tapes Tapezine on cassette and Crime Pays .       Another sizable group of fanzines arose in  |role_playing_game|Role_Playing_Game|  fandom, where fanzines allowed people to publish their ideas and views on specific games and their  |role_playing_campaigns|Role_Playing_Campaigns| . In 1975, was released the apazine  |Alarums_and_Excursions|Alarums_And_Excursions| .      Role-playing fanzines allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control in the hands of the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG fanzines were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork.     A fanzine community developed and was based on sale to a reading public and exchanges by editor/publishers. Many of the pioneers of RPG zinedom got their start in, or remain part of,  |science_fiction_fandom|Science_Fiction_Fandom| . This is also true of the small but still active  |board_game|Board_Game|  fandom scene, the most prolific subset of which is centered around  |play_by_mail|Play_By_Mail_Game| |_Diplomacy|Diplomacy_Game| .     The UK fanzine  |Aslan|Aslan|   was responsible for popularization of  |freeform_role_playing_games|Freeform_Role_Playing_Game|  in the UK.        Video game fanzines first emerged during the  |second_generation_period|Second_Generation_Of_Video_Game_Consoles|  when newsletters for computer user groups and stores were not uncommon, though not always well-known. Subscriber-based newsletters included the well-known  8: 16 , The Video Game Update  and later  Computer Entertainer . The publication,  Joystick Jolter  was the first actual fanzine.     Later, as desktop publishing tools became more accessible, there was an increase in fanzine production. Fanzines generally emphasized either classic gaming , or current gaming . However some fanzines covered both topics . The number of zines grew bigger when video game journalists including  |Arnie_Katz|Arnie_Katz|  and  |Chris_Bieniek|Chris_Bieniek|  used their columns to publish reviews of fanzines that they had been sent at magazines like  Video Games & Computer Entertainment ,  EGM , and  Tips & Tricks . These reviews had the effect of introducing fan editors to each other and creating a fanzine scene.     The video game fanzine diminished greatly in popularity with the rise of the web, though some zines—particularly the classic gaming ones—continued past the mid-90s . The rise of on demand publishing has led to a new outlet for print zines, like  Jumpbutton  and  Scroll .     The video game fanzine era was biggest in the US and Canada, but there were/are zines from other countries too. Video game fanzines in UK have included  Retrogamer ,  Pixel Nation ,  Capcom Fanzine ,  Mercury , and  Super Famicom Mini Mag  among others. Bielby, Matt, ed. Super Express – Fanhunter: Super Plays Fanzine Round-Up.  Super Play . Issue 9, Pg.14. July 1993. . In France fanzines like  Revival  we circulated, and Japan has seen the production of lavish  |doujin|Doujin|  works.     More recently, there has been a mini-resurgence in video game fanzines, with the launch of HyperPlay RPG in 2015 and Switch Player in 2017.
