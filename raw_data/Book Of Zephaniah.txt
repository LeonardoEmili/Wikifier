     The Book of Zephaniah   is the ninth of the  |Twelve_Minor_Prophets|Twelve_Minor_Prophets| , preceded by the  |Book_of_Habakkuk|Book_Of_Habakkuk|  and followed by the  |Book_of_Haggai|Book_Of_Haggai| . Zephaniah means  |Yahweh|Yahweh|  has hidden/protected,  or Yahweh hides .       The books superscription attributes its authorship to Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of  |King_Josiah|Josiah|  son of  |Amon_of_Judah|Amon_Of_Judah|  . All that is known of  |Zephaniah|Zephaniah|  comes from the text.     The name Cushi, Zephaniahs father, means Cushite or  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| n, and the text of Zephaniah mentions the sin and restoration of Ethiopians. ,  While some have concluded from this that Zephaniah was a black Jew, Ehud Ben Zvi maintains that, based on the context, Cushi must be understood as a personal name rather than an indicator of nationality.  |Abraham_ibn_Ezra|Abraham_Ibn_Ezra|  interpreted the name Hezekiah in the superscription as  |King_Hezekiah_of_Judah|Hezekiah| , though that is not a claim advanced in the text of Zephaniah.     As with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars, such as Kent Harold Richards and Jason DeRouchie, consider the words in Zephaniah to reflect a time early in the reign of  |King_Josiah|Josiah|  before his reforms of 622 BC took full effect, in which case the prophet may have been born during the reign of  |Manasseh|Manasseh_Of_Judah|  . Others agree that some portion of the book is postmonarchic, that is, dating to later than 586 BC when the  |Kingdom_of_Judah|Kingdom_Of_Judah|  fell in the  |Siege_of_Jerusalem|Siege_Of_Jerusalem| . Some who consider the book to have largely been written by a historical Zephaniah have suggested that he may have been a disciple of  |Isaiah|Isaiah|  because of the two books similar focus on rampant corruption and injustice in Judah.         If Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, then its composition was occasioned by Judahs refusal to obey its  |covenant|Covenant|  obligations toward Yahweh despite having seen  |Israels|Kingdom_Of_Israel| |exile|Assyrian_Captivity|  a generation or two previouslyâ€”an exile that the Judahite literary tradition attributed to Yahwehs anger against Israels disobedience to his covenant.   In this historical context, Zephaniah urges Judah to obedience to Yahweh, saying that perhaps he will forgive them if they do.              The HarperCollins Study Bible supplies headings for the book as follows:          More consistently than any other prophetic book, Zephaniah focuses on the day of the Lord,  developing this tradition from its first appearance in  |Amos|Book_Of_Amos| .  The day of the Lord tradition also appears in  |Isaiah|Book_Of_Isaiah| ,  |Ezekiel|Book_Of_Ezekiel| ,  |Obadiah|Book_Of_Obadiah| ,  |Joel|Book_Of_Joel| , and  |Malachi|Book_Of_Malachi| . , , , ,      The book begins by describing Yahwehs judgement. The threefold repetition of I will sweep away in  emphasizes the totality of the destruction, as the number three often signifies complete perfection in the Bible. The order of creatures in  is the opposite of the creation order in , signifying an undoing of creation. This is also signified by the way that from the face of the earth forms an  inclusio  around , hearkening back to how the phrase is used in the  |Genesis_flood_narrative|Genesis_Flood_Narrative|  in , , , where it also connotes an undoing of creation.     As is common in prophetic literature in the Bible, a remnant survives Yahwehs judgement in Zephaniah by humbly seeking refuge in Yahweh.  The book concludes in an announcement of hope and joy,  as Yahweh bursts forth in joyful divine celebration  over his people.        Because of its hopeful tone of the gathering and restoration of exiles,  has been included in  |Jewish_liturgy|Jewish_Liturgy| .     Zephaniah served as a major inspiration for the  |medieval|Medieval| |Catholic|Catholic_Church| |hymn|Hymn| |Dies_Irae|Dies_Irae| , whose title and opening words are from the  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  translation of .
