   A narrow-gauge railway  is a  |railway|Railway|  with a  |track_gauge|Track_Gauge|  narrower than  |standard|Standard-Gauge_Railway|  . Most narrow-gauge railways are between  and .     Since narrow-gauge railways are usually built with  |tighter_curves|Minimum_Railway_Curve_Radius| , smaller  |structure_gauges|Structure_Gauge| , and lighter rails, they can be less costly to build, equip, and operate than standard- or  |broad-gauge_railways|Broad-Gauge_Railway|  . Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify the cost of a standard- or broad-gauge line.     Narrow-gauge railways have specialized use in  |mines|Mining|  and other environments where a small  |structure_gauge|Structure_Gauge|  necessitates a small  |loading_gauge|Loading_Gauge| . They also have more general applications. Non-industrial, narrow-gauge mountain railways are common in the  |Rocky_Mountains|Rocky_Mountains|  of the United States and the  |Pacific_Cordillera|Pacific_Cordillera|  of Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the former  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia| , Greece, and  |Costa_Rica|Costa_Rica| . In some countries, narrow gauge is the standard; Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Australian states of  |Queensland|Queensland| ,  |Western_Australia|Western_Australia|  and  |Tasmania|Tasmania|  have a  gauge, and  |Malaysia|Malaysia|  and  |Thailand|Thailand|  have  |metre-gauge_railways|Metre-Gauge_Railway| . Narrow-gauge  |trams|Tram| , particularly metre-gauge, are common in Europe.          A narrow-gauge railway is one where the distance between the inside edges of the rails is less than .  Historically, the term was sometimes used to refer to  |standard-gauge_railways|Standard-Gauge_Railway| , to distinguish them from  |broad-gauge_railways|Broad-Gauge_Railways| , but this use no longer applies.                   The earliest recorded railway appears in  |Georgius_Agricolas|Georgius_Agricola|  1556  De re metallica , which shows a mine in Bohemia with a railway of about  gauge. During the 16th century, railways were primarily restricted to hand-pushed, narrow-gauge lines in mines throughout Europe. In the 17th century,  |mine_railways|Mine_Railway|  were extended to provide transportation above ground. These lines were  |industrial|Industrial_Railway| , connecting mines with nearby transportation points . These railways were usually built to the same narrow gauge as the mine railways from which they developed.        The worlds first  |steam_locomotive|Steam_Locomotive| , built in 1802 by  |Richard_Trevithick|Richard_Trevithick|  for the Coalbrookdale Company, ran on a   |plateway|Plateway| . The first commercially successful steam locomotive was  |Matthew_Murrays|Matthew_Murray| |Salamanca|Salamanca|  built in 1812 for the   |Middleton_Railway|Middleton_Railway|  in  |Leeds|Leeds| . Salamanca was also the first  |rack-and-pinion|Rack_Railway|  locomotive. During the 1820s and 1830s, a number of industrial narrow-gauge railways in the United Kingdom used steam locomotives. In 1842, the first narrow-gauge steam locomotive outside the UK was built for the -gauge Antwerp-Ghent Railway  in  |Belgium|Belgium| . The first use of steam locomotives on a public, passenger-carrying narrow-gauge railway was in 1865, when the  |Ffestiniog_Railway|Ffestiniog_Railway|  introduced passenger service after receiving its first locomotives two years earlier.        Many narrow-gauge railways were part of industrial enterprises and served primarily as  |industrial_railways|Industrial_Railway| , rather than general carriers. Common uses for these industrial narrow-gauge railways included mining, logging, construction, tunnelling, quarrying, and conveying agricultural products. Extensive narrow-gauge networks were constructed in many parts of the world; 19th-century mountain logging operations often used narrow-gauge railways to transport logs from mill to market. Significant  |sugarcane|Sugarcane|  railways still operate in Cuba, Fiji, Java, the Philippines, and Queensland, and narrow-gauge railway equipment remains in common use for building tunnels.       The first use of an  |internal_combustion_engine|Internal_Combustion_Engine|  to power a narrow-gauge locomotive was in 1902.  |F._C._Blake|Francis_Claude_Blake|  built a 7  hp petrol locomotive for the  |Richmond_Main_Sewerage_Board|Richmond_Main_Sewerage_Board|  sewage plant at  |Mortlake|Mortlake| . This  gauge locomotive was probably the third petrol-engined locomotive built.        Extensive narrow-gauge  |rail_systems|Trench_Railways|  served the front-line trenches of both sides in  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .   They were a short-lived military application, and after the war the surplus equipment created a small boom in European narrow-gauge railway building.       Narrow-gauge railways usually cost less to build because they are usually lighter in construction, using smaller  |cars|Railway_Car|  and  |locomotives|Locomotive|  , smaller  |bridges|Bridge|  and  |tunnels|Tunnel|  , and tighter curves.  Narrow gauge is often used in mountainous terrain, where  |engineering|Civil_Engineering|  savings can be substantial. It is also used in sparsely populated areas where the potential demand is too low for broad-gauge railways to be economically viable. This is the case in parts of Australia and most of Southern Africa, where poor soils have led to population densities too low for standard gauge to be viable.     For temporary railways which will be removed after short-term use, such as logging, mining or large-scale construction projects , a narrow-gauge railway is substantially cheaper and easier to install and remove. Such railways have almost vanished, however, due to the capabilities of modern  |trucks|Truck| .     In many countries, narrow-gauge railways were built as branch lines to feed traffic to standard-gauge lines due to lower construction costs. The choice was often not between a narrow- and standard-gauge railway, but between a narrow-gauge railway and none at all.     Disadvantages and solutions        Narrow-gauge railways cannot freely interchange  |rolling_stock|Rolling_Stock|  with the standard- or broad- gauge railways with which they link, and the transfer of passengers and freight require time-consuming manual labour or substantial capital expenditure.  Some bulk commodities, such as  |coal|Coal| ,  |ore|Ore| , and  |gravel|Gravel| , can be mechanically  |transshipped|Transshipment| , but this is time-consuming, and the equipment required for the transfer is often complex to maintain.     If rail lines with other gauges coexist in a network, in times of peak demand it is difficult to move rolling stock to where it is needed when a  |break_of_gauge|Break_Of_Gauge|  exists. Sufficient rolling stock must be available to meet a narrow-gauge railways peak demand , and the surplus equipment generates no cash flow during periods of low demand. In regions where narrow gauge forms a small part of the rail network , extra money is needed to design, produce or import narrow-gauge equipment.     Solutions to interchangeability problems include  |bogie_exchanges|Bogie_Exchange| , a  |rollbock|Rollbock|  system,  |variable_gauge|Variable_Gauge| ,  |dual_gauge|Dual_Gauge|  or  |gauge_conversion|Gauge_Conversion| .       Historically, in many places narrow gauge railways were built to lower standards to prioritize cheap and fast construction. As a result, many narrow-gauge railways have often limited scope for increase in maximum load or speed. An example is the use of low curve radius, which simplifies construction but limits the maximum allowed speed.   In Japan, a few narrow-gauge lines have been upgraded to standard-gauge  |mini-shinkansen|Mini-Shinkansen|  to allow through service by standard-gauge high-speed trains. Due to the alignment and minimum curve radius of those lines, however, the maximum speed of the through service is the same as the original narrow-gauge line. If a narrow-gauge line is built to a higher standard, like Japans proposed  |Super_Tokkyū|Super_Tokkyū| , this problem can be minimized.      If narrow-gauge rails are designed with potential growth in mind , obstacles to future growth would be similar to other rail gauges. For lines constructed to a lower standard, speed can be increased by realigning rail lines to increase the minimum curve radius, reducing the number of intersections or introducing  |tilting_trains|Tilting_Train| .          The heavy-duty  narrow-gauge railways in  |Queensland|Queensland| , South Africa, and New Zealand demonstrate that if track is built to a heavy-duty standard, performance almost as good as a standard-gauge line is possible. Two-hundred-car trains operate on the  |Sishen–Saldanha_railway_line|Sishen–Saldanha_Railway_Line|  in South Africa, and high-speed  |Tilt_Trains|Tilt_Train|  run in Queensland. Another example of a heavy-duty narrow-gauge line is Brazils  |EFVM|Vale_Railroads| .  gauge, it has  |over-100-pound_rail|Rail_Profilenorth_America|   and a  |loading_gauge|Loading_Gaugenorth_America|  almost as large as US non-excess-height lines. The line has a number of  locomotives and 200-plus-car trains. In South Africa and New Zealand, the loading gauge is similar to the restricted British loading gauge; in New Zealand, some  |British_Rail_Mark_2|British_Rail_Mark_2|  carriages have been  |rebuilt_with_new_bogies|Bogie_Exchange|  for use by  |Tranz_Scenic|Tranz_Scenic|  ,  |Tranz_Metro|Tranz_Metro|  , and  |Transdev_Auckland|Transdev_Auckland|  .       Narrow gauges reduced stability means that its trains cannot run at speeds as high as on broader gauges. For example, if a curve with standard-gauge rail can allow speed up to , the same curve with narrow-gauge rail can only allow speed up to .      In Japan and Queensland, recent permanent-way improvements have allowed trains on  gauge tracks to exceed .  |Queensland_Rails|Queensland_Rail| |Electric_Tilt_Train|Qr_Tilt_Train| , the fastest train in Australia and the fastest  gauge train in the world, set a record of .   The speed record for  narrow-gauge rail is , set in South Africa in 1978.         A special  gauge railcar was built for the  |Otavi_Mining_and_Railway_Company|Otavi_Mining_And_Railway_Company|  with a design speed of 137  km/h.    Curve radius is also important for high speeds: narrow-gauge railways allow sharper curves, but these limit a vehicles safe speed.     Gauges     Many narrow gauges, from  gauge and  gauge, are in present or former use. They fall into several broad categories:     4 ft 6 in gauge      track gauge was adopted by early 19th-century railways, primarily in the  |Lanarkshire|Lanarkshire|  area of Scotland.  lines were also constructed, and both were eventually converted to standard gauge.     4 ft and 1200 mm gauge    |City_of_Oxford_Tramways_Company|City_Of_Oxford_Tramways_Company| |Glasgow_Subway|Glasgow_Subway| |Padarn_Railway|Padarn_Railway| |Bradford_Corporation_Tramways|Bradford_Corporation_Tramways| |Keighley_Tramways|Keighley_Tramways| |Wellington_tramway_system|Wellington_Tramway_System| |Saundersfoot_Railway|Saundersfoot_Railway| |Derby_Tramways_Company|Derby_Tramways_Company| |Reading_Corporation_Tramways|Reading_Corporation_Tramways| |Barrow-in-Furness_Tramways_Company|Barrow-In-Furness_Tramways_Company| |Darwen_Corporation_Tramways|Darwen_Corporation_Tramways| |Central_Funicular|Central_Funicular| |Gardena_Ronda_Express|Gardena_Ronda_Express| |Zagreb_Funicular|Zagreb_Funiculartechnical_Characteristics| |Rheineck–Walzenhausen_mountain_railway|Rheineck–Walzenhausen_Mountain_Railway| |Schlossbergbahn|Schlossbergbahn| |Appenzell_Railways|Appenzell_Railwaysoperation| |Stoosbahn|Stoosbahn|         3 ft 6 in gauge       between the inside of the rail heads, its name and classification vary worldwide and it has about  of track.        in  |Algeria|Rail_Transport_In_Algeria|   on the  |Hejaz_railway|Hejaz_Railway|  in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria; only a few lines survive.          As its name implies, metre gauge is a track gauge of . It has about  of track.     According to Italian law, track gauges in Italy were defined from the centre of each rail rather than the inside edges of the rails. This gauge, measured  between the edges of the rails, is known as  |Italian_metre_gauge|Track_Gauge_In_Italy| .               There were a number of large  railroad systems in North America; notable examples include the  |Denver_&_Rio_Grande|Denver_&_Rio_Grande|  and  |Rio_Grande_Southern|Rio_Grande_Southern_Railroad|  in Colorado and the  |South_Pacific_Coast|South_Pacific_Coast_Railroad|  and  |West_Side_Lumber_Co|West_Side_Lumber_Company_Railway|  of California.  was also a common track gauge in  |South_America|South_America| ,  |Ireland|Ireland|  and on the  |Isle_of_Man|Isle_Of_Man| .  was a common gauge in Europe. Swedish three-foot-gauge railways  are unique to that country.       A few railways and tramways were built to  gauge, including  |Nankai_Main_Line|Nankai_Main_Line|  ,  |Ocean_Pier_Railway_at_Atlantic_City|Ocean_Pier_Railway_At_Atlantic_City| ,  |Seaton_Tramway|Seaton_Tramway|   and  |Waiorongomai_Tramway|Waiorongomai_Tramway| .     800 mm, 2 ft 6 in, Bosnian and 750 mm gauge      gauge railways are commonly used for  |rack_railways|Rack_Railway| . Imperial  gauge railways were generally constructed in the former  |British_colonies|British_Colonies| .   |Bosnian_gauge|Bosnian_Gauge|  and  railways are predominantly found in Russia and Eastern Europe.       Gauges such as ,  and  were used in parts of the UK, particularly for railways in Wales and the borders, with some industrial use in the coal industry. Some sugar cane lines in Cuba were .      2 ft and 600 mm gauges         gauge railways were generally constructed in the former British colonies. ,  and  were used in Europe.            Gauges below  were rare.  |Arthur_Percival_Heywood|Arthur_Percival_Heywood|  developed  gauge  |estate_railways|British_Narrow-Gauge_Railwaysestate_Railways|  in Britain and  |Decauville|Decauville|  produced a range of industrial railways running on  and  tracks, most commonly in restricted environments such as underground mine railways, parks and farms, in France. Several  gauge railways were built in Britain to serve ammunition depots and other military facilities, particularly during  |World_War_I|World_War_I|.
