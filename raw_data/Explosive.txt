           An explosive  is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can produce an  |explosion|Explosion|  if released suddenly, usually accompanied by the production of  |light|Light| ,  |heat|Heat| ,  |sound|Sound| , and  |pressure|Pressure| . An explosive charge is a measured quantity of explosive material, which may either be composed solely of one ingredient or be a mixture containing at least two substances.     The potential energy stored in an explosive material may, for example, be    |chemical_energy|Chemical_Energy| , such as  |nitroglycerin|Nitroglycerin|  or  |grain_dust|Grain_Dust| |pressurized|Pressure| |gas|Gas_Compressor| , such as a  |gas_cylinder|Gas_Cylinder|  or  |aerosol_can|Aerosol_Can| |nuclear|Nuclear_Weapon|  energy, such as in the  |fissile|Fissile| |isotopes|Isotope| |uranium-235|Uranium-235|  and  |plutonium-239|Plutonium-239|      Explosive materials may be categorized by the speed at which they expand. Materials that  |detonate|Detonate|   are said to be high explosives and materials that  |deflagrate|Deflagration|  are said to be low explosives . Explosives may also be categorized by their  |sensitivity|Sensitivity| . Sensitive materials that can be initiated by a relatively small amount of heat or pressure are  |primary_explosives|Primary_Explosive|  and materials that are relatively insensitive are  |secondary|Secondary_Explosives|  or  |tertiary_explosives|Tertiary_Explosive| .     A wide variety of chemicals can explode; a smaller number are manufactured specifically for the purpose of being used as explosives. The remainder are too dangerous, sensitive, toxic, expensive, unstable, or prone to decomposition or degradation over short time spans.     In contrast, some materials are merely  |combustible|Combustible|  or  |flammable|Flammable|  if they burn without exploding.     The distinction, however, is not razor-sharp. Certain materials—dusts, powders, gases, or volatile organic liquids—may be simply combustible or flammable under ordinary conditions, but become explosive in specific situations or forms, such as  |dispersed_airborne_clouds|Dust_Explosion| , or  |confinement_or_sudden_release|Gas_Explosion| .          At its root, the history of chemical explosives lies in the history of gunpowder.   During the Tang Dynasty in the 9th century, Taoist Chinese alchemists were eagerly trying to find the elixir of immortality.  In the process, they stumbled upon the explosive invention of gunpowder made from coal, saltpeter, and sulfur in 1044. Gunpowder was the first form of chemical explosives and by 1161, the Chinese were using explosives for the first time in warfare.    The Chinese would incorporate explosives fired from bamboo or bronze tubes known as bamboo fire crackers. The Chinese also used inserted rats from inside the bamboo fire crackers to fire toward the enemy, creating great psychological ramifications—scaring enemy soldiers away and causing cavalry units to go wild.      Though  |early_thermal_weapons|Early_Thermal_Weapons| , such as  |Greek_fire|Greek_Fire| , have existed since ancient times, the first widely used explosive in  |warfare|Warfare|  and  |mining|Mining|  was  |black_powder|Black_Powder| , invented in 9th century in China by Song Chinese alchemists. This material was sensitive to water, and it produced copious amounts of dark smoke. The first useful explosive stronger than black powder was  |nitroglycerin|Nitroglycerin| , developed in 1847. Since nitroglycerin is a liquid and highly unstable, it was replaced by  |nitrocellulose|Nitrocellulose| , trinitrotoluene  in 1863,  |smokeless_powder|Smokeless_Powder| ,  |dynamite|Dynamite|  in 1867 and  |gelignite|Gelignite|  . World War I saw the adoption of TNT in artillery shells. World War II saw an extensive use of new explosives . In turn, these have largely been replaced by more powerful explosives such as  |C-4|C-4|  and  |PETN|Petn| . However, C-4 and PETN react with metal and catch fire easily, yet unlike TNT, C-4 and PETN are waterproof and malleable. Ankony, Robert C., Lurps: A Rangers Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri, revised ed., Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Lanham, MD , p.73.                The largest commercial application of explosives is  |mining|Mining| . Whether the mine is on the surface or is buried underground, the detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space can be used to liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as , mixtures of ammonium nitrate prills and fuel oil  and  of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuels.     In Materials Science and Engineering, explosives are used in  |cladding|Cladding|  . A thin plate of some material is placed atop a thick layer of a different material, both layers typically of metal. Atop the thin layer is placed an explosive. At one end of the layer of explosive, the explosion is initiated. The two metallic layers are forced together at high speed and with great force. The explosion spreads from the initiation site throughout the explosive. Ideally, this produces a metallurgical bond between the two layers.        As the length of time the shock wave spends at any point is small, we can see mixing of the two metals and their surface chemistries, through some fraction of the depth, and they tend to be mixed in some way. It is possible that some fraction of the surface material from either layer eventually gets ejected when the end of material is reached. Hence, the mass of the now welded bilayer, may be less than the sum of the masses of the two initial layers.     There are applications where a shock wave, and electrostatics, can result in high velocity projectiles.                                        An explosion is a type of spontaneous chemical reaction that, once initiated, is driven by both a large exothermic change and a large positive  |entropy|Entropy|  change in going from reactants to products, thereby constituting a thermodynamically favorable process in addition to one that propagates very rapidly. Thus, explosives are substances that contain a large amount of energy stored in  |chemical_bonds|Chemical_Bond| . The energetic stability of the gaseous products and hence their generation comes from the formation of strongly bonded species like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, which contain strong double and triple bonds having bond strengths of nearly 1 MJ/mole. Consequently, most commercial explosives are organic compounds containing  |-NO_2|Nitro_Compound| ,  |-ONO_2|Nitrate|  and  |-NHNO_2|Nitroamine|  groups that, when detonated, release gases like the aforementioned . W.W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd ed., Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pp. 479–480 .     An explosive is classified as a low or high explosive according to its rate of  |combustion|Combustion| , while high explosives  |detonate|Detonation| . While these definitions are distinct, the problem of precisely measuring rapid decomposition makes practical classification of explosives difficult.     Traditional explosives mechanics is based on the shock-sensitive rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrogen to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam.  |Nitrates|Nitrate|  typically provide the required oxygen to burn the carbon and hydrogen fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, carbon and hydrogen contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel and  |ammonium_nitrate|Ammonium_Nitrate| . A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic  |nitric_oxides|Nox| .       The  |chemical_decomposition|Chemical_Decomposition|  of an explosive may take years, days, hours, or a fraction of a second. The slower processes of decomposition take place in storage and are of interest only from a stability standpoint. Of more interest are the other two rapid forms besides decomposition: deflagration and detonation.          In deflagration, decomposition of the explosive material is propagated by a flame front which moves slowly through the explosive material at speeds less than the speed of sound within the substance   |low_explosive|Low_Explosive|  material.          This term is used to describe an explosive phenomenon whereby the decomposition is  |propagated|Wave_Propagation|  by an explosive  |shock_wave|Shock_Wave|  traversing the explosive material at speeds greater than the speed of sound within the substance.   |nuclear_explosives|Nuclear_Explosive| , and abruptly heating a substance to a  |plasma|Plasma|  state with a high-intensity  |laser|Laser|  or  |electric_arc|Electric_Arc| .     Laser- and arc-heating are used in laser detonators,  |exploding-bridgewire_detonators|Exploding-Bridgewire_Detonator| , and  |exploding_foil_initiators|Slapper_Detonator| , where a shock wave and then detonation in conventional chemical explosive material is created by laser- or electric-arc heating. Laser and electric energy are not currently used in practice to generate most of the required energy, but only to initiate reactions.       To determine the suitability of an explosive substance for a particular use, its  |physical|Physics| |properties|Properties|  must first be known. The usefulness of an explosive can only be appreciated when the properties and the factors affecting them are fully understood. Some of the more important characteristics are listed below:          Sensitivity refers to the ease with which an explosive can be ignited or detonated, i.e., the amount and intensity of  |shock|Electric_Shock| ,  |friction|Friction| , or  |heat|Heat|  that is required. When the term  |sensitivity|Wikt:Sensitivity|  is used, care must be taken to clarify what kind of sensitivity is under discussion. The relative sensitivity of a given explosive to impact may vary greatly from its sensitivity to friction or heat. Some of the test methods used to determine sensitivity relate to:    Impact  – Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the distance through which a standard weight must be dropped onto the material to cause it to explode.    Friction  – Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the amount of pressure applied to the material in order to create enough friction to cause a reaction.    Heat  – Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the temperature at which decomposition of the material occurs.     Specific explosives may be idiosyncratically sensitive to such factors as pressure drop, acceleration, the presence of sharp edges or rough surfaces, incompatible materials, or even—in rare cases—nuclear or electromagnetic radiation. These factors present special hazards that may rule out any practical utility.     Sensitivity is an important consideration in selecting an explosive for a particular purpose. The explosive in an armor-piercing projectile must be relatively insensitive, or the shock of impact would cause it to detonate before it penetrated to the point desired. The explosive lenses around nuclear charges are also designed to be highly insensitive, to minimize the risk of accidental detonation.       The index of the capacity of an explosive to be initiated into detonation in a sustained manner. It is defined by the power of the detonator which is certain to prime the explosive to a sustained and continuous detonation. Reference is made to the  |Sellier-Bellot|Sellier-Bellot|  scale that consists of a series of 10 detonators, from n. 1 to n. 10, each of which corresponds to an increasing charge weight. In practice, most of the explosives on the market today are sensitive to an n. 8 detonator, where the charge corresponds to 2  grams of  |mercury_fulminate|Mercury_Fulminate| .       The velocity with which the reaction process propagates in the mass of the explosive. Most commercial mining explosives have detonation velocities ranging from 1800  m/s to 8000  m/s. Today, velocity of detonation can be measured with accuracy. Together with density it is an important element influencing the yield of the energy transmitted for both atmospheric over-pressure and ground acceleration. By definition, a low explosive , such as black powder, or smokeless gunpowder has a burn rate of 171–631  m/s.  In contrast, a high explosive , whether a primary, such as  |detonating_cord|Detonating_Cord| , or a secondary, such as TNT or C-4 has a significantly higher burn rate.           Stability  is the ability of an explosive to be stored without  |deterioration|Chemical_Decomposition| .     The following factors affect the stability of an explosive:    Chemical constitution . In the strictest technical sense, the word stability is a thermodynamic term referring to the energy of a substance relative to a reference state or to some other substance. However, in the context of explosives, stability commonly refers to ease of detonation, which is concerned with  |kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics|  . It is perhaps best, then, to differentiate between the terms thermodynamically stable and kinetically stable by referring to the former as inert. Contrarily, a kinetically unstable substance is said to be labile. It is generally recognized that certain groups like nitro ,  |nitrate|Nitrate|  , and  |azide|Azide|  , are intrinsically labile. Kinetically, there exists a low activation barrier to the decomposition reaction. Consequently, these compounds exhibit high sensitivity to flame or mechanical shock. The chemical bonding in these compounds is characterized as predominantly covalent and thus they are not thermodynamically stabilized by a high ionic-lattice energy. Furthermore, they generally have positive enthalpies of formation and there is little mechanistic hindrance to internal molecular rearrangement to yield the more thermodynamically stable decomposition products. For example, in  |lead_azide|Lead_Azide| , Pb 2 , the nitrogen atoms are already bonded to one another, so decomposition into Pb and N 2 is relatively easy.    Temperature of storage. The rate of decomposition of explosives increases at higher temperatures. All standard military explosives may be considered to have a high degree of stability at temperatures from –10 to +35  °C, but each has a high temperature at which its rate of  |decomposition|Thermal_Decomposition|  rapidly accelerates and stability is reduced. As a rule of thumb, most explosives become dangerously unstable at temperatures above 70  °C.   Exposure to sunlight . When exposed to the  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  rays of sunlight, many explosive compounds containing  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  groups rapidly decompose, affecting their stability.    Electrical discharge .  |Electrostatic|Electrostatic_Discharge|  or  |spark|Electric_Spark|  sensitivity to initiation is common in a number of explosives. Static or other electrical discharge may be sufficient to cause a reaction, even detonation, under some circumstances. As a result, safe handling of explosives and  |pyrotechnics|Pyrotechnics|  usually requires proper  |electrical_grounding|Ground|  of the operator.          The term power or performance as applied to an explosive refers to its ability to do work. In practice it is defined as the explosives ability to accomplish what is intended in the way of energy delivery . Explosive power or performance is evaluated by a tailored series of tests to assess the material for its intended use. Of the tests listed below, cylinder expansion and air-blast tests are common to most testing programs, and the others support specific applications.   Cylinder expansion test. A standard amount of explosive is loaded into a long hollow  |cylinder|Cylinder| , usually of copper, and detonated at one end. Data is collected concerning the rate of radial expansion of the cylinder and the maximum cylinder wall velocity. This also establishes the  |Gurney_energy|Gurney_Equations|  or 2E.   Cylinder fragmentation. A standard steel cylinder is loaded with explosive and detonated in a sawdust pit. The  |fragments|Fragmentation|  are collected and the size distribution analyzed.   Detonation pressure .  |Detonation|Detonation|  pressure data derived from measurements of shock waves transmitted into water by the detonation of cylindrical explosive charges of a standard size.   Determination of critical diameter. This test establishes the minimum physical size a charge of a specific explosive must be to sustain its own detonation wave. The procedure involves the detonation of a series of charges of different diameters until difficulty in detonation wave propagation is observed.   Massive-diameter detonation velocity. Detonation velocity is dependent on loading density , charge diameter, and grain size. The hydrodynamic theory of detonation used in predicting explosive phenomena does not include the diameter of the charge, and therefore a detonation velocity, for a massive diameter. This procedure requires the firing of a series of charges of the same density and physical structure, but different diameters, and the extrapolation of the resulting detonation velocities to predict the detonation velocity of a charge of a massive diameter.   Pressure versus scaled distance. A charge of a specific size is detonated and its pressure effects measured at a standard distance. The values obtained are compared with those for TNT.   Impulse versus scaled distance. A charge of a specific size is detonated and its impulse measured as a function of distance. The results are tabulated and expressed as TNT equivalents.   Relative bubble energy . A 5 to 50  kg charge is detonated in water and piezoelectric gauges measure peak pressure, time constant, impulse, and energy.   ::The RBE may be defined as K x 3   ::RBE K s   ::where K the bubble expansion period for an experimental  or a standard  charge.          In addition to strength, explosives display a second characteristic, which is their shattering effect or brisance , which is distinguished and separate from their total work capacity. This characteristic is of practical importance in determining the effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings,  |grenades|Grenade| , and the like. The rapidity with which an explosive reaches its peak pressure  is a measure of its brisance. Brisance values are primarily employed in France and Russia.     The sand crush test is commonly employed to determine the relative brisance in comparison to TNT. No test is capable of directly comparing the explosive properties of two or more compounds; it is important to examine the data from several such tests  in order to gauge relative brisance. True values for comparison require field experiments.        |Density|Density|  of loading refers to the mass of an explosive per unit volume. Several methods of loading are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and press loading, the choice being determined by the characteristics of the explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average density of the loaded charge can be obtained that is within 80–99% of the theoretical maximum density of the explosive. High load density can reduce  |sensitivity|Sensitivity|  by making the  |mass|Mass|  more resistant to internal  |friction|Friction| . However, if density is increased to the extent that individual  |crystals|Crystal|  are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased load density also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the  |warhead|Warhead| . It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as dead-pressing, in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.        |Volatility|Volatility|  is the readiness with which a substance  |vaporizes|Vaporization| . Excessive volatility often results in the development of pressure within rounds of ammunition and separation of mixtures into their constituents. Volatility affects the chemical composition of the explosive such that a marked reduction in stability may occur, which results in an increase in the danger of handling.       The introduction of  |water|Water|  into an explosive is highly undesirable since it reduces the sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation of the explosive.  |Hygroscopicity|Hygroscopicity|  is a measure of a materials moisture-absorbing tendencies. Moisture affects explosives adversely by acting as an inert material that absorbs heat when vaporized, and by acting as a solvent medium that can cause undesired chemical reactions. Sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation are reduced by inert materials that reduce the continuity of the explosive mass. When the moisture content evaporates during detonation, cooling occurs, which reduces the temperature of reaction. Stability is also affected by the presence of moisture since moisture promotes decomposition of the explosive and, in addition, causes corrosion of the explosives metal container.     Explosives considerably differ from one another as to their behavior in the presence of water. Gelatin dynamites containing nitroglycerine have a degree of water resistance. Explosives based on  |ammonium_nitrate|Ammonium_Nitrate|  have little or no water resistance as ammonium nitrate is highly soluble in water and is hygroscopic.       Many explosives are  |toxic|Toxicity|  to some extent. Manufacturing inputs can also be organic compounds or hazardous materials that require special handing due to risks . The decomposition products, residual solids, or gases of some explosives can be toxic, whereas others are harmless, such as carbon dioxide and water.     Examples of harmful by-products are:   Heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and barium from primers   Nitric oxides from TNT   Perchlorates when used in large quantities     Green explosives seek to reduce environment and health impacts. An example of such is the lead-free primary explosive copper 5-nitrotetrazolate, an alternative to  |lead_azide|Lead_Azide| .  One variety of a green explosive is CDP explosives, whose synthesis does not involve any toxic ingredients, consumes carbon dioxide while detonating and does not release any nitric oxides into the atmosphere when used.          Explosive material may be incorporated in the  |explosive_train|Explosive_Train|  of a device or system. An example is a pyrotechnic lead igniting a booster, which causes the main charge to detonate.       The most widely used explosives are condensed liquids or solids converted to gaseous products by explosive chemical reactions and the energy released by those reactions. The gaseous products of complete reaction are typically  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| ,  |steam|Steam| , and  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| .  Gaseous volumes computed by the  |ideal_gas_law|Ideal_Gas_Law|  tend to be too large at high pressures characteristic of explosions.  Ultimate volume expansion may be estimated at three orders of magnitude, or one liter per gram of explosive. Explosives with an oxygen deficit will generate soot or gases like  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  and  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| , which may react with surrounding materials such as atmospheric  |oxygen|Oxygen| . Attempts to obtain more precise volume estimates must consider the possibility of such side reactions, condensation of steam, and aqueous solubility of gases like carbon dioxide.      By comparison, CDP detonation is based on the rapid reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon with the abundant release of energy. Rather than produce typical waste gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen and nitric oxides, CDP is different. Instead, the highly energetic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon vaporizes and pressurizes excess dry ice at the wave front, which is the only gas released from the detonation. The velocity of detonation for CDP formulations can therefore be customized by adjusting the weight percentage of reducing agent and dry ice. CDP detonations produce a large amount of solid materials that can have great commercial value as an abrasive:     Example – CDP Detonation Reaction with Magnesium: XCO 2 + 2Mg → 2MgO + C + CO 2     The products of detonation in this example are magnesium oxide, carbon in various phases including diamond, and vaporized excess carbon dioxide that was not consumed by the amount of magnesium in the explosive formulation.
