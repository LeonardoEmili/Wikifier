Yoshiyuki Tominos original plot for the anime was considerably much more grim, with Amuro dying halfway through the series, and the crew of the White Base having to ally with Char , but finally having to battle him after he takes control of the Principality of Zeon. The original concept found expression in a series of novels written by Tomino soon after the shows conclusion, and elements of the storyline weaved themselves into  Zeta Gundam  and  Chars Counterattack .     In previous series Tomino worked in, villains were alien agents. Mobile Suit Gundam was the first of his work which featured humans as antagonists. The director commented he wanted to tell a story about war. He aimed to expose thoroughly starting with Japanese aggression in Manchuria in 1939. Tomino did not allow for changes to history and wanted to use the story to make viewers confront the tragic realities of war.

On July 25, 2015, UK anime distributor Anime Limited announced they will release Mobile Suit Gundam in cooperation with Sunrise for the first time in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray.     In both American TV showings and on the international DVD and Blu-ray release, episode 15 was cut out. According to Yoshiyuki Tomino, the removal was made at his request, with the episode becoming a lost episode of sorts, never being dubbed.  The episode remained on the Japanese DVD and Blu-ray releases.       In 1979, before the end of the anime, Yoshiyuki Tomino himself created the first novelizations of the original Gundam anime series. The novels, issued as a series of three books, allowed him to depict his story in a more sophisticated, adult, and detailed fashion. Along with this adaptation came several major changes to the story. For example, Amuro is already a member of the Federation military at the time of the initial Zeon attack on Side 7, and the main characters in the Federation serve on the White Base-class ships Pegasus and Pegasus II rather than the Pegasus-class White Base.  Additionally, the war continues well into the year UC 0080 in the novels, whereas it concludes at the beginning of that year in the anime series. In the novel Amuro Ray is killed in the final attack against the Zeonic stronghold of A Baoa Qu when his RX-78-3 is pierced through the torso by a Rick Doms beam bazooka. This occurs as Chars unit attempts to warn him about Gihrens intention to destroy the fortress and take the Federations offensive fleet along with it. Char and the crew of Pegasus II , along with handpicked men under Kycilia Zabis command, make a deep penetrating attack against the Side 3 and together kill Gihren Zabi, after which Kycilia is killed by Char. Tomino later lamented that had he known that anime ending would be different and that another series would be made, he would not have killed off Amuro in the novels.     The three novels were translated into English by ": null

At the time, there were no officially recognized romanizations of character and mecha names, and a variety of different spellings were being used in the English-language fan community.

        ", a popular French-language singer. He also rendered Zaku as Zak, and Jion as Zeon, instead of Zion, which was in use in some circles. Some North American fans, already attached to particular spellings, took great umbrage at Schodts renditions, forgetting that in the original Japanese most character and mecha names are written in  katakana , and that there were, therefore, no official spellings. Many years later, when the Gundam series was finally licensed in North America, the rights holders came up with a unified list of official spellings for English-language material, and some of these spellings include Schodts renditions, as well as the renditions to which certain North American fans were attached.     In 2004, Frederik Schodt revised his original translation of the books, which had been out of print for nearly a decade. What had been a three volume set in the 1990 Del Rey edition was re-released by Stone Bridge Press as one single volume of 476 pages , titled Mobile Suit Gundam: Awakening, Escalation, Confrontation. Since the rights holders in Japan by this time had created a unified list of romanized character and mecha names, Schodt was able to use it, and Amuros rival in the novel thus became Char and not Sha ; the popular Zeon Mobile Suit, similarly, became Zaku, and not Zak .        Following the success of the Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, in 1981 Tomino reworked the footage into three separate compilation movies. The first two movies, Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam: Soldiers of Sorrow, were released in 1981. The third movie, Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space, was released in 1982.     Each of the three movies is largely composed of old footage from the TV series, however Tomino felt that some things could be changed for the better. Tomino removed several aspects of the show which he felt were still too super robot-esque for the real robot series he intended Gundam to be, such as the Gundam Hammer weapon. The G-Armor upgrade parts were also completely removed and replaced in the narrative by the more realistic Core Booster support fighters, and Hayato receives a RX-77 Guncannon at Jaburo to replace the disadvantaged RX-75 Guntank. The third movie also includes a substantial amount of new footage expanding on the battles of Solomon and A Baoa Qu.     The first Gundam film, upon release on 22 February 1981, drew a large crowd of 15,000 people at its premiere, leading to concerns from police and media that it could lead to social unrest from a riotous crowd.
