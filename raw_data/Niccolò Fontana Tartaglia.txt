     Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia  was an Italian  |mathematician|Mathematician| ,  |engineer|Engineer|  , a surveyor  and a bookkeeper from the then- |Republic_of_Venice|Republic_Of_Venice|  . He published many books, including the first Italian translations of  |Archimedes|Archimedes|  and  |Euclid|Euclid| , and an acclaimed compilation of  |mathematics|Mathematics| . Tartaglia was the first to apply mathematics to the investigation of the paths of cannonballs, known as  |ballistics|Ballistics| , in his  Nova Scientia  ; his work was later partially validated and partially superseded by  |Galileos|Galileo_Galilei|  studies on falling bodies. He also published a treatise on retrieving sunken ships.       Niccolò Fontana was the son of Michele Fontana, a dispatch rider who travelled to neighboring towns to deliver mail. But in 1506, Michele was murdered by robbers, and Niccolò, his two siblings, and his mother were left impoverished. Niccolò experienced further tragedy in 1512 when the King Louis XIIs troops invaded  |Brescia|Brescia|  during the  |War_of_the_League_of_Cambrai|War_Of_The_League_Of_Cambrai|  against Venice. The militia of Brescia defended their city for seven days. When the French finally broke through, they took their revenge by massacring the inhabitants of Brescia. By the end of battle, over 45,000 residents were killed. During the massacre, Niccolò and his family sought sanctuary in the local cathedral. But the French entered and a soldier sliced Niccolòs jaw and palate with a saber and left him for dead. His mother nursed him back to health but the young boy was left with a speech impediment, prompting the nickname Tartaglia . After this he would never shave, and grew a beard to camouflage his scars.      There is a story that Tartaglia learned only half the  |alphabet|Alphabet|  from a private tutor before funds ran out, and he had to learn the rest by himself. Be that as it may, he was essentially self-taught. He and his contemporaries, working outside the academies, were responsible for the spread of classical works in modern languages among the educated middle class.          His edition of  |Euclid|Euclid|  in 1543, the first translation of the  Elements  into any modern European language, was especially significant. For two centuries Euclid had been taught from two  |Latin|Latin|  translations taken from an Arabic source; these contained errors in Book V, the  |Eudoxian|Eudoxus_Of_Cnidus|  theory of proportion, which rendered it unusable. Tartaglias edition was based on  |Zambertis|Zamberti|  Latin translation of an uncorrupted Greek text, and rendered Book V correctly. He also wrote the first modern and useful commentary on the theory. Later, the theory was an essential tool for  |Galileo|Galileo| , just as it had been for  |Archimedes|Archimedes| .     However, his best known work is his treatise  General Trattato di Numeri et Misure published in Venice 1556  1560. This has been called the best treatise on  |arithmetic|Arithmetic|  that appeared in the sixteenth century.  Not only does Tartaglia have complete discussions of numerical operations and the commercial rules used by Italian arithmeticians in this work, but he also discusses the life of the people, the customs of merchants and the efforts made to improve arithmetic in the 16th century.       Tartaglia is perhaps best known today for his conflicts with  |Gerolamo_Cardano|Gerolamo_Cardano| . Cardano cajoled Tartaglia into revealing his solution to the  |cubic_equations|Cubic_Equation|  by promising not to publish them. Tartaglia divulged the secrets of the solutions of three different forms of the cubic equation in verse.  Several years later, Cardano happened to see unpublished work by  |Scipione_del_Ferro|Scipione_Del_Ferro|  who independently came up with the same solution as Tartaglia. As the unpublished work was dated before Tartaglias, Cardano decided his promise could be broken and included Tartaglias solution in his next publication. Even though Cardano credited his discovery, Tartaglia was extremely upset and a famous public challenge match resulted between himself and Cardanos student,  |Ludovico_Ferrari|Ludovico_Ferrari| . Widespread stories that Tartaglia devoted the rest of his life to ruining Cardano, however, appear to be completely fabricated.  |Tony_Rothman|Tony_Rothman| ,  Mathematical historians now credit both Cardano and Tartaglia with the formula to solve cubic equations, referring to it as the  |Cardano–Tartaglia_formula|Cardano–Tartaglia_Formula|  .          Tartaglia is also known for having given an expression  for the  |volume|Volume|  of a  |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron|  as the  |Cayley–Menger_determinant|Cayley–Menger_Determinant|  of the  |distance_values|Distance|  measured pairwise between its four corners:     : V2         0 & d2 & d2 & d2 & 1     d2 & 0 & d2 & d2 & 1     d2 & d2 & 0 & d2 & 1     d2 & d2 & d2 & 0 & 1     1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0         where  is the distance between vertices  and  . This is a generalization of  |Herons_formula|Herons_Formula|  for the area of a  |triangle|Triangle| .
