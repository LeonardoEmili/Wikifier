                                Spica , designated α Virginis , is the brightest object in the  |constellation|Constellation| |Virgo|Virgo|  and one of the 20  |brightest_stars|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  in the  |night_sky|Night_Sky| . Analysis of its  |parallax|Parallax|  shows that it is located 250 ± 10  |light_years|Light_Year|  from the  |Sun|Sun| . It is a spectroscopic  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  and  |rotating_ellipsoidal_variable|Rotating_Ellipsoidal_Variable| ; a system whose two stars are so close together they are egg-shaped rather than spherical, and can only be separated by their  |spectra|Electromagnetic_Spectrum| . The primary is a  |blue_giant|Blue_Giant|  and a  |variable_star|Variable_Star|  of the  |Beta_Cephei_type|Beta_Cephei_Variable| .     Spica, along with  |Arcturus|Arcturus|  and  |Denebola|Denebola|  or  |Regulus|Regulus|  depending on the source, is part of the  |Spring_Triangle|Spring_Triangle| |asterism|Asterism| , and by extension, also of the  |Great_Diamond|Great_Diamond|  together with the star  |Cor_Caroli|Cor_Caroli| .         As one of the nearest massive binary star systems to the Sun, Spica has been the subject of many observational studies.     Spica is believed to be the star that gave  |Hipparchus|Hipparchus|  the data that led him to discover the  |precession_of_the_equinoxes|Axial_Precession| . A  |temple|Temple|  to  |Menat|Menat|   at  |Thebes|Thebes,_Egypt|  was oriented with reference to Spica when it was built in 3200 BC, and, over time, precession slowly but noticeably changed Spicas location relative to the temple.  |Nicolaus_Copernicus|Nicolaus_Copernicus|  made many observations of Spica with his home-made  |triquetrum|Triquetrum|  for his researches on precession.            Spica is 2.06 degrees from the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic|  and can be  |occulted|Occultation|  by the  |Moon|Moon|  and sometimes by  |planets|Planet| . The last planetary occultation of Spica occurred when  |Venus|Venus|  passed in front of the star  on November 10, 1783. The next occultation will occur on September 2, 2197, when Venus again passes in front of Spica. The Sun passes a little more than 2° north of Spica around October 16 every year, and the stars  |heliacal_rising|Heliacal_Rising|  occurs about two weeks later. Every 8 years, Venus passes Spica around the time of the stars heliacal rising, as in 2009 when it passed 3.5° north of the star on November 3.     A method of finding Spica is to follow the arc of the handle of the  |Big_Dipper|Big_Dipper|  to Arcturus, and then continue on the same  |angular_distance|Angular_Distance|  to Spica. This can be recalled by the mnemonic phrase, arc to Arcturus and spike to Spica.       Spica is a close  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  whose components orbit each other every four days. They stay close together enough that they cannot be resolved as two stars through a  |telescope|Telescope| . The changes in the orbital motion of this pair results in a  |Doppler_shift|Doppler_Shift|  in the  |absorption_lines|Absorption_Line|  of their respective  |spectra|Stellar_Spectrum| , making them a double-lined spectroscopic binary. Initially, the orbital parameters for this system were inferred using spectroscopic measurements. Between 1966 and 1970, the  |Narrabri_Stellar_Intensity_Interferometer|Narrabri_Stellar_Intensity_Interferometer|  was used to observe the pair and to directly measure the orbital characteristics and the angular diameter of the primary, which was found to be , and the angular size of the  |semi-major_axis|Semi-Major_Axis|  of the orbit was found to be only slightly larger at .     Spica is a  |rotating_ellipsoidal_variable|Rotating_Ellipsoidal_Variable| , which is a non-eclipsing close binary star system where the stars are mutually distorted through their gravitational interaction. This effect causes the  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  of the star system to vary by 0.03 over an interval that matches the orbital period. This slight dip in magnitude is barely noticeable visually. Both stars rotate faster than their mutual orbital period. This lack of synchronization and the high ellipticity of their orbit may indicate that this is a young star system. Over time, the mutual tidal interaction of the pair may lead to rotational synchronization and  |orbit_circularization|Tidal_Circularization| .     Spica is a polarimetric variable, first discovered to be such in 2016. The majority of the polarimetric signal is the result of the reflection of the light from one star off the other . The two stars in Spica were the first ever to have their reflectivity  measured. The geometric albedos of Spica A and B are, respectively, 3.61 percent and 1.36 percent,  values that are low compared to planets.     The MK  |spectral_classification|Stellar_Classification|  of Spica is typically considered to be an early B-type main sequence star. Individual spectral types for the two components are difficult to assign accurately, especially for the secondary due to the  |Struve–Sahade_effect|Struve–Sahade_Effect| . The  |Bright_Star_Catalogue|Bright_Star_Catalogue|  derived a spectral class of B1 III-IV for the primary and B2V for the secondary, but later studies have given various different values.     The primary star has a  |stellar_classification|Stellar_Classification|  of B1 III–IV. The  |luminosity_class|Luminosity_Class|  matches the spectrum of a star that is midway between a  |subgiant|Subgiant|  and a  |giant_star|Giant_Star| , and it is no longer a  |main-sequence_star|Main-Sequence_Star| . The evolutionary stage has been calculated to be near or slightly past the end of the main sequence phase. This is a massive star with more than 10 times the  |mass_of_the_Sun|Solar_Mass|  and seven times the  |Suns_radius|Solar_Radius| . The  |bolometric_luminosity|Bolometric_Luminosity|  of the primary is about 20,500 times that of the  |Sun|Sun| , and nine times the luminosity of its companion. The primary is one of the nearest stars to the Sun that has enough mass to end its life in a  |Type_II_supernova|Type_Ii_Supernova|  explosion.     The primary is classified as a  |Beta_Cephei|Beta_Cephei_Variable| |variable_star|Variable_Star|  that varies in brightness over a 0.1738-day period. The spectrum shows a  |radial_velocity|Radial_Velocity|  variation with the same period, indicating that the surface of the star is regularly pulsating outward and then contracting. This star is rotating rapidly, with a rotational velocity of 199  km/s along the  |equator|Equator| .     The secondary member of this system is one of the few stars whose spectrum is affected by the Struve–Sahade effect. This is an anomalous change in the strength of the  |spectral_lines|Spectral_Line|  over the course of an orbit, where the lines become weaker as the star is moving away from the observer. It may be caused by a strong  |stellar_wind|Stellar_Wind|  from the primary scattering the light from secondary when it is receding. This star is smaller than the primary, with about 7 times the mass of the Sun and 3.6 times the Suns radius. Its stellar classification is B2  V, making this a  |main-sequence_star|Main-Sequence_Star| .         α Virginis  is the systems  |Bayer_designation|Bayer_Designation| .     The traditional name Spica derives from  |Latin|Latin|  spīca virginis the virgins ear of grain . It was also anglicized as Virgins Spike.    |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer|  cited the name Arista.     Other traditional names are Azimech , from  |Arabic|Arabic|  السماك الأعزل al-simāk al-ʼaʽzal the unarmed simāk ; Alarph  , Arabic for the grape-gatherer or gleaner, and Sumbalet , from Arabic سنبلة‎ sunbulah ear of grain .     In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSNs first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Spica for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.     In Chinese , , meaning  |Horn|Horn|  , refers to an asterism consisting of Spica and ζ Virginis . Consequently, the Chinese name for Spica is .     In Hindu astronomy , Spica corresponds to the Nakshatra Chitrā.       Both American ships USS Spica and USNS Spica were named after this star while USS Azimech , a Crater-class cargo ship , was given one of the stars medieval names.     A blue star represents Spica on the flag of the Brazilian state of Pará . Spica is also the star representing Pará on the Brazilian flag .     A South Korean Girl Group was named after the star.     Spica is a Vocaloid song sung by Hatsune Miku .     In a non-canonical chapter in Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World- , Subaru had a daughter with Rem named Spica.     Spica is the pseudonym of Lili in the childrens manga series,  |Zodiac_P.I.|Zodiac_P.I.|      In his  |Three_Books_of_Occult_Philosophy|Three_Books_Of_Occult_Philosophy| ,  |Cornelius_Agrippa|Cornelius_Agrippa|  attributes Spicas  |kabbalistic|Kabbalistic|  symbol  |Image:Agrippa1531_Spica.png|Image:Agrippa1531_Spica.Png|  to  |Hermes_Trismegistus|Hermes_Trismegistus|.
