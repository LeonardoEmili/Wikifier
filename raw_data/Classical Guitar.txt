The classical guitar  is a member of the  |guitar|Guitar|  family used in  |classical_music|Classical_Music| . An acoustic wooden  |string|String|  instrument with strings made of  |gut|Catgut|  or  |nylon|Nylon| , it is a precursor of the  |acoustic|Acoustic_Guitar|  and  |electric_guitars|Electric_Guitars|  which use metal  |strings|String| . Classical guitars are derived from the Spanish  |vihuela|Vihuela|  and  |gittern|Gittern|  in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, which later evolved into the seventeenth and eighteenth century  |Baroque_guitar|Baroque_Guitar|  and later the modern classical guitar in the mid nineteenth century.     For a right-handed player, the traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is properly held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the sound hole . The modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body  and is commonly played off the hip.     The phrase classical guitar may refer to either of two concepts other than the instrument itself:   the instrumental finger technique common to classical guitar—individual strings plucked with the fingernails or, rarely, fingertips.   the instruments classical music repertoire     The term modern classical guitar is sometimes used to distinguish the classical guitar from older forms of guitar, which are in their broadest sense also called classical, or more specifically, early guitars. Examples of early guitars include the six-string early romantic guitar , and the earlier baroque guitars with five  |courses|Course| .     The materials and the methods of classical guitar construction may vary, but the typical shape is either modern classical guitar or that historic classical guitar similar to the early romantic guitars of France and Italy.  |Classical_guitar_strings|Classical_Guitar_Strings|  once made of  |gut|Catgut|  are now made of such polymers as  |nylon|Nylon| , with fine wire wound about the acoustically lower strings.     A guitar family tree may be identified. The  |flamenco_guitar|Flamenco_Guitar|  derives from the modern classical, but has differences in material, construction and sound.       Todays modern classical guitar was established by the late designs of the 19th-century Spanish  |luthier|Luthier| ,  |Antonio_Torres_Jurado|Antonio_Torres_Jurado| .
