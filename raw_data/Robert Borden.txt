      Sir Robert Laird Borden,  was a  |Canadian|Canadians|  lawyer and politician who served as the eighth  |prime_minister_of_Canada|Prime_Minister_Of_Canada| , in office from 1911 to 1920. He is best known for his leadership of  |Canada_during_World_War_I|Canada_During_World_War_I| .     Borden was born in  |Grand-Pré,_Nova_Scotia|Grand-Pré,_Nova_Scotia| . He worked as a schoolteacher for a period and then served his  |articles_of_clerkship|Articled_Clerk|  at a  |Halifax|Halifax,_Nova_Scotia|  law firm. He was  |called_to_the_bar|Call_To_The_Bar|  in 1878, and soon became one of Nova Scotias most prominent barristers. Borden was elected to the  |House_of_Commons_of_Canada|House_Of_Commons_Of_Canada|  in 1896, representing the  |Conservative_Party|Conservative_Party_Of_Canada| . He replaced  |Charles_Tupper|Charles_Tupper|  as party leader in 1901, and became prime minister after the partys victory at the  |1911_federal_election|1911_Canadian_Federal_Election| .     As prime minister, Borden led Canada through World War I and its immediate aftermath. His government passed the  War Measures Act , created the  |Canadian_Expeditionary_Force|Canadian_Expeditionary_Force| , and eventually introduced  |compulsory_military_service|Military_Service_Act| , which sparked the  |1917_conscription_crisis|Conscription_Crisis_Of_1917| . On the home front, it dealt with the consequences of the  |Halifax_Explosion|Halifax_Explosion| , introduced  |womens_suffrage|Womens_Suffrage_In_Canada|  for federal elections, and used the  |North-West_Mounted_Police|North-West_Mounted_Police|  to break up the 1919  |Winnipeg_general_strike|Winnipeg_General_Strike| . For the  |1917_federal_election|1917_Canadian_Federal_Election|  , Borden created the  |Unionist_Party|Unionist_Party| , an amalgam of Conservatives and pro-conscription  |Liberals|Liberal_Party_Of_Canada| ; his government was re-elected with an overwhelming majority.     Borden retired from politics in 1920, having accepted a knighthood in 1915 – the last Canadian prime minister to be knighted. He was also the last prime minister born before  |Confederation|Canadian_Confederation| , and is the most recent Nova Scotian to hold the office. His portrait has appeared on  |Canadian_one_hundred-dollar_notes|Canadian_Hundred-Dollar_Note|  produced since 1976, but in late 2016 the government announced Bordens image would be removed during the next redesign.        Robert Laird Borden was born and educated in  |Grand-Pré,_Nova_Scotia|Grand-Pré,_Nova_Scotia| , a farming community at the eastern end of the  |Annapolis_Valley|Annapolis_Valley| , where his great-grandfather Perry Borden, Sr. of  |Tiverton,_Rhode_Island|Tiverton,_Rhode_Island| , had taken up  |Acadian|Acadian|  land in 1760 as one of the  |New_England_Planters|New_England_Planters| . The Borden family had immigrated from  |Headcorn,_Kent|Headcorn,_Kent| , England, to New England in the 1600s. Also arriving in this group was a great-great-grandfather,  |Robert_Denison|Robert_Denison| , who had come from Connecticut at about the same time. Perry had accompanied his father, Samuel Borden, the chief surveyor chosen by the government of  |Massachusetts|Massachusetts|  to survey the former Acadian land and draw up new lots for the  |Planters|New_England_Planters|  in Nova Scotia. Through the marriage of his patrilineal ancestor Richard Borden to Innocent Cornell, Borden is descendant from  |Thomas_Cornell|Thomas_Cornell|  of  |Portsmouth,_Rhode_Island|Portsmouth,_Rhode_Island| .  New England Historical Genealogical Society.     Bordens father Andrew Borden was judged by his son to be a man of good ability and excellent judgement , of a calm, contemplative and philosophical turn of mind, but he lacked energy and had no great aptitude for affairs . His mother Eunice Jane Laird was more driven, possessing very strong character, remarkable energy, high ambition and unusual ability . Her ambition was transmitted to her first-born child, who applied himself to his studies while assisting his parents with the farm work he found so disagreeable. His cousin  |Sir_Frederick_Borden|Frederick_William_Borden|  was a prominent  |Liberal|Liberal_Party_Of_Canada|  politician.      Robert Borden was the last Canadian Prime Minister born before  |Confederation|Canadian_Confederation| . Thornton, Martin. Sir Richard Borden:Canada. 2011.          From 1868 to 1874, he worked as a teacher in Grand-Pré and  |Matawan,_New_Jersey|Matawan,_New_Jersey| . Seeing no future in teaching, he returned to Nova Scotia in 1874. Despite having no formal university education, he went to  |article|Articled_Clerk|  for four years at a  |Halifax|City_Of_Halifax|  law firm. In August 1878, he was called to the Nova Scotia Bar, placing first in the bar examinations. Borden went to  |Kentville,_Nova_Scotia|Kentville,_Nova_Scotia| , as the junior partner of the Conservative lawyer  |John_P._Chipman|John_&_Nbsp;P._Chipman| . In 1880, he was inducted into the  |Freemasons|Freemason|   – St Andrews lodge 1.  at www.freemasonry.bcy.ca     In 1882, he was asked by Wallace Graham to move to Halifax and join the Conservative law firm headed by Graham and Charles Hibbert Tupper. In the Autumn of 1889, when he was only 35, Borden became the senior partner following the departure of Graham and Tupper for the bench and politics, respectively. His financial future guaranteed, on September 25, 1889, he married  |Laura_Bond|Laura_Bond|  , the daughter of a Halifax hardware merchant. They would have no children. In 1894, he bought a large property and home on the south side of Quinpool Road, which the couple called Pinehurst . In 1893, Borden successfully argued the first of two cases which he took to the  |Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council|Judicial_Committee_Of_The_Privy_Council| . He represented many of the important Halifax businesses, and sat on the boards of Nova Scotian companies including the  |Bank_of_Nova_Scotia|Bank_Of_Nova_Scotia|  and the  |Crown_Life_Insurance_Company|Crown_Life_Insurance_Company| . In 1896, he became President of the Nova Scotia Barristers Society, and took the initiative in organizing the founding meetings of the  |Canadian_Bar_Association|Canadian_Bar_Association|  in  |Montreal|Montreal|  within the same year. By the time he was prevailed upon to enter politics, Borden had what some judged to be the largest legal practice in the Maritime Provinces, and had become a wealthy man.          Borden was a Liberal until he broke with the party in  |1891|1891_Canadian_Federal_Election|  over the issue of  |Reciprocity|Reciprocity| .     He was elected to Parliament in the  |1896_federal_election|1896_Canadian_Federal_Election|  as a Conservative and in 1901 was selected by the Conservative caucus to succeed Sir  |Charles_Tupper|Charles_Tupper|  as leader of the Conservative Party. He was defeated in his Halifax seat in the  |1904_federal_election|1904_Canadian_Federal_Election|  and re-entered the House of Commons the next year via a by-election in  |Carleton|Carleton| . Over the next decade he worked to rebuild the party and establish a reform policy, the  |Halifax_Platform|Halifax_Platform|  of 1907 which he described as the most advanced and progressive policy ever put forward in Federal affairs . It called for reform of the Senate and the civil service, a more selective immigration policy, free rural mail delivery, and government regulation of telegraphs, telephones, and railways and eventually national ownership of telegraphs and telephones. Despite his efforts, his party lost the  |1908_federal_election|1908_Canadian_Federal_Election|  to  |Wilfrid_Lauriers|Wilfrid_Laurier|  Liberals.   Borden was however elected again for  |Halifax|Halifax| . His partys fortunes turned around in the  |1911_federal_election|1911_Canadian_Federal_Election| , however, when the Conservatives successfully campaigned against Lauriers proposals for a  |Reciprocity|Reciprocity|   agreement with the United States. Borden countered with a revised version of John A. Macdonalds  |National_Policy|National_Policy|  and appeals of loyalty to the  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  and ran on the slogan Canadianism or Continentalism . In British Columbia, the party ran on the slogan A White Canada , playing to the fears of British Columbians that resented the increasing presence of cheap Asian labour and the resulting depression in wages. Last Steps to Freedom by John Boyko pg.46 In Quebec, concurrently,  |Henri_Bourassa|Henri_Bourassa|  led a campaign against what he saw as Lauriers capitulation to British imperialism, playing a part in the defeat of Lauriers government and the election of Bordens Tories.              Borden served as Prime Minister for the duration of the  |12th_Parliament_of_Canada|12Th_Parliament_Of_Canada| , and for most of the  |13th_Parliament_of_Canada|13Th_Parliament_Of_Canada| , before his retirement from active political life in July 1920.          As  |Prime_Minister_of_Canada|Prime_Minister_Of_Canada|  during the  |First_World_War|World_War_I| , he transformed his government to a wartime administration, passing the  War Measures Act  in 1914. Borden committed Canada to provide half a million soldiers for the war effort. However, volunteers had quickly dried up when Canadians realized there would be no quick end to the war. Bordens determination to meet that huge commitment led to the  Military Service Act  and the  |Conscription_Crisis_of_1917|Conscription_Crisis_Of_1917| , which split the country on linguistic lines.  In 1917 Borden recruited members of the  |Liberals|Liberal_Party_Of_Canada|  to create a  |Unionist|Unionist_Party|  government. The  |1917_election|1917_Canadian_Federal_Election|  saw the Government candidates  crush the Opposition  |Laurier_Liberals|Laurier_Liberals|  in  |English_Canada|English_Canada|  resulting in a large parliamentary majority for Borden.        Sir Robert Borden pledged himself during the campaign to equal suffrage for women. With his return to power, he introduced a bill in 1918 for extending the franchise to women. This passed without division.     The war effort also enabled Canada to assert itself as an independent power. Borden wanted to create a single Canadian army, rather than have Canadian soldiers split up and assigned to British divisions as had happened during the  |Boer_War|Second_Boer_War| .  |Sam_Hughes|Sam_Hughes| , the Minister of Militia, generally ensured that Canadians were well-trained and prepared to fight in their own divisions, although with mixed results such as the  |Ross_Rifle|Ross_Rifle| .  |Arthur_Currie|Arthur_Currie|  provided sensible leadership for the Canadian divisions in Europe, although they were still under overall British command. Nevertheless, Canadian troops proved themselves to be among the best in the world, fighting at the  |Somme|Battle_Of_The_Somme| ,  |Ypres|Ypres| ,  |Passchendaele|Battle_Of_Passchendaele| , and especially at the  |Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge|Battle_Of_Vimy_Ridge| .     During Bordens first term as Prime Minister, the  |National_Research_Council_of_Canada|National_Research_Council_Of_Canada|  was established in 1916.       In world affairs, Borden played a crucial role in transforming the British Empire into a partnership of equal states, the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| , a term that was first discussed at an  |Imperial_Conference|Imperial_Conference|  in  |London|London|  during the war. Borden also introduced the first Canadian  |income_tax|Income_Tax|  under Income War Tax Act of 1917, which was then meant to be temporary but later became permanent.     Convinced that Canada had become a nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the  |Paris_Peace_Conference|Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919| . This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which perceived such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost a far larger proportion of its men compared to the US in the war , Canada at least had the right to the representation of a minor power. British Prime Minister  |David_Lloyd_George|David_Lloyd_George|  eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of separate  |Canadian|Canadians| ,  |India|India| n,  |Australia|Australia| n,  |Newfoundland|Dominion_Of_Newfoundland| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  and  |South_Africa|South_Africa| n delegations. Despite this, Borden boycotted the opening ceremony, protesting at the precedence given to the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Newfoundland|  of the much smaller Newfoundland over him. MacMillan p.71     Not only did Bordens persistence allow him to represent Canada in  |Paris|Paris|  as a nation, it also ensured that each of the  |dominions|Dominion|  could sign the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  in its own right and receive a separate membership in the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations| . During the conference, Borden tried to act as an intermediary between the  |United_States|United_States|  and other members of the  |British_Empire_delegation|British_Empire_Delegation| , particularly  |Australia|Australia|  and  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  over the issue of the  |League_of_Nations_Mandate|League_Of_Nations_Mandate| . MacMillan p.107–114 Borden also discussed with Lloyd George the possibility of Canada taking over the administration of  |Belize|Belize|  and the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| , but no agreement was reached.     At Bordens insistence, the treaty was ratified by the  |Canadian_Parliament|Parliament_Of_Canada| . Borden was the last Prime Minister to be  |knighted|Knighthood|  after the House of Commons indicated its desire for the discontinuation of the granting of any future titles to Canadians in 1919 with the adoption of the  |Nickle_Resolution|Nickle_Resolution| .       In 1919 Borden approved the use of troops to put down the  |Winnipeg_general_strike|Winnipeg_General_Strike| , which was feared to be the result of  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik|  agitation from the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . MacMillan                  Sir Robert Borden retired from office in 1920. He was the Chancellor of  |Queens_University|Queens_University|  from 1924 to 1930 and also was Chancellor of  |McGill_University|Mcgill_University|  from 1918 to 1920 while still Prime Minister. Borden also served as Vice-President of  |The_Champlain_Society|Champlain_Society|  between 1923 and 1925. He was the Societys first Honorary President between 1925 and 1938.  Bordens successor  |Arthur_Meighen|Arthur_Meighen|  was defeated by the new Liberal leader  |William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King|William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King|  in the  |1921_election|1921_Canadian_Federal_Election| . Nevertheless, Borden would go on to represent Canada once more on the international stage when he attended the  |Washington_Naval_Conference|Washington_Naval_Conference|  in 1922 and signed the  |resulting_arms_reduction_treaty|Washington_Naval_Treaty|  on Canadas behalf.     At the time of his death, Borden stood as president of two financial institutions:  |Barclays_Bank|Barclays_Bank|  of Canada and the  |Crown_Life_Insurance_Company|Crown_Life| . Borden died on June 10, 1937, in Ottawa and is buried in the  |Beechwood_Cemetery|Beechwood_Cemetery|  marked by a simple stone cross.        Robert Laird Borden married Laura Bond, youngest daughter of the late T. H. Bond, September 1889. She served as president of the  |Local_Council_of_Women_of_Halifax|Local_Council_Of_Women_Of_Halifax| , until her resignation in 1901. She served as President of the Aberdeen Association, Vice-President of the Womens Work Exchange in Halifax, and Corresponding Secretary of the Associated Charities of the United States.        Borden was the last Canadian Prime Minister to be knighted since, in deference to the  |Nickle_Resolution|Canadian_Titles_Debate| , no others have been. However  |R._B._Bennett|R._&_Nbsp;B._Bennett|  was created 1st Viscount Bennett after leaving office.   Sir Robert Borden is depicted on  |Canadian_$100_bills|Canadian_$100_Bill|  produced from 1976 to 2016, but his image will not be used on next design according to a government announcement in late 2016.   Sir Robert Borden was honoured by having two  |secondary_schools|Sir_Robert_Borden_High_School|  named after him, in the  |Nepean|Nepean,_Ontario|  part of Ottawa, and in the  |Scarborough|Scarborough,_Toronto|  section of  |Toronto|Toronto| .
