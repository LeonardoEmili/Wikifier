     Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie  was an American  |computer_scientist|Computer_Science| . He created the  |C_programming_language|C|  and, with long-time colleague  |Ken_Thompson|Ken_Thompson| , the  |Unix|Unix| |_operating_system|Operating_System|  and  |B_programming_language|B| . Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the  |Turing_Award|Turing_Award|  from the  |ACM|Association_For_Computing_Machinery|  in 1983, the  |Hamming_Medal|Ieee_Richard_W_Hamming_Medal|  from the  |IEEE|Institute_Of_Electrical_And_Electronics_Engineers|  in 1990 and the  |National_Medal_of_Technology|National_Medal_Of_Technology|  from  |President_Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  in 1999. Ritchie was the head of  |Lucent_Technologies|Lucent|  System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the R in  |K_R_C|The_C_Programming_Language| , and commonly known by his  |username|User|  dmr.       Dennis Ritchie was born in  |Bronxville_New_York|Bronxville_New_York| . His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime  |Bell_Labs|Bell_Labs|  scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits on  |switching_circuit_theory|Switching_Circuit_Theory| . As a child, Dennis moved with his family to  |Summit_New_Jersey|Summit_New_Jersey| , where he graduated from  |Summit_High_School|Summit_High_School| . He graduated from  |Harvard_University|Harvard_University|  with  |degrees|Academic_Degree|  in  |physics|Physics|  and  |applied_mathematics|Applied_Mathematics| .           In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on Program Structure and Computational Complexity at Harvard under the supervision of  |Patrick_C_Fischer|Patrick_C_Fischer| . However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree.      During the 1960s, Ritchie and  |Ken_Thompson|Ken_Thompson|  worked on the  |Multics|Multics|  operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old  |PDP_7|Pdp_7|  machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970,  |Brian_Kernighan|Brian_Kernighan|  suggested the name  |Unix|Unix|  , a pun on the name Multics .  To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created  |B|B| . Later, B was replaced by  |C|C| , created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.      During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and  |Robert_Morris|Robert_Morris|  on a  |ciphertext_only_attack|Ciphertext_Only_Attack|  on the  |M_209|M_209|  US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.  Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the  |NSA|Nsa| , the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle was applicable to machines still in use by foreign governments.     Ritchie was also involved with the development of the  |Plan_9|Plan_9_From_Bell_Labs|  and  |Inferno|Inferno|  operating systems, and the programming language  |Limbo|Limbo| .     As part of an AT & T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.        Ritchie is best known as the creator of the  |C_programming_language|C| , a key developer of the  |Unix|Unix|  operating system, and co-author of the book  The C Programming Language ; he was the R in K & R . Ritchie worked together with  |Ken_Thompson|Ken_Thompson| , who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchies most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms. They were so influential on  |Research_Unix|Research_Unix|  that  |Doug_McIlroy|Doug_Mcilroy|  later wrote, The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.      Ritchie liked to emphasize that he was just one member of a group. He suggested that many of the improvements he introduced simply looked like a good thing to do, and that anyone else in the same place at the same time might have done the same thing.     Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application,  |operating_system|Operating_System| , and  |embedded_system|Embedded_System|  development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. Unix has also been influential, establishing computing concepts and principles that have been widely adopted.     In an interview from 1999, Ritchie clarified that he saw  |Linux|Linux|  and  |BSD|Bsd|  operating systems as a continuation of the basis of the Unix operating system, and as derivatives of Unix:           In the same interview, he stated that he viewed both Unix and Linux as the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago.       In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the  |Turing_Award|Turing_Award|  for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system .  Ritchies Turing Award lecture was titled Reflections on Software Research .    In 1990, both Ritchie and Thompson received the  |IEEE_Richard_W_Hamming_Medal|Ieee_Richard_W_Hamming_Medal|  from the  |Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers|Institute_Of_Electrical_And_Electronics_Engineers|  , for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language .      In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the  |Computer_History_Museum|Computer_History_Museum| , for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language.      On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the  |National_Medal_of_Technology|National_Medal_Of_Technology|  of 1998 from President  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age .       In 2005, the  |Industrial_Research_Institute|Industrial_Research_Institute|  awarded Ritchie its  |Achievement_Award|Iri_Achievement_Award|  in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.      In 2011, Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the  |Japan_Prize_for_Information_and_Communications|Japan_Prize|  for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.           Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in  |Berkeley_Heights_New_Jersey|Berkeley_Heights_New_Jersey| , where he lived alone. First news of his death came from his former colleague,  |Rob_Pike|Rob_Pike| . The cause and exact time of death have not been disclosed.      He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for  |prostate_cancer|Prostate_Cancer|  and  |heart_disease|Heart_Disease| .   News of Ritchies death was largely overshadowed by the media coverage of the death of  |Apple|Apple_Inc_|  co-founder  |Steve_Jobs|Steve_Jobs| , which occurred the week before.        Following Ritchies death, computer historian  |Paul_E_Ceruzzi|Paul_E_Ceruzzi|  stated:             In an interview shortly after Ritchies death, long time colleague  |Brian_Kernighan|Brian_Kernighan|  said Ritchie never expected C to be so significant.      Kernighan told  The New York Times  The tools that Dennis built—and their direct descendants—run pretty much everything today.”  Kernighan reminded readers of how important a role C and Unix had played in the development of later high-profile projects, such as the  |iPhone|Iphone| .     Other testimonials to his influence followed.                 Reflecting upon his death, a commentator compared the relative importance of  |Steve_Jobs|Steve_Jobs|  and Ritchie, concluding that work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years—including technology on which Apple went on to build its fortune.  Another commentator said, Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true.  Another said, many in computer science and related fields knew of Ritchie’s importance to the growth and development of, well, everything to do with computing,...      The  |Fedora_16|Fedora_16| |_Linux_distribution|Linux_Distribution| , which was released about a month after he died, was dedicated to his memory.   |FreeBSD|Freebsd|  9.0, released January 12, 2012 was also dedicated in his memory.
