|_Malaysia|Malaysia|  is an active member of various international organisations, including the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| , the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| , the  |Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation|Organisation_Of_Islamic_Cooperation| , and the  |Non_Aligned_Movement|Non_Aligned_Movement| . It has also in recent times been an active proponent of regional co-operation.       Malaysia has been a member of the Commonwealth since independence in 1957, when it entered into the  |Anglo_Malayan_Defence_Agreement|Anglo_Malayan_Defence_Agreement|  with the United Kingdom whereby Britain guaranteed the defence of  |Malaya|Federation_Of_Malaya|  . The presence of British and other Commonwealth troops were crucial to Malaysias security during the  |Malayan_Emergency|Malayan_Emergency|  and the  |Indonesian_Confrontation|Indonesian_Confrontation|  , which was sparked by Malayas merger with the British colonies of Singapore,  |Sarawak|Crown_Colony_Of_Sarawak|  and  |North_Borneo|Crown_Colony_Of_North_Borneo|  to form Malaysia in 1963.     The British defence guarantee ended following Britains decision in 1967 to withdraw its forces east of  |Suez|Suez| , and was replaced in 1971 with the  |Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements|Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements|  by which Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to co-operate in the area of defence, and to consult in the event of external aggression or the threat of attack on Malaysia or Singapore. The FPDA continues to operate, and the Five Powers have a permanent Integrated Area Defence System based at  |RMAF|Royal_Malaysian_Air_Force| |_Butterworth|Butterworth_Malaysia| , and organise annual naval and air exercises.     Under the leadership of Prime Minister  |Tunku_Abdul_Rahman|Tunku_Abdul_Rahman|  , Malaysia pursued a strongly pro-Commonwealth anti-communist foreign policy. Nonetheless, Malaysia was active in the opposition to  |apartheid|Apartheid|  that saw South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961, and was a founding member of the  |Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|Association_Of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|  in 1967 and the  |Organisation_of_the_Islamic_Conference|Organisation_Of_Islamic_Cooperation|  in 1969, with the Tunku as its first Secretary-General in 1971.       Under Prime Ministers  |Tun_Abdul_Razak|Tun_Abdul_Razak|  and  |Tun_Hussein_Onn|Tun_Hussein_Onn| , Malaysia shifted its policy towards non-alignment and neutrality. Malaysias foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their ideology or political system, and to further develop relations with other countries in the region.  In 1971, ASEAN issued its neutralist and anti-nuclear Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality Declaration. In the same year, Malaysia joined the  |Non_Aligned_Movement|Non_Aligned_Movement| . Consistent with this policy Malaysia established diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China in 1974.     This policy shift was continued and strengthened by Prime Minister  |Mahathir_bin_Mohamad|Mahathir_Bin_Mohamad| , who pursued a regionalist and pro-South policy with at times strident  |anti_Western|Anti_Western_Sentiment|  rhetoric. He long sought to establish an East Asian Economic Group as an alternative to  |APEC|Apec| , excluding Australia, New Zealand and the Americas, and during his premiership Malaysia signed up to an ASEAN Free Trade Area and ASEAN+3, a regional forum with China, Japan and South Korea. He was involved with a spat with Australian prime minister  |Paul_Keating|Paul_Keating| , who called him a recalcitrant after he refused to attend the APEC summit in  |Seattle|Seattle| .     A strong tenet of Malaysias policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.    Malaysia views regional co-operation as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. It attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and has tried to strengthen relations with other Islamic states.  Malaysia was a leading advocate of expanding ASEANs membership to include Laos, Vietnam, and Burma, arguing that  |constructive_engagement|Constructive_Engagement|  with these countries, especially Burma, will help bring political and economic changes. Malaysia is also a member of  |G_15|Group_Of_15|  and  |G_77|Group_Of_77|  economic groupings.     Despite Mahathirs frequently anti-Western rhetoric he worked closely with Western countries, and led a crackdown against Islamic fundamentalists after the  |11_September_attacks|11_September_Attacks| . Under his successor,  |Abdullah_Badawi|Abdullah_Badawi| , relations with Western countries, particularly Australia, have improved. The current Minister of Foreign Affairs is  |Dato|Malay_Titlesdato| |_Saifuddin_Abdullah|Saifuddin_Abdullah| , who assumed office on 2 July 2018.     Malaysia has never recognised  |Israel|Israel|  and has no diplomatic ties with it,  with the country ever condemning the Israelis action during  |their_raid_over_a_Gaza_humanitarian_mission|Gaza_Flotilla_Raid|  and request the  |International_Criminal_Court|International_Criminal_Court|  to take any action against them.  Malaysia has stated it will only establish an official relations with Israel once a  |peace_agreement|Israeliâ€“Palestinian_Peace_Process|  with the  |State_of_Palestine|State_Of_Palestine|  been reached and called for both parties to find a quick resolution.   Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions, such as in  |Namibia|United_Nations_Transition_Assistance_Group| ,  |Cambodia|United_Nations_Transitional_Authority_In_Cambodia| ,  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|United_Nations_Protection_Force| ,  |Somalia|United_Nations_Operation_In_Somalia_Ii| ,  |East_Timor|United_Nations_Integrated_Mission_In_East_Timor|  and  |Lebanon|United_Nations_Interim_Force_In_Lebanon| .         Malaysia is a founding member of the  |Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|Asean|  and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference .   It is also a member of the  |Non_Aligned_Movement|Non_Aligned_Movement| .  Kuala Lumpur was the site of the first  |East_Asia_Summit|East_Asia_Summit|  in 2005, and Malaysia has chaired ASEAN, the OIC, and the NAM in the past. A former British colony, it is also a member of  |the_Commonwealth|The_Commonwealth| .      Malaysia is affiliated with the United Nations and many of its specialised agencies, including  |UNESCO|Unesco| ,  |World_Bank|World_Bank| ,  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund| ,  |International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|International_Atomic_Energy_Agency| ;  |General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade|General_Agreement_On_Tariffs_And_Trade| . It is also a member of the  |Asia_Pacific_Economic_Cooperation|Asia_Pacific_Economic_Cooperation| , the  |Developing_8_Countries|Developing_8_Countries| .     |Asian_Development_Bank|Asian_Development_Bank| ,  |Five_Power_Defense_Arrangement|Five_Power_Defense_Arrangement| ,  |G_77|Group_Of_77| , and  |South_Centre|South_Centre| .  On 31 October 2011 Malaysia became a party to the  |Antarctic_Treaty|Antarctic_Treaty| .        The policy towards territorial disputes by the Malaysian government is one of pragmatism, solving disputes in a number of ways, including some resolved in the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| .          Malaysia has asserted sovereignty over the  |Spratly_Islands|Spratly_Islands|  together with China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Brunei. Tensions have eased since the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea . However, it is not the legally binding  |code_of_conduct|Code_Of_Conduct|  sought by some parties.  Malaysia was not party to a March 2005 joint accord among the  |national_oil_companies|National_Oil_Company|  of China, the Philippines and Vietnam on conducting marine  |seismic|Seismic|  activities in the Spratly Islands.  Malaysia long maintained a low-key approach to the dispute, maintaining positive relations with China due to strong economic ties, a large ethnic Chinese population, and a desire for a balance of power in the region.   However, as Chinese fishing vessels and coast guard ships have become increasingly assertive,  Malaysia has increased its diplomatic and military responses.            The ICJ awarded  |Ligitan|Ligitan|  and  |Sipadan|Sipadan|  islands to Malaysia over Indonesia but left the  |maritime_boundary|Maritime_Boundary|  in the hydrocarbon-rich  |Celebes_Sea|Celebes_Sea|  in dispute,  culminating in hostile confrontations in March 2005 over concessions to the  |Ambalat|Ambalat|  oil block.       Singapore  |was_a_part_of_Malaysia_for_two_years_|Singapore_In_Malaysia| , but it ultimately was asked by Tunku to secede after increased racial tensions due to the election campaigns in 1964. Today, disputes continue among other things, over the pricing of deliveries of raw untreated water to Singapore, Singapores land reclamation causing a negative environmental impact in Malaysian waters, a new bridge to replace the  |Johor_Singapore_Causeway|Johor_Singapore_Causeway|  which Singapore does not want to pay for, maritime boundaries, the redevelopment of Malayan Railway lands in Singapore and  |Pedra_Branca|Pedra_Branca_Singapore| . Both parties however, agreed to  |ICJ|International_Court_Of_Justice|  arbitration on the island dispute. On 24 May 2008, the International Court of Justice ruled that Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore with the nearby Middle Rocks going to Malaysia. Regarding railway land in Singapore, see also  |Malaysia_Singapore_Points_of_Agreement_of_1990|Malaysia_Singapore_Points_Of_Agreement_Of_1990| . On introducing budget flights between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, the stumbling block appears to be Malaysias sympathy towards flag carrier  |Malaysia_Airlines|Malaysia_Airlines| , and preference for the existing near duopoly with Singapore Airlines.          The Philippines has a dormant claim to eastern  |Sabah|Sabah| .       Malaysias land boundary with Brunei around Limbang is no longer in dispute. On 16 March 2009, Brunei announced its decision to drop a long-standing claim to Sarawaks  |Limbang_district|Limbang_District| .  This was the result of the two countries resolving their various land and sea territorial disputes.  This issue was resolved along with several other disputes with the sealing and signing of letters of exchange by Abdullah and the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei at Istana Nurul Iman. As of 2010, the two countries are working towards resolving disputes over their maritime boundaries.       According to a source, the areas around  |Ko_Kra|Ko_Kra|  and  |Ko_Losin|Ko_Losin|  in present-day Thailand are once disputed with Malaysia.                                                                        |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| |Federation_of_Malaya|Federation_Of_Malaya|  became an independent native  |elective_monarchy|Elective_Monarchy|  within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957 with the  |Yang_di_Pertuan_Agong|Yang_Di_Pertuan_Agong|  as head of state.     Malaya united with  |North_Borneo|Crown_Colony_Of_North_Borneo|  ,  |Sarawak|Crown_Colony_Of_Sarawak| , and  |Singapore|Singapore|  to form  |Malaysia|Malaysia|  in 1963.     Singapore was expelled from Malaysia in 1965, and became an independent  |Commonwealth_republic|Commonwealth_Republic| .
