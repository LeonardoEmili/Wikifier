 Kuwait  is a small country in the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| , bordering the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf| , between  |Iraq|Iraq|  and  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| . A prosperous trade center for many centuries, Kuwait came to greater international prominence in the post- |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  era, largely because of its strategic location at the head of the Persian Gulf and  |oil|Petroleum|  revenues.     Since 2006, Kuwait has been partially governed by  |Sabah_Al_Ahmad_Al_Jaber_Al_Sabah|Sabah_Al_Ahmad_Al_Jaber_Al_Sabah|  and his designated successor,  |Nawaf_Al_Ahmad_Al_Jaber_Al_Sabah|Nawaf_Al_Ahmad_Al_Jaber_Al_Sabah| , the Prime Minister and Crown Prince. In the postwar period, these men have supported the strengthening of democratic participation in decision making, as provided for in the  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Kuwait| .     Kuwait is located at the far northwestern corner of the Persian Gulf. Kuwait is 17,820 square kilometres in size. At its most distant points, it is about  north to south, and  east to west. Kuwaits area consists mostly of  |desert|Desert| .            As previously mentioned, Kuwait borders the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf|  with  of coast. Within its territory are nine islands, two of which,  |Bubiyan|Bubiyan|  and  |Warbah|Warbah_Island| , are largely uninhabited but strategically important. Due to the Iraq-Kuwait war , many people left their homes on islands and have since not returned to their homes.     Kuwaits most prominent geographic feature is Kuwait Bay , which indents the shoreline for about forty kilometers, providing natural protection for the port of Kuwait, and accounts for nearly one half the countrys shoreline.     To the south and west, Kuwait shares a long border of 250 kilometers with  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| . The boundary between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia was set by the Treaty of Al Uqayr in 1922, which also established the  |Saudi–Kuwaiti_neutral_zone|Saudi–Kuwaiti_Neutral_Zone|  of 5,700 square kilometers between the two nations. In 1966, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia agreed to divide the neutral zone; the partitioning agreement making each country responsible for administration in its portion was signed in December 1969. The resources in the area, now known as the Divided Zone, are not affected by the agreement. The oil from onshore and offshore fields continues to be shared equally between the two countries.     The third side of the triangle-shaped nation is the 240 kilometers of historically contested border between Kuwait and Iraq. Although the Iraqi government, which had first asserted a claim to rule Kuwait in 1938, recognized the borders with Kuwait in 1963 , it continued to press Kuwait for control over Bubiyan and Warbah islands through the 1960s and 1970s.     In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and, shortly thereafter, formally incorporated the entire country into Iraq. Under  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  Security Council Resolution 687, after the restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty in 1991, a UN commission undertook formal demarcation of the borders on the basis of those agreed to in 1963. The boundary was demarcated in 1992, but Iraq refuses to accept the commissions findings.     Recent events from 2008 to the present day have seen the positive advancement of maritime border relations with Iraq with the development of the Khawr Abd Allah Protocols. The non-legally binding KAA Protocols were developed and mediated between the heads of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies by Major David Hammond Royal Marines, the British naval lawyer and legal advisor to  |Combined_Task_Force_158|Combined_Task_Force_158| . This included the production of the KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart by Major Hammond and which was subsequently distributed to both countries, having been produced by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office.     In November 2008, the KAA Protocols were historically signed at Kuwait Naval Base having been verbally agreed on board  in May 2008. The signing meeting saw the first formal meeting of the heads of respective navies since before the 1991  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| . Subsequently, the success of the non-legally binding protocols was reported to the US Congress on January 9, 2009 in the Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq Report.
