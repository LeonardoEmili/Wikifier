            A hydrofoil is a lifting surface, or  |foil|Foil| , that operates in water. They are similar in appearance and purpose to  |aerofoils|Aerofoil|  used by  |aeroplanes|Aeroplane| .  |Boats|Boat|  that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils. As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boats  |hull|Hull|  out of the water, decreasing  |drag|Drag|  and allowing greater speeds.       The hydrofoil usually consists of a  |wing|Wing|  like structure mounted on  |struts|Strut|  below the  |hull|Hull| , or across the keels of a catamaran in a variety of boats . As a hydrofoil-equipped watercraft increases in speed, the hydrofoil elements below the hull develop enough  |lift|Lift|  to raise the hull out of the water, which greatly reduces hull  |drag|Drag| . This provides a corresponding increase in  |speed|Speed|  and  |fuel_efficiency|Fuel_Efficiency| .     Wider adoption of hydrofoils is prevented by the increased complexity of building and maintaining them. Hydrofoils are generally prohibitively more expensive than conventional watercraft above the certain displacement, so most hydrofoil craft are relatively small, and are mainly used as high-speed passenger ferries, where the relatively high passenger fees can offset the high cost of the craft itself. However, the design is simple enough that there are many  |human-powered_hydrofoil|Human-Powered_Hydrofoil|  designs. Amateur experimentation and development of the concept is popular.                Since air and water are governed by similar  |fluid_equations|Fluid_Dynamics| —albeit with different levels of  |viscosity|Viscosity| ,  |density|Density| , and  |compressibility|Compressible_Flow| —the hydrofoil and  |airfoil|Airfoil|   create  |lift|Lift|  in identical ways. The foil shape moves smoothly through the water, deflecting the flow downward, which, following the  |Euler_equations|Euler_Equations| , exerts an upward force on the foil. This turning of the water creates higher pressure on the bottom of the foil and reduced pressure on the top. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via  |Bernoullis_principle|Bernoullis_Principle| , so the resulting flow field about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other.     When used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, this upward force lifts the body of the vessel, decreasing drag and increasing speed. The lifting force eventually balances with the weight of the craft, reaching a point where the hydrofoil no longer lifts out of the water but remains in equilibrium. Since wave resistance and other impeding forces such as various types of  |drag|Drag|  on the hull are eliminated as the hull lifts clear, turbulence and drag act increasingly on the much smaller surface area of the hydrofoil, and decreasingly on the hull, creating a marked increase in speed.        Early hydrofoils used V-shaped foils. Hydrofoils of this type are known as surface-piercing since portions of the V-shape hydrofoils rise above the water surface when foilborne. Some modern hydrofoils use fully submerged inverted T-shape foils. Fully submerged hydrofoils are less subject to the effects of wave action, and, therefore, more stable at sea and more comfortable for crew and passengers. This type of configuration, however, is not self-stabilizing. The  |angle_of_attack|Angle_Of_Attack|  on the hydrofoils must be adjusted continuously to changing conditions, a control process performed by sensors, a computer, and active surfaces.                The first evidence of a hydrofoil on a vessel appears on a British patent granted in 1869 to Emmanuel Denis Farcot, a Parisian. He claimed that adapting to the sides and bottom of the vessel a series or inclined planes or wedge formed pieces, which as the vessel is driven forward will have the effect of lifting it in the water and reducing the draught.  . Italian inventor  |Enrico_Forlanini|Enrico_Forlanini|  began work on hydrofoils in 1898 and used a ladder foil system. Forlanini obtained patents in Britain and the United States for his ideas and designs.   Popular Mechanics, December 1911, p. 927.     Between 1899 and 1901, British boat designer  |John_Thornycroft|John_Isaac_Thornycroft|  worked on a series of models with a stepped hull and single bow foil. In 1909 his company built the full scale  long boat, Miranda III. Driven by a  engine, it rode on a bowfoil and flat stern. The subsequent Miranda IV was credited with a speed of .           A March 1906  |Scientific_American|Scientific_American|  article by American hydrofoil pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils.  |Alexander_Graham_Bell|Alexander_Graham_Bell|  considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement, and after reading the article began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. With his chief engineer  |Casey_Baldwin|Frederick_W._Baldwin| , Bell began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor  |Enrico_Forlanini|Enrico_Forlanini|  and began testing models based on those designs, which led to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. During Bells world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over  |Lake_Maggiore|Lake_Maggiore| . Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.     On returning to Bells large laboratory at his  |Beinn_Bhreagh|Beinn_Bhreagh,_Nova_Scotia|  estate near  |Baddeck,_Nova_Scotia|Baddeck,_Nova_Scotia| , they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in Bells  HD-4 . Using  |Renault|Renault|  engines, a top speed of  was achieved, accelerating rapidly, taking waves without difficulty, steering well and showing good stability. Bells report to the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  permitted him to obtain two 260  kW engines. On 9 September 1919 the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of , which stood for two decades.  A full-scale replica of the HD-4 is viewable at the  |Alexander_Graham_Bell_National_Historic_Site|Alexander_Graham_Belllegacy_And_Honors|  museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.     In the early 1950s an English couple built the White Hawk, a jet-powered hydrofoil water craft, in an attempt to beat the absolute water speed record.  Popular Mechanics, August 1953, pp. 70-71 However, in tests, White Hawk could barely top the record breaking speed of the 1919 HD-4. The designers had faced an engineering phenomenon that limits the top speed of even modern hydrofoils:  |cavitation|Cavitation|  disturbs the lift created by the foils as they move through the water at speed above , bending the lifting foil. The World Water Speed Record by Leo Villa and Kevin Desmond, 1976              German engineer  |Hanns_von_Schertel|Hanns_Von_Schertel|  worked on hydrofoils prior to and during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in  |Germany|Germany| . After the war, the Russians captured Schertels team. As Germany was not authorized to build fast boats, Schertel went to  |Switzerland|Switzerland| , where he established the Supramar company. In 1952, Supramar launched the first commercial hydrofoil, PT10 Freccia dOro , in Lake Maggiore, between Switzerland and  |Italy|Italy| . The PT10 is of surface-piercing type, it can carry 32 passengers and travel at . In 1968, the Bahraini born banker  |Hussain_Najadi|Hussain_Najadi|  acquired the Supramar AG and expanded its operations into Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Norway and the US.  |General_Dynamics|General_Dynamics|  of the United States became its licensee, and the Pentagon awarded its first R & D naval research project in the field of  |supercavitation|Supercavitation| .  |Hitachi|Hitachi,_Ltd.|  Shipbuilding of Osaka, Japan, was another licensee of Supramar, as well as many leading ship owners and shipyards in the OECD countries.     From 1952 to 1971, Supramar designed many models of hydrofoils: PT20, PT50, PT75, PT100 and PT150. All are of surface-piercing type, except the PT150 combining a surface-piercing foil forward with a fully submerged foil in the aft location. Over 200 of Supramars design were built, most of them by Rodriquez in  |Sicily|Sicily| , Italy.     During the same period the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  experimented extensively with hydrofoils, constructing hydrofoil river boats and  |ferries|Ferries|  with streamlined designs during the cold war period and into the 1980s. Such vessels include the  |Raketa|Raketa|  type, followed by the larger  |Meteor|Meteor|  type and the smaller  |Voskhod|Voskhod|  type. One of the most successful Soviet designer/inventor in this area was  |Rostislav_Alexeyev|Rostislav_Alexeyev| , who some consider the father of the modern hydrofoil due to his 1950s era high speed hydrofoil designs. Later, circa 1970s, Alexeyev combined his hydrofoil experience with the  |surface_effect|Ground_Effect_In_Aircraft|  principle to create the  |Ekranoplan|Ekranoplan| .     In 1961,  |SRI_International|Sri_International|  issued a study on The Economic Feasibility of Passenger Hydrofoil Craft in US Domestic and Foreign Commerce .  Commercial use of hydrofoils in the US first appeared in 1961 when two commuter vessels were commissioned by  |Harry_Gale_Nye,_Jr.s|Harry_Gale_Nye,_Jr.|  North American Hydrofoils to service the route from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey to the financial district of Lower Manhattan.                      A 17-ton German craft VS-6 Hydrofoil was designed and constructed in 1940, completed in 1941 for use as a mine layer, it was tested in the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| , producing speeds of 47 knots. Tested against a standard  |E-boat|E-Boat|  over the next three years it performed well but was not brought into production. Being faster it could carry a higher payload and was capable of travelling over minefields but was prone to damage and noisier.      In Canada during World War II, Baldwin worked on an experimental  |smoke_laying|Smoke_Screen|  hydrofoil that was later superseded by other smoke-laying technology and an experimental target-towing hydrofoil. The forward two foil assemblies of what is believed to be the latter hydrofoil were salvaged in the mid-1960s from a derelict hulk in Baddeck, Nova Scotia by Colin MacGregor Stevens. These were donated to the Maritime Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The  |Canadian_Armed_Forces|Canadian_Forces_Maritime_Command|  built and tested a number of hydrofoils , which culminated in the high-speed anti-submarine hydrofoil  |HMCS_Bras_dOr|Hmcs_Bras_Dor|  in the late 1960s. However, the program was cancelled in the early 1970s due to a shift away from  |anti-submarine_warfare|Anti-Submarine_Warfare|  by the Canadian military. The Bras dOr was a surface-piercing type that performed well during her trials, reaching a maximum speed of .     The USSR introduced several hydrofoil-based fast attack craft into  |their_navy|Soviet_Navy| , principally:    |Sarancha_class_missile_boat|Sarancha_Class_Missile_Boat| , a unique vessel built in the 1970s    |Turya_class_torpedo_boat|Turya_Class_Torpedo_Boat| , introduced in 1972 and still in service    |Matka_class_missile_boat|Matka_Class_Missile_Boat| , introduced in the 1980s and still in service    |Muravey_class_patrol_boat|Muravey_Class_Patrol_Boat| , introduced in the 1980s and still in service     The  |US_Navy|United_States_Navy|  began experiments with hydrofoils in the mid-1950s by funding a sailing vessel that used hydrofoils to reach speeds in the 30  mph range.  Popular Mechanics, February 1956, p. 136. The  |XCH-4|Experimental_Craft_Hydrofoil_No._4|  , designed by  |William_P._Carl|William_P._Carl| , exceeded speeds of  and was mistaken for a seaplane due to its shape.  The US Navy implemented a small number of combat hydrofoils, such as the  |Pegasus_class|Pegasus_Class_Hydrofoil| , from 1977 through 1993. These hydrofoils were fast and well armed.      The  |Italian_Navy|Marina_Militare|  has used six hydrofoils of the  |Sparviero_class|Sparviero_Class_Patrol_Boat|  since the late 1970s. These were armed with a 76  mm gun and two missiles, and were capable of speeds up to . Three similar boats were built for the  |Japan_Maritime_Self-Defense_Force|Japan_Maritime_Self-Defense_Force| .          The French experimental  |sail|Sail|  powered hydrofoil  Hydroptère  is the result of a research project that involves advanced engineering skills and technologies. In September 2009, the Hydroptère set new sailcraft world speed records in the 500  m category, with a speed of  and in the  category with a speed of .       Another trimaran sailboat is the Windrider Rave.  The Rave is a commercially available , two person, hydrofoil trimaran, capable of reaching speeds of . The boat was designed by Jim Brown.     The  |Moth_dinghy|Moth|  has evolved into some radical foil configurations.      |Hobie_Sailboats|Hobie_Cat|  produced a production foiling  |trimaran|Trimaran| , the Hobie Trifoiler, the fastest production sailboat. Trifoilers have clocked speeds upward of thirty knots.     A new kayak design, called  |Flyak|Flyak| , has hydrofoils that lift the kayak enough to significantly reduce drag, allowing speeds of up to . Some  |surfers|Surfing|  have developed surfboards with hydrofoils called  |foilboards|Foilboard| , specifically aimed at surfing big waves further out to sea.           Quadrofoil Q2 is a two-seater, four-foiled hydrofoil electrical leisure watercraft. Its initial design was set in 2012 and it has been available commercially since the end of 2016. Powered by a 5.2-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and propelled by a 5.5 kW motor, it reaches the top speed of 40 km/h and has 80 km of range.        The  |Manta5_Hydrofoiler_XE-1|Manta5_Hydrofoiler_Xe-1|  is a Hydrofoil E-bike, designed and built in  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| . Initially designed in secret by Guy Howard-Willis in 2011, it has since been available commercially for pre-order in New Zealand since late 2017  Propelled by a 400 watt motor, it can reach speeds exceeding 14 km/h with a weight of 22 kg. A single charge of the battery lasts an hour for a rider weighing 85kg.                        Soviet-built  |Voskhods|Voskhod|  are one of the most successful passenger hydrofoil designs. Manufactured in Russia and Ukraine, they are in service in more than 20 countries. The most recent model,  |Voskhod-2M_FFF|Voskhod| , also known as Eurofoil, was built in  |Feodosiya|Feodosiya|  for the Dutch public transport operator  |Connexxion|Connexxion| .      The  |Boeing_929|Boeing_Jetfoil|  is widely used in  |Asia|Asia|  for passenger services between the many islands of  |Japan|Japan| , between  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong|  and  |Macau|Macau|  and on the  |Korean_peninsula|Korean_Peninsula| .       Current operators of hydrofoils include:      |TurboJET|Turbojet|  service, which speeds passengers across the  |Pearl_River_Delta|Pearl_River_Delta|  between  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong–Macau_Ferry_Terminal|  and  |Macau|Outer_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal|  in less than an hour, with an average speed of 45 knots , mainly using  |Boeings|Boeing| |Jetfoil|Boeing_Jetfoil| .

It lies thirty kilometers west of Saint Petersburg. Since 2012 replaced by a catamaran Mercury.   Meteor, Raketa and Voskhod hydrofoil types operate all over  |Volga|Volga| ,  |Don|Don_River|  and  |Kama_Rivers|Kama_River|  in  |Russia|Russia| . Also the  |Lena_River|Lena_River|  and  |Amur_River|Amur_River| .   Meteor hydrofoils are operated by a number of tour operators in  |Croatia|Croatia| , mostly for packaged tours, but there are also some scheduled services to islands in Adriatic.   Hydrofoils are regularly operated on the three major Italian lakes by branches of the  |Ministry_of_Infrastructure_and_Transport|Ministry_Of_Infrastructure_And_Transport|  Navigazione Lago Maggiore  services routes on  |Lake_Maggiore|Lake_Maggiore|  between  |Locarno|Locarno|  and  |Arona|Arona,_Piedmont| ,  Navigazione Lago di Como  services routes on  |Lake_Como|Lake_Como| , and  Navigazione Lago di Garda  services routes on  |Lake_Garda|Lake_Garda| .

Meteor , Polesye and Voskhod hydrofoil types operate in  |Hungary|Hungary| . MAHART PassNave Ltd. operates scheduled hydrofoil liners between  |Budapest|Budapest| ,  |Bratislava|Bratislava|  and  |Vienna|Vienna| , inland liners between Budapest and the  |Danube_Bend|Danube_Bend| , and theme cruises to Komárom, Solt, Kalocsa and Mohács.   Kometa Flying Dolphin services are currently operated by Joy Cruises between Corfu and Paxos. They run from Corfu Port to Gaios using two hydrofoils: Ilida and Ilida II. The company operates also an international service from Corfu to Saranda using the hydrofoil Ilida Dolphin of the same type.   Kometa type hydrofoils are operated by Ionian Cruises and Finikas Lines between Saranda and Corfu.   Russian hydrofoils of the Kometa type operated on the  |Bulgarian_Black_Sea_Coast|Bulgarian_Black_Sea_Coast|  connecting  |Varna|Varna| ,  |Nesebar|Nesebar| ,  |Burgas|Burgas| ,  |Sozopol|Sozopol| ,  |Primorsko|Primorsko| , and  |Tsarevo|Tsarevo| , and Raketa and Meteor models served the Bulgarian  |Danube|Danube|  ports between  |Rousse|Rousse|  and  |Vidin|Vidin| .

In 2012, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department in  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong|  leased a 12-meter HAWC , a  |catamaran|Catamaran| , to patrol the Geo Park, a UNESCO Sanctioned Marine Park in the Sai Kung areas off  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| .   In July 2018, the new generation  |Kometa_120M|Kometa_120M|  boat has started operation on the busy  |Sevastopol|Sevastopol| - |Yalta|Yalta|  route in  |Crimea|Crimea| , with the plans to add two more and possible other routes in 2019.       Until 31 December 2013, Fast Flying Ferries operated by  |Connexxion|Connexxion|  provided a regular  |public_transport|Public_Transport|  service over the  |North_Sea_Canal|North_Sea_Canal|  between  |Amsterdam_Central_Station|Amsterdam_Centraal|  and  |Velsen-Zuid|Velsen|  in the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , using  |Voskhod|Voskhod|  2M hydrofoils. It was stopped due to a new  |speed_limit|Speed_Limit| .   Between 1981 and 1990,  |Transmediterranea|Transmediterranea|  used to operate a service of hydrofoils connecting  |Ceuta|Ceuta|  and  |Algeciras|Algeciras|  in the Strait of Gibraltar. The crossing took half an hour, in comparison to the hour and a half of conventional ferries. Due to the common extreme winds and storms that take place in winter in the Strait of Gibraltar, the service was replaced in 1990 by catamarans, which were also able to carry cars. At the peak of the year, in summer, there was a service every half an hour in each direction. This high-speed connection had a big impact on the development of Ceuta, facilitating one-day business trips to mainland Spain.   Between 1964 and 1991 the  |Sydney_hydrofoils|Sydney_Hydrofoils|  operated on  |Sydney_Harbour|Port_Jackson|  between  |Circular_Quay|Circular_Quay|  and  |Manly|Manly,_New_South_Wales| .   During 70s and 80s there were frequent services between  |Belgrade|Belgrade|  and  |Tekija|Tekija|  in  |Đerdap_gorge|Iron_Gates| . The distance 0f  was covered in 3 hours and 30 minutes downstream and 4 hours upstream.    Between 1980 and 1981,  |B+I_Line|British_And_Irish_Steam_Packet_Company|  operated a  |Boeing_929|Boeing_929|  jetfoil, named Cú Na Mara , between Liverpool and Dublin. The service was not successful and was discontinued at the end of the 1981 season.      See also the history of  |Condor_Ferries|Condor_Ferries| , which operated six hydrofoil ferries over a 29-year period between the  |Channel_Islands|Channel_Islands| , south coast of England and  |Saint-Malo|Saint-Malo| .   Following the independence of  |Estonia|Estonia|  in the 1990s, the regular ferry service between  |Helsinki|Helsinki|  and  |Tallinn|Tallinn|  was augmented by Soviet built hydrofoils during the summer season in periods of good weather. The higher speed service competed with the traditional ro-ro ferries but allowed easy day trips for pedestrian travellers. They were ultimately replaced with high-speed catamarans that could also carry vehicles and have better seaworthiness; however, the latter ceased operations as the operator filed for bankruptcy in May 2018.           Hydrofoils had their peak in popularity in the 1960s and 70s. Since then there has been a steady decline in their use and popularity for leisure, military and commercial passenger transport use. There are a number of reasons for this:     Hydrofoils are sensitive to impacts with floating objects and marine animals. On hitting something, a hydrofoil boat may fall off the foils, which often creates a perception of increased danger. However, hydrofoils operating in  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| , reportedly some of the most littered waters, operate relatively trouble free. The Hong Kong Marine department maintains online records of all accidents in its waters.    Hydrofoils have sharp edges that reside in the water while in operation. These edges can fatally injure marine animals .   Hydrofoils are expensive to build. A vessel like the Boeing Jetfoil currently costs about three times the price of an equivalent  |catamaran|Catamaran|  passenger ferry. The increased costs are not always economically justifiable by consumers. Simpler designs such as those of Russian design and those by Rodriquez in Italy are more competitive in price and are still being produced today for operation on ferry routes.   It is a very conservative industry. Hydrofoils are still considered exotic by many commercial operators of high-speed craft and many will not risk trying such exotic vessels when they have no experience in operating them.  Those that do have found benefit in their operation.   They are technically complex and require high maintenance, which has put an end to most military hydrofoil projects. The US Navy, for example, developed some of the most technically advanced hydrofoils, but could not make the complex propulsion systems and ride control reliable. This eventually led to the suspension of their hydrofoil projects. Most other Navy developments met the same fate. The Russian Navy still operates very large hydrofoils and have been successful—largely because they opted for simpler systems that might not have the same performance as the US designs but are more robust and reliable. In Hong Kong, increasing maintenance cost of keeping the aging Jetfoils running, and sharp decrease of passenger demand after the opening of  |Hong_Kong–Zhuhai–Macau_Bridge|Hong_Kong–Zhuhai–Macau_Bridge|.
