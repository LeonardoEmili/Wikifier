      In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a  |complemented|Complemented_Lattice| |_distributive_lattice|Distributive_Lattice| . This type of  |algebraic_structure|Algebraic_Structure|  captures essential properties of both  |set|Set|  operations and  |logic|Logic|  operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a  |power_set|Power_Set|  algebra or a  |field_of_sets|Field_Of_Sets| , or its elements can be viewed as generalized  |truth_values|Truth_Value| . It is also a special case of a  |De_Morgan_algebra|De_Morgan_Algebra|  and a  |Kleene_algebra_|Kleene_Algebra| .     Every Boolean algebra  |gives_rise|Boolean_Algebra_Boolean_Rings|  to a  |Boolean_ring|Boolean_Ring| , and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to  |conjunction|Logical_Conjunction|  or  |meet|Meet|  ∧, and ring addition to  |exclusive_disjunction|Exclusive_Or|  or  |symmetric_difference|Symmetric_Difference|  . However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the  |duality_principle|Duality_Principle| . Givant and  |Paul_Halmos|Paul_Halmos| , 2009, p.  20      TOC          The term Boolean algebra honors  |George_Boole|George_Boole|  , a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the  |algebraic_system|Algebraic_System|  initially in a small pamphlet, The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between  |Augustus_De_Morgan|Augustus_De_Morgan|  and  |William_Hamilton|Sir_William_Hamilton_9Th_Baronet| , and later as a more substantial book,  The Laws of Thought , published in 1854. Booles formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by  |William_Jevons|William_Jevons|  and  |Charles_Sanders_Peirce|Charles_Sanders_Peirce| . The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and  |distributive_lattices|Distributive_Lattice|  is owed to the 1890 Vorlesungen of  |Ernst_Schröder|Ernst_Schröder| . The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is  |A_N_Whiteheads|A_N_Whitehead|  1898 Universal Algebra. Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by  |Edward_V_Huntington|Edward_V_Huntington| . Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of  |Marshall_Stone|Marshall_Stone|  in the 1930s, and with  |Garrett_Birkhoffs|Garrett_Birkhoff|  1940 Lattice Theory. In the 1960s,  |Paul_Cohen|Paul_Cohen| ,  |Dana_Scott|Dana_Scott| , and others found deep new results in  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic|  and  |axiomatic_set_theory|Axiomatic_Set_Theory|  using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely  |forcing|Forcing|  and  |Boolean_valued_models|Boolean_Valued_Model| .         A Boolean algebra is a six- |tuple|Tuple|  consisting of a  |set|Set|  A, equipped with two  |binary_operations|Binary_Operation|  ∧ , ∨ , a  |unary_operation|Unary_Operation|  ¬ and two elements 0 and 1 in A , such that for all elements a, b and c of A, the following  |axioms|Axiom|  hold: Davey, Priestley, 1990, p.109, 131, 144     ::   Note, however, that the absorption law and even the associativity law can be excluded from the set of axioms as they can be derived from the other axioms .     A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a trivial Boolean algebra or a degenerate Boolean algebra.      It follows from the last three pairs of axioms above , or from the absorption axiom, that   ::a b ∧ a       if and only if       a ∨ b b.   The relation ≤ defined by a ≤ b if these equivalent conditions hold, is a  |partial_order|Partial_Order|  with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet a ∧ b and the join a ∨ b of two elements coincide with their  |infimum|Infimum|  and  |supremum|Supremum| , respectively, with respect to ≤.     The first four pairs of axioms constitute a definition of a  |bounded_lattice|Bounded_Lattice| .     It follows from the first five pairs of axioms that any complement is unique.     The set of axioms is  |self_dual|Duality|  in the sense that if one exchanges ∨ with ∧ and 0 with 1 in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore, by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra , one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its dual. .         The simplest non-trivial Boolean algebra, the  |two_element_Boolean_algebra|Two_Element_Boolean_Algebra| , has only two elements, 0 and 1, and is defined by the rules:        : It has applications in  |logic|Logic| , interpreting 0 as false, 1 as true, ∧ as and, ∨ as or, and ¬ as not. Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms, and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are  |logically_equivalent|Logical_Equivalence| .     : The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in  |electrical_engineering|Electrical_Engineering| ; Strictly, electrical engineers tend to use additional states to represent other circuit conditions such as high impedance - see  |IEEE_1164|Ieee_1164|  or  |IEEE_1364|Ieee_1364| . here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one  |bit|Bit|  in a  |digital_circuit|Digital_Circuit| , typically high and low  |voltage|Voltage| . Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.     : The two-element Boolean algebra is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras, because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra . This can for example be used to show that the following laws  are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:   :  ∧  ∧  ≡  ∧    :  ∨  ∨  ≡  ∨      The  |power_set|Power_Set|  of any given nonempty set S forms a Boolean algebra, an  |algebra_of_sets|Algebra_Of_Sets| , with the two operations ∨ : ∪ and ∧ : ∩ . The smallest element 0 is the  |empty_set|Empty_Set|  and the largest element 1 is the set S itself.     : After the two-element Boolean algebra, the simplest Boolean algebra is that defined by the  |power_set|Power_Set|  of two atoms:    S that are either finite or  |cofinite|Cofinite|  is a Boolean algebra, an  |algebra_of_sets|Algebra_Of_Sets| .   Starting with the  |propositional_calculus|Propositional_Calculus|  with κ sentence symbols, form the  |Lindenbaum_algebra|Lindenbaum–Tarski_Algebra|  . This construction yields a Boolean algebra. It is in fact the  |free_Boolean_algebra|Free_Boolean_Algebra|  on κ generators. A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to the two-element Boolean algebra.
