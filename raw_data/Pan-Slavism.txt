   Pan-Slavism, a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the  |political_ideology|Political_Ideology|  concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the  |Slavic_speaking_peoples|Slavic_People| . Its main impact occurred in the  |Balkans|Balkans| , where non-Slavic empires had ruled the  |South_Slavs|South_Slav|  for centuries. These were mainly the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| ,  |Austria_Hungary|Austria_Hungary|  , the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , and  |Venice|Republic_Of_Venice| .       Extensive pan-Slavism began much like  |Pan_Germanism|Pan_Germanism| , both of which grew from the sense of unity and  |nationalism|Nationalism|  experienced within  |ethnic_groups|Ethnic_Group|  after the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  and the consequent  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars|  against European monarchies. Like other  |Romantic_nationalist|Romantic_Nationalism|  movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of  |history|History| ,  |philology|Philology| , and  |folklore|Folklore|  actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the  |Southern_Slavic|South_Slavs|  independence.     Commonly used symbols of the Pan-Slavic movement were the  |Pan_Slavic_colours|Pan_Slavic_Colours|  and the Pan-Slavic anthem,  Hey, Slavs .     The first pan-Slavists were the 16th-century Croatian writer  |Vinko_Pribojević|Vinko_Pribojević|  and the 17th-century  |Aleksandar_Komulović|Aleksandar_Komulović| ,  |Bartol_Kašić|Bartol_Kašić| ,  |Ivan_Gundulić|Ivan_Gundulić|  and  |Croatian|Croats| |_Catholic|Catholic_Church|  missionary  |Juraj_Križanić|Juraj_Križanić| .

The movement began following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. In the aftermath, the leaders of Europe sought to restore the pre-war  |status_quo|Status_Quo| . At the  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna| , Austrias representative,  |Prince_von_Metternich|Metternich| , felt the threat to this status quo in Austria was the nationalists demanding independence from the empire. While their subjects were composed of numerous ethnic groups , most of the subjects were Slavs.          The  |First_Pan_Slav_congress|Prague_Slavic_Congress_1848|  was held in  |Prague|Prague| ,  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  in June, 1848, during the  |revolutionary_movement_of_1848|Revolutions_Of_1848| . The Czechs had refused to send representatives to the  |Frankfurt_Assembly|Frankfurt_Assembly|  feeling that Slavs had a distinct interest from the Germans. The  |Austroslav|Austroslavism| ,  |František_Palacký|František_Palacký| , presided over the event. Most of the delegates were Czech and Slovak. Palacký called for the co-operation of the  |Habsburgs|Habsburg|  and had also endorsed the Habsburg monarchy as the political formation most likely to protect the peoples of  |central_Europe|Central_Europe| . When the Germans asked him to declare himself in favour of their desire for national unity, he replied that he would not as this would weaken the Habsburg state: “Truly, if it were not that  |Austria|Austrian_Empire|  had long existed, it would be necessary, in the interest of  |Europe|Europe| , in the interest of  |humanity|All_Humanity|  itself, to create it.”     The Pan-Slav congress met during the revolutionary turmoil of 1848. Young inhabitants of Prague had taken to the streets and in the confrontation, a stray bullet had killed the wife of  |Field_Marshal|Field_Marshal| |_Alfred_I_Prince_of_Windisch_Grätz|Alfred_I_Prince_Of_Windisch_Grätz| , the commander of the Austrian forces in Prague. Enraged, Windischgrätz seized the city, disbanded the congress, and established  |martial_law|Martial_Law|  throughout Bohemia.                  The first Pan-Slavic convention was held in Prague on June 2 through 16, 1848. See Note 134 on page 725 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14 . The delegates at the Congress were specifically both  |anti_Austrian|Austria_Hungaryethnic_Relations|  and  |anti_Russian|Russificationpoland_And_Lithuania| . Still the Right —the moderately liberal wing of the Congress—under the leadership of  |František_Palacký|František_Palacký|  , a Czech historian and politician, See the biographical note on page 784 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14. and  |Pavol_Jozef_Šafárik|Pavol_Jozef_Šafárik|  , a Slovak philologist, historian and archaeologist, See the biographical note at page 787 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14 favored autonomy of the Slav lands within the framework of Austrian monarchy. See Note 134 on page 725 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14. In contrast the Left —the radical wing of the Congress—under the leadership of  |Karel_Sabina|Karel_Sabina|  , a Czech writer and journalist,  |Josef_Václav_Frič|Josef_Václav_Frič| , a Czech nationalist,  |Karol_Libelt|Karol_Libelt|  , a Polish writer and politician, and others, pressed for a close alliance with the revolutionary-democratic movement going on in Germany and Hungary in 1848.     A national rebirth in the Hungarian Upper Land  awoke in a completely new light, both before the Slovak Uprising in 1848 and after. The driving force of this rebirth movement were Slovak writers and politicians who called themselves Štúrovci, the followers of  |Ľudovít_Štúr|Ľudovít_Štúr| . As the Slovak nobility was  |Magyarized|Magyarization|  and most Slovaks were merely farmers or priests, this movement failed to attract much attention. Nonetheless, the campaign was successful as a brotherly cooperation between the Croats and the Slovaks brought its fruit throughout the war. Most of the battles between Slovaks and Hungarians however, did not turn out in favor for the Slovaks who were logistically supported by the Austrians, but not sufficiently. The shortage of manpower proved to be decisive as well.     During the war, the  |Slovak_National_Council|Slovak_National_Council|  brought its demands to the young Austrian emperor,  |Franz_Joseph_I|Franz_Joseph_I_Of_Austria| , who seemed to take a note of it and promised support for the Slovaks against the revolutionary radical Hungarians. However the moment the revolution was over, Slovak demands were forgotten. These demands included an autonomous land within the Austrian Empire called Slovenský kraj which would be eventually led by a Serbian prince. This act of ignorance from the Emperor convinced the Slovak and the Czech elite who proclaimed the concept of Austroslavism as dead.     Disgusted by the Emperors policy, in 1849, Ľudovít Štúr, the person who codified the first official  |Slovak_language|Slovak_Language| , wrote a book he would name Slavdom and the World of the Future. This book served as a manifesto where he noted that Austroslavism was not the way to go anymore. He also wrote a sentence that often serves as a quote until this day: Every nation has its time under Gods sun, and the  |linden|Tilia|  is blossoming, while the  |oak|Oaknationalsymbol|  bloomed long ago.       He expressed confidence in the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  however, as it was the only country of Slavs that was not dominated by anybody else, yet it was one of the most powerful nations in the world. He often symbolized Slavs as being a tree, with minor Slavic nations being branches while the trunk of the tree was Russian. His Pan-Slavic views were unleashed in this book, where he stated that the land of Slovaks should be annexed by the Tsars empire and that eventually the population could be not only  |Russified|Russification| , but also converted into the rite of  |Orthodoxy|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| , religion originally spread by  |Cyril_and_Methodius|Saints_Cyril_And_Methodius|  during the times of  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia| , which served as an opposition to the  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  missionaries from the  |Franks|Franks| . After the  |Hungarian_invasion_of_Pannonia|Hungarian_Conquest_Of_The_Carpathian_Basin| , Hungarians converted into Catholicism, which effectively influenced the Slavs living in  |Pannonia|Pannonia|  and in the land south of the Lechs.     However, the Russian Empire often claimed Pan-Slavism as a justification for its aggressive moves in the Balkan Peninsula of Europe against the Ottoman Empire, which conquered and held the land of Slavs for centuries. This eventually led to the  |Balkan_campaign|Russo_Turkish_War|  of the Russian Empire, which resulted in the entire Balkan being liberated from the Ottoman Empire, with the help and the initiative of the Russian Empire. Frederick Engels, Germany and Pan-Slavism contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14, pp. 156-158. Pan-Slavism has some supporters among Czech and Slovak politicians, especially among the nationalistic and far-right ones, such as Peoples Party - Our Slovakia.     During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , captured Slavic soldiers were asked to fight against oppression in the Austrian Empire . Consequently, some did.      The creation of an independent  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  made the old ideals of Pan-Slavism anachronistic. Relations with other Slavic states varied, sometimes being so tense it escalated into an armed conflict, such as with the  |Second_Polish_Republic|Second_Polish_Republic|  where border clashes over  |Silesia|Silesia|  resulted in a short hostile conflict, the  |Polish–Czechoslovak_War|Polish–Czechoslovak_War| . Even tensions between Czechs and Slovaks had appeared before and during the World War II.             Pan-Slavism in the south would often turn to Russia for support.  The Southern Slavic movement advocated the independence of the Slavic peoples in the  |Austro_Hungarian_Empire|Austro_Hungarian_Empire| ,  |Republic_of_Venice|Republic_Of_Venice|  and the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . Some Serbian intellectuals sought to unite all of the Southern, Balkan Slavs, whether  |Catholic|Catholicism|  , or  |Orthodox|Orthodox_Church|  ,  |Bulgarians|Bulgarians| |Carniola|Carniola| ,  |Styria|Styria| ,  |Carinthia|Carinthia| ,  |Gorizia_and_Gradisca|Gorizia_And_Gradisca| ,  |Trieste|Trieste| ,  |Istria|Istria|  from Germany, Austria and Russiae.g. in Poland candidates from Związek Słowiański got no more than few thousands votes .
