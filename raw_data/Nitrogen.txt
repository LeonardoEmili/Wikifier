            Nitrogen is the  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  N and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician  |Daniel_Rutherford|Daniel_Rutherford|  in 1772. Although  |Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele|Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele|  and  |Henry_Cavendish|Henry_Cavendish|  had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist  |Jean_Antoine_Claude_Chaptal|Jean_Antoine_Claude_Chaptal|  in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  and  |nitrates|Nitrate| .  |Antoine_Lavoisier|Antoine_Lavoisier|  suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek ἀζωτικός no life , as it is an  |asphyxiant_gas|Asphyxiant_Gas| ; this name is instead used in many languages, such as  |French|French_Language| ,  |Russian|Russian_Language| ,  |Romanian|Romanian_Language|  and  |Turkish|Turkish_Language| , and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as  |hydrazine|Hydrazine| ,  |azides|Azide|  and  |azo_compounds|Azo_Compound| .     Nitrogen is the lightest member of  |group_15|Pnictogen|  of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. The name comes from the Greek πνίγειν to choke , directly referencing nitrogens asphyxiating properties. It is a common element in the  |universe|Universe| , estimated at about  |seventh_in_total_abundance|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  in the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  and the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| . At  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Temperature_And_Pressure| , two atoms of the element  |bind|Chemical_Bond|  to form dinitrogen, a colourless and odorless  |diatomic|Diatomic_Molecule| |_gas|Gas|  with the formula N 2 . Dinitrogen forms about 78% of  |Earths_atmosphere|Atmosphere_Of_Earth| , making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  , in the  |nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid|   and in the energy transfer molecule  |adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate| . The  |human_body_contains|Composition_Of_The_Human_Body|  about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The  |nitrogen_cycle|Nitrogen_Cycle|  describes movement of the element from the air, into the  |biosphere|Biosphere|  and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.     Many industrially important compounds, such as  |ammonia|Ammonia| , nitric acid, organic nitrates , and  |cyanides|Cyanide| , contain nitrogen. The extremely strong  |triple_bond|Triple_Bond|  in elemental nitrogen , the second strongest bond in any  |diatomic_molecule|Diatomic_Molecule|  after  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  , . wiredchemist.com dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N 2 into useful  |compounds|Chemical_Compound| , but at the same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial  |fertilisers|Fertiliser| , and fertiliser nitrates are key  |pollutants|Pollutant|  in the  |eutrophication|Eutrophication|  of water systems.     Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as  |Kevlar|Kevlar|  used in high-strength fabric and  |cyanoacrylate|Cyanoacrylate|  used in  |superglue|Superglue| . Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including  |antibiotics|Antibiotic| . Many drugs are mimics or  |prodrugs|Prodrug|  of natural nitrogen-containing  |signal_molecules|Cell_Signaling| |nitroglycerin|Nitroglycerin|  and  |nitroprusside|Nitroprusside|  control  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure|  by metabolizing into  |nitric_oxide|Nitric_Oxide| . Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural  |caffeine|Caffeine|  and  |morphine|Morphine|  or the synthetic  |amphetamines|Amphetamine| , act on receptors of animal  |neurotransmitters|Neurotransmitter| .          Nitrogen compounds have a very long history,  |ammonium_chloride|Ammonium_Chloride|  having been known to  |Herodotus|Herodotus| . They were well known by the Middle Ages.  |Alchemists|Alchemy|  knew nitric acid as  aqua fortis  , as well as other nitrogen compounds such as  |ammonium|Ammonium|  salts and  |nitrate|Nitrate|  salts. The mixture of nitric and  |hydrochloric_acids|Hydrochloric_Acid|  was known as  aqua regia  , celebrated for its ability to dissolve  |gold|Gold| , the king of metals.     The discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician  |Daniel_Rutherford|Daniel_Rutherford|  in 1772, who called it noxious air. Rutherford, Daniel  , M.D. dissertation, University of Edinburgh, Scotland. English translation:   Though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance, he clearly distinguished it from Joseph Blacks  |_fixed_air_|Joseph_Blackcarbon_Dioxide| , or carbon dioxide. Aaron J. Ihde, The Development of Modern Chemistry, New York 1964. The fact that there was a component of air that does not support  |combustion|Combustion|  was clear to Rutherford, although he was not aware that it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by  |Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele|Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele| , Carl Wilhelm Scheele,  . In the section titled Die Luft muß aus elastischen Flüßigkeiten von zweyerley Art, zusammengesetzet seyn. , pp. 6–14, Scheele presents the results of eight experiments in which air was reacted with various substances. He concluded  So viel sehe ich aus angeführten Versuchen, daß die Luft aus 2 von einander unterschiedenen Flußigkeiten bestehe, von welchen die eine die Eigenschaft das Phlogiston anzuziehen gar nicht äussere, die andere aber zur solchen Attraction eigentlich aufgeleget ist und welche zwischen dem 3:ten und 4:ten Theil von der ganzen Luftmasse aus machet.   |Henry_Cavendish|Henry_Cavendish| ,  ;  and  |Joseph_Priestley|Joseph_Priestley| ,  ; see:  who referred to it as burnt air or  phlogisticated air . Nitrogen gas was  |inert|Inert_Gas|  enough that  |Antoine_Lavoisier|Antoine_Lavoisier|  referred to it as  |mephitic_air|Wikt_Mephitic_Air|  or azote, from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  word  , no life . Lavoisier, Antoine with Robert Kerr, trans., Elements of Chemistry, 4th ed. , pp. 85–86.  In reflecting upon the circumstances of this experiment, we readily perceive; that the mercury, during its calcination absorbs the salubrious and respirable part of the air, or, to speak more strictly, the base of this respirable part; that the remaining air is a species of mephitis incapable of supporting combustion or respiration; …  I shall afterwards shew, that at least in our climate, the atmospheric air is composed of respirable and mephitic airs, in the proportion of 27 and 73; … Lavoisier, Antoine with Robert Kerr, trans., Elements of Chemistry, 4th ed. ,  The chemical properties of the noxious portion of the atmospheric air being hitherto but little known, we have been satisfied to derive the name of its base from its known quality of killing such animals as are forced to breathe it, giving it the name of azot, from the Greek privitive particle α and ξωη, vita; hence the name of the noxious part of atmospheric air is azotic gas. In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, animals died and flames were extinguished. Though Lavoisiers name was not accepted in English, since it was pointed out that almost all gases are mephitic, it is used in many languages  and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as  |hydrazine|Hydrazine|  and compounds of the  |azide|Azide|  ion. Finally, it led to the name  |pnictogens|Pnictogen|  for the group headed by nitrogen, from the Greek πνίγειν to choke . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 406–07     The English word nitrogen entered the language from the French nitrogène, coined in 1790 by French chemist  |Jean_Antoine_Chaptal|Jean_Antoine_Chaptal|  , Chaptal, J. A. and Nicholson, William trans. Elements of Chemistry, 3rd ed. London, England: C.C. and J. Robinson, vol. 1.  In order to correct the Nomenclature on this head nothing more is necessary than to substitute to this word a denomination which is derived from the general system made use of; and I have presumed to propose that of Nitrogene Gas. In the first place, it is deduced from the characteristic and exclusive property of this gas, which forms the radical of the nitric acid. By this means we shall preserve to the combinations of this substance the received denominations, such as those of the Nitric Acid, Nitrates, Nitrites, & c. from the French nitre  and the French suffix -gène, producing , from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  -γενής . Chaptals meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| , which in turn was produced from  |nitre|Nitre| . In earlier times, niter had been confused with Egyptian natron   – called νίτρον in Greek  – which, despite the name, contained no nitrate. . Etymonline.com. Retrieved 2011-10-26.     The earliest military, industrial, and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter , most notably in  |gunpowder|Gunpowder| , and later as  |fertiliser|Fertiliser| . In 1910,  |Lord_Rayleigh|John_William_Strutt_3Rd_Baron_Rayleigh|  discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced active nitrogen , a  |monatomic|Monatomic| |_allotrope|Allotrope|  of nitrogen.

Retrieved 2011-10-26.     For a long time, sources of nitrogen compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions.  |Nitrogen_fixation|Nitrogen_Fixation|  by industrial processes like the  |Frank–Caro_process|Frank–Caro_Process|  and  |Haber–Bosch_process|Haber–Bosch_Process|  eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, to the extent that half of global  |food_production|Food_Production|  now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.  At the same time, use of the  |Ostwald_process|Ostwald_Process|  to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as  |feedstock|Feedstock|  in the manufacture of  |explosives|Explosives|  in the  |World_Wars|World_War|  of the 20th century.                A nitrogen atom has seven electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron|  in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which are unpaired. It has one of the highest  |electronegativities|Electronegativity|  among the elements , exceeded only by  |chlorine|Chlorine|  ,  |oxygen|Oxygen|  , and  |fluorine|Fluorine|  . Following periodic trends, its single-bond  |covalent_radius|Covalent_Radius|  of 71  pm is smaller than those of  |boron|Boron|  and  |carbon|Carbon|  , while it is larger than those of oxygen and fluorine . The  |nitride|Nitride|  anion, N 3− , is much larger at 146  pm, similar to that of the  |oxide|Oxide|  and  |fluoride|Fluoride|  anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577  MJ·mol −1 , and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920  MJ·mol −1 . Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 550     The lack of radial nodes in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the  |p_block|P_Block| , especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating  |orbital_hybridisation|Orbital_Hybridization| . It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities.  |Hypervalency|Hypervalent_Molecule|  is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich  |three_center_four_electron_bond|Three_Center_Four_Electron_Bond|  since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogens position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners  |phosphorus|Phosphorus| ,  |arsenic|Arsenic| ,  |antimony|Antimony| , and  |bismuth|Bismuth| .      Nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Although each period 2 element from lithium to oxygen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group , their degree drops off abruptly past the boron–silicon pair. The similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present.     While it does not share the proclivity of carbon for  |catenation|Catenation| , nitrogen chains composed of eight atoms and more are obtainable. Like carbon, nitrogen tends to form ionic or metallic compounds with metals. Nitrogen forms an extensive series of nitrides with carbon, including those with chain-,  |graphitic_|Graphite| , and  |fullerenic|Fullerene| -like structures.      It resembles oxygen with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for  |hydrogen_bond|Hydrogen_Bond| ing and the ability to form  |coordination_complex|Coordination_Complex| es by donating its  |lone_pairs|Lone_Pair|  of electrons. There are some parallels between the chemistry of ammonia NH 3 and water H 2 O. For example, the capacity of both compounds to be pronated to give NH 4 + and H 3 0 + or deprotonated to give NH 2 − and OH − , with all of these able to be isolated in solid compounds.      The high electronegativity of nitrogen is misleading.  Nitrogen has a negative  |electron_affinity|Electron_Affinity| , which means that energy is required to add an electron to it. This is because nitrogen has three p-orbitals each occupied with one electron. An incoming electron will experience significant repulsion from the electrons in these orbitals. This does not happen with carbon, which has one unoccupied p sub shell. Nor does it occur with oxygen, since the increased  |nuclear_charge|Nuclear_Charge|  is sufficient to overcome inter-electron repulsion effects.     Nitrogen shares with both its horizontal neighbours a preference for forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, oxygen, or other nitrogen atoms, through p π –p π interactions. Thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and therefore has very much lower  |melting|Melting_Point|  and  |boiling_points|Boiling_Point|  than the rest of its group, as the N 2 molecules are only held together by weak  |van_der_Waals_interactions|Van_Der_Waals_Interaction|  and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles.     This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the  |nitrogen_oxides|Nitrogen_Oxide| ,  |nitrites|Nitrite| ,  |nitrates|Nitrate| ,  |nitro_|Nitro_Compound| ,  |nitroso|Nitroso| -,  |azo|Azo_Compound| -, and  |diazo|Diazo| -compounds,  |azides|Azide| ,  |cyanates|Cyanate| ,  |thiocyanates|Thiocyanate| , and  |imino|Imino| -derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen. Setting aside their differences, nitrogen and phosphorus form an extensive series of compounds with one another; these have chain, ring, and cage structures.              Nitrogen has two stable  |isotopes|Isotope| : 14 N and 15 N. The first is much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007  u. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 411–12 Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the  |CNO_cycle|Cno_Cycle|  in  |stars|Star| , but 14 N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14 N is one of the five stable  |odd–odd_nuclides|Even_And_Odd_Atomic_Nuclei|  ; the other four are  |_2_H|Deuterium| , 6 Li, 10 B, and 180m Ta.      The relative abundance of 14 N and 15 N is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological  |redox|Redox|  reactions and the evaporation of natural  |ammonia|Ammonia|  or  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| .  Biologically mediated reactions  strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15 N enrichment of the  |substrate|Substrate|  and depletion of the  |product|Product| .      The heavy isotope 15 N was first discovered by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |carbon|Carbon|  were discovered. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 408 It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes.  It is frequently used in  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance|  spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional  |nuclear_spin|Nuclear_Spin|  of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14 N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a  |quadrupole_moment|Quadrupole_Moment|  that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15 N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more common 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15 N significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low  |gyromagnetic_ratio|Gyromagnetic_Ratio| , . As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1 H is about 300 times as much as that for 15 N at the same magnetic field strength.  This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15 N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15 N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| , carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15 N: 14 N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of  |geochemistry|Geochemistry| ,  |hydrology|Hydrology| ,  |paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatology|  and  |paleoceanography|Paleoceanography| , where it is called  |δ_15_N|Δ15N| .      Of the ten other isotopes produced synthetically, ranging from 12 N to 23 N,  |_13_N|Nitrogen_13|  has a  |half_life|Half_Life|  of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives on the order of seconds or even milliseconds. No other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the  |nuclear_drip_lines|Nuclear_Drip_Line| , leaking out a proton or neutron.  Given the half-life difference, 13 N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in  |positron_emission_tomography|Positron_Emission_Tomography|  , although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a  |cyclotron|Cyclotron|  via proton bombardment of 16 O producing 13 N and an  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle| .      The  |radioisotope|Radioisotope|  16 N is the dominant  |radionuclide|Radionuclide|  in the coolant of  |pressurised_water_reactors|Pressurised_Water_Reactor|  or  |boiling_water_reactors|Boiling_Water_Reactor|  during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16 O via an  |_reaction|Np_Reaction|  in which the 16 O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16 O produces high-energy  |gamma_radiation|Gamma_Radiation|  .  Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during  |reactor|Nuclear_Reactor|  power operation.              Atomic nitrogen, also known as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a  |triradical|Radical|  with three unpaired electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N 2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and  |water|Water|  to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2  mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 412–16     Given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N 2 , dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless  |diamagnetic|Diamagnetic|  gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210  °C and boils at −196  °C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, but it will nevertheless react with  |lithium|Lithium|  metal and some  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal|  complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N  |triple_bond|Triple_Bond| . Triple bonds have short bond lengths and high dissociation energies , and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogens chemical inertness.     There are some theoretical indications that other nitrogen  |oligomers|Oligomers|  and polymers may be possible. If they could be synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives.  This is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond is much stronger than those of the NN double bond or the N–N single bond : indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 483 A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown  |tetrahedrane|Tetrahedrane| . This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens  |azide|Azide|  ,  |pentazenium|Pentazenium|  , and  |pentazolide|Pentazole|  . Under extremely high pressures  and high temperatures , as produced in a  |diamond_anvil_cell|Diamond_Anvil_Cell| , nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded  |cubic_gauche|Cubic_Gauche|  crystal structure. This structure is similar to that of  |diamond|Diamond| , and both have extremely strong  |covalent_bonds|Covalent_Bond| , resulting in its nickname nitrogen diamond .         At  |atmospheric_pressure|Atmospheric_Pressure| , molecular nitrogen  |condenses|Condensation|   at 77   |K|Kelvin|   and  |freezes|Freezing|  at 63  K  into the beta  |hexagonal_close_packed|Hexagonal_Close_Packed|  crystal  |allotropic|Allotropy|  form. Below 35.4  K nitrogen assumes the  |cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|  crystal allotropic form .   |Liquid_nitrogen|Liquid_Nitrogen| , a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density , is a common  |cryogen|Cryogen| .   |Solid_nitrogen|Solid_Nitrogen|  has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on  |Pluto|Pluto|   and outer moons of the Solar System such as  |Triton|Triton| .  Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can  |sublime|Sublimation|  to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows in the form of glaciers and on Triton  |geysers|Geyser|  of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.              The first example of a  |dinitrogen_complex|Dinitrogen_Complex|  to be discovered was 2+ , and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These  |complexes|Complex| , in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation, illustrate how N 2 might bind to the metal in  |nitrogenase|Nitrogenase|  and the  |catalyst|Catalysis|  for the  |Haber_process|Haber_Process|       Dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N  and M←N≡N→M , in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a  |bridging_ligand|Bridging_Ligand|  to two metal cations  or to just one . The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond . A few complexes feature multiple N 2 ligands and some feature N 2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N 2 is isoelectronic with  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  and  |acetylene|Acetylene|  , the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in  |carbonyl|Carbonyl|  compounds, although N 2 is a weaker σ-donor and π-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that σ donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M–N bond than π back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on  donation is more readily accomplished than side-on  donation.     Today, dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals, accounting for several hundred compounds. They are normally prepared by three methods:   Replacing labile ligands such as  |H_2_O|Water| ,  |H_−_|Hydride| , or  |CO|Carbon_Monoxide|  directly by nitrogen: these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions.   Reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable coligand in excess under nitrogen gas. A common choice include replacing chloride ligands by  |dimethylphenylphosphine|Dimethylphenylphosphine|  to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached than the original chlorine ligands.   Converting a ligand with N–N bonds, such as hydrazine or azide, directly into a dinitrogen ligand.   Occasionally the N≡N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex, for example by directly reacting coordinated  |ammonia|Ammonia|  with  |nitrous_acid|Nitrous_Acid|  , but this is not generally applicable. Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown; a few exceptions are known, such as the blue  2 -.       Nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first three  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas| es,  |helium|Helium| ,  |neon|Neon| , and  |argon|Argon| , and some of the very short-lived elements after  |bismuth|Bismuth| , creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications. Many binary compounds are known: with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides, oxides, and fluorides, these are typically called  |nitrides|Nitride| . Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements   .
