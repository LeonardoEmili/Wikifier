        Jean-Michel Basquiat  was an American artist of  |Haitian|Haitian_Americans|  and  |Puerto_Rican|Puerto_Ricans|  descent. Basquiat first achieved fame as part of  |SAMO|Samo| , an informal  |graffiti|Graffiti|  duo who wrote enigmatic  |epigrams|Epigram|  in the cultural hotbed of the  |Lower_East_Side|Lower_East_Side|  of  |Manhattan|Manhattan|  during the late 1970s, where  |rap|Rap| ,  |punk|Punk_Visual_Art| , and  |street_art|Street_Art|  coalesced into early  |hip_hop_music|Hip_Hop_Music|  culture. By the 1980s, his  |neo_expressionist|Neo_Expressionism|  paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. The  |Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art|Whitney_Museum_Of_American_Art|  held a retrospective of his art in 1992.     Basquiats art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He  |appropriated|Appropriation|  poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image,  |abstraction|Abstract_Art| ,  |figuration|Figurative_Art| , and historical information mixed with contemporary critique.     Basquiat used  |social_commentary|Social_Commentary|  in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community of his time, as well as attacks on  |power_structures|Power|  and systems of racism. Basquiats visual poetics were acutely  |political|Political_Criticism|  and direct in their criticism of  |colonialism|Colonialism|  and support for  |class_struggle|Class_Conflict| . He died of a  |heroin_overdose|Opioid_Overdose|  at his art studio at the age of 27. On May 18, 2017, at a  |Sothebys|Sothebys|  auction, a 1982 painting by Basquiat depicting a black skull with red and black rivulets  set a new record high for any American artist at auction, selling for $110.5 million. Basquiats art has inspired many in the  |hip_hop_music|Hip_Hop_Music|  community such as Jay-Z.         Jean-Michel Basquiat was born in  |Brooklyn|Brooklyn| , New York, on December 22, 1960, shortly after the death of his older brother, Max. He was the second of four children of Matilde Basquiat  , Lodge Communications 185, Harry S Truman Lodge No.1066,  |F_A_M_|F_A_M_| , December 4, 2008. New York, New York. Sad Tidings for Brother John Andrades. and Gérard Basquiat .   by James Fanelli, September 5, 2013, 6:27am.  by  The New York Times  . He had two younger sisters: Lisane, born in 1964, and Jeanine, born in 1967.      His father, Gérard Basquiat, was born in  |Port_au_Prince|Port_Au_Prince| , Haiti, and his mother, Matilde Basquiat, who was of Puerto Rican descent, was born in  |Brooklyn|Brooklyn| , New York. Matilde instilled a love for art in her young son by taking him to art museums in Manhattan and enrolling him as a junior member of the  |Brooklyn_Museum_of_Art|Brooklyn_Museum| .  Basquiat was a precocious child who learned how to read and write by the age of four and was a gifted artist. His teachers, including artist José Machado, noticed his artistic abilities, and his mother encouraged her sons artistic talent. By the age of 11, Basquiat was fully fluent in French, Spanish and English. In 1967, Basquiat started attending  |Saint_Anns_School|Saint_Anns_School| , an arts-oriented exclusive private school. Phoebe Hoban,  The New York Times Arthur C. Danto,  The Nation Lisa J. Curtis,  Brooklyn Paper There he met his friend Marc Prozzo; together they created a childrens book, written by Basquiat and illustrated by Prozzo. Basquiat became an avid reader of Spanish, French, and English texts and a good athlete, competing in track events.     In September 1968, at the age of seven, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street. His arm was broken and he suffered several internal injuries; he eventually underwent a  |splenectomy|Splenectomy| .  While he was recuperating from his injuries, his mother brought him a copy of  Grays Anatomy  to keep him occupied. This book would prove to be influential in his future artistic outlook. His parents separated that year and he and his sisters were raised by their father.   by Lindsay Pollock . The family resided in  |Boerum_Hill|Boerum_Hill| , Brooklyn, for five years, then moved to  |San_Juan_Puerto_Rico|San_Juan_Puerto_Rico| , in 1974, where Basquiat studied at Saint Johns School in  |Condado|Condado| . After two years, they returned to New York City.       When he was 13, his mother was committed to a mental institution and thereafter spent her life in and out of institutions. Fretz, Eric.  . Greenwood Press, 2010. . Cf.  Due to his mothers instability and family unrest, at 15 Basquiat ran away from home.  He slept on park benches in  |Tompkins_Square_Park|Tompkins_Square_Park| , and was arrested and returned to the care of his father within a week.  Basquiat dropped out of  |Edward_R_Murrow_High_School|Edward_R_Murrow_High_School|  in the 10th grade at the age of 17 and then attended  |City_As_School|City_As_School| , an alternative high school in Manhattan, home to many artistic students who failed at conventional schooling. His father banished him from the household for dropping out of high school and Basquiat stayed with friends in Brooklyn. He supported himself by selling T-shirts and homemade post cards.        Basquiats transition from being homeless and unemployed to becoming a prosperous artist took place in a short space of time. By 1980, he would be selling a single painting for up to $25,000.  In 1976, Basquiat and his friend Al Diaz began spray painting  |graffiti|Graffiti|  on buildings in  |Lower_Manhattan|Lower_Manhattan| , working under the pseudonym  |SAMO|Samo| . The designs featured inscribed messages within his Untitled works such as Plush safe he think... SAMO and SAMO as an escape clause . In 1978, Basquiat worked for the Unique Clothing Warehouse in their art department at 718 Broadway in  |NoHo|Noho_Manhattan| , and at night he continued using the pseudonym SAMO , painting his original graffiti  art on neighborhood buildings. Uniques founder Harvey Russack discovered Basquiat painting a building one night, they became friends, and he offered him a day job. On December 11, 1978,  The Village Voice  published an article about the graffiti. Faflick, Philip. The SAMO Graffiti ... Boosh-Wah or CIA? Village Voice, December 11, 1978: p. 41. When Basquiat and Diaz ended their friendship, the SAMO project ended with the epitaph SAMO IS DEAD , inscribed on the walls of  |SoHo|Soho_Manhattan|  buildings in 1979. Cf. Fretz, pp. 46–47.        In 1979, Basquiat appeared on the live  |public_access_television|Public_Access_Television|  show  TV Party  hosted by  |Glenn_OBrien|Glenn_Obrien| , and the two started a friendship. Basquiat made regular appearances on the show over the next few years. That same year, Basquiat formed the  |noise_rock|Noise_Rock|  band Test Pattern – which was later renamed Gray – which played at  |Arleen_Schlosss|Arleen_Schloss|  open space, Wednesdays at As .  In October 1979, at the same club, Basquiat showed his SAMO montages using color Xerox copies of his works.     Other members of Gray included Shannon Dawson,  |Michael_Holman|Michael_Holman| , Nick Taylor, Wayne Clifford and  |Vincent_Gallo|Vincent_Gallo| , and the band performed at nightclubs such as  |Maxs_Kansas_City|Maxs_Kansas_City| ,  |CBGB|Cbgb| ,  |Hurrah|Hurrah|  and the  |Mudd_Club|Mudd_Club| . In 1980, Basquiat starred in OBriens  |independent_film|Independent_Film|   Downtown 81 , originally titled New York Beat. That same year, Basquiat met  |Andy_Warhol|Andy_Warhol|  at a restaurant. Basquiat presented to Warhol samples of his work, and Warhol was stunned by Basquiats mystique and allure.  Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child , directed by  |Tamra_Davis|Tamra_Davis|  . The two artists later collaborated. Downtown 81 featured some of Grays recordings on its soundtrack.  Andy Kellman. Downtown 81 Original Soundtrack. Retrieved January 16, 2008. Basquiat also appeared in the 1981  |Blondie|Blondie|  music video  |Rapture|Rapture| , in a role originally intended for  |Grandmaster_Flash|Grandmaster_Flash| ,  on  Pop-Up Video . as a nightclub disc jockey.          During the early 1980s, Basquiat made his breakthrough as a solo artist. In June 1980, Basquiat participated in The Times Square Show, a multi-artist exhibition sponsored by  |Collaborative_Projects_Incorporated|Colab|  and  |Fashion_Moda|Fashion_Moda|  where he was noticed by various critics and curators. In particular Emilio Mazzoli, an Italian gallerist, saw the exhibition and invited Basquiat to Modena to have his world first solo show, that opened on May 23, 1981. In December 1981,  |Rene_Ricard|Rene_Ricard|  published The Radiant Child in  Artforum  magazine.   At this time, Basquiat painted many pieces on found objects, such as discarded doors.     In March 1982, he painted in  |Modena|Modena| , Italy, for his second Italian exhibition. Starting in November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space  |Larry_Gagosian|Larry_Gagosian|  had built below his  |Venice|Venice_California| , California home. There, Basquiat commenced a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at  |Gagosian_Gallery|Gagosian_Gallery|  which was then in West Hollywood. Fred Hoffman ,   Los Angeles Times . He brought along his girlfriend, then-unknown aspiring singer  |Madonna|Madonna| .  Gagosian recalls, Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and we were having a lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, My girlfriend is coming to stay with me. I was a little concerned–one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, Well, whats she like? And he said, Her name is Madonna and shes going to be huge. Ill never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.  During this time, Basquiat took considerable interest in the work that  |Robert_Rauschenberg|Robert_Rauschenberg|  was producing at  |Gemini_G_E_L_|Gemini_G_E_L_|  in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter.        In late 1981, Basquiat met Annina Nosei with his first exhibition in her gallery in a group show called Public Address with  |Keith_Haring|Keith_Haring|  and  |Barbara_Kruger|Barbara_Kruger|  among others, and he joined the Annina Nosei gallery and worked in a basement below the gallery toward his first American one-man show from March 6 to April 1, 1982.  At the time, and while dating others, Basquiat was living with his girlfriend , Suzanne Mallouk, who later specifically described his  |sexuality|Sexual_Orientation|  in  |Jennifer_Clements|Jennifer_Clement|  book, Widow Basquiat, as: ... not monochromatic. It did not rely on visual stimulation, such as a pretty girl. It was a very rich multichromatic sexuality. He was attracted to people for all different reasons. They could be boys, girls, thin, fat, pretty, ugly. It was, I think, driven by intelligence. He was attracted to intelligence more than anything and to pain.      In 1983, Basquiat produced a  |12_inch|12_Inch_Single| |_rap|Rapping|  single featuring  |hip_hop|Hip_Hop_Music|  artists  |Rammellzee|Rammellzee|  and  |K_Rob|K_Rob| . Billed as Rammellzee vs. K-Rob, the single contained two versions of the same track:  |Beat_Bop|Beat_Bop|  on the A-side with vocals, with the B-side adding an instrumental version.  The single was pressed in limited quantities on the one-off Tartown Record Company label. The singles cover featured Basquiats artwork, making the pressing highly desirable among both record and art collectors. A large number of photographs depict a 2-3 year collaboration between Warhol and Basquiat from 1983 and 1985 which included Olympic Rings , in which Warhol made some Olympic five-ring symbols rendered in the original primary colors and which Basquiat stylized with his graffiti style.   |Gagosian_Gallery|Gagosian_Gallery| , London. Basquiat often painted in expensive  |Armani|Armani|  suits; and he would even appear in public in the same paint-splattered clothes.  , Haworth Press, 2004, p. 299.           By 1986, Basquiat had left the Annina Nosei gallery and was showing at the  |Mary_Boone|Mary_Boone|  gallery in SoHo. On February 10, 1985, he appeared on the cover of  The New York Times Magazine  in a feature titled New Art, New Money: The Marketing of an American Artist . Cathleen McGuigan, New Art, New Money , The New York Times Magazine, February 2005. In spite of his artistic success in this period, his emotional instability continued to haunt him and caused him to begin to use heroin frequently. Many of his peers speculated that his heroin use was a means of coping with the demands of his newfound fame, the exploitative nature of the art industry, and the pressures of being a black man in the white-dominated art world. Michael Wines, , The New York Times, August 27, 1988     Following his return from a trip to Hawaii in the last year of his life, Keith Haring reports meeting with Basquiat who was glad to tell Haring that he had finally kicked his dependence on drugs. Jean Michel Basquiat. Taschen Press . Page 440. Despite attempts at sobriety, he died on August 12, 1988, of a  |heroin_overdose|Opioid_Overdose|  at his art studio on  |Great_Jones_Street|Great_Jones_Street|  in Manhattans  |NoHo|Noho_Manhattan|  neighborhood.    He was  |27_years_old|27_Club| .      Basquiat was interred in Brooklyns  |Green_Wood_Cemetery|Green_Wood_Cemetery| , where  |Jeffrey_Deitch|Jeffrey_Deitch|  made a graveside speech. Among those speaking at Basquiats memorial held at Saint Peters Church on November 3, 1988, was Ingrid Sischy who, as the editor of  Artforum  in the 1980s, got to know the artist well and commissioned a number of articles that introduced his work to the wider world.  Suzanne Mallouk recited sections of  |A_R_Pencks|A_R_Penck|  Poem for Basquiat and  |Fab_5_Freddy|Fab_5_Freddy|  read a poem by  |Langston_Hughes|Langston_Hughes| .   The New York Times  Books. The 300 guests included musicians  |John_Lurie|John_Lurie|  and  |Arto_Lindsay|Arto_Lindsay| ; artist  |Keith_Haring|Keith_Haring| ; poet  |David_Shapiro|David_Shapiro| ;  |Glenn_OBrien|Glenn_Obrien| , a writer; Fab 5 Freddy; and members of the band Gray, which Basquiat led in the late 1970s.  In memory of the late artist, Keith Haring created Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat .  In his memorial words for Basquiat, Haring stated: He truly created a lifetime of works in ten years. Greedily, we wonder what else he might have created, what masterpieces we have been cheated out of by his death, but the fact is that he has created enough work to intrigue generations to come. Only now will people begin to understand the magnitude of his contribution .            According to  |Franklin_Sirmans|Franklin_Sirmans| , Basquiat  |appropriated|Appropriation|  poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image,  |abstraction|Abstract_Art| ,  |figuration|Figurative_Art| , and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. Sirmans, Franklin. In the Cipher: Basquiat and Hip Hop Culture from the book Basquiat. Mayer, Marc . Merrell Publishers in association with the Brooklyn Museum, , pp. 91–105. Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that underlying Basquiats self-identification as an artist was his innate capacity to function as something like an  |oracle|Oracle| , distilling his perceptions of the outside world down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative acts. Additionally, continuing his activities as a graffiti artist, Basquiat often incorporated words into his paintings. Before his career as a painter began, he produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for the political–poetical graffiti under the name of  |SAMO|Samo| . On one occasion Basquiat painted his girlfriends dress with the words Little Shit Brown . He would often draw on random objects and surfaces, including other peoples property. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of Basquiats art. His paintings are typically covered with text and codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, diagrams and more.      Basquiats art focused on recurrent suggestive dichotomies , such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. Hoffman, Fred. The Defining Years: Notes on Five Key Works from the book Basquiat. Mayer, Marc . Merrell Publishers in association with the Brooklyn Museum, , pp. 129–139. A middle period from late 1982 to 1985 featured multi-panel paintings and individual canvases with exposed stretcher bars, the surface dense with writing, collage and imagery. The years 1984–85 were also the main period of the Basquiat–Warhol collaborations, even if, in general, they were not very well received by the critics. A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book  Grays Anatomy , which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital aged seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss Symbol Sourcebook,  |Leonardo_da_Vincis|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  notebooks, and Burchard Brentjes African Rock Art.       A prominent theme in the early Basquiat portrayed historically prominent black figures, such as  |Charlie_Parker|Charlie_Parker| , who were identified by Basquiat as black heroes and saints. These were often identified with the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in Basquiats specially chosen pantheon. As the Art Daily described Basquiats show in the Bilbao Guggenheim: The show is divided into eight different sections on the Museums third floor and begins in Gallery 305, where his earliest creations are displayed under two themes: “Street as Studio” and “Heroes and Saints”. The urban landscape inspired the subject matter, approach, and materials used in these pieces . Art Daily. Jean-Michel Basquiat: Nows the Time on view at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.             In his short career, Basquiat produced around 1500  |drawings|Drawing| , as well as around 600 paintings and many sculpture and mixed media works. Basquiat drew constantly, and often used objects around him as surfaces when paper was not immediately at hand.   Since childhood, Basquiat produced cartoon-inspired drawings when encouraged by his mothers interest in art, and drawing became a part of his expression as an artist.  Basquiats drawings were produced in many different media, most commonly ink, pencil, felt-tip or marker, and oil-stick. Basquiat sometimes used  |Xerox|Xerox_Art|  copies of fragments of his drawings to paste on to the canvas of larger paintings.      The first public showing of Basquiats paintings and drawings was in 1981: New York/New Wave, at  |PS1|Ps1_Contemporary_Art_Center|  in Long Island City, brought together by  |Mudd_Club|Mudd_Club|  co-founder and curator  |Diego_Cortez|Diego_Cortez| . It was a group show that included pieces by  |William_Burroughs|William_S_Burroughs| ,  |David_Byrne|David_Byrne| ,  |Keith_Haring|Keith_Haring| ,  |Nan_Goldin|Nan_Goldin|  and  |Robert_Mapplethorpe|Robert_Mapplethorpe| .   The article in Artforum magazine entitled Radiant Child written by  |Rene_Ricard|Rene_Ricard|  after seeing the show at PS1, brought Basquiat to the attention of the art world.  In 1984 Basquiat immortalised Ricard in two drawings, Untitled  and Rene Ricard,  representing the tension that existed between them.     A poet as well as an artist, words featured heavily in his drawings and paintings, with direct references to racism, slavery, the people and street scene of 1980s New York including other artists, and black historical figures, musicians and sports stars, as his notebooks and many important drawings demonstrate.   Often Basquiats drawings were untitled, and as such to differentiate works a word written within the drawing is commonly in parentheses after Untitled, such as with Untitled . After Basquiat died of an overdose at the age of 27, his estate was controlled by his father Gérard Basquiat, who also oversaw the committee which authenticated artworks, and operated from 1993 to 2012 to review over 1000 works, the majority of which were drawings.               Heads and skulls are seen as significant focal points of many of Basquiats most seminal works. Two pieces, Untitled   and Untitled ,  held by the  |Broad_Foundation|Broad_Foundation|  and  |Maezawa_Foundation|Yusaku_Maezawa| , respectively, can be seen as primary examples. In reference to the potent image depicted in both pieces, Fred Hoffman writes that Basquiat was likely, caught off guard, possibly even frightened, by the power and energy emanating from this unexpected image. Further investigation by Fred Hoffman of pieces like Masonic Lodge 1983 and Untitled in his book The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat reveals a deeper interest in the artists fascination with heads that proves an evolution in the artists oeuvre from one of raw power to one of more refined cognizance. Hoffman, Fred. The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Gallerie Enrico Navarra / 2017            According to Andrea Frohne, Basquiats painting Untitled  reclaims Egyptians as African and subverts the concept of ancient Egypt as the cradle of Western Civilization .   At the center of the painting, Basquiat depicts an Egyptian boat being guided down the  |Nile_River|Nile|  by  |Osiris|Osiris| , the Egyptian god of the earth and vegetation.  On the right panel of the painting appear the words Esclave, Slave, Esclave . Two letters of the word Nile are crossed out and Frohne suggests that, The letters that are wiped out and scribbled over perhaps reflect the acts of historians who have conveniently forgotten that Egyptians were black and blacks were enslaved.  On the left panel of the painting Basquiat has illustrated two  |Nubia|Nubia| n-style masks. The  |Nubians|Nubian_People|  historically were darker in skin color, and were considered to be slaves by the Egyptian people.  Throughout the rest of the painting, images of the  |Atlantic_slave_trade|Atlantic_Slave_Trade|  are juxtaposed alongside images of the  |Egyptian_slave_trade|Slavery_In_Ancient_Egypt|  centuries before.  The sickle in the center panel is a direct reference to the slave trade in the United States, and slave labor under the plantation system. The word salt that appears on the right panel of the work refers to the Atlantic slave trade, as salt was another important commodity traded at that time.      Another of Basquiats pieces, Irony of Negro Policeman , is intended to illustrate how he believes African-Americans have been controlled by a predominantly  |Caucasian|Caucasian_Race|  society. Basquiat sought to portray that African-Americans have become complicit with the institutionalized forms of whiteness and corrupt white regimes of power years after the  |Jim_Crow_era|Jim_Crow_Laws|  had ended.  This concept has been reiterated in additional Basquiat works, including his titled . However Basquiat found the idea of the “negro policeman” specifically ironic. The hat that frames the head of the Negro policeman resembles a cage, and represents what Basquiat believes are the constrained independent perceptions of African Americans at the time, and how constrained the policemans own perceptions were within white society. Basquiat drew upon his Haitian heritage by painting a hat that resembles the top hat associated with the  family of , who embody the powers of death in  |Vodou|Haitian_Vodou| .   However, Kellie Jones, in her essay Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the Mix, posits that Basquiats mischievous, complex, and  |neologistic|Neologism|  side, with regard to the fashioning of modernity and the influence and effluence of black culture are often elided by critics and viewers, and thus lost in translation. Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the Mix, by Kellie Jones, from the book Basquiat, edited by Marc Mayer, 2005, Merrell Publishers in association with the Brooklyn Museum, , pp. 163–179. The art historian  |Olivier_Berggruen|Olivier_Berggruen|  situates in Basquiats anatomical screen prints, titled Anatomy, an assertion of vulnerability, one which creates an aesthetic of the body as damaged, scarred, fragmented, incomplete, or torn apart, once the organic whole has disappeared. Paradoxically, it is the very act of creating these representations that conjures a positive corporeal valence between the artist and his sense of self or identity.          Traditionally, the interpretation of Basquiats works at the visual level comes from the subdued emotional tone of what they represent compared to what is actually depicted. For example, the figures in his paintings, as stated by  |Stephen_Metcalf|Stephen_Metcalf| , are shown frontally, with little or no depth of field, and nerves and organs are exposed, as in an anatomy textbook. Are these creatures dead and being clinically dissected, one wonders, or alive and in immense pain? Stephen Metcalf ,   The Atlantic . In a similar vein, Jordana Moore Saggese states the action represented in the paintings of Basquiat have been referred to as a tribute to jazz indicating that, Parker, Gillespie, and the other musicians of the bebop era infamously appropriated both the harmonic structures of jazz standards, using them as a structure for their own songs, and repeated similar note patterns across several improvisations. Jordana Moore Saggese ,   Khan Academy .     A second recurrent reference to Basquiats aesthetics comes from the artist intention to share, in the words of Niru Ratnum, a highly individualistic, expressive view of the world . Niru Ratnam ,   The Spectator .  |David_Bowie|David_Bowie| , a collector of Basquiats works, stated that He seemed to digest the frenetic flow of passing image and experience, put them through some kind of internal reorganization and dress the canvas with this resultant network of chance. Ekow eshun ,   Independent . Basquiat seems to invite us to, in the words of Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo, paint like a child, dont paint what is on the surface... Finally every energy you drop is marking a territory, is a traffic sign, is directing and feeding spirits. What seems like a mess for some of us in the Cartesian logic, it is maybe a clear spiritual route for some others. Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo ,   Contemporary Art Theory . Fred Hoffman stated that a painting from Basquiat typically shows the artists vitality and energy being continually challenged by life-draining organisms. Fred Hoffman ,   American Suburb X . Reviews about his work have been written on the direct relation of painting and graffiti. Regarding the relation between painting and graffiti,  |Olivia_Laing|Olivia_Laing|  states: Words jumped out at him, from the back of cereal boxes or subway ads, and he stayed alert to their subversive properties, their double and hidden meaning. Olivia Laing ,   The Guardian .     In the words of the Marc Mayer essay Basquiat in History , Basquiat speaks articulately while dodging the full impact of clarity like a  |matador|Torero| . We can read his pictures without strenuous effort—the words, the images, the colors and the construction—but we cannot quite fathom the point they belabor. Keeping us in this state of half-knowing, of mystery-within-familiarity, had been the core technique of his brand of communication since his adolescent days as the graffiti poet SAMO. To enjoy them, we are not meant to analyze the pictures too carefully. Quantifying the encyclopedic breadth of his research certainly results in an interesting inventory, but the sum cannot adequately explain his pictures, which requires an effort outside the purview of  |iconography|Iconography|  ... he painted a calculated incoherence, calibrating the mystery of what such apparently meaning-laden pictures might ultimately mean. Basquiat, edited by Marc Mayer, 2005, Merrell Publishers in association with the Brooklyn Museum, , p. 50.       Basquiats first public exhibition in June 1980 was in the group effort The Times Square Show , held in a vacant building at 41st Street and Seventh Avenue, New York. In late 1981, Basquiat joined the Annina Nosei gallery in SoHo; his first one-person exhibition was in 1982 at that gallery.  MoMA Collection, New York. By then, he was showing regularly alongside other Neo-expressionist artists including  |Julian_Schnabel|Julian_Schnabel| ,  |David_Salle|David_Salle| ,  |Francesco_Clemente|Francesco_Clemente|  and  |Enzo_Cucchi|Enzo_Cucchi| . He was represented in Los Angeles by the Gagosian gallery and throughout Europe by  |Bruno_Bischofberger|Bruno_Bischofberger| .     Major exhibitions of Basquiats work have included Jean-Michel Basquiat: Paintings 1981–1984 at the  |Fruitmarket_Gallery|Fruitmarket_Gallery| , Edinburgh , which traveled to the  |Institute_of_Contemporary_Arts|Institute_Of_Contemporary_Arts| , London, and  |Museum_Boijmans_Van_Beuningen|Museum_Boijmans_Van_Beuningen| , Rotterdam, in 1985; the two exhibits at  |Kestnergesellschaft|Kestnergesellschaft| , Hannover . The first retrospective to be held of his work was the Jean-Michel Basquiat exhibition at the  |Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art|Whitney_Museum_Of_American_Art|  from October 1992 to February 1993. It subsequently traveled to the  |Menil_Collection|Menil_Collection| , Houston; the  |Des_Moines_Art_Center|Des_Moines_Art_Center| , Iowa; and the  |Montgomery_Museum_of_Fine_Arts|Montgomery_Museum_Of_Fine_Arts| , Alabama, from 1993 to 1994.
