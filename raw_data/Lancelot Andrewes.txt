         Lancelot Andrewes  was an English bishop and scholar, who held high positions in the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England|  during the reigns of  |Elizabeth_I|Elizabeth_I_Of_England|  and  |James_I|James_I_Of_England| . During the latters reign, Andrewes served successively as  |Bishop_of_Chichester|Bishop_Of_Chichester| ,  |of_Ely|Bishop_Of_Ely| , and  |of_Winchester|Bishop_Of_Winchester|  and oversaw the translation of the  King James Version of the Bible  . In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a  |Lesser_Festival|Lesser_Festival| .         Andrewes was born in 1555 near  |All_Hallows,_Barking|All_Hallows-By-The-Tower| , by the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London| , of an ancient  |Suffolk|Suffolk|  family later domiciled at Chichester Hall, at  |Rawreth|Rawreth|  in Essex; his father, Thomas, was master of  |Trinity_House|Trinity_House| . Andrewes attended the  |Coopers_free_school|Coopers_Company_And_Coborn_School| , in  |Ratcliff|Ratcliff| , in the parish of  |Stepney|Stepney|  and then the  |Merchant_Taylors_School|Merchant_Taylors_School,_Northwood|  under  |Richard_Mulcaster|Richard_Mulcaster| . In 1571 he entered  |Pembroke_Hall|Pembroke_College,_Cambridge| ,  |Cambridge|Cambridge|  and graduated with a  |Bachelor_of_Arts|Bachelor_Of_Arts|  degree, proceeding to a  |Master_of_Arts|Master_Of_Arts|  degree in 1578.  His academic reputation spread so quickly that on the foundation in 1571 of  |Jesus_College,_Oxford|Jesus_College,_Oxford|  he was named in the charter as  |one_of_the_founding_scholars|List_Of_Founding_Fellows,_Scholars_And_Commissioners_Of_Jesus_College,_Oxford|  without his privity ; his connection with the college seems to have been purely notional, however. In 1576 he was elected fellow of  |Pembroke_College|Pembroke_College,_Cambridge| , Cambridge; on 11 June 1580 he was  |ordained|Holy_Orders|  a priest by  |William_Chaderton|William_Chaderton| ,  |Bishop_of_Chester|Bishop_Of_Chester|   and in 1581 was incorporated Master of Arts at Oxford. As catechist at his college he read lectures on the  |Decalogue|Ten_Commandments|  , which aroused great interest.     Once a year he would spend a month with his parents, and during this vacation, he would find a master from whom he would learn a language of which he had no previous knowledge. In this way, after a few years, he acquired most of the modern languages of Europe.     Andrewes was the elder brother of the scholar and cleric  |Roger_Andrewes|Roger_Andrewes| , who also served as a translator for the  |King_James_Version_of_the_Bible|King_James_Version_Of_The_Bible| .         In 1588, following a period as chaplain to  |Henry_Hastings,_3rd_Earl_of_Huntingdon|Henry_Hastings,_3Rd_Earl_Of_Huntingdon| , Lord President of the Council in the North, he became vicar of  |St_Giles,_Cripplegate|St_Giles,_Cripplegate|  in the City of London, where he delivered striking sermons on the temptation in the wilderness and the  |Lords_Prayer|Lords_Prayer| . In a great sermon  on 10 April 1588, he stoutly vindicated the  |Reformed|English_Reformation|  character of the Church of England against the claims of  |Roman_Catholicism|Roman_Catholicism|  and adduced  |John_Calvin|John_Calvin|  as a new writer, with lavish praise and affection.     Through the influence of  |Francis_Walsingham|Francis_Walsingham| , Andrewes was appointed  |prebendary|Prebendary|  of St Pancras in  |St_Pauls|St_Pauls_Cathedral| , London, in 1589, and subsequently became Master of his own college of Pembroke, as well as a chaplain to  |John_Whitgift|John_Whitgift| ,  |Archbishop_of_Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury| . From 1589 to 1609 he was prebendary of  |Southwell|Southwell_Minster| . On 4 March 1590, as a chaplain of Elizabeth I, he preached before her an outspoken sermon and, in October that year, gave his introductory lecture at St Pauls, undertaking to comment on the first four chapters of the  |Book_of_Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis| . These were later compiled as The Orphan Lectures .     Andrewes liked to move among the people, yet found time to join a society of antiquaries, of which  |Walter_Raleigh|Walter_Raleigh| ,  |Philip_Sidney|Philip_Sidney| , Burleigh, Arundel, the Herberts, Saville,  |John_Stow|John_Stow|  and  |William_Camden|William_Camden|  were members. Elizabeth I had not advanced him further on account of his opposition to the alienation of ecclesiastical revenues. In 1598 he declined the bishoprics of  |Ely|Ely,_Cambridgeshire|  and  |Salisbury|Salisbury,_England| , because of the conditions attached. On 23 November 1600, he preached at  |Whitehall|Whitehall|  a controversial sermon on  |justification|Justification| . In July 1601 he was appointed  |Dean_of_Westminster|Dean_Of_Westminster|  and gave much attention to the school there.          On the accession of  |James_I|James_I_Of_England| , to whom his somewhat pedantic style of preaching recommended him, Andrewes rose into great favour. He assisted at Jamess  |coronation|Coronation| , and in 1604 took part in the  |Hampton_Court_Conference|Hampton_Court_Conference| .     Andrewes name is the first on the list of divines appointed to compile the Authorized Version of the Bible. He headed the First Westminster Company which took charge of the first books of the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament|  . He acted, furthermore, as a sort of general editor for the project as well.     On 31 October 1605 his election as  |Bishop_of_Chichester|Bishop_Of_Chichester|  was  |confirmed|Confirmation_Of_Bishops| , he was consecrated a bishop on 3 November, installed at  |Chichester_Cathedral|Chichester_Cathedral|  on 18 November and made  |Lord_High_Almoner|Lord_High_Almoner|  .  Following the discovery of the  |Gunpowder_Plot|Gunpowder_Plot|  Andrewes was asked to prepare a sermon to be presented to the king in 1606 . In this sermon Lancelot Andrewes justified the need to commemorate the deliverance and defined the nature of celebrations. This sermon became the foundation of celebrations which continue 400 years later. In 1609 he published Tortura Torti, a learned work which grew out of the Gunpowder Plot controversy and was written in answer to  |Bellarmines|Robert_Bellarmine|  Matthaeus Tortus, which attacked James Is book on the  |oath_of_allegiance|Oath_Of_Allegiance_Of_James_I_Of_England| . After moving to Ely , he again controverted Bellarmine in the Responsio ad Apologiam.     In 1617 he accompanied James I to  |Scotland|Scotland|  with a view to persuading the Scots that Episcopacy was preferable to  |Presbyterian|Presbyterian| ism. He was made dean of the  |Chapel_Royal|Chapel_Royal|  and translated to  |Winchester|Bishop_Of_Winchester| , a  |diocese|Diocese|  that he administered with great success. Following his death in 1626 in his  |Southwark|Southwark|  palace, he was mourned alike by leaders in Church and state, and buried beside the high altar in St Saviours .               Two generations later,  |Richard_Crashaw|Richard_Crashaw|  caught up the universal sentiment, when in his lines Upon Bishop Andrewes Picture before his Sermons he exclaims:     :: This reverend shadow cast that setting sun,   :: Whose glorious course through our horizon run,   :: Left the dim face of this dull hemisphere,   :: All one great eye, all drownd in one great teare.     Andrewes was a friend of  |Hugo_Grotius|Grotius| , and one of the foremost contemporary scholars, but is chiefly remembered for his style of preaching. As a churchman he was typically  |Anglican|Anglican| , equally removed from the  |Puritan|Puritan|  and the Roman positions. A good summary of his position is found in his First Answer to Cardinal Perron, who had challenged James Is use of the title  |Catholic|Catholic|  . His position in regard to the  |Eucharist|Eucharist|  is naturally more mature than that of the first reformers.     As to the Real Presence we are agreed; our controversy is as to the mode of it. As to the mode we define nothing rashly, nor anxiously investigate, any more than in the Incarnation of Christ we ask how the human is united to the divine nature in One Person. There is a real change in the elements—we allow ut panis iam consecratus non sit panis quem natura formavit; sed, quem benedictio consecravit, et consecrando etiam immutavit. .       Adoration is permitted, and the use of the terms sacrifice and altar maintained as being consonant with scripture and antiquity. Christ is a sacrifice—so, to be slain; a propitiatory sacrifice—so, to be eaten. .     By the same rules that the Passover was, by the same may ours be termed a sacrifice. In rigour of speech, neither of them; for to speak after the exact manner of divinity, there is but one only sacrifice, veri nominis, that is Christs death. And that sacrifice but once actually performed at His death, but ever before represented in figure, from the beginning; and ever since repeated in memory to the worlds end. That only absolute, all else relative to it, representative of it, operative by it ... Hence it is that what names theirs carried, ours do the like, and the Fathers make no scruple at it—no more need we..          Andrewes preached regularly and submissively before James I and his court on the anniversaries of the  |Gowrie_Conspiracy|Gowrie_Conspiracy|  and the Gunpowder Plot. These sermons were used to promulgate the doctrine of the  |Divine_Right_of_Kings|Divine_Right_Of_Kings| .     His Life was written by  |Whyte|Alexander_Whyte|  , M. Wood , and  |Ottley|Robert_Lawrence_Ottley|  . His services to his church have been summed up thus: he has a keen sense of the proportion of the faith and maintains a clear distinction between what is fundamental, needing ecclesiastical commands, and subsidiary, needing only ecclesiastical guidance and suggestion; as distinguished from the earlier protesting standpoint, e.g. of the  |Thirty-nine_Articles|Thirty-Nine_Articles| , he emphasized a positive and constructive statement of the Anglican position.     His best-known work is the Preces Privatae or Private Prayers, edited by  |Alexander_Whyte|Alexander_Whyte|  , which has widespread appeal and has remained in print since renewed interest in Andrewes developed in the 19th century. The Preces Privatae were first published by R. Drake in 1648; an improved edition by F. E. Brightman appeared in 1903.  |John_Rutter|John_Rutter|  set some of those prayers to music. Andrewess other works occupy eight volumes in the  Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology  . Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command of  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England| , have been occasionally reprinted, and are considered among the most rhetorically developed and polished sermons of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Because of these, Andrewes has been commemorated by literary greats such as T. S. Eliot.     Andrewes was considered, next to  |Ussher|James_Ussher| , to be the most learned churchman of his day, and enjoyed a great reputation as an eloquent and impassioned preacher, but the stiffness and artificiality of his style render his sermons unsuited to modern taste. Nevertheless, there are passages of extraordinary beauty and profundity. His doctrine was  |High_Church|High_Church| , and in his life he was humble, pious, and charitable. He continues to influence religious thinkers to the present day, and was cited as an influence by  |T._S._Eliot|T._S._Eliot| , among others. Eliot also borrowed, almost word for word and without his usual acknowledgement, a passage from Andrewes 1622 Christmas Day sermon for the opening of his poem  |Journey_of_the_Magi|Journey_Of_The_Magi|  . In his 1997 novel Timequake,  |Kurt_Vonnegut|Kurt_Vonnegut|  suggested that Andrewes was the greatest writer in the English language, citing as proof the first few verses of the 23rd Psalm. His translation work has also led him to appear as a character in three plays dealing with the  |King_James_Bible|King_James_Bible| , Howard Brentons  Anne Boleyn  , Jonathan Holmes  Into Thy Hands  and David Edgars  Written on the Heart  .     He has an academic cap named after him, known as the  |Bishop_Andrewes_cap|Bishop_Andrewes_Cap| , which is like a  |mortarboard|Mortarboard|  but made of velvet, floppy and has a tump or tuff instead of a tassel. This was in fact the ancient version of the mortarboard before the top square was stiffened and the tump replaced by a tassel and button. This cap is still used by Cambridge DDs and at certain institutions as part of their  |academic_dress|Academic_Dress| .       1555––1589:  The Reverend  Lancelot Andrewes   1589–bef. 1590: The Reverend Prebendary Lancelot Andrewes   bef. 1590–1594: The Reverend Prebendary Doctor Lancelot Andrewes   1594–1601: The Reverend Canon Doctor Lancelot Andrewes   1601–1605:  The Very Reverend  Doctor Lancelot Andrewes   1605–1626:  The Right Reverend .
