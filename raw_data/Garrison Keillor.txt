        Gary Edward Garrison Keillor is an American author, storyteller,  |humorist|Humorist| , voice actor, and radio personality. He is best known as the creator of the  |Minnesota_Public_Radio|Minnesota_Public_Radio|  show  A Prairie Home Companion  , which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town  |Lake_Wobegon|Lake_Wobegon| , the setting of many of his books, including  Lake Wobegon Days and  Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories . Other creations include  |Guy_Noir|Guy_Noir| , a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in A Prairie Home Companion comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program  The Writers Almanac , which pairs one or two poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.     In November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for A Prairie Home Companion. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of A Prairie Home Companion and The Writers Almanac to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of The Writers Almanac on his website.             Keillor was born in  |Anoka,_Minnesota|Anoka,_Minnesota| , the son of Grace Ruth  and John Philip Keillor. His father was a carpenter and postal worker    who was half- |Canadian|Canadians|  with  |English|English_People|  ancestry; Keillors paternal grandfather was from  |Kingston,_Ontario|Kingston,_Ontario| .   His maternal grandparents were  |Scottish|Scottish_People|  emigrants from  |Glasgow|Glasgow| .        Keillors family belonged to the  |Plymouth_Brethren|Plymouth_Brethren| , an  |Evangelical_Christian|Evangelicalism|  movement that he has since left. In 2006, he told  Christianity Today  that he was attending the St. John the Evangelist  |Episcopal|Episcopal_Church_In_The_United_States_Of_America|  church in  |Saint_Paul,_Minnesota|Saint_Paul,_Minnesota| , after previously attending a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  church in New York.       Keillor graduated from  |Anoka_High_School|Anoka_High_School|  in 1960 and from the  |University_of_Minnesota|University_Of_Minnesota|  with a  |bachelors_degree|Bachelors_Degree|  in English in 1966.  During college, he began his broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as  |Radio_K|Radio_K| .     In his 2004 book Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America, Keillor mentions some of his noteworthy ancestors, including  |Joseph_Crandall|Joseph_Crandall| ,  who was an associate of  |Roger_Williams|Roger_Williams| , who founded  |Rhode_Island|Rhode_Island|  and the first American  |Baptist|Baptist|  church; and  |Prudence_Crandall|Prudence_Crandall| , who founded the first African-American womens school in America.          Garrison Keillor started his professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio , later  |Minnesota_Public_Radio|Minnesota_Public_Radio|  , which today distributes programs under the  |American_Public_Media|American_Public_Media|  brand. He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called A Prairie Home Entertainment, on KSJR FM at  |St._Johns_University|College_Of_Saint_Benedict/Saint_Johns_University|  in  |Collegeville|Collegeville,_Minnesota| . The shows eclectic music was a major divergence from the stations usual  |classical|Classical_Music|  fare. During this time he submitted fiction to  The New Yorker  magazine, where his first story for that publication, Local Family Keeps Son Happy, appeared in September 1970.      Keillor resigned from The Morning Program in February 1971 in protest of what he considered interference with his musical programming; as part of his protest, he played nothing but the  |Beach_Boys|Beach_Boys| |Help_Me,_Rhonda|Help_Me,_Rhonda|  during one broadcast. When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed A Prairie Home Companion.     Keillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the  |Grand_Ole_Opry|Grand_Ole_Opry|  for  The New Yorker , but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space. In August 1973, MER announced plans to broadcast a Saturday night version of  A Prairie Home Companion  with live musicians.       A Prairie Home Companion   debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974; it featured guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show is punctuated by spoof commercial spots for  |PHC_fictitious_sponsors|A_Prairie_Home_Companionsponsors|  such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors ; Garrison Keillor, pp. 35, 85. University Press of Mississippi, 1991. it presents parodic serial melodramas, such as The Adventures of Guy Noir , Private Eye and The Lives of the Cowboys. Keillor voices Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provides lead or backup vocals for some of the shows musical numbers. The show airs from the  |Fitzgerald_Theater|Fitzgerald_Theater|  in  |St._Paul|St._Paul,_Minnesota| .     After the shows intermission, Keillor reads clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivers a monologue called The News from Lake Wobegon, a fictitious town based in part on Keillors own hometown of  |Anoka,_Minnesota|Anoka,_Minnesota| , and on  |Freeport|Freeport,_Minnesota|  and other small towns in  |Stearns_County,_Minnesota|Stearns_County,_Minnesota| , where he lived in the early 1970s.   |Lake_Wobegon|Lake_Wobegon|  is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place ... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.        The original PHC ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, The American Radio Company of the Air, which had essentially the same format as PHC. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to A Prairie Home Companion; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.      On a typical broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion, Keillors name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor reads, he gives himself no billing or credit except written by  |Sarah_Bellum|Cerebellum| , a joking reference to his own brain.     Keillor regularly takes the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically features local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the citys Queens Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary.  Keillor has produced broadcast performances similar to PHC but without the Prairie Home Companion brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival.  He was also the host of  The Writers Almanac , from 1993 to 2017, which, like PHC, was produced and distributed by American Public Media.      In a March 2011 interview, Keillor announced that he would be retiring from A Prairie Home Companion in 2013;  but in a December 2011 interview with the Sioux City Journal, Keillor said: The show is going well. I love doing it. Why quit?  During an interview on July 20, 2015, Keillor announced his intent to retire from the show after the 2015â€“2016 season, saying, I have a lot of other things that I want to do. I mean, nobody retires anymore. Writers never retire. But this is my last season. This tour this summer is the farewell tour.      Keillors final episode of the show was recorded live for an audience of 18,000 fans at the  |Hollywood_Bowl|Hollywood_Bowl|  in California on July 1, 2016,  and broadcast the next day, ending 42 seasons of the show.  After the performance, President  |Barack_Obama|Barack_Obama|  phoned Keillor to congratulate him.  The show continued on October 15, 2016, with  |Chris_Thile|Chris_Thile|  as its host.       At age thirteen, Keillor adopted the pen name Garrison to distinguish his personal life from his professional writing.  He commonly uses Garrison in public and in other media.      Keillor has been called e of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life by  |Randall_Balmer|Randall_Balmer|  in Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism. Randall Balmer: Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism. Revised and expanded edition 2004, Baylor University Press. He has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well as children. In addition to writing for  The New Yorker , he has written for  The Atlantic Monthly  and  National Geographic .  He has also written for  |Salon.com|Salon.Com|  and authored an  |advice_column|Agony_Aunt|  there under the name Mr. Blue. Following a heart operation, he resigned on September 4, 2001, his last column being titled Every dog has his day :           In 2004 Keillor published a collection of political essays, Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America, and in June 2005 he began a column called The Old Scout,  which ran at Salon.com and in  |syndicated|Print_Syndication|  newspapers. The column went on hiatus in April 2010 so that he ... finish a screenplay and start writing a novel.     Keillor wrote the screenplay for the 2006 movie  A Prairie Home Companion , directed by  |Robert_Altman|Robert_Altman| . He also appears in the movie.            On November 1, 2006, Keillor opened an  |independent_bookstore|Independent_Bookstore| , Common Good Books, G. Keillor, Prop. in the  |Blair_Arcade_Building|Blair_Flats|  at the southwest corner of Selby and N. Western Avenues in the Cathedral Hill area in the  |Summit-University|Summit-University|  neighborhood of  |Saint_Paul,_Minnesota|Saint_Paul,_Minnesota| .  Upon opening the bookstore, Keillor wrote this poem:           In April 2012, the store moved to a new location on Snelling Avenue across from  |Macalester_College|Macalester_College|  in the  |Macalester-Groveland_neighborhood|Neighborhoods_In_Saint_Paul,_Minnesotadistrict_14_-_Macalester-Groveland| .        Probably owing in part to his distinctive  |North-Central|North-Central_American_English|  accent, Keillor is often used as a  |voice-over|Voice-Over|  actor. Some notable appearances include:   Voiceover artist for Honda UKs the Power of Dreams campaign. The campaigns most memorable advertisement is the 2003  |Honda_Accord|Honda_Accord|  commercial  Cog , which features a  |Heath_Robinson|W._Heath_Robinson|  contraption  made entirely of car parts. The commercial ends with Keillor asking, Isnt it nice when things just work?   Since then, Keillor has voiced the tagline for most if not all UK Honda advertisements, and even sang the voiceover in the 2004 Honda Diesel commercial  Grrr .  His most recent ad was a reworking of an existing commercial with digitally added England flags to tie in with the  |World_Cup|2006_Fifa_World_Cup| . Keillors tagline was Come on, England, keep the dream alive.   Voice of the Norse god  |Odin|Odin|  in an episode of the Disney animated series  Hercules   |Walt_Whitman|Walt_Whitman|  and other historical figures in  |Ken_Burnss|Ken_Burns|  documentary series  The Civil War  and  Baseball   Narrator of River of Dreams Documentary at the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa   In 1991, Keillor released  |Songs_of_the_Cat|Songs_Of_The_Cat| , an album of original and parody songs about cats.       In  |Slate|Slate.Com| , Sam Anderson called Keillor very clearly a genius. His range and stamina alone are incredibleâ€”after 30 years, he rarely repeats himselfâ€”and he has the genuine wisdom of a Cosby or Mark Twain . But Keillors willful simplicity, Anderson wrote, is annoying because, after a while, it starts to feel prescriptive. Being a responsible adult doesnt necessarily mean speaking slowly about tomatoes. Anderson also noted that in 1985, when  |Time|Time|  magazine called Keillor the funniest man in America, Bill Cosby said, Thats true if youre a pilgrim.       Keillors style, particularly his speaking voice, has often been parodied .    |The_Simpsons|The_Simpsons|  parodied him in an episode in which the family is shown watching a Keillor-like monologist on television; they are perplexed at why the studio audience is laughing so much, prompting Homer to ask What the hells so funny? and Bart to suggest Maybe its the TV. Homer then hits the set, exclaiming: Stupid TV! Be more funny!   On the November 19, 2011, episode of  |Saturday_Night_Live|Saturday_Night_Live| , cast member Bill Hader impersonated Keillor in a sketch depicting celebrities auditioning to replace Regis Philbin as co-host of  |Live!_with_Kelly|Live!_With_Kelly| .   One Boston radio critic likens Keillor and his down-comforter voice to a hypnotist intoning, You are getting sleepy now, while noting that Keillor does play to listeners intelligence.   Pennsylvanian singer-songwriter Tom Flannery wrote a song in 2003 titled I Want a Job Like Garrison Keillors.   Two parody books by Harrison Geillor : The Zombies of Lake Woebegotten and The Twilight of Lake Woebegotten, were published by Night Shade Books in 2010 and 2011.       thu   Keillor is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party . He is tall. He considers himself a loner and prefers not to make eye contact with people. Though not diagnosed, he also considers himself to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum . He spoke about his experiences as an autistic person in his keynote address at the 19th Annual Minnesota Autism Conference in 2014.     Keillor has been married three times. He was married to Mary Guntzel from 1965 to 1976; they had one son, Jason . He was married to Ulla Skaerved, a former exchange student from Denmark at Keillors high school whom he re-encountered at a class reunion, from 1985 to 1990. He married classical string player Jenny Lind Nilsson , who is also from Anoka , in 1995. They have one daughter, Maia Grace Keillor .     Between his first and second marriages, Keillor was romantically involved with Margaret Moos, who worked as a producer of A Prairie Home Companion.     On September 7, 2009, Keillor was briefly hospitalized after suffering a minor stroke . He returned to work a few days later.       In 2006, after a visit to a United Methodist church in Highland Park, Texas , Keillor created a local controversy with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes church and that it would be better if I didnt talk about politics. In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two burly security men were a local policeman and the churchs own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillors publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said that Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, so he did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke. Supposedly, before Keillors remarks, participants at the event had considered the visit to have been cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying that he did not have security guards at other stops on the tour.     In 2007, Keillor wrote a column that in part criticized stereotypical gay parents, who he said were sardonic fellows with fussy hair who live in over-decorated apartments with a striped sofa and a small weird dog and who worship campy performers. In response to the strong reactions of many readers, Keillor said:         In 2008, Keillor created a controversy in St. Paul when he filed a lawsuit against his neighbors plan to build an addition on her home, citing his need for light and air and a view of open space and beyond . Keillors home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and it would still be significantly larger than his neighbors with its planned addition. Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with his neighbor shortly after the story became public.     In 2009, one of Keillors Old Scout columns contained a reference to lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys and a complaint about Silent Night as rewritten by Unitarian s, upsetting some readers. A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, Listening to him talk about us over the years, its becoming more and more evident that he isnt laughing with us â€” hes laughing at us , while Jeff Jacoby of the  |Boston_Globe|Boston_Globe|  called Keillor cranky and intolerant .       On November 29, 2017, the  |Star_Tribune|Star_Tribune|  reported that Minnesota Public Radio was terminating all business relationships with Keillor as a result of allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him. In January 2018, MPR CEO Jon McTaggart elaborated that they had received allegations of dozens of sexually inappropriate incidents from the individual, including requests for sexual contact. Keillor has denied any wrongdoing and said his firing stems from an incident when he touched a womans bare back while trying to console her. He stated he apologized to her soon after, that they had already made up, and that he was surprised to hear the allegations when her lawyer called.     In its statement of termination, MPR announced that Keillor would keep his executive credit for the show, but that since he owns the trademark for the phrase prairie home companion , they would cease rebroadcasting episodes of A Prairie Home Companion featuring Keillor and remove the trademarked phrase from the radio show hosted by Chris Thile . MPR also eliminated its business connections to PrairieHome.org and stopped distributing Keillors daily program  |The_Writers_Almanac|The_Writers_Almanac| .  |The_Washington_Post|The_Washington_Post|  also canceled Keillors weekly column when they learned he had continued writing columns, including a controversial piece criticizing Al Franken s resignation because of sexual misconduct allegations, without revealing that he was under investigation at MPR. Several fans wrote MPR to protest his firing, and within the month, 153 members had canceled their memberships because of it. In January 2018, Keillor announced he was in mediation with MPR over the firing. On January 23, 2018, MPR News reported further on the investigation after interviewing almost 60 people who had worked with Keillor. The story described other alleged sexual misconduct by Keillor, and a $16,000 severance check for a woman who was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to prevent her from talking about her time at MPR .         Keillor received a letter from the MPR CEO, Jon McTaggart, dated April 5, 2018, confirming that both sides wanted archives of A Prairie Home Companion and The Writers Almanac to be publicly available again. In April 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement under which MPR would restore the online archives.
