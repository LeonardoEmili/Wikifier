     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the factorial of a positive  |integer|Integer|  , denoted by , is the  |product|Product|  of all positive integers less than or equal to  |empty_product|Empty_Product| .     The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in  |combinatorics|Combinatorics| ,  |algebra|Algebra| , and  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| . Its most basic use counts the possible distinct  |sequences|Sequence|  – the  |permutations|Permutations|  – of  distinct objects: there are .     The factorial  |function|Function|  can also be  |extended_to_non-integer_arguments|Factorialfactorial_Of_Non-Integer_Values|  while retaining its most important properties. This involves using  |gamma_function|Gamma_Function|  to define . However, this extension does not work when  is a negative integer.          Factorials were used to count permutations at least as early as the 12th century, by Indian scholars.  In 1677,  |Fabian_Stedman|Fabian_Stedman|  described factorials as applied to  |change_ringing|Change_Ringing| , a musical art involving the ringing of many tuned bells. After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial :      The  |notation|Mathematical_Notation|   was introduced by the French mathematician  |Christian_Kramp|Christian_Kramp|  in 1808.        The factorial function is defined by the product     : n! 1   2   3       n,     for integer . This may be written in  |pi_product_notation|Multiplicationcapital_Pi_Notation|  as     : n!   i.     From these formulas, one may derive the  |recurrence_relation|Recurrence_Relation|      : n! n   ! .     For example, one has   :     5! & 5   4!     6! & 6   5!     50! & 50   49!       and so on.       The factorial of  is , or in symbols, .     There are several motivations for this definition:   For , the definition of  as a product involves the product of no numbers at all, and so is an example of the broader convention that the product of no factors is equal to the multiplicative identity .   There is exactly one permutation of zero objects .   It makes many identities in  |combinatorics|Combinatorics|  valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the  |empty_set|Empty_Set|  is given by the  |binomial_coefficient|Binomial_Coefficient|    ::     1.   : More generally, the number of ways to choose all  elements among a set of  is   ::     1.   It allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function| , as a power series:   :: ex       It extends the recurrence relation to 0.       Although the factorial function has its roots in  |combinatorics|Combinatorics| , formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.   There are  different ways of arranging  distinct objects into a sequence, the  |permutations|Permutation|  of those objects.     Often factorials appear in the  |denominator|Denominator|  of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting - |combinations|Combination|   from a set with  elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a -permutation: successively selecting and removing one element of the set,  times, for a total of   ::     n   :possibilities. This, however, produces the -combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each -combination is obtained in  different ways, the correct number of -combinations is   ::         .   :This number is known  as the  |binomial_coefficient|Binomial_Coefficient| , because it is also the coefficient of  in . The term n is often called a  |falling_factorial|Falling_And_Rising_Factorials|  .   Factorials occur in  |algebra|Algebra|  for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the  |binomial_formula|Binomial_Formula| , or through  |averaging|Averaging|  over  |permutations|Permutations|  for  |symmetrization|Symmetrization|  of certain operations.   Factorials also turn up in  |calculus|Calculus| ; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of  |Taylors_formula|Taylors_Formula| ,  where they are used as compensation terms due to the th  |derivative|Derivative|  of  being equivalent to .   Factorials are also used extensively in  |probability_theory|Probability_Theory|   and  |number_theory|Number_Theory|  .   Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of -permutations of  can be written as   :: n    :while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property of binomial coefficients:   ::   nk      n    The factorial function can be shown, using the  |power_rule|Power_Rule| , to be   :: n! Dn      :where  is  |Eulers_notation|Notation_For_Differentiationeuler.27S_Notation|  for the th  |derivative|Derivative|  of .         As  grows, the factorial  increases faster than all  |polynomials|Polynomial|  and  |exponential_functions|Exponential_Growth|   in .     Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm|    :   n!     x       The graph of the function  is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately  |linear|Linear_Function|  for all reasonable values of , but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for  by bounding the sum with an  |integral|Integral|  from above and below as follows:     :     x   dx       x         dx     which gives us the estimate     : n      n!     + 1       Hence  . This result plays a key role in the analysis of the  |computational_complexity|Computational_Complexity_Theory|  of  |sorting_algorithms|Sorting_Algorithm|  . From the bounds on  deduced above we get that     :   e   n!     e       It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all  we have  .
