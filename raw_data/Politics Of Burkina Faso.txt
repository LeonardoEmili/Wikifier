           The Politics of Burkina Faso takes place in a framework of a  |semi-presidential|Semi-Presidential_System| |republic|Republic| , whereby the  |Prime_Minister_of_Burkina_Faso|Prime_Minister_Of_Burkina_Faso|  is the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and of a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| . The  |President_of_Burkina_Faso|President_Of_Burkina_Faso|  is the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| .  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by both the President and the Government.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the  |government|Forms_Of_Government|  and parliament. The party system was dominated by the  |Congress_for_Democracy_and_Progress|Congress_For_Democracy_And_Progress|  until the  |2014_Burkinabé_uprising|2014_Burkinabé_Uprising| . Since then, the CDP has lost influence. The  |Judiciary|Judiciary|  is independent of the executive and the legislature.           In 1990, the  |Popular_Front|Popular_Front|  held its first National Congress, which formed a committee to draft a national constitution. The constitution was approved by referendum in 1991. In 1992,  |Blaise_Compaoré|Blaise_Compaoré|  was elected president, running unopposed after the opposition boycotted the election because of Compaorés refusal to accede to demands of the opposition such as a Sovereign National Conference to set modalities. The opposition did participate in the following years legislative elections, in which the  |ODP/MT|Odp/Mt|  won a majority of the seats contested for.     The government of the Fourth Republic includes a strong presidency, a prime minister, a Council of Ministers presided over by the president, a National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legislature and judiciary are independent but remain susceptible to outside influence.     In 1995, Burkina held its first multiparty municipal elections since it gained independence. The presidents ODP/MT won over 1,100 of some 1,700 councilor seats being contested.     In February 1996, the ruling ODP/MT merged with several small opposition parties to form the  |Congress_for_Democracy_and_Progress|Congress_For_Democracy_And_Progress|  . This effectively co-opted much of what little viable opposition to Compaoré existed. The remaining opposition parties regrouped in preparation for 1997 legislative elections and the 1998 presidential election. The 1997 legislative elections, which international observers pronounced to be substantially free, fair, and transparent, resulted in a large CDP majority—101 to 111 seats.             |President|List_Of_Heads_Of_State_Of_Burkina_Faso| |Roch_Marc_Christian_Kaboré|Roch_Marc_Christian_Kaboré| |Peoples_Movement_for_Progress|Peoples_Movement_For_Progress| |Prime_Minister|List_Of_Heads_Of_Government_Of_Burkina_Faso| |Christophe_Joseph_Marie_Dabiré|Christophe_Joseph_Marie_Dabiré| |Peoples_Movement_for_Progress|Peoples_Movement_For_Progress|  Assemblée NationaleCGTBHBDHPCNTBONSL |rkina_Fa|Rkina_Fa| |rkina_Fa|Rkina_Fa| |rkina_Fa|Rkina_Fa| |rkina_Fa|Rkina_Fa| |ovin|Ovin| |ovin|Ovin| |mé_Conventi|Mé_Conventi| |ganizati|Ganizati| regional .
