              In  |cell_biology|Cell_Biology| , the nucleus  is a  |membrane-bound|Biological_Membranefunction| |organelle|Organelle|  found in  |eukaryotic|Eukaryote| |cells|Cell| . Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell| , have  |no_nuclei|Anucleatedcells| , and a few others including  |osteoclasts|Osteoclast|  have  |many|Multinucleate| .     The cell nucleus contains all of the cells  |genome|Genome| , except for a small fraction of  |mitochondrial_DNA|Mitochondrial_Dna| , organized as multiple long linear  |DNA|Dna|  molecules in a  |complex|Protein_Complex|  with a large variety of  |proteins|Protein| , such as  |histones|Histone| , to form  |chromosomes|Chromosome| . The  |genes|Gene|  within these chromosomes are  |structured|Nuclear_Organization|  in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating  |gene_expression|Gene_Expression| —the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the  |nuclear_envelope|Nuclear_Envelope| , a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular  |cytoplasm|Cytoplasm| , and the  |nuclear_matrix|Nuclear_Matrix|  , a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the  |cytoskeleton|Cytoskeleton| , which supports the cell as a whole.     Because the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules,  |nuclear_pores|Nuclear_Pore|  are required to regulate  |nuclear_transport|Nuclear_Transport|  of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a  |channel|Ion_Channel|  through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and  |ions|Ion| . Movement of large molecules such as proteins and  |RNA|Rna|  through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of  |nuclear_bodies|Nuclear_Bodies|  exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the  |nucleolus|Nucleolus| , which is mainly involved in the assembly of  |ribosomes|Ribosome| . After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate  |mRNA|Mrna| .             The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist  |Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek|Antonie_Van_Leeuwenhoek|  . He observed a lumen , the nucleus, in the  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell|  of  |salmon|Salmon| . Leeuwenhoek, A. van: Opera Omnia, seu Arcana Naturae ope exactissimorum Microscopiorum detecta, experimentis variis comprobata, Epistolis ad varios illustres viros. J. Arnold et Delphis, A. Beman, Lugdinum Batavorum 1719–1730. Cited after: Dieter Gerlach, Geschichte der Mikroskopie.  |Verlag_Harri_Deutsch|Verlag_Harri_Deutsch| , Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 2009. . Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.     The nucleus was also described by  |Franz_Bauer|Franz_Bauer|  in 1804  and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish  |botanist|Botanist| |Robert_Brown|Robert_Brown|  in a talk at the  |Linnean_Society_of_London|Linnean_Society_Of_London| . Brown was studying  |orchids|Orchid|  under the microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus , in the cells of the flowers outer layer.      He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838,  |Matthias_Schleiden|Matthias_Schleiden|  proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name cytoblast . He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around cytoblasts .  |Franz_Meyen|Franz_Meyen|  was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the cytoblast or otherwise, contradicted work by  |Robert_Remak|Robert_Remak|  and  |Rudolf_Virchow|Rudolf_Virchow|  who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells . The function of the nucleus remained unclear.  Online Version      Between 1877 and 1878,  |Oscar_Hertwig|Oscar_Hertwig|  published several studies on the  |fertilization|Fertilization|  of  |sea_urchin|Sea_Urchin|  eggs, showing that the nucleus of the  |sperm|Sperm|  enters the  |oocyte|Oocyte|  and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to  |Ernst_Haeckels|Ernst_Haeckel|  theory that the complete  |phylogeny|Phylogeny|  of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a monerula , a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm . Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including  |amphibians|Amphibians|  and  |molluscs|Molluscs| .  |Eduard_Strasburger|Eduard_Strasburger|  produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873,  |August_Weismann|August_Weismann|  postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after  |mitosis|Mitosis|  was discovered and the  |Mendelian_rules|Mendelian_Inheritance|  were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the  |chromosome_theory_of_heredity|Chromosome_Theory_Of_Heredity|  was therefore developed.       The nucleus is the largest  |organelle|Organelle|  in animal cells.    In  |mammal|Mammal| ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6  |micrometres|Micrometre|  , which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.  The contents of the   nucleus are held in the  |nucleoplasm|Nucleoplasm|  similar to the  |cytoplasm|Cytoplasm|  in the rest of the cell. The fluid component of this is termed the nucleosol, similar to the  |cytosol|Cytosol|  in the cytoplasm.       In most types of  |granulocyte|Granulocyte| , a  |white_blood_cell|White_Blood_Cell| , the nucleus is  |lobated|Lobation|  and can be bi-lobed, tri-lobed or multi-lobed.                 The  |nuclear_envelope|Nuclear_Envelope| , otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two  |cellular_membranes|Cell_Membrane| , an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50  |nanometres|Nanometre|  . The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cells genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent  |macromolecules|Macromolecule|  from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.  The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the  |rough_endoplasmic_reticulum|Rough_Endoplasmic_Reticulum|  , and is similarly studded with  |ribosomes|Ribosomes| . The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER  |lumen|Lumen| .      |Nuclear_pores|Nuclear_Pores| , which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as  |nucleoporins|Nucleoporin| . The pores are about 125 million  |daltons|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  in  |molecular_weight|Molecular_Weight|  and consist of around 50  to several hundred proteins . The pores are 100  nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9  nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as  |nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid|  and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope,  each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse.  Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.     Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some DNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as  |karyopherins|Karyopherin| . Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use  |adaptor_proteins|Signal_Transducing_Adaptor_Protein| .   |Steroid_hormones|Steroid_Hormone|  such as  |cortisol|Cortisol|  and  |aldosterone|Aldosterone| , as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular  |signaling|Cell_Signaling| , can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind  |nuclear_receptor|Nuclear_Receptor|  proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as  |transcription_factors|Transcription_Factor|  when bound to their  |ligand|Ligand| ; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as  |histone_deacetylases|Histone_Deacetylase|  that repress gene expression.          In animal cells, two networks of  |intermediate_filaments|Intermediate_Filaments|  provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The  |nuclear_lamina|Nuclear_Lamina|  forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.      The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of  |lamin|Lamin|  proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina.   Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as  |emerin|Emerin|  and  |nesprin|Nesprin| , bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil,  that is visible using  |fluorescence_microscopy|Fluorescence_Microscopy| . The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the  |nucleolus|Nucleolus|  and is present during  |interphase|Interphase| .  Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as  |LEM3|Lem_Domain-Containing_Protein_3| , bind  |chromatin|Chromatin|  and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.      Like the components of other  |intermediate_filaments|Intermediate_Filament| , the lamin  |monomer|Monomer|  contains an  |alpha-helical|Alpha-Helix|  domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a  |dimer|Protein_Dimer|  structure called a  |coiled_coil|Coiled_Coil| . Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an  |antiparallel|Antiparallel|  arrangement, to form a  |tetramer|Tetramer_Protein|  called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.     Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as  laminopathies . The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as  |progeria|Progeria| , which causes the appearance of premature  |aging|Aging|  in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated  |biochemical|Biochemistry|  changes give rise to the aged  |phenotype|Phenotype|  is not well understood.                     The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cells genetic material in the form of multiple linear  |DNA|Dna|  molecules organized into structures called  |chromosomes|Chromosome| . Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the  |cell_cycle|Cell_Cycle|  these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as  |chromatin|Chromatin| , and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined  |chromosomes|Chromosome|  familiar from a  |karyotype|Karyotype| . A small fraction of the cells genes are located instead in the  |mitochondria|Mitochondria| .     There are two types of chromatin.  |Euchromatin|Euchromatin|  is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently  |expressed|Gene_Expression|  by the cell.  The other type,  |heterochromatin|Heterochromatin| , is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into  |facultative_heterochromatin|Facultative_Heterochromatinfacultative_Heterochromatin| , consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and  |constitutive_heterochromatin|Constitutive_Heterochromatin|  that consists of chromosome structural components such as  |telomeres|Telomere|  and  |centromeres|Centromere| .  During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches,  called chromosome territories.  Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosomes territory boundary.      Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular,  |nucleosomes|Nucleosome| , have been associated with a number of  |autoimmune_diseases|Autoimmune_Disease| , such as  |systemic_lupus_erythematosus|Systemic_Lupus_Erythematosus| .  These are known as  |anti-nuclear_antibodies|Anti-Nuclear_Antibody|  and have also been observed in concert with  |multiple_sclerosis|Multiple_Sclerosis|  as part of general immune system dysfunction.  As in the case of  |progeria|Progeria| , the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.                         The  |nucleolus|Nucleolus|  is the largest of the discrete densely stained, membraneless structures known as  |nuclear_bodies|Nuclear_Bodies|  found in the nucleus. It forms around  |tandem_repeats|Tandem_Repeat|  of  |rDNA|Ribosomal_Dna| , DNA coding for  |ribosomal_RNA|Ribosomal_Rna|  . These regions are called  |nucleolar_organizer_regions|Nucleolar_Organizer_Regions|  . The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and  |assemble_ribosomes|Nucleolusfunction_And_Ribosome_Assembly| . The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.      In the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called  |RNA_polymerase_I|Rna_Polymerase_I|  transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits  |5.8S|5.8S_Ribosomal_Rna| ,  |18S|18S_Ribosomal_Rna| , and  |28S|28S_Ribosomal_Rna|  rRNA.  The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by  |small_nucleolar_RNA|Small_Nucleolar_Rna|  molecules, some of which are derived from spliced  |introns|Intron|  from  |messenger_RNAs|Messenger_Rna|  encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the  |nuclear_pores|Nuclear_Pore| .     When observed under the  |electron_microscope|Electron_Microscope| , the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers , surrounded by the dense fibrillar component , which in turn is bordered by the granular component . Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.          Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other nuclear bodies. These include  |Cajal_bodies|Cajal_Body| , gemini of Cajal bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association , promyelocytic leukaemia bodies,  |paraspeckles|Paraspeckle| , and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.     Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of  |nemaline_myopathy|Nemaline_Myopathy| . This condition typically results from mutations in  |actin|Actin| , and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.        A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called  |Cajal_bodies|Cajal_Body|  or coiled bodies , whose diameter measures between 0.2  µm and 2.0  µm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an  |electron_microscope|Electron_Microscope| , they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein  |coilin|Coilin| .  CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically  |small_nucleolar_RNA|Snorna|  and  |small_nuclear_RNA|Small_Nuclear_Rna|  maturation, and histone mRNA modification.     Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the  |Gemini_constellation|Gemini|  in reference to their close twin relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain  |small_nuclear_ribonucleoproteins|Snrnp|  , but do contain a protein called  |survival_of_motor_neuron|Survival_Of_Motor_Neuron_Protein|  whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis,  though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the  |coilin|Coilin|  component; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive, and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative.        PIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing.  They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the  |transcription_factor|Transcription_Factor|  PTF, which promotes transcription of  |small_nuclear_RNA|Small_Nuclear_Rna|  .         |Promyelocytic_leukemia_bodies|Promyelocytic_Leukemia_Protein|  are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0  µm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 , Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains.  PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the  |promyelocytic_leukemia_protein|Promyelocytic_Leukemia_Protein|  . They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. Pml-/- mice, which are unable to create PML bodies, develop normally without obvious ill effects, showing that PML bodies are not required for most essential biological processes.
