           Imperial Conferences  were periodic gatherings of government leaders from the self-governing colonies and dominions of the  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  between 1887 and 1937, before the establishment of regular  |Meetings_of_Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers|Meeting_Of_Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers|  in  |1944|1944_Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers_Conference| . They were held in  |1887|First_Colonial_Conference| ,  |1894|1894_Colonial_Conference| ,  |1897|1897_Colonial_Conference| ,  |1902|1902_Colonial_Conference| ,  |1907|1907_Imperial_Conference| ,  |1911|1911_Imperial_Conference| ,  |1921|1921_Imperial_Conference| ,  |1923|1923_Imperial_Conference| ,  |1926|1926_Imperial_Conference| ,  |1930|1930_Imperial_Conference| ,  |1932|British_Empire_Economic_Conference|  and  |1937|1937_Imperial_Conference| .     All the conferences were held in London, the seat of the Empire, except for the 1894 and 1932 conferences which were held in  |Ottawa|Ottawa| , the capital of the senior  |Dominion|Dominion|  of the Crown. The 1907 conference changed the name of the meetings to Imperial Conferences and agreed that the meetings should henceforth be regular rather than taking place while overseas statesmen were visiting London for royal occasions .              Originally instituted to emphasise imperial unity, as time went on, the conferences became a key forum for dominion governments to assert the desire for removing the remaining vestiges of their colonial status.  The conference of 1926 agreed to the  |Balfour_Declaration|Balfour_Declaration_1926| , which acknowledged that the dominions would henceforth rank as equals to the United Kingdom, as members of the  |British_Commonwealth_of_Nations|British_Commonwealth_Of_Nations| .     The conference of 1930 decided to abolish the legislative supremacy of the  |British_Parliament|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  as it was expressed through the  |Colonial_Laws_Validity_Act|Colonial_Laws_Validity_Act|  and other  |Imperial_Acts|Imperial_Acts| . The statesmen recommended that a declaratory enactment of Parliament, which became the  |Statute_of_Westminster_1931|Statute_Of_Westminster_1931| , be passed with the consent of the dominions, but some dominions did not ratify the statute until some years afterwards. The 1930 conference was notable, too, for the attendance of  |Southern_Rhodesia|Southern_Rhodesia| , despite it being a self-governing colony, not a dominion.        As  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  drew to a close, Imperial Conferences were replaced by  |Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers_Conferences|Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers_Conference| , with 17 such meetings occurring from 1944 until 1969, all but one of the meetings occurred in London. The gatherings were renamed  |Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting|Commonwealth_Heads_Of_Government_Meeting| .
