         The concept of  |Germany|Germany|  as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| , who referred to the unconquered area east of the  |Rhine|Rhine|  as  Germania , thus distinguishing it from  |Gaul|Gaul|  , which he had conquered. The victory of the  |Germanic_tribes|Cherusci|  in the  |Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest|Battle_Of_The_Teutoburg_Forest|   prevented annexation by the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , although the  |Roman_provinces|Roman_Provinces|  of  |Germania_Superior|Germania_Superior|  and  |Germania_Inferior|Germania_Inferior|  were established along the  |Rhine|Rhine| . Following the  |Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire|Fall_Of_The_Western_Roman_Empire| , the  |Franks|Franks|  conquered the other  |West|West_Germanic_Languages| |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples| . When the  |Frankish_Empire|Francia|  was divided among  |Charles_the_Greats|Charles_The_Great|  heirs in 843, the eastern part became  |East_Francia|East_Francia| . In 962,  |Otto_I|Otto_I|  became the first  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , the medieval German state.     In the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| , the regional dukes, princes, and bishops gained power at the expense of the emperors.  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  led the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  against the Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern states remained Catholic. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War|  , which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians living in both parts. The Thirty Years War brought tremendous destruction to Germany; more than 1/4 of the population and 1/2 of the male population in the German states were killed by the catastrophic war. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous independent states, such as  |Prussia|Prussia| ,  |Bavaria|Bavaria| ,  |Saxony|Saxony| ,  |Austria|Austria|  and other states, which also controlled land outside of the area considered Germany .     After the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  and the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars|  from 1803–1815, feudalism fell away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The German revolutions of 1848–49 failed. The  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  modernized the German economy, led to the rapid growth of cities and the emergence of the  |socialist_movement|History_Of_Socialism|  in Germany. Prussia, with its capital  |Berlin|Berlin| , grew in power. German universities became world-class centers for science and humanities, while music and art flourished. The  |unification_of_Germany|Unification_Of_Germany|  was achieved under the leadership of the Chancellor  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  with the formation of the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  in 1871. This resulted in the  Kleindeutsche Lösung , , rather than the Großdeutsche Lösung, . The new  Reichstag , an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in  |colonial_expansion_in_Africa_and_the_Pacific|German_Colonial_Empire| .     By 1900, Germany was the dominant power on the European continent and its rapidly expanding industry had surpassed Britains while provoking it in  |a_naval_arms_race|Anglo-German_Naval_Arms_Race| . Germany led the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  in  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  against France, Great Britain, Russia and the United States. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced to pay  |war_reparations|War_Reparations|  by the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  and was stripped of its colonies as well as of home territory to be ceded to Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France, and Poland. The  |German_Revolution_of_1918–19|German_Revolution_Of_1918–19|  put an end to the  |federal|Federal_Monarchy| |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , which resulted in the establishment of the  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| , an unstable parliamentary democracy.     In the early 1930s, the worldwide  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  hit Germany hard, as unemployment soared and people lost confidence in the government. In January 1933,  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  was appointed  |Chancellor_of_Germany|Chancellor_Of_Germany| . His  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party|  quickly established a  |totalitarian|Totalitarian|  regime, and  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met.  |Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland|Remilitarization_Of_The_Rhineland|  came in 1936, then annexation of Austria in the  Anschluss  and parts of Czechoslovakia with the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement|  in 1938, and  |further_territory_of_Czechoslovakia|German_Occupation_Of_Czechoslovakia|  in 1939. On 1 September 1939, Germany initiated  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in Europe with the  |invasion_of_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland| . After forming a  |pact_with_the_Soviet_Union|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|  in 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe. After a  |Phoney_War|Phoney_War|  in spring 1940, the Germans swept Denmark and Norway, the Low Countries, and France, giving Germany control of nearly all of Western Europe. Hitler  |invaded_the_Soviet_Union|Operation_Barbarossa|  in June 1941.     Racism, especially  |antisemitism|Antisemitism| , was a central feature of the Nazi regime. In Germany, but predominantly in the  |German-occupied_areas|German-Occupied_Europe| , the systematic  |genocide|Genocide|  program known as  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust|  killed 11 million, including Jews, German dissidents, disabled people, Poles, Romanies, Soviets , and others. In 1942, the German invasion of the Soviet Union faltered, and after the  |United_States_entered_the_war|Military_History_Of_The_United_States_During_World_War_Ii| , Britain became the base for massive  |Anglo-American_bombings|Strategic_Bombing_During_World_War_Ii|  of German cities. Following the Allied  |invasion_of_Normandy|Invasion_Of_Normandy|  , the German Army was pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.     Under  |occupation_by_the_Allies|Allied-Occupied_Germany| , German territories were split up, Austria was again made a separate country,  |denazification|Denazification|  took place, and the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  resulted in the division of the country into democratic  |West_Germany|Germany|  and communist  |East_Germany|East_Germany| , reduced in territory by the establishment of the  |Oder-Neisse_line|Oder-Neisse_Line| . Millions of ethnic Germans were deported from  |pre-war_Eastern_Germany|Former_Eastern_Territories_Of_Germany| ,  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland| , and from  |all_over_Eastern_Europe|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans| , or fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid  |economic_expansion|Wirtschaftswunder| , and became the dominant economy in Western Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of  |NATO|Nato|  but without access to nuclear weapons. The  |Franco-German_friendship|France–Germany_Relations|  became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the  |European_Union|European_Union| . In 1989, the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall|  was destroyed, the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  collapsed, and East Germany was  |reunited_with_West_Germany|Reunification_Of_Germany|  in 1990. In 1998–1999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the  |eurozone|Eurozone| . Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about one-quarter of the eurozones annual  |gross_domestic_product|Gross_Domestic_Product| . In the early 2010s, Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating euro crisis, especially concerning Greece and other  |Southern_European|Southern_European|  nations. In the middle of the decade, the country faced the  |European_migrant_crisis|European_Migrant_Crisis|  as the main receiver of asylum seekers from  |Syria|Syria|  and other troubled regions.     For more events, see Timeline of German history .             The discovery of the  |Homo_heidelbergensis|Mauer_1|  mandible in 1907 affirms archaic human presence in Germany by at least 600,000 years ago. The oldest complete set of hunting weapons ever found anywhere in the world was excavated from a coal mine in  |Schöningen|Schöningen| ,  |Lower_Saxony|Lower_Saxony| . Between 1994 and 1998,  |eight_380,000-year-old_wooden_javelins|Schöningen_Spears|  between  in length were eventually unearthed.      In 1856 the fossilized bones of an extinct human species were salvaged from a limestone grotto in the  |Neander|Neander|  valley near  |Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf| ,  |North_Rhine-Westphalia|North_Rhine-Westphalia| . The archaic nature of the fossils, now known to be around 40,000 years old, was recognized and the characteristics published in the first-ever  |paleoanthropologic|Paleoanthropology| |species_description|Species_Description|  in 1858 by  |Hermann_Schaaffhausen|Hermann_Schaaffhausen| .  The species was named Homo neanderthalensis –  |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  man in 1864.     The remains of  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic| |early_modern_human|Homo_Sapiens|  occupation uncovered and documented in several caves in the  |Swabian_Jura|Swabian_Jura|  include various mammoth ivory sculptures that rank among the oldest uncontested works of art and several flutes, made of bird bone and mammoth ivory that are confirmed to be the oldest musical instruments ever found. The 40,000-year-old  |Löwenmensch_figurine|Löwenmensch_Figurine|  represents the oldest uncontested figurative work of art and the 35,000-year-old  |Venus_of_Hohle_Fels|Venus_Of_Hohle_Fels|  has been asserted as the oldest uncontested object of human figurative art ever discovered.                                     The  |ethnogenesis|Ethnogenesis|  of the  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples|  remains debated. However, for author  |Averil_Cameron|Averil_Cameron|  it is obvious that a steady process has occurred during the  |Nordic_Bronze_Age|Nordic_Bronze_Age| , or at the latest during the  |Pre-Roman_Iron_Age|Pre-Roman_Iron_Age| .  From their homes in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany the tribes began expanding south, east and west during the 1st century BC, and came into contact with the  |Celt|Celt| ic tribes of  |Gaul|Gaul| , as well as with  |Iranian|Iranian_Peoples| ,  |Baltic|Balts| , and  |Slavic|Slavic_Peoples|  cultures in  |Central|Central_Europe| / |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| .     Factual and detailed knowledge about the early history of the Germanic tribes is rare. Researchers have to be content with the recordings of the tribes affairs with the  |Romans|Roman_Empire| , linguistic conclusions, archaeological discoveries and the rather new yet auspicious results of  |archaeogenetic|Archaeogenetics|  study. In the mid-1st century BC,  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  erected the  |first_known_bridges_across_the_Rhine|Caesars_Rhine_Bridges|  during his  |campaign_in_Gaul|Gallic_Wars|  and led a military contingent across and into the territories of the local Germanic tribes. After several days and having made no contact with Germanic troops Caesar returned to the west of the river.  The  |Suebi|Suebi|  tribe under chieftain  |Ariovistus|Ariovistus| , had around 60 BC conquered lands of the Gallic  |Aedui|Aedui|  tribe to the west of the Rhine. Consequent plans to populate the region with Germanic settlers from the east were vehemently opposed by Caesar, who had already launched his  |ambitious_campaign|Gallic_Wars|  to subjugate all Gaul. Julius Caesar confronts and beats the Suebi forces in 58 BC in the  |Battle_of_Vosges|Battle_Of_Vosges|  and forces Ariovist to retreat across the Rhine.  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| ,  Commentarii de Bello Gallico   |1.31–53|Wikisource:The_Gallic_War_/Book_131|           Emperor Augustus considered conquest beyond the  |Rhine|Rhine|  and the  |Danube|Danube|  not only regular foreign policy but also necessary to counter Germanic incursions into a still rebellious Gaul. A series of forts and commercial centers were established along the two rivers. Some tribes, such as the  |Ubii|Ubii|  consequently allied with Rome and readily adopted advanced Roman culture. During the 1st century CE Roman legions conducted extended campaigns into  |Germania_magna|Germania| , the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, attempting to subdue the various tribes. Roman ideas of administration, the imposition of taxes and a legal framework were frustrated by the total absence of an infrastructure. The campaigns of  |Germanicus|Germanicus| , for example were almost exclusively characterized by frequent massacres of villagers and indiscriminate pillaging. The tribes, however maintained their elusive identities. In 9 AD a coalition of tribes under the  |Cherusci|Cherusci|  chieftain  |Arminius|Arminius| , who was familiar with Roman tactical doctrines, defeated a sizeable Roman force in the  |Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest|Battle_Of_The_Teutoburg_Forest| . Consequently, Rome resolved to permanently establish the Rhine/Danube border and refrain from further territorial advance into Germania. By AD 100 the frontier along the Rhine and the Danube and the  |Limes_Germanicus|Limes_Germanicus|  was firmly established. Several Germanic tribes lived under Roman rule south and west of the border, as described in  |Tacituss|Tacitus|   Germania . These lands represent the modern states  |Baden-Württemberg|Baden-Württemberg| , southern  |Bavaria|Bavaria| , southern  |Hesse|Hesse| ,  |Saarland|Saarland|  and the  |Rhineland|Rhineland| . Austria formed the regular provinces of  |Noricum|Noricum|  and  |Raetia|Raetia| .   The provinces  |Germania_Inferior|Germania_Inferior|   and  |Germania_Superior|Germania_Superior|  , were formally established in 85 AD, after long and painful campaigns as lasting military control was confined to the lands surrounding the rivers.     The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: the  |Alamanni|Alamanni| ,  |Franks|Franks| ,  |Bavarii|Bavarii| ,  |Chatti|Chatti| ,  |Saxons|Saxons| ,  |Frisii|Frisii| ,  |Sicambri|Sicambri| , and  |Thuringii|Thuringii| . By the 3rd century the Germanic peoples began to migrate beyond the  limes  and the Danube frontier. Several large tribes – the  |Visigoths|Visigoths| ,  |Ostrogoths|Ostrogoths| ,  |Vandals|Vandals| ,  |Burgundians|Burgundians| ,  |Lombards|Lombards| ,  |Saxons|Saxons|  and  |Franks|Franks|  – migrated and played their part in the  |decline_of_the_Roman_Empire|Decline_Of_The_Roman_Empire|  and the transformation of the old  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire| .      |Christianity_was_introduced|Christianity_In_Germany|  to Roman controlled south-western Germania and Christian religious structures such as the  |Aula_Palatina|Aula_Palatina|  of  |Trier|Trier|  were built during the reign of  |Constantine_I|Constantine_I|       From 1184 to 1186, the empire under  |Frederick_I_Barbarossa|Frederick_I_Barbarossa|  reached its cultural peak with the  Diet of Pentecost  held at  |Mainz|Mainz|  and the marriage of his son  |Henry|Henry_Vi,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in Milan to the  |Norman|Normans|  princess  |Constance_of_Sicily|Constance_Of_Sicily| .  The power of the feudal lords was undermined by the appointment of  |ministerials|Ministerialis|  as officials. Chivalry and the court life flowered, as expressed in the scholastic philosophy of  |Albertus_Magnus|Albertus_Magnus|  and the literature of  |Wolfram_von_Eschenbach|Wolfram_Von_Eschenbach| .      Between 1212 and 1250,  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  established a modern, professionally administered state from his base in  |Sicily|Sicily| . He resumed the conquest of Italy, leading to further conflict with the  |Papacy|Papacy| . In the Empire, extensive sovereign powers were granted to ecclesiastical and secular princes, leading to the rise of independent territorial states. The struggle with the Pope sapped the Empires strength, as Frederick II was excommunicated three times. After his death, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell, followed by an interregnum during which there was no Emperor.       The failure of negotiations between Emperor  |Louis_IV|Louis_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and the papacy led to the 1338  |Declaration_at_Rhense|Declaration_At_Rhense|  by six princes of the  |Imperial_Estate|Imperial_Estate|  to the effect that election by all or the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. As result, the monarch was no longer subject to papal approbation and became increasingly dependent on the favour of the electors. Between 1346 and 1378  |Emperor_Charles_IV|Charles_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  of  |Luxembourg|Luxembourg| , king of Bohemia, sought to restore imperial authority. The 1356 decree of the  |Golden_Bull|Golden_Bull_Of_1356|  stipulated that all future emperors were to be chosen by a college of only  |seven|Prince-Elector|  – four secular and three clerical – electors. The secular electors were the King of Bohemia, the  |Count_Palatine|Count_Palatine|  of the Rhine, the Duke of  |Saxony|Saxony| , and the Margrave of  |Brandenburg|Brandenburg| , the clerical electors were the Archbishops of  |Mainz|Mainz| ,  |Trier|Trier| , and  |Cologne|Cologne| .      Between 1347 and 1351 Germany and almost the entire European continent were consumed by the most severe outbreak of the  |Black_Death|Black_Death| |pandemic|Pandemic| . Estimated to have caused the abrupt death of 30 to 60% of Europes population, it lead to widespread social and economic disruption and deep religious disaffection and fanaticism. Minority groups, and Jews in particular were blamed, singled out and  |attacked|Black_Death_Jewish_Persecutions| . As a consequence, many Jews fled and resettled in Eastern Europe.            The early-modern European society gradually developed after the disasters of the 14th century as religious obedience and political loyalties declined in the wake of the  |Great_Plague|Black_Death| , the  |schism|Western_Schism|  of the Church and prolonged dynastic wars. The rise of the  |cities|Free_Imperial_City|  and the emergence of the new  |burgher|Burgher|  class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.  The commercial enterprises of the mercantile  |patriciate|Patrician|  family of the  |Fuggers|Fugger|  of  |Augsburg|Augsburg|  generated unprecedented financial means. As financiers to both the leading ecclesiastical and secular rulers, the Fuggers fundamentally influenced the political affairs in the empire during the 15th and 16th century.  The increasingly money based economy also provoked social discontent among knights and peasants and predatory robber knights became common. The knightly classes had traditionally established their monopoly through warfare and military skill. However, the shift to practical mercenary infantry armies and military-technical advances led to a marginalization of heavy cavalry.      From 1438 the  |Habsburg|Habsburg|  dynasty, who had acquired control in the south-eastern empire over the Duchy of Austria,  |Bohemia|Kingdom_Of_Bohemia|  and  |Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  after the death of King  |Louis_II|Louis_Ii_Of_Hungary_And_Bohemia|  in 1526, managed to permanently occupy the position of the Holy Roman Emperor until 1806 . However, this strict policy of dynastic rule over a vast multi-ethnic territory, prevented the development of concepts of patriotism and unity among the empires territorial rulers and a national identity as in  |France|France|  and  |England|England| .     During his reign from 1493 to 1519,  |Maximilian_I|Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  tried to  |reform|Imperial_Reform|  the empire. An Imperial supreme court  was established, imperial taxes were levied, and the power of the  |Imperial_Diet|Imperial_Diet|   was increased. The reforms, however, were frustrated by the continued territorial fragmentation of the Empire.          Total population estimates of the German territories range around 5 to 6 million by the end of Henry IIIs reign in 1056 and about 7 to 8 million after Friedrich Barabarossas rule in 1190.   The vast majority were farmers, typically in a state of  |serfdom|Serfdom|  under feudal lords and monasteries. Towns gradually emerged and in the 12th century many new cities were founded along the trading routes and near imperial strongholds and castles. The towns were subjected to the  |municipal_legal_system|German_Town_Law| . Cities such as  |Cologne|Cologne| , that had acquired the status of  |Imperial_Free_Cities|Imperial_Free_City| , were no longer answerable to the local landlords or bishops, but immediate subjects of the Emperor and enjoyed greater commercial and legal liberties.  The towns were ruled by a council of the – usually  |mercantile|Merchant|  – elite, the  |patricians|Patrician| .  |Craftsmen|Artisan|  formed  |guilds|Guild| , governed by strict rules, which sought to obtain control of the towns; a few were open to women. Society had diversified, but was divided into sharply demarcated classes of the  |clergy|Clergy| ,  |physicians|Physician| ,  |merchants|Merchant| , various guilds of artisans, unskilled day labourers and  |peasants|Peasant| . Full citizenship was not available to  |paupers|Paupers| . Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending, regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of corporate autonomy.       |Colognes|History_Of_Cologne|  central location on the  |Rhine|Rhine|  river placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the basis of Colognes growth.  The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterized by the citys status as a major harbor and transport hub upon the Rhine. It was the seat of an archbishop, under whose patronage the vast  |Cologne_Cathedral|Cologne_Cathedral|  was built since 1240. The cathedral houses sacred Christian relics and since it has become a well known  |pilgrimage_destination|Pilgrimage| . By 1288 the city had secured its independence from the archbishop , and was ruled by its  |burghers|Bourgeoisie| .  – covers from 1000 to 1300.          From the early medieval period and continuing through to the 18th century, Germanic law assigned women to a subordinate and dependent position relative to men.  |Salic_law|Salic_Law| , from which the laws of the German lands would be based, placed women at a disadvantage with regard to property and inheritance rights. Germanic widows required a male guardian to represent them in court. Unlike  |Anglo-Saxon_law|Anglo-Saxon_Law|  or the  |Visigothic_Code|Visigothic_Code| , Salic law barred women from royal succession. Social status was based on military and biological roles, a reality demonstrated in rituals associated with newborns, when female infants were given a lesser value than male infants. The use of physical force against wives was condoned until the 18th century in Bavarian law.  Judith M. Bennett and Ruth Mazo Karras, eds. The Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe .     Some women of means asserted their influence during the Middle Ages, typically in royal court or convent settings.  |Hildegard_of_Bingen|Hildegard_Of_Bingen| ,  |Gertrude_the_Great|Gertrude_The_Great| ,  |Elisabeth_of_Bavaria|Elisabeth_Of_Bavaria| , and  |Argula_von_Grumbach|Argula_Von_Grumbach|  are among the women who pursued independent accomplishments in fields as diverse as medicine, music composition, religious writing, and government and military politics.          |Benedictine|Benedictine|  abbess  |Hildegard_von_Bingen|Hildegard_Von_Bingen|  wrote several influential theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical songs, poems, and arguably the oldest surviving  |morality_play|Morality_Play| , while supervising brilliant miniature  |Illuminations|Illumination| . About 100 years later,  |Walther_von_der_Vogelweide|Walther_Von_Der_Vogelweide|  became the most celebrated of the  |Middle_High_German|Middle_High_German|  lyric poets.     Around 1439,  |Johannes_Gutenberg|Johannes_Gutenberg|  of  |Mainz|Mainz| , used  |movable_type|Movable_Type|  printing and issued the  |Gutenberg_Bible|Gutenberg_Bible| . He was the global inventor of the  |printing_press|Printing_Press| , thereby starting the  |Printing_Revolution|Printing_Revolution| . Cheap printed books and pamphlets played central roles for the spread of the  |Reformation|Reformation|  and the  |Scientific_Revolution|Scientific_Revolution| .     Around the transition from the 15th to the 16th century,  |Albrecht_Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer|  from  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg|  established his reputation across Europe as  |painter|Painting| ,  |printmaker|Printmaker| ,  |mathematician|Mathematician| ,  |engraver|Engraver| , and  |theorist|Theorist|  when he was still in his twenties and secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the  |Northern_Renaissance|Northern_Renaissance| .     The addition Nationis Germanicæ to the emperors title appeared first in the 15th century: in a 1486 law decreed by Frederick III and in 1512 in reference to the Imperial Diet in Cologne by Maximilian I. By then, the emperors had lost their influence in Italy and Burgundy. In 1525, the Heilbronn reform plan – the most advanced document of the  |German_Peasants_War|German_Peasants_War|   – referred to the Reich as von Teutscher Nation .               :See List of states in the Holy Roman Empire for subdivisions and the political structure                In order to manage their ever growing expenses, the  |Renaissance_Popes|Renaissance_Papacy|  of the 15th and early 16th century promoted the excessive sale of  |indulgences|Indulgence|  and offices and titles of the Roman Curia.     In 1517, the monk  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  published a pamphlet with  |95_Theses|95_Theses|  that he posted in the town square of  |Wittenberg|Wittenberg|  and handed copies to feudal lords. Whether he nailed them to a church door at Wittenberg remains unclear. The list detailed 95 assertions, he argued, represented corrupt practice of the Christian faith and misconduct within the Catholic Church. Although perhaps not Luthers chief concern, he received popular support for his condemnation of the sale of  |indulgences|Indulgences|  and clerical offices, the popes and higher clergys abuse of power and his doubts of the very idea of the institution of the Church and the papacy.      The  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  was the first successful challenge to the Catholic Church and began in 1521 as Luther was outlawed at the  |Diet_of_Worms|Diet_Of_Worms|  after his refusal to repent. The ideas of the reformation spread rapidly, as the new technology of the modern printing press ensured cheap mass copies and distribution of the theses and helped by the  |Emperor_Charles_Vs|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  wars with France and the  |Turks|Ottoman_Empire| . Hiding in the  |Wartburg_Castle|Wartburg_Castle| , Luther translated the Bible into German, thereby greatly contributing to the establishment of the modern German language. This is highlighted by the fact that Luther spoke only a local dialect of minor importance during that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed others and constitutes to a great extent what is now modern German. With the  |protestation|Protestation_At_Speyer|  of the Lutheran princes at the  |Imperial_Diet|Imperial_Diet|  of  |Speyer|Second_Diet_Of_Speyer|  in 1529 and the acceptance and adoption of the Lutheran  |Augsburg_Confession|Augsburg_Confession|  by the Lutheran princes beginning in 1530, the separate Lutheran church was established. John Lotherington, The German Reformation        The 1524/25  |German_Peasants_War|German_Peasants_War| , that began in the southwest in  |Alsace|Alsace|  and  |Swabia|Swabia|  and spread further east into  |Franconia|Franconia| ,  |Thuringia|Thuringia|  and Austria, was a series of economic and religious revolts of the rural lower classes, encouraged by the rhethoric of various radical religious reformers and Anabaptists against the ruling feudal lords. Although occasionally assisted by war-experienced noblemen like  |Götz_von_Berlichingen|Götz_Von_Berlichingen|  and  |Florian_Geyer|Florian_Geyer|  and the theologian  |Thomas_Müntzer|Thomas_Müntzer|  , the peasant forces lacked military structure, skill, logistics and equipment and as many as 100,000 insurgents were eventually defeated and massacred by the territorial princes. Michael G. Baylor, The German Reformation and the Peasants War: A Brief History with Documents     The Catholic  |Counter-Reformation|Counter-Reformation| , initiated in 1545 at the  |Council_of_Trent|Council_Of_Trent|  was spearheaded by the scholarly religious  |Jesuit_order|Society_Of_Jesus| , that was founded just five years prior by several clerics around  |Ignatius_of_Loyola|Ignatius_Of_Loyola| . Its intent was to challenge and contain the Protestant Reformation via apologetic and polemical writings and decrees, ecclesiastical reconfiguration, wars and imperial political maneuverings. In 1547  |emperor_Charles_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  defeated the  |Schmalkaldic_League|Schmalkaldic_League| , a military alliance of Protestant rulers. John Lotherington, The Counter-Reformation The 1555  |Peace_of_Augsburg|Peace_Of_Augsburg|  decreed the recognition of the Lutheran Faith and religious division of the empire. It also stipulated the rulers right to determine the official confession in his principality . The Counter-Reformation eventually failed to reintegrate the central and northern German Lutheran states. In 1608/1609 the  |Protestant_Union|Protestant_Union|  and the  |Catholic_League|Catholic_League|  were formed.             The 1618 to 1648  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , that took place almost exclusively in the Holy Roman Empire has its origins, that remain widely debated, in the unsolved and recurring conflicts of the Catholic and Protestant factions. The Catholic emperor  |Ferdinand_II|Ferdinand_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  attempted to achieve the religious and political unity of the empire, while the opposing Protestant Union forces were determined to defend their religious rights. The religious motive served as the universal justification for the various territorial and foreign princes, who over the course of several stages joined either of the two warring parties in order to gain land and power.      The conflict was sparked by the  |revolt_of_the_Protestant_nobility_of_Bohemia|Bohemian_Revolt|  against emperor  |Matthias|Matthias,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  succession policies. After imperial triumph at the  |Battle_of_White_Mountain|Battle_Of_White_Mountain|  and a short-lived peace, the war grew to become a political European conflict by the intervention of  |King_Christian_IV_of_Denmark|Christian_Iv_Of_Denmark|  from 1625 to 1630,  |Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden|Gustavus_Adolphus_Of_Sweden|  from 1630 to 1648 and France under  |Cardinal_Richelieu|Cardinal_Richelieu|  from 1635 to 1648. The conflict increasingly evolved into a struggle between the French House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg for predominance in Europe, for which the central German territories of the empire served as the battle ground.      The war ranks among the most catastrophic in history as three decades of constant warfare and destruction have left the land devastated. Marauding armies incessantly pillaged the countryside, seized and levied heavy taxes on cities and indiscriminately plundered the food stocks of the peasantry. There were also the countless bands of murderous outlaws, sick, homeless, disrupted people and invalid soldiery. Overall social and economic disruption caused a dramatic decline in population as a result of pandemic murder and random rape and killings, endemic infectious diseases, crop failures, famine, declining birth rates, wanton burglary, witch-hunts and the emigration of terrified people. Estimates vary between a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650 and a mere 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The  |Altmark|Altmark|  and  |Württemberg|History_Of_Württemberg|  regions were especially hard hit, where it took generations to fully recover. Geoffrey Parker, The Thirty Years War p. 178 has 15–20% decline; Tryntje Helfferich, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History p. xix, estimates a 25% decline. Wilson pp. 780–95 reviews the estimates.     The war was the last major religious struggle in mainland Europe and ended in 1648 with the  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia| . It resulted in increased autonomy for the constituent states of the Holy Roman Empire, limiting the power of the emperor.  |Alsace|Alsace|  was permanently lost to France,  |Pomerania|Pomerania|  was temporarily lost to Sweden, and the Netherlands officially left the Empire.             The population of Germany reached about twenty million people by the mid-16th century, the great majority of whom were peasant farmers.      The Protestant Reformation was a triumph for literacy and the new printing press. Luthers translation of the Bible into German was a decisive impulse for the increase of literacy and stimulated printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. The Reformation instigated a media revolution as by 1530 over 10,000 individual works are published with a total of ten million copies. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a good against bad church. It soon became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichés, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.  Especially effective were Luthers Small Catechism, for use of parents teaching their children, and Larger Catechism, for pastors. See texts at  Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many tracts popularized Luthers ideas.  |Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder|Lucas_Cranach_The_Elder|  , the great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luthers theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luthers views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luthers careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.      Luthers German translation of the Bible was also decisive for the  |German_language|German_Language|  and its evolution from  |Early_New_High_German|Early_New_High_German|  to Modern Standard. His bible promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area.       The German astronomical community played a central role in Europe in the early modern period. Several non-German scientists contributed to the community, such as  |Copernicus|Copernicus| , the instigator of the  |scientific_revolution|Scientific_Revolution|  who lived in  |Royal_Prussia|Royal_Prussia| , a part of  |Poland|Kingdom_Of_Poland|  and  |Tycho_Brahe|Tycho_Brahe| , who worked in  |Denmark|Kingdom_Of_Denmark|  and  |Bohemia|Kingdom_Of_Bohemia| . Copernicus, whose mother was of German ancestry was better known inside the German community.  Astronomer  |Johannes_Kepler|Johannes_Kepler|  from  |Weil_der_Stadt|Weil_Der_Stadt|  was one of the pioneering minds of empirical and rational research. Through rigorous application of the principles of the  |Scientific_method|Scientific_Method|  he construed his  |laws_of_planetary_motion|Keplers_Laws_Of_Planetary_Motion| . His ideas influenced contemporary Italian scientist  |Galileo_Galilei|Galileo_Galilei|  and provided fundamental mechanical principles for  |Isaac_Newtons|Isaac_Newton|  theory of  |universal_gravitation|Newtons_Law_Of_Universal_Gravitation| .                 In 1640,  |Frederick_William|Frederick_William,_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| , also called the Great  |Elector|Prince-Elector| , became ruler of  |Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg-Prussia|  and immediately threw off his vassalage under the Kingdom of Poland and reorganized his loose and scattered territories. In 1648 he acquired  |East_Pomerania|Province_Of_Pomerania|  via the treaty of Territorial Adjustments in the  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia| .   |King_Frederick_William_I|Frederick_William_I_Of_Prussia| , known as the Soldier King, who reigned from 1713 to 1740, established the structures for the highly centralized future Prussian state and raised a standing army, that was to play a central role. In order to address the demographic problem of Prussias largely rural population of about three million, the immigration and settlement of French  |Huguenots|Huguenots|  in urban areas, of whom many were craftsmen, was supported.     The total population of Germany  grew from 16 million in 1700 to 17 million in 1750 and reached 24 million in 1800. The 18th-century economy noticeably profited from widespread practical application of the Scientific method as greater yields and a more reliable agricultural production and the introduction of hygienic standards positively affected the birth rate – death rate balance.              |Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis_Xiv_Of_France|  waged a series of successful wars in order to extend the French territory. He conquered  |Alsace_and_Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine|  that included the free imperial city of Strasbourg and invaded the  |Electorate_of_the_Palatinate|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate|  in the  |War_of_the_Grand_Alliance|War_Of_The_Grand_Alliance| .  Louis established a number of  |courts|Chambers_Of_Reunion|  whose sole function was to reinterpret historic decrees and treaties, the  |Treaties_of_Nijmegen|Treaties_Of_Nijmegen|  and the  |Peace_of_Westphalia|Peace_Of_Westphalia|  in particular in favor of his policies of conquest. He considered the conclusions of these courts, the Chambres de réunion as sufficient justification for his boundless annexations. Louis forces operated inside the Holy Roman Empire largely unopposed, because all available imperial contingents fought in Austria in the  |Great_Turkish_War|Great_Turkish_War| . The  |Grand_Alliance|Grand_Alliance|  of 1689 took up arms against France and countered any further military advances of Louis. The conflict ended in 1697 as both parties agreed to peace talks after either side had realized, that a total victory was financially unattainable. The  |Treaty_of_Ryswick|Treaty_Of_Ryswick|  provided for the return of the  |Electorate_of_the_Palatinate|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate|  to the empire.      After the last-minute  |relief_of_Vienna|Battle_Of_Vienna|  from a siege and the imminent seizure by a  |Turkish_force|Ottoman_Army|  in 1683, the combined troops of the  |Holy_League|Holy_League| , that had been founded the following year, embarked on the military containment of the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  and reconquered  |Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  in 1687.  The  |Papal_States|Papal_States| , the Holy Roman Empire, the  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth| , the  |Republic_of_Venice|Republic_Of_Venice|  and since 1686 Russia had joined the league under the leadership of  |Pope_Innocent_XI|Pope_Innocent_Xi| .  |Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince_Eugene_Of_Savoy| , who served under emperor Leopold I, took supreme command in 1697 and decisively defeated the Ottomans in a series of spectacular battles and   manoeuvres. The 1699  |Treaty_of_Karlowitz|Treaty_Of_Karlowitz|  marked the end of the Great Turkish War and Prince Eugene continued his service for the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  as president of the  |War_Council|Hofkriegsrat| . He effectively ended Turkish rule over most of the territorial states in the  |Balkans|Balkans|  during the  |Austro-Turkish_War_of_1716–18|Austro-Turkish_War_Of_1716–18| . The  |Treaty_of_Passarowitz|Treaty_Of_Passarowitz|  left Austria to freely establish royal domains in Serbia and the Banat and maintain hegemony in  |Southeast_Europe|Southeast_Europe| , on which the future  |Austrian_Empire|Austrian_Empire|  was based.             |Frederick_II_the_Great|Frederick_The_Great|  is best known for his military genius and unique utilisation of the highly organized army to make Prussia one of the great powers in Europe as well as  |escaping_from_almost_certain_national_disaster|Miracle_Of_The_House_Of_Brandenburg|  at the last minute. However he was also an artist, author and philosopher, who conceived and promoted the concept of  |Enlightened_absolutism|Enlightened_Absolutism| . 19th-century historians created the romantic image of the glorified warrior and accomplished leader and he served as heroic role model for an aggressive Germany militarism down to 1945 and beyond. Dennis Showalter, Frederick the Great: A Military History ; called by  |Russell_Weigley|Russell_Weigley|  The best introduction to Frederick the Great and indeed to European warfare in his time.      Austrian empress  |Maria_Theresa|Maria_Theresa_Of_Austria|  succeeded in bringing about a favorable conclusion for her in  |the_1740_to_1748_war|War_Of_The_Austrian_Succession|  for recognition of her succession to the throne. However,  |Silesia|Silesia|  was permanently lost to Prussia as a consequence of the  |Silesian_Wars|Silesian_Wars|  and the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War| . The 1763  |Treaty_of_Hubertusburg|Treaty_Of_Hubertusburg|  ruled that Austria and Saxony had to relinquish all claims to Silesia. Prussia, that had nearly doubled its territory was eventually recognized as a great European power with the consequence that the politics of the following century were fundamentally influenced by  |German_dualism|Austria–Prussia_Rivalry| , the rivalry of Austria and Prussia for supremacy in Central Europe.      The concept of Enlightened absolutism, although rejected by the nobility and citizenry, was advocated in  |Prussia|Prussia|  and  |Austria|Austria|  and implemented since 1763. Prussian king  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii_Of_Prussia|  defended the idea in an essay and argued that the  |benevolent_monarch|Benevolent_Dictatorship|  simply is the first servant of the state, who effects his absolute political power for the benefit of the population as a whole. A number of legal reforms , the reorganization of the  |Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences|Prussian_Academy_Of_Sciences| , the introduction of compulsory education for boys and girls and promotion of religious tolerance, among others, caused rapid social and economic development.      During 1772 to 1795 Prussia instigated the  |partitions_of_Poland|Partitions_Of_Poland|  by occupying the western territories of the former  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth| . Austria and Russia resolved to acquire the remaining lands with the effect that Poland ceased to exist as a sovereign state until 1918. Lucjan R. Lewitter, The Partitions of Poland in A. Goodwyn, ed. The New Cambridge Modern History: vol 8 1763–93 pp 333–59             Completely overshadowed by Prussia and Austria, according to historian  |Hajo_Holborn|Hajo_Holborn| , the smaller German states were generally characterized by political lethargy and administrative inefficiency, often compounded by rulers who were more concerned with their mistresses and their hunting dogs than with the affairs of state.  |Bavaria|Electorate_Of_Bavaria|  was especially unfortunate in this regard; it was a rural land with very heavy debts and few growth centers.  |Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony|  was in economically good shape, although its government was seriously mismanaged, and numerous wars had taken their toll. During the time when Prussia rose rapidly within Germany, Saxony was distracted by foreign affairs. The house of Wettin concentrated on acquiring and then holding on to the Polish throne which was ultimately unsuccessful. In  |Württemberg|History_Of_Württemberg|  the duke lavished funds on palaces, mistresses, great celebration, and hunting expeditions. Many of the city-states of Germany were run by bishops, who in reality were from powerful noble families and showed scant interest in religion. None developed a significant reputation for good government.      In  |Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate_Of_Hesse-Kassel| , the Landgrave  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Landgrave_Of_Hesse-Kassel| , ruled 1760–1785 as an enlightened despot, and raised money by renting soldiers  to  |Great_Britain|Great_Britain|  to help fight the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| . He combined  |Enlightenment_ideas|The_Enlightenment|  with Christian values,  |cameralist|Cameralism|  plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.       |Hanover|History_Of_Hanover|  did not have to support a lavish court—its rulers were also kings of England and resided in London.  |George_III|George_Iii_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , elector from 1760 to 1820, never once visited Hanover. The local nobility who ran the country opened the  |University_of_Göttingen|University_Of_Göttingen|  in 1737; it soon became a world-class intellectual center.  |Baden|History_Of_Baden|  sported perhaps the best government of the smaller states.  |Karl_Friedrich|Charles_Frederick,_Grand_Duke_Of_Baden|  ruled well for 73 years and was an enthusiast for  |The_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment| ; he abolished serfdom in 1783.      The smaller states failed to form coalitions with each other, and were eventually overwhelmed by Prussia. Between 1807 and 1871, Prussia swallowed up many of the smaller states, with minimal protest, then went on to found the German Empire. In the process, Prussia became too heterogeneous, lost its identity, and by the 1930s had become an administrative shell of little importance.       The nobility represented the  |first_estate|Estates_Of_The_Realm|  in a typical early modern kingdom of Christian Europe, with Germany being no exception. The empires pluralistic character also applied to its nobility, that greatly varied in power and wealth, ideas, ambition, loyalty and education. However, there existed the distinction between the Imperial nobility, the direct vassals of the emperor and the Territorial nobility, who have received their  |fief|Fief|  from the  |territorial_princes|Imperial_Estate| .  Many of whom had been impoverished as their standard of life and culture had declined since the end of the Medieval period. In an ever more complex economy, they struggled to compete with the patricians and merchants of the cities. The Thirty Years War marked the reversal of fortunes for those noblemen, who seized the initiative and had understood the requirements of higher education for a lucrative position in the post-war territorial administration. In the Prussian lands east of the Elbe river the system of  |manorial_jurisdiction|Manorialism|  guaranteed near universal legal power and economic freedom for the local lords, called  |Junkers|Junker| , who dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.        Peasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.  For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 1710 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, Jans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania, Genealogist, Fall 2008, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 131–169          The emancipation of the serfs came in 1770–1830, beginning with Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, buy and sell it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was  |Baron_vom_Stein|Heinrich_Friedrich_Karl_Vom_Und_Zum_Stein|  , who was influenced by  |The_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment| , especially the free market ideas of  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| .  The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowners could borrow government money to buy land from peasants . The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.     The agrarian reforms in northwestern Germany in the era 1770–1870 were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished  |feudal_obligations|Feudal_Obligations|  and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy, which increased productivity and population growth and strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile, the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants.  In the east the serfs were emancipated but the  |Junker_class|Junker|  maintained its large estates and monopolized political power.      Around 1800 the Catholic monasteries, which had large land holdings, were nationalized and sold off by the government. In Bavaria they had controlled 56% of the land. Thomas Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800–1866 p. 59       A major social change occurring between 1750–1850, depending on region, was the end of the traditional whole house system, in which the owners family lived together in one large building with the servants and craftsmen he employed. Marion W. Gray, Productive men, reproductive women: the agrarian household and the emergence of separate spheres during the German Enlightenment . They reorganized into separate living arrangements. No longer did the owners wife take charge of all the females in the different families in the whole house. In the new system, farm owners became more professionalized and profit-oriented. They managed the fields and the household exterior according to the dictates of technology, science, and economics. Farm wives supervised family care and the household interior, to which strict standards of cleanliness, order, and thrift applied. The result was the spread of formerly urban bourgeois values into rural Germany. Marion W. Gray and June K. Burton, Bourgeois Values in the Rural Household, 1810–1840: The New Domesticity in Germany, The Consortium on Revolutionary Europe, 1750–1850 23 : 449–56.     The lesser families were now living separately on wages. They had to provide for their own supervision, health, schooling, and old-age. At the same time, because of the demographic transition, there were far fewer children, allowing for much greater attention to each child. Increasingly the middle-class family valued its privacy and its inward direction, shedding too-close links with the world of work. Nipperdey, ch 2. Furthermore, the working classes, the middle classes and the upper classes became physically, psychologically and politically more separate. This allowed for the emergence of working-class organizations. It also allowed for declining religiosity among the working-class, who were no longer monitored on a daily basis. Eda Sagarra, An introduction to Nineteenth century Germany pp 231–33.               Since the mid-18th century recognition and application of Enlightenment ideas, higher cultural, intellectual and spiritual standards have lead to higher quality works of art in music, philosophy, science and literature. Philosopher  |Christian_Wolff|Christian_Wolff|  was a pioneering author on a near universal number of Enlightenment rationality topics in Germany and established German as the language of philosophic reasoning, scholarly instruction and research.      In 1685 Margrave  |Frederick_William|Frederick_William,_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  of Prussia issued the  |Edict_of_Potsdam|Edict_Of_Potsdam|  within a week after French king  |Louis_XIVs|Louis_Xiv_Of_France| |Edict_of_Fontainebleau|Edict_Of_Fontainebleau| , that decreed the abolishment of the 1598  |concession|Edict_Of_Nantes|  to free religious practice for  |Protestants|Huguenots| . Frederick William offered his co-religionists, who are oppressed and assailed for the sake of the Holy Gospel and its pure doctrine...a secure and free refuge in all Our Lands.  Around 20,000 Huguenot refugees arrived in an immediate wave and settled in the cities, 40% in Berlin, the ducal residence alone. The French Lyceum in Berlin was established in 1689 and the French language had by the end of the 17th century replaced Latin to be spoken universally in international diplomacy. The nobility and the educated middle-class of Prussia and the various German states increasingly used the French language in public conversation in combination with universal cultivated manners. Like no other German state, Prussia had access to and the skill set for the application of pan-European Enlightenment ideas to develop more rational political and administrative institutions. Charles W. Ingrao, A Pre-Revolutionary Sonderweg. German History 203 , pp 279–286. The princes of Saxony carried out a comprehensive series of fundamental fiscal, administrative, judicial, educational, cultural and general economic reforms. The reforms were aided by the countrys strong urban structure and influential commercial groups, who modernized pre-1789 Saxony along the lines of classic Enlightenment principles. Katrin Keller, Saxony: Rétablissement and Enlightened Absolutism. German History 20.3 : 309–331.      |Johann_Gottfried_von_Herder|Johann_Gottfried_Von_Herder|  broke new ground in philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the  |Sturm_und_Drang|Sturm_Und_Drang|  movement of proto-Romanticism.  |Weimar_Classicism|Weimar_Classicism|  was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical, and Enlightenment ideas. The movement, from 1772 until 1805, involved Herder as well as polymath  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe|  and  |Friedrich_Schiller|Friedrich_Schiller|  , a poet and historian. Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schillers plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the heros struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.      German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers  |Johann_Sebastian_Bach|Johann_Sebastian_Bach|  ,  |Joseph_Haydn|Joseph_Haydn|  , and  |Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|  .       |Königsberg|Königsberg|  philosopher  |Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel_Kant|  tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom, and political authority. Kants work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th century.   The ideas of the Enlightenment and their implementation received general approval and recognition as principal cause for widespread cultural progress.        Before the 19th century, young women lived under the economic and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed under the control of their husbands. In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages. Before 1789, the majority of women lived confined to societys private sphere, the home. Ruth-Ellen B. Joeres and Mary Jo Maynes, German women in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: a social and literary history .     The Age of Reason did not bring much more for women: men, including Enlightenment aficionados, believed that women were naturally destined to be principally wives and mothers. Within the educated classes, there was the belief that women needed to be sufficiently educated to be intelligent and agreeable interlocutors to their husbands. However, the lower-class women were expected to be economically productive in order to help their husbands make ends meet. Eda Sagarra, A Social History of Germany: 1648 – 1914 .             German reaction to the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the  |execution_of_the_French_king|Execution_Of_Louis_Xvi|  and the onset of  |the_Terror|Reign_Of_Terror|  disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum . Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion. James J. Sheehan, German History, 1770–1866 pp 207–88     Europe was racked by two decades of war revolving around Frances efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty. War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the  |Battle_of_Valmy|Battle_Of_Valmy|  . The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation , but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and Austria ended their failed wars with France but partitioned Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795.        |France|French_Consulate|  took control of the  |Rhineland|Rhineland| , imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share power with the rising middle class. Napoleon created the  |Kingdom_of_Westphalia|Kingdom_Of_Westphalia|  as a model state.  These reforms proved largely permanent and modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the French language, German opposition grew in intensity. A  |Second_Coalition|Second_Coalition|  of Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire was little more than a farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming new countries under his control. In Germany Napoleon set up the  |Confederation_of_the_Rhine|Confederation_Of_The_Rhine| , comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.       Under  |Frederick_William_IIs|Frederick_William_Ii_Of_Prussia|  weak rule Prussia had undergone a serious economic, political and military decline. His successor king  |Frederick_William_III|Frederick_William_Iii_Of_Prussia|  tried to remain neutral during the  |War_of_the_Third_Coalition|War_Of_The_Third_Coalition|  and  |French_emperor|First_French_Empire| |Napoleons|Napoleon|  dissolution of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  and reorganisation of the German principalities. Induced by the queen and a pro-war party Frederick William joined the  |Fourth_Coalition|War_Of_The_Fourth_Coalition|  in October 1806. Napoleon easily defeated the Prussian army at the  |Battle_of_Jena|Battle_Of_Jena|  and occupied Berlin. Prussia lost its recently acquired territories in western Germany, its army was reduced to 42,000 men, no trade with Britain was allowed and Berlin had to pay Paris high reparations and fund the French army of occupation.  |Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony|  changed sides to support Napoleon and joined the  |Confederation_of_the_Rhine|Confederation_Of_The_Rhine| . Ruler  |Frederick_Augustus_I|Frederick_Augustus_I_Of_Saxony|  was rewarded with the title of king and given a slice of Poland taken from Prussia.      After  |Napoleons_military_fiasco_in_Russia_in_1812|French_Invasion_Of_Russia| , Prussia allied with Russia in the  |Sixth_Coalition|War_Of_The_Sixth_Coalition| . A series of battles followed and Austria joined the alliance. Napoleon was decisively defeated in the  |Battle_of_Leipzig|Battle_Of_Leipzig|  in late 1813. The German states of the Confederation of the Rhine defected to the Coalition against Napoleon, who rejected any peace terms. Coalition forces invaded France in early 1814,  |Paris_fell|Battle_Of_Paris|  and in April Napoleon surrendered. Prussia as one of the winners at the  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna| , gained extensive territory.                     In 1815 continental Europe was in a state of overall turbulence and exhaustion, as a consequence of the  |French_Revolutionary|French_Revolutionary_Wars|  and  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| . The liberal spirit of the  |Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|  and Revolutionary era diverged toward the  |Romanticism|Romanticism|  of  |Edmund_Burke|Edmund_Burke| ,  |Joseph_de_Maistre|Joseph_De_Maistre|  and  |Novalis|Novalis| . The victorious members of the Coalition had negotiated a new peaceful balance of powers in Vienna and agreed to maintain a stable German heartland that keeps French imperialism at bay. However, the idea of reforming the defunct  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  was discarded.  |Napoleons|Napoleon_Bonaparte| |reorganization_of_the_German_states|German_Mediatization|  was continued and the remaining princes were allowed to keep their titles. In 1813, in return for guarantees from the Allies that the sovereignty and integrity of the Southern German states  would be preserved, they broke with France.            During the 1815  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  the 39 former states of the Confederation of the Rhine joined the  |German_Confederation|German_Confederation| , a loose agreement for mutual defense. Attempts of economic integration and customs coordination were frustrated by repressive anti-national policies. Great Britain approved of the union, convinced that a stable, peaceful entity in central Europe could discourage aggressive moves by France or Russia. Most historians, however, concluded, that the Confederation was weak and ineffective and an obstacle to German nationalism. The union was undermined by the creation of the  |Zollverein|Zollverein|  in 1834, the  |1848_revolutions|German_Revolutions_Of_1848–49| , the rivalry between Prussia and Austria and was finally dissolved in the wake of the  |Austro-Prussian_War|Austro-Prussian_War|  of 1866, to be replaced by the  |North_German_Confederation|North_German_Confederation|  during the same year.            Between 1815 and 1865 the population of the German Confederation grew around 60% from 21 million to 34 million. Simultaneously the  |Demographic_Transition|Demographic_Transition|  took place as the high birth rates and high death rates of the pre-industrial country shifted to low birth and death rates of the fast-growing industrialized urban economic and agricultural system. Increased agricultural productivity secured a steady food supply, as famines and epidemics declined. This allowed people to marry earlier, and have more children. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and after 1840, large-scale emigration to the  |United_States|United_States| . Emigration totaled at 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and at 780,000 in the 1860s. The upper and middle classes first practiced birth control, soon to be universally adopted.          In 1800, Germanys social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the French Revolution , however, produced important institutional reforms, that included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. The idea, that these reforms were beneficial for Industrialization has been contested.  Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in the many small principalities. Until 1850, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches and the government bureaucracies maintained many rules and restrictions that held entrepreneurship in low esteem and given little opportunity to develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony and other states introduced agriculture based on sugar beets, turnips and potatoes, that yielded higher crops, which enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas.     In the early 19th century the Industrial Revolution was in full swing in Britain, France, and Belgium. The various small federal states in Germany developed only slowly and independently as competition was strong. Early investments for the railway network during the 1830s came almost exclusively from private hands. Without a central regulatory agency the construction projects were quickly realized. Actual industrialization only took off after 1850 in the wake of the railroad construction. The textile industry grew rapidly, profiting from the elimination of tariff barriers by the Zollverein.  During the second half of the 19th century the German industry grew exponentially and by 1900, Germany was an industrial world leader along with Britain and the United States.     Historian  |Thomas_Nipperdey|Thomas_Nipperdey|  remarks:   On the whole, industrialisation in Germany must be considered to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, in terms of social inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, alienation, new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare. Thomas Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800–1866 p 178       In 1800 the population was predominantly rural, as only 10% lived in communities of 5,000 or more people, and only 2% lived in cities of more than 100,000 people. After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 inhabitants in 1870, Hamburg from 130,000 to 290,000, Munich from 40,000 to 269,000 and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000. Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800–1866 pp. 96–97             The takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron. Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist  |Friedrich_List|Friedrich_List|  summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:     1. As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.   2. It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.   3. It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.   4. It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes. Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800–1866 p.  165     Lacking a technological base at first, engineering and hardware was imported from Britain. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was the support of industrialisation. Eventually numerous lines criss-crossed the Ruhr area and other industrial centers and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, 9,400 locomotives pulled 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day.           While there existed no national newspaper the many states issued a great variety of printed media, although they rarely exceeded regional significance. In a typical town existed one or two outlets, urban centers, such as Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to a few percent of male adults, chiefly from the aristocratic and upper middle class. Liberal publishers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image. Theodore S. Hamerow, The Social Foundations of German Unification, 1858–1871: Ideas and Institutions pp 284–91 Censorship was strict, and the imperial government issued the political news that was supposed to be published. After 1871, strict press laws were enforced by Bismarck to contain the Socialists and hostile editors. Editors focused on political commentary, culture, the arts, high culture and the popular serialized novels. Magazines were politically more influential and attracted intellectual authors. Kenneth E. Olson, The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965 pp 99–134       19th-century artists and intellectuals were greatly inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution and the great poets and writers  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe|  ,  |Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing|Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing|  and  |Friedrich_Schiller|Friedrich_Schiller|  . The  |Sturm_und_Drang|Sturm_Und_Drang| |romantic|Romanticism|  movement was embraced and emotion was given free expression in reaction to the perceived rationalism of the  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment| . Philosophical principles and methods were revolutionized by  |Immanuel_Kants|Immanuel_Kant|  paradigm shift.  |Ludwig_van_Beethoven|Ludwig_Van_Beethoven|  was the most influential composer of the period from  |classical|Classical_Period|  to  |Romantic_music|Romantic_Music| . His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced  |Franz_Schubert|Franz_Schubert|  and  |Robert_Schumann|Robert_Schumann|  . In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by  |Carl_Maria_von_Weber|Carl_Maria_Von_Weber|  and perfected by  |Richard_Wagner|Richard_Wagner|  in his  |Ring_Cycle|Ring_Cycle| . The  |Brothers_Grimm|Brothers_Grimm|  collected folk stories into the popular  |Grimms_Fairy_Tales|Grimms_Fairy_Tales|  and are ranked among the founding fathers of  |German_studies|German_Studies| , who initiated the work on the  |Deutsches_Wörterbuch|Deutsches_Wörterbuch|  , the most comprehensive work on the German language. Elmer H. Antonsen, James W. Marchand, and Ladislav Zgusta, eds. The Grimm brothers and the Germanic past .     University professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With  |Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|  ,  |Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling|  ,  |Arthur_Schopenhauer|Arthur_Schopenhauer|  ,  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche|  ,  |Max_Weber|Max_Weber|  ,  |Karl_Marx|Karl_Marx|  and  |Friedrich_Engels|Friedrich_Engels|  in philosophy,  |Friedrich_Schleiermacher|Friedrich_Schleiermacher|  in theology and  |Leopold_von_Ranke|Leopold_Von_Ranke|  in history became famous. The  |University_of_Berlin|Humboldt_University_Of_Berlin| , founded in 1810, became the worlds leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by  |Alexander_von_Humboldt|Alexander_Von_Humboldt|  in natural science and  |Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|  in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to politics, but their support for the failed revolution of 1848 forced many into exile.                   Two main developments reshaped religion in Germany. Across the land, there was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King  |Frederick_William_III|Frederick_William_Iii|  was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to unify the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardized liturgy, organization and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the  |Church_of_the_Prussian_Union|Prussian_Union_Of_Churches|  was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans, and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the Old Lutherans in Silesia who clung tightly to the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground. Tens of thousands migrated,  |to_South_Australia|German_Australian| , and especially to the United States, where they formed the  |Missouri_Synod|Lutheran_Church–Missouri_Synod| , which is still in operation as a conservative denomination. Finally in 1845 a new king  |Frederick_William_IV|Frederick_William_Iv|  offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form a separate church association with only nominal government control. Christopher Clark, Iron Kingdom pp 412–19 Christopher Clark, Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817–40. Historical Journal 39.04 pp: 985–1004.  Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany 1648–1840 pp 485–91     From the religious point of view of the typical Catholic or Protestant, major changes were underway in terms of a much more personalized religiosity that focused on the individual more than the church or the ceremony. The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity.  |Pietistic_revivals|Pietism|  were common among Protestants. Among, Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the  |Seamless_robe_of_Jesus|Seamless_Robe_Of_Jesus| , said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion. Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new  |ultramontanism|Ultramontanism|  of Catholics highly loyal to Rome. Christopher Clark, Iron Kingdom pp 419–21 A sharp controversy broke out in 1837–38 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands. However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government. Holborn, A History of Modern Germany 1648–1840 pp 498–509                          After the fall of Napoleon, Europes statesmen convened in Vienna in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the  |Austrian_Prince_Metternich|Klemens_Wenzel_Von_Metternich| . The political principles agreed upon at this  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  included the restoration, legitimacy and solidarity of rulers for the repression of revolutionary and nationalist ideas.     The  |German_Confederation|German_Confederation|   was founded, a loose union of 39 states under Austrian leadership, with a Federal Diet  meeting in  |Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt_Am_Main| . It was a loose coalition that failed to satisfy most nationalists. The member states largely went their own way, and Austria had its own interests.     In 1819 a student radical assassinated the reactionary playwright  |August_von_Kotzebue|August_Friedrich_Ferdinand_Von_Kotzebue| , who had scoffed at liberal student organisations. In one of the few major actions of the German Confederation, Prince Metternich called a conference that issued the repressive  |Carlsbad_Decrees|Carlsbad_Decrees| , designed to suppress liberal agitation against the conservative governments of the German states.  The Decrees terminated the fast-fading nationalist fraternities , removed liberal university professors, and expanded the censorship of the press. The decrees began the persecution of the demagogues , which was directed against individuals who were accused of spreading revolutionary and nationalist ideas. Among the persecuted were the poet  |Ernst_Moritz_Arndt|Ernst_Moritz_Arndt| , the publisher Johann Joseph Görres and the Father of Gymnastics Ludwig Jahn.      In 1834 the  |Zollverein|Zollverein|  was established, a customs union between Prussia and most other German states, but excluding Austria. As industrialisation developed, the need for a unified German state with a uniform currency, legal system, and government became more and more obvious.          Growing discontent with the political and social order imposed by the Congress of Vienna led to the outbreak, in 1848, of the  |March_Revolution|Revolutions_Of_1848_In_The_German_States|  in the German states. In May the German National Assembly  met in Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution.     But the 1848 revolution turned out to be unsuccessful:  |King_Frederick_William_IV_of_Prussia|Frederick_William_Iv_Of_Prussia|  refused the imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-established by 1850. Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went to the United States and became a political force there.        The 1850s were a period of extreme political reaction. Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholic during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated  |clericalism|Clericalism|  and  |absolute_divine_monarchy|Divine_Right_Of_Kings| . The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.       In 1857, the Prussian king  |Frederick_William_IV|Frederick_William_Iv_Of_Prussia|  suffered a stroke and his brother  |William|William_I,_German_Emperor|  served as regent until 1861 when he became King William I. Although conservative, William was very pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was the naming of  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  as Prussian minister president in 1862. The cooperation of Bismarck, Defense Minister  |Albrecht_von_Roon|Albrecht_Von_Roon| , and Field Marshal  |Helmut_von_Moltke|Helmut_Von_Moltke|  set the stage for the military victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, that led to the unification of Germany. Holborn, A History of Modern Germany: 1840–1945 pp 131–67 Edgar Feuchtwanger, Bismarck: A Political History pp 83–98     In 1863–64, disputes between Prussia and Denmark over  |Schleswig|Duchy_Of_Schleswig|  escalated, which was not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The conflict led to the  |Second_War_of_Schleswig|Second_War_Of_Schleswig|  in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and occupied  |Jutland|Jutland| . The Danes were forced to cede both the Duchy of Schleswig and the  |Duchy_of_Holstein|Duchy_Of_Holstein|  to Austria and Prussia. The subsequent management of the two duchies led to tensions between Austria and Prussia. Austria wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German Confederation, while Prussia intended to annex them. The disagreement served as a pretext for the  |Seven_Weeks_War|Seven_Weeks_War|  between Austria and Prussia, that broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies clashed at Sadowa-Königgrätz in an  |enormous_battle|Battle_Of_Königgrätz|  involving half a million men. Prussian superior logistics and the modern breech-loading  |needle_guns|Needle_Gun|  superioity over the slow  |muzzle-loading_rifles|Muzzle-Loading_Rifle|  of the Austrians, proved to be elementary for Prussias victory. The battle had also decided the  |struggle_for_hegemony|Austria–Prussia_Rivalry|  in Germany and Bismarck was deliberately lenient with defeated Austria, that was to play only a subordinate role in future German affairs. Holborn, A History of Modern Germany: 1840–1945 pp 167–88 Feuchtwanger, Bismarck: A Political History pp 99–147            After the  |Seven_Weeks_War|Seven_Weeks_War|  the German Confederation was dissolved and the  |North_German_Federation|North_German_Federation|   was established under the leadership of Prussia. Austria was excluded and its immense influence over Germany finally came to an end. The North German Federation was a transitional organisation that existed from 1867 to 1871, between the dissolution of the German Confederation and the founding of the German Empire. Gordon A. Craig, Germany, 1866–1945 pp 11–22                       Chancellor  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  determined the political course of the German Empire until 1890. He fostered alliances in Europe to contain France on the one hand and aspired to consolidate Germanys influence in Europe on the other. His principal domestic policies focused on the suppression of socialism and the reduction of the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church on its adherents. He issued a series of anti-socialist laws in accord with a set of social laws, that included universal health care, pension plans and other social security programs. His  |Kulturkampf|Kulturkampf|  policies were vehemently resisted by Catholics, who organized political opposition in the Center Party. German industrial and economic power had grown to match Britain by 1900.     In 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser  |Wilhelm_II|Wilhelm_Ii_Of_Germany|  became emperor. He rejected advice from experienced politicians and ordered Bismarcks resignation in 1890. He opposed Bismarcks careful and delicate foreign policy and was determined to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for centuries. The Kaiser promoted the active colonization of Africa and Asia for the lands that were not already colonies of other European powers. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe only allied with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and embarked on a dangerous naval arms race with Britain. His aggressive and erroneous policies greatly contributed to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince would spark off  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .              In 1868, the Spanish queen  |Isabella_II|Isabella_Ii|  was deposed in the  |Glorious_Revolution|Glorious_Revolution| , leaving the countrys throne vacant. When Prussia suggested the Hohenzollern candidate,  |Prince_Leopold|Leopold,_Prince_Of_Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|  as successor, France vehemently objected. The matter evolved into a  |diplomatic_scandal|Ems_Dispatch|  and in July 1870, France resolved to end it in a  |full-scale_war|Franco-Prussian_War| . The conflict was quickly decided as Prussia, joined by forces of a pan-German alliance never gave up the tactical initiative. A series of victories in north-eastern France followed and another French army group was simultaneously encircled at Metz. A few weeks later, the French army contingent under Emperor  |Napoleon_IIIs|Napoleon_Iii|  personal command was finally forced to capitulate in the  |fortress_of_Sedan|Battle_Of_Sedan| .   Napoleon was taken prisoner and a  |provisional_government|Government_Of_National_Defence|  hastily proclaimed in Paris. The new government resolved to fight on and tried to reorganize the remaining armies while the Germans settled down to besiege Paris. The starving city surrendered in January 1871 and Jules Favre signed the surrender at Versailles. France was forced to pay indemnities of 5  billion francs and cede  |Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine|  to Germany. This conclusion left the French national psyche deeply humiliated and further aggravated the  |French–German_enmity|French–German_Enmity| .     During the  |Siege_of_Paris|Siege_Of_Paris| , the German princes assembled in the  |Hall_of_Mirrors|Hall_Of_Mirrors|  of the  |Palace_of_Versailles|Palace_Of_Versailles|  on 18 January 1871 and announced the establishment of the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  and proclaimed the Prussian King  |Wilhelm_I|Wilhelm_I_Of_Germany|  as  |German_Emperor|German_Emperor| . The act  |unified_all_ethnic_German_states|Unification_Of_Germany|  with the exception of Austria in the  |Little_German_solution|Lesser_Germany|  of a federal economic, political and administrative unit. Bismarck, was appointed to serve as Chancellor.          The new empire was a  |federal|Federation|  union of 25 states that varied considerably in size, demography, constitution, economy, culture, religion and socio-political development. However, even Prussia itself, which accounted for two-thirds of the territory as well as of the population, had emerged from the empires periphery as a newcomer. It also faced colossal cultural and economic internal divisions. The Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the Rhineland for example had been under French control  |during_the_previous_decades|Confederation_Of_The_Rhine| . The local people, who had benefited from the liberal, civil reforms, that were derived from the ideas of the French Revolution, had only little in common with predominantly rural communities in authoritarian and disjointed  |Junker|Junker|  estates of  |Pommerania|Pommerania| .    The inhabitants of the smaller territorial lands, especially in central and southern Germany greatly rejected the Prussianized concept of the nation and preferred to associate such terms with their individual home state. The Hanseatic port cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck ranked among the most ferocious opponents of the so-called contract with Prussia. As advocates of free trade, they objected Prussian ideas of economic integration and refused to sign the renewed  |Zollverein|Zollverein|  treaties until 1888.  The  |Hanseatic|Hanseatic|  merchants overseas economic success corresponded with their globalist mindset. The citizen of Hamburg, whom Bismark characterized as extremely irritating and the German ambassador in London as the worst Germans we have, were particularly appalled by Prussian militarism and its unopposed growing influence.      The Prusso-German authorities were aware of necessary integration concepts as the results and the 52%  |voter_turnout|Voter_Turnout|  of the  |first_imperial_elections|1871_German_Federal_Election|  had clearly demonstrated. Historians increasingly argue, that the nation-state was forged through empire. National identity was expressed in bombastic imperial  |stone_iconography|Emperor_William_Monuments|  and was to be achieved as an imperial people, with an emperor as head of state and it was to develop imperial ambitions – domestic, European and global.       Bismarcks domestic policies as Chancellor of Germany were based on his effort to universally adopt the idea of the Protestant Prussian state and achieve the clear separation of church and state in all imperial principalities. In the  |Kulturkampf|Kulturkampf|  from 1871 to 1878, he tried to minimize the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and its political arm, the  |Catholic_Centre_Party|Catholic_Centre_Party| , via secularization of all education and introduction of civil marriage, but without success. The Kulturkampf antagonised many Protestants as well as Catholics and was eventually abandoned. The millions of non-German imperial subjects, like the Polish, Danish and French minorities, were left with no choice but to endure discrimination or accept   the policies of  |Germanisation|Germanisation| .         Aristocracy   The new Empire provided attractive top level career opportunities for the national nobility in the various branches of the consular and civil services and the army. As a consequence the aristocratic near total control of the civil sector guaranteed a dominant voice in the decision making in the universities and the churches. The 1914 German diplomatic corps consisted of 8 princes, 29 counts, 20 barons, 54 representants of the lower nobility and a mere 11 commoners. These commoners were indiscriminately recruited from elite industrialist and banking families. The consular corps employed numerous commoners, that however, occupied positions of little to no executive power.  The Prussian tradition to reserve the highest military ranks for young aristocrats was adopted and the new  |constitution|Constitution_Of_The_German_Empire|  put all military affairs under the direct control of the Emperor and beyond control of the Reichstag.  With its large corps of reserve officers across Germany, the military strengthened its role as  The estate which upheld the nation , and historian  |Hans-Ulrich_Wehler|Hans-Ulrich_Wehler|  added:  it became an almost separate, self-perpetuating caste.       Power increasingly was centralized among the 7000 aristocrats, who resided in the national capital of  |Berlin_and_neighboring_Potsdam|Berlin/Brandenburg_Metropolitan_Region| . Berlins rapidly increasing rich middle-class copied the aristocracy and tried to marry into it. A peerage could permanently boost a rich industrial family into the upper reaches of the establishment. Alexandra Richie, Faust’s Metropolis. A History of Berlin p 207. However, the process tended to work in the other direction as the nobility became industrialists. For example, 221 of the 243 mines in Silesia were owned by nobles or by the King of Prussia himself. David Blackbourn, The Long Nineteenth Century: A History of Germany, 1780–1918 p 32.     Middle class   The  |middle_class|Middle_Class|  in the cities grew exponentially, although it never acquired the powerful parliamentary representation and legislative rights as in France, Britain or the United States. The  |Association_of_German_Womens_Organizations_or_BDF|Bund_Deutscher_Frauenvereine|  was established in 1894 to encompass the proliferating womens organizations that had emerged since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a  |bourgeois|Bourgeoisie|  organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome and were organized by the Socialists.      Working class   The rise of the Socialist Workers Party , aimed to peacefully establish a socialist order through the transformation of the existing political and social conditions. From 1878, Bismarck tried to oppose the growing social democratic movement by  |outlawing_the_partys_organisation|Anti-Socialist_Laws| , its assemblies and most of its newspapers. Nonetheless, the Social Democrats grew stronger and Bismarck initiated his  |social_welfare_program|State_Socialism|  in 1883 in order to appease the working class.      Bismarck built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as the 1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical care, and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern  |European_welfare_state|European_Welfare_State| . His paternalistic programs won the support of German industry because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.   Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade.                   Bismarck would not tolerate any power outside Germany—as in Rome—having a say in domestic affairs. He launched the  |Kulturkampf|Kulturkampf|  against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in the state of Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy. The Catholic element, in turn, saw in the  |National-Liberals|National_Liberal_Party|  the worst enemy and formed the  |Center_Party|Centre_Party| . Douglas W. Hatfield, Kulturkampf: The Relationship of Church and State and the Failure of German Political Reform , Journal of Church and State 233 pp. 465–484      Catholics, although nearly a third of the national population, were seldom allowed to hold major positions in the Imperial government, or the Prussian government. After 1871, there was a systematic purge of the remaining Catholics; in the powerful interior ministry, which handled all police affairs, the only Catholic was a messenger boy. Jews were likewise heavily discriminated against. John C.G. Roehl, Higher civil servants in Germany, 1890–1900 in James J.

Journal of Modern History : 647–686. esp. pp. 657–662      Most of the Kulturkampf was fought out in Prussia, but Imperial Germany passed the  |Pulpit_Law|Pulpit_Law|  which made it a crime for any cleric to discuss public issues in a way that displeased the government. Nearly all Catholic bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws and defiantly faced the increasingly heavy penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarcks government. Historian Anthony Steinhoff reports the casualty totals:     As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile  ... Finally, between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies.

Steinhoff, Christianity and the creation of Germany , in Sheridan Gilley and Brian Stanley, eds., Cambridge History of Christianity: Volume 8: 1814–1914 p. 295     Bismarck underestimated the resolve of the Catholic Church and did not foresee the extremes that this struggle would attain. John K. Zeender in The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 43, No. 3 , pp. 328–330. Rebecca Ayako Bennette, Fighting for the Soul of Germany: The Catholic Struggle for Inclusion after Unification The Catholic Church denounced the harsh new laws as anti-Catholic and mustered the support of its rank and file voters across Germany. In the following elections, the Center Party won a quarter of the seats in the Imperial Diet.  The conflict ended after 1879 because Pope Pius IX died in 1878 and Bismarck broke with the Liberals to put his main emphasis on tariffs, foreign policy, and  |attacking_socialists|Anti-Socialist_Laws| . Bismarck negotiated with the conciliatory new pope  |Leo_XIII|Pope_Leo_Xiii| .  Peace was restored, the bishops returned and the jailed clerics were released. Laws were toned down or taken back , but the laws concerning education, civil registry of marriages and religious disaffiliation remained in place. The Center Party gained strength and became an ally of Bismarck, especially when he attacked socialism. Ronald J. Ross, The failure of Bismarcks Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871–1887 .             Chancellor Bismarcks imperial foreign policy basically aimed at security and the prevention of a Franco-Russian alliance, in order to avoid a likely  |Two-front_war|Two-Front_War| . The  |League_of_Three_Emperors|League_Of_Three_Emperors|  was signed in 1873 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that  |republicanism|Republicanism|  and  |socialism|Socialism|  were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. Russia fought a victorious  |war_against_the_Ottoman_Empire|Russo-Turkish_War|  from 1877 to 1878 and attempted to  |establish|Treaty_Of_San_Stefano|  the  |Principality_of_Bulgaria|Principality_Of_Bulgaria| , that was strongly opposed by France and Britain in particular, as they were long concerned with the preservation of the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  and Russian containment at the  |Bosphorus_Strait|Bosphorus_Strait|  and the Black Sea. Germany hosted the  |Congress_of_Berlin|Congress_Of_Berlin|  in 1878, where a more moderate peace settlement was agreed upon.     In 1879, Germany formed the  |Dual_Alliance|Dual_Alliance|  with Austria-Hungary, an agreement of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement of the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance and in 1887, the so-called  |Reinsurance_Treaty|Reinsurance_Treaty|  was signed between Germany and Russia. In it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany or an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy, seeking supporters for its interests in  |North_Africa|North_Africa|  against Frances colonial policy, joined the Dual Alliance, which became the  |Triple_Alliance|Triple_Alliance| . In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French attack.      Bismarck had always argued that the acquisition of overseas colonies was impractical and the burden of administration and maintenance would outweigh the benefits. Eventually, Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established in Africa  and in  |Oceania|Oceania|  . Consequently, Bismarck initiated the  |Berlin_Conference|Berlin_Conference|  of 1885, a formal meeting of the European colonial powers, who sought to established international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory . Its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalisation of the Scramble for Africa and  |New_Imperialism|New_Imperialism|  .               Emperor William I died in 1888. His son  |Frederick_III|Frederick_Iii,_German_Emperor| , open for a more liberal political course, reigned only for ninety-nine days, as he was stricken with throat cancer and died three months after his coronation. His son  |Wilhelm_II|Wilhelm_Ii,_German_Emperor|  followed him on the throne at the age of 29. Wilhelm rejected the liberal ideas of his parents and embarked on a conservative autocratic rule. He early on decided to replace the political elite and in March 1890 he forced chancellor Bismarck into retirement.  Following his principle of Personal Regiment , Wilhelm was determined to exercise maximum influence on all government affairs.  Christopher Clark, Kaiser Wilhelm II pp. 35–47 John C. G. Wilhelm II: the Kaisers personal monarchy, 1888–1900 .          The young  |Kaiser_Wilhelm|Wilhelm_Ii,_German_Emperor|  set out to apply his imperialist ideas of Weltpolitik , as he envisaged a gratuitously aggressive political course to increase the empires influence in and control over the world. After the removal of Bismarck, foreign policies were tackled with by the Kaiser and the Federal Foreign Office under  |Friedrich_von_Holstein|Friedrich_Von_Holstein| . Wilhelms increasingly erratic and reckless conduct was unmistakably related to character deficits and the lack of diplomatic skills. On the Kaisers histrionic personality disorder , see Tipton , pp. 243–245  The foreign offices rather sketchy assessment of the current situation and its recommendations for the empires most suitable course of action were:   First a long-term coalition between France and Russia had to fall apart, secondly, Russia and Britain would never get together, and finally, Britain would eventually seek an alliance with Germany.   Subsequently, Wilhelm refused to renew the  |Reinsurance_Treaty|Reinsurance_Treaty|  with Russia. Russia promptly formed a closer relationship with France in the  |Dual_Alliance_of_1894|Franco-Russian_Alliance| , as both countries were concerned about the novel disagreeability of Germany. Furthermore, Anglo–German relations provided, from a British point of view, no basis for any consensus as the Kaiser refused to divert from his, although somewhat peculiarly desperate and anachronistic, aggressive imperial engagement and the  |naval_arms_race|Anglo-German_Naval_Arms_Race|  in particular. Von Holsteins analysis proved to be mistaken on every point, Wilhelm, however, failed too, as he did not adopt a nuanced political dialogue. Germany was left gradually isolated and dependent on the  |Triple_Alliance|Triple_Alliance|  with Austria-Hungary, and Italy. This agreement was hampered by differences between Austria and Italy and in 1915 Italy left the alliance.      In 1897 Admiral  |Alfred_von_Tirpitz|Alfred_Von_Tirpitz| , state secretary of the  |German_Imperial_Naval_Office|German_Imperial_Naval_Office|  devised his initially rather practical, yet nonetheless  |ambitious_plan|Tirpitz_Plan|  to build a sizeable naval force. Although basically posing only an indirect threat as a  |Fleet_in_being|Fleet_In_Being| , Tirpitz theorized, that its mere existence would force Great Britain, dependend on unrestricted movement on the seas, to agree to diplomatic compromises.  Tirpitz started the program of warship construction in 1898 and enjoyed the full support of Kaiser Wilhelm. Wilhelm entertained less rational ideas on the fleet, that circled around his romantic childhood dream to have a fleet of  own some day and his obsessive adherence to direct his policies along the line of  |Alfred_Thayer_Mahans|Alfred_Thayer_Mahan|  work  |The_Influence_of_Sea_Power_upon_History|The_Influence_Of_Sea_Power_Upon_History| .  In exchange for the eastern African island of  |Zanzibar|Zanzibar| , Germany had bargained the island of  |Heligoland|Heligoland|  in the  |German_Bight|German_Bight|  with Britain in 1890, and converted the island into a naval base and installed immense coastal defense batteries. Britain considered the imperial German endeavours to be a dangerous infringement on the century-old delicate balance of global affairs and trade on the seas under British control. The British, however, resolved to keep up the  |naval_arms_race|Anglo-German_Naval_Arms_Race|  and introduced the highly advanced new  Dreadnought  battleship concept in 1907. Germany quickly adopted the concept and by 1910 the arms race again escalated.       In the  |First_Moroccan_Crisis|First_Moroccan_Crisis|  of 1905, Germany nearly clashed with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. Kaiser Wilhelm II was upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco.      The  |Second_Moroccan_Crisis|Agadir_Crisis|  of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germanys renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. This confirmed French control over Morocco, which became a full protectorate of that country in 1912.           By 1890 the economy continued to industrialize and grow on an even higher rate than during the previous two decades and increased dramatically in the years leading up to World War I. As the growth rates for the individual branches and sectors often varied considerably, and periodical figures provided by the Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt are often disputed or just assessments. Classification and naming of internationally traded commodities and exported goods was still in progress and the structure of production and export had changed during four decades. Published documents provide numbers such as: The proportion of goods manufactured by the modern industry was approximately 25% in 1900, while the proportion of consumer related products in manufactured exports stood at 40%.  Reasonably exact are the figures for the entire industrial production between 1870 and 1914, which increased about 500%.      Historian J. A. Perkins argued that more important than Bismarcks new tariff on imported grain was the introduction of the sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including the use of artificial fertilizers and mechanical tools. Intensive methodical farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were usually small in size and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.          The basics of the modern chemical research laboratory layout and the introduction of essential equipment and instruments such as  |Bunsen_burners|Bunsen_Burner| , the  |Petri_dish|Petri_Dish| , the  |Erlenmeyer_flask|Erlenmeyer_Flask| , task-oriented working principles and team research originated in 19th-century Germany and France. The organisation of knowledge acquisition was further refined by laboratory integration in research institutes of the universities and the industries. Germany acquired the leading role in the worlds  |Chemical_industry|Chemical_Industry|  by the late 19th century through strictly organized methodology. In 1913, the German Chemical industry produced almost 90 percent of the global supply of  |dye|Dye| stuffs and sold about 80 percent of its production abroad.       Germany became Europes leading steel-producing nation in the 1890s, thanks in large part to the protection from American and British competition afforded by tariffs and cartels.  The leading firm was Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp , run by the  |Krupp_family|Krupp| .  The merger of several major firms into the Vereinigte Stahlwerke in 1926 was modeled on the  |U.S._Steel|U.S._Steel|  corporation in the United States. The new company emphasized rationalization of management structures and modernization of the technology; it employed a multi-divisional structure and used return on investment as its measure of success. By 1913, American and German exports dominated the world steel market, as Britain slipped to third place.      In machinery, iron and steel, and other industries, German firms avoided cut-throat competition and instead relied on trade associations. Germany was a world leader because of its prevailing corporatist mentality , its strong bureaucratic tradition, and the encouragement of the government. These associations regulate competition and allowed small firms to function in the shadow of much larger companies.        Germanys unification process after 1871 was heavily dominated by men and give priority to the Fatherland theme and related male issues, such as military prowess. Brigitte Young, Triumph of the fatherland: German unification and the marginalization of women . Nevertheless, middle class women enrolled in the  Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine , the Union of German Feminist Organizations . Founded in 1894, it grew to include 137 separate womens rights groups from 1907 until 1933, when the Nazi regime disbanded the organization.  The BDF gave national direction to the proliferating womens organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists.     Formal organizations for promoting womens rights grew in numbers during the Wilhelmine period. German feminists began to network with feminists from other countries, and participated in the growth of international organizations.             By the 1890s, German colonial expansion in Asia and the Pacific  led to frictions with Britain, Russia, Japan and the United States. John Anthony Moses and Paul M. Kennedy, Germany in the Pacific and Far East, 1870–1914 .

Ethnic demands for nation states upset the balance between the empires that dominated Europe,  |leading_to_World_War_I|Causes_Of_World_War_I| , which started in August 1914. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.     In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, author Paul M. Kennedy recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germanys reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was Londons fear that a repeat of 1870  – when Prussia and the German states smashed France  – would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.        In the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the  |Schlieffen_Plan|Schlieffen_Plan| . But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlins diversion of troops, and very stiff French resistance on the  |Marne|Marne| , north of Paris.     The  |Western_Front|Western_Front|  became an extremely bloody battleground of  |trench_warfare|Trench_Warfare| . The stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germanys overseas access to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by 1917.      The United States joined with the Allies in April 1917. The entry of the United States into the war – following Germanys declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare – marked a decisive turning-point against Germany.        More wide open was the fighting on the  |Eastern_Front|Eastern_Front| . In the east, there were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the  |Battle_of_Tannenberg|Battle_Of_Tannenberg| , followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces – exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917  |Russian_Revolution|Russian_Revolution|  – led to the  |Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk|Treaty_Of_Brest-Litovsk|  the Bolsheviks were forced to sign on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war. It gave Germany control of Eastern Europe. Spencer Tucker says, The German General Staff had formulated extraordinarily harsh terms that shocked even the German negotiator.  When Germany later complained that the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  of 1919 was too harsh on them, the Allies responded that it was more benign than Brest-Litovsk.             By defeating Russia in 1917 Germany was able to bring hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies. By retraining the soldiers in new storm-trooper tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the Battlefield and win a decisive victory before the American army arrived in strength.  However, the spring offensives all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped, and the Germans lacked the reserves necessary to consolidate their gains. In the summer, with the Americans arriving at 10,000 a day, and the German reserves exhausted, it was only a matter of time before multiple Allied offenses destroyed the German army.        Unexpectedly Germany plunged into  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  . It rapidly mobilized its civilian economy for the war effort, the economy was handicapped by the British blockade that cut off food supplies. Feldman, Gerald D. The Political and Social Foundations of Germanys Economic Mobilization, 1914–1916, Armed Forces & Society 31 pp 121–145.      Meanwhile, conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the turnip winter, because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.  Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.     1918 was also the year of the deadly  |1918_Spanish_Flu_pandemic|1918_Flu_Pandemic|  which struck hard at a population weakened by years of malnutrition.            The end of October 1918, in  |Wilhelmshaven|Wilhelmshaven| , in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the  |German_Revolution_of_1918–19|German_Revolution_Of_1918–19| . Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers and soldiers councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat  |Philipp_Scheidemann|Philipp_Scheidemann|  proclaimed a Republic.        On 11 November,  |the_Compiègne_armistice|Armistice_With_Germany|  was signed, ending the war. The  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  was signed on 28 June 1919. Germany was to cede Alsace-Lorraine to France. Eupen-Malmédy would temporarily be ceded to Belgium, with a plebiscite to be held to allow the people the choice of the territory either remaining with Belgium or being returned to German control. Following a plebiscite, the territory was allotted to Belgium on 20 September 1920. The future of  |North_Schleswig|Northern_Schleswig|  was to be decided by plebiscite. In the  |Schleswig_Plebiscites|Schleswig_Plebiscites| , the Danish-speaking population in the north voted for Denmark and the southern, German speaking populace, part voted for Germany. Schleswig was thus partitioned. Holstein remained German without a referendum.  |Memel|Klaipėda|  was ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, to decide the future of the area. On 9 January 1923, Lithuanian forces invaded the territory. Following negotiations, on 8 May 1924, the League of Nations ratified the annexation on the grounds that Lithuania accepted the  |Memel_Statute|Memel_Statute| , a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status. Until 1929, German-Lithuanian co-operation increased and this power sharing arrangement worked. Poland was restored and most of the provinces of  |Posen|Province_Of_Posen|  and  |West_Prussia|West_Prussia| , and some areas of  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia|  were reincorporated into the reformed country after plebiscites and independence uprisings. All German colonies were to be handed over to League of Nations, who then assigned them as  |Mandates|League_Of_Nations_Mandate|  to Australia, France, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. The new owners were required to act as a disinterested trustee over the region, promoting the welfare of its inhabitants in a variety of ways until they were able to govern themselves. The left and right banks of the Rhine were to be permanently demilitarised. The industrially important  |Saarland|Saarland|  was to be governed by the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  for 15 years and its coalfields administered by France. At the end of that time a plebiscite was to determine the Saars future status. To ensure execution of the treatys terms, Allied troops would occupy the left bank of the Rhine for a period of 5–15 years. The German army was to be limited to 100,000 officers and men; the general staff was to be dissolved; vast quantities of war material were to be handed over and the manufacture of munitions rigidly curtailed. The navy was to be similarly reduced, and no military aircraft were allowed. Germany was also required to pay  |reparations|World_War_I_Reparations|  for all civilian damage caused during the war.                   The humiliating peace terms in the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. In December 1918, the  |Communist_Party_of_Germany|Communist_Party_Of_Germany|  was founded, and in 1919 it tried and failed to overthrow the new republic.  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  in 1919 took control of the new  |National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party|National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party|  , which failed in a  |coup_in_Munich_in_1923|Beer_Hall_Putsch| . Both parties, as well as parties supporting the republic, built militant auxiliaries that engaged in increasingly violent street battles. Electoral support for both parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard, producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units. The Nazis , with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933–1945.       On 11 August 1919, the  |Weimar|Weimar_Republic|  constitution came into effect, with  |Friedrich_Ebert|Friedrich_Ebert|  as first President.      On 30 December 1918, the  |Communist_Party_of_Germany|Communist_Party_Of_Germany|  was founded by the  |Spartacus_League|Spartacus_League| , who had split from the Social Democratic Party during the war. It was headed by  |Rosa_Luxemburg|Rosa_Luxemburg|  and  |Karl_Liebknecht|Karl_Liebknecht| , and rejected the parliamentary system. In 1920, about 300,000 members from the  |Independent_Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Independent_Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  joined the party, transforming it into a mass organization. The Communist Party had a following of about 10% of the electorate.           In the first months of 1920, the  |Reichswehr|Reichswehr|  was to be reduced to 100,000 men, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. This included the dissolution of many  |Freikorps|Freikorps|  – units made up of volunteers. In an attempt at a coup détat in March 1920, the  |Kapp_Putsch|Kapp_Putsch| , extreme right-wing politician Wolfgang Kapp let Freikorps soldiers march on Berlin and proclaimed himself Chancellor of the Reich. After four days the coup détat collapsed, due to popular opposition and lack of support by the civil servants and the officers. Other cities were shaken by strikes and rebellions, which were bloodily suppressed.     Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . Under the  |Treaty_of_Rapallo|Treaty_Of_Rapallo,_1922| , Germany accorded the Soviet Union de jure recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.          When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district . The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to  |passive_resistance|Passive_Resistance| |hyperinflation|Hyperinflation| , and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See  |1920s_German_inflation|1920S_German_Inflation| .          In September 1923, the deteriorating economic conditions led Chancellor  |Gustav_Stresemann|Gustav_Stresemann|  to call an end to the passive resistance in the Ruhr. In November, his government introduced a new currency, the  |Rentenmark|German_Rentenmark|  , together with other measures to stop the hyperinflation. In the following six years the economic situation improved. In 1928, Germanys industrial production even regained the pre-war levels of 1913.     The national elections of 1924 led to a swing to the right. Field Marshal  |Paul_von_Hindenburg|Paul_Von_Hindenburg|  was  |elected|1925_German_Presidential_Election|  President in 1925.     In October 1925 the  |Treaty_of_Locarno|Treaty_Of_Locarno|  was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germanys borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germanys admission to the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  in 1926.       The actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 million marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in C bonds were entirely chimerical—a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 was 20 billion  |German_gold_marks|German_Gold_Mark| , worth about US$5 billion or £1 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods like coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicized rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US received $100 million.        The  |Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929|Wall_Street_Crash_Of_1929|  marked the beginning of the worldwide  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , which hit Germany as hard as any nation. In July 1931, the Darmstätter und Nationalbank – one of the biggest German banks – failed. In early 1932, the number of unemployed had soared to more than 6,000,000.     On top of the collapsing economy came a political crisis: the political parties represented in the Reichstag were unable to build a governing majority in the face of escalating extremism from the far right . In March 1930, President Hindenburg appointed  |Heinrich_Brüning|Heinrich_Brüning|  Chancellor, invoking article 48 of Weimars constitution, which allowed him to override the Parliament. To push through his package of austerity measures against a majority of Social Democrats, Communists and the NSDAP , Brüning made use of emergency decrees and dissolved Parliament. In March and April 1932, Hindenburg was re-elected in the  |German_presidential_election_of_1932|1932_German_Presidential_Election| .     The Nazi Party was the largest party in the national elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 it received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the Reichstag. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%. Richard F. Hamilton,  Who Voted for Hitler? Together, the anti-democratic parties of the far right were now able to hold a considerable share of seats in Parliament, but they were at swords point with the political left, fighting it out in the streets. The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the lower middle class in the cities and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former Chancellor  |Franz_von_Papen|Franz_Von_Papen|  and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor.          The Weimar years saw a flowering of  |German_science|German_Science|  and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many renowned scientists and writers to flee.   German recipients dominated the  |Nobel_prizes_in_science|Nobel_Laureates_By_Country| .  Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by  |Hermann_von_Helmholtz|Hermann_Von_Helmholtz| ,  |Wilhelm_Conrad_Röntgen|Wilhelm_Conrad_Röntgen| ,  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein| ,  |Otto_Hahn|Otto_Hahn| ,  |Max_Planck|Max_Planck|  and  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg| . Chemistry likewise was dominated by German professors and researchers at the great chemical companies such as  |BASF|Basf|  and  |Bayer|Bayer|  and persons like  |Justus_von_Liebig|Justus_Von_Liebig| ,  |Fritz_Haber|Fritz_Haber|  and  |Emil_Fischer|Emil_Fischer| . Theoretical mathematicians  |Georg_Cantor|Georg_Cantor|  in the 19th century and  |David_Hilbert|David_Hilbert|  in the 20th century.  |Karl_Benz|Karl_Benz| , the inventor of the automobile, and  |Rudolf_Diesel|Rudolf_Diesel|  were pivotal figures of engineering, and  |Wernher_von_Braun|Wernher_Von_Braun| , rocket engineer.  |Ferdinand_Cohn|Ferdinand_Cohn| ,  |Robert_Koch|Robert_Koch|  and  |Rudolph_Virchow|Rudolph_Virchow|  were three key figures in microbiology.     Among the most important German writers were  |Thomas_Mann|Thomas_Mann|  ,  |Hermann_Hesse|Hermann_Hesse|  and  |Bertolt_Brecht|Bertolt_Brecht|  . The reactionary historian  |Oswald_Spengler|Oswald_Spengler|  wrote  The Decline of the West  on the inevitable decay of Western Civilization, and influenced intellectuals in Germany such as  |Martin_Heidegger|Martin_Heidegger| ,  |Max_Scheler|Max_Scheler| , and the  |Frankfurt_School|Frankfurt_School| , as well as intellectuals around the world.      After 1933, Nazi proponents of  |Aryan_physics|Aryan_Physics| , led by the Nobel Prize-winners  |Johannes_Stark|Johannes_Stark|  and  |Philipp_Lenard|Philipp_Lenard| , attacked Einsteins theory of relativity as a degenerate example of Jewish materialism in the realm of science. Many scientists and humanists emigrated; Einstein moved permanently to the U.S. but some of the others returned after 1945.                       The Nazi regime restored economic prosperity and ended mass unemployment using heavy spending on the military, while suppressing labor unions and strikes. The return of prosperity gave the  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party|  enormous popularity, with only minor, isolated and subsequently unsuccessful cases of  |resistance_among_the_German_population|German_Resistance|  over the 12 years of rule. The  |Gestapo|Gestapo|  under  |Heinrich_Himmler|Heinrich_Himmler|  destroyed the political opposition and persecuted the Jews, trying to force them into exile, while taking their property. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic organizations except the Protestant and Catholic churches. All expressions of public opinion were controlled by Hitlers propaganda minister,  |Joseph_Goebbels|Joseph_Goebbels| , who made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitlers hypnotic speaking. The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its Führer , putting all powers in his hands.  |Nazi_propaganda|Nazi_Propaganda|  centered on Hitler and was quite effective in creating what historians called the Hitler Myth —that Hitler was all-wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention.  In fact Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whoever had his ear. All top officials reported to Hitler and followed his basic policies, but they had considerable autonomy on a daily basis.             In order to secure a majority for his Nazi Party in the Reichstag, Hitler called for new elections. On the evening of 27 February 1933, the  |Reichstag_building_was_set_afire|Reichstag_Fire| . Hitler swiftly blamed an alleged Communist uprising, and convinced President Hindenburg to sign the  |Reichstag_Fire_Decree|Reichstag_Fire_Decree| , which rescinded most German civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges or a court order. Four thousand members of the  |Communist_Party_of_Germany|Communist_Party_Of_Germany|  were arrested. Communist agitation was banned, but at this time not the Communist Party itself. Communists and Socialists were brought into hastily prepared  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camp|  such as  |Kemna_concentration_camp|Kemna_Concentration_Camp| , where they were at the mercy of the  |Gestapo|Gestapo| , the newly established secret police force. Communist Reichstag deputies were taken into  |protective_custody|Protective_Custody|  .        Despite the terror and unprecedented propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed to gave the majority for the NSDAP as Hitler had hoped. Together with the  |German_National_Peoples_Party|German_National_Peoples_Party|  , however, he was able to form a slim majority government. In March 1933, the  |Enabling_Act|Enabling_Act_Of_1933| , an amendment to the  |Weimar_Constitution|Weimar_Constitution| , passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94. To obtain the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill, accommodations were made to the Catholic  |Centre_Party|Centre_Party| , and the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, and the Communists deputies had already been banned. This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag. The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the  |Länder|States_Of_Germany| ; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal  |Weimar|Weimar_Republic|  constitution. Germany left the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations| . The coalition parliament was rigged by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently, in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a quid pro quo with the  |Pope|Holy_See|  under the anti-communist  |Pope_Pius_XI|Pope_Pius_Xi|  for the  Reichskonkordat ; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi Party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. According to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932.  The Communist Party was proscribed in April 1933.     Thereafter, the Chief of Staff of the SA,  |Ernst_Röhm|Ernst_Röhm| , demanded more political and military power for he and his men, which caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler used the  |SS|Schutzstaffel|  and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership—along with a number of Hitlers political adversaries . It became known as the  |Night_of_the_Long_Knives|Night_Of_The_Long_Knives|  and took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. As a reward, the SS became an independent organisation under the command of the  Reichsführer-SS  Heinrich Himmler. He would rise to become Chief of German Police in June 1936 and already had control over the concentration camps system. Upon Hindenburgs death on 2 August 1934, Hitlers cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Chancellor and Führer .             The Nazi regime was particularly hostile towards Jews, who became the target of unending  |antisemitic|Antisemitic|  propaganda attacks. The Nazis attempted to convince the German people to view and treat Jews as subhumans  and immediately after winning almost 44% of parliamentary seats in the  |1933_federal_elections|March_1933_German_Federal_Election|  the Nazis imposed a nationwide  |boycott_of_Jewish_businesses|Nazi_Boycott_Of_Jewish_Businesses| . In March 1933 the first official  |Nazi_concentration_camp|Nazi_Concentration_Camp|  was established at  |Dachau|Dachau_Concentration_Camp|  in  |Bavaria|Bavaria|  and from 1933 to 1935 the Nazi regime consolidated their power. The  |Law_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Professional_Civil_Service|Law_For_The_Restoration_Of_The_Professional_Civil_Service|  passed on 7 April 1933, which forced all Jewish civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service. The  |Nuremberg_Laws_of_1935|Nuremberg_Laws|  ban sexual relations between Jews and Germans and only those of German or related blood were eligible to be considered citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights. This stripped Jews, Roma and others of their legal rights. Jews continued to suffer persecution under the Nazi regime, exemplified by the  |Kristallnacht_pogrom|Kristallnacht|  of 1938, and about half of Germanys 500,000 Jews fled the country before 1939, after which escape became almost impossible.      In 1941, the Nazi leadership decided to implement a plan that they called the  |Final_Solution|Final_Solution|  which came to be known as the  |Holocaust|Holocaust| . Under the plan, Jews and other lesser races along with political opponents from Germany as well as  |occupied_countries|German–Occupied_Europe|  were systematically murdered at murder sites,  |German_concentration_camps|German_Concentration_Camps| , and starting in 1942, at  |extermination_camps|Extermination_Camps| .  Between 1941 and 1945 Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically disabled and members of other groups were targeted and methodically murdered – the origin of the word  |genocide|Genocide|  . In total approximately 11 million people were killed during the Holocaust including 1.1 million children.           In 1935, Hitler officially re-established the  |Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe|  and reintroduced universal military service. This was in breach of the Treaty of Versailles; Britain, France and Italy issued notes of protest. Hitler had the officers swear their personal allegiance to him.  In 1936 German troops  |marched_into_the_demilitarised_Rhineland|Remilitarization_Of_The_Rhineland| . As the territory was part of Germany, the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war. The move strengthened Hitlers standing in Germany. His reputation swelled further with the  |1936_Summer_Olympics|1936_Summer_Olympics| , which were held in the same year in Berlin, and proved another great propaganda success for the regime as orchestrated by master propagandist  |Joseph_Goebbels|Joseph_Goebbels| .        Historians have paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| .  It appears the role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically the Nazis advocated a  |patriarchal|Patriarchal|  society in which the German woman would recognise that her world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home . However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Hitler came to power in 1933, feminist groups were shut down or incorporated into the  |National_Socialist_Womens_League|National_Socialist_Womens_League| , which coordinated groups throughout the country to promote feminine virtues, motherhood and household activities. Courses were offered on childrearing, sewing and cooking. The Nazi regime did promote a liberal code of conduct regarding heterosexual relations among Germans and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock. The  Lebensborn  association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes where single mothers could be accommodated during their pregnancies.     As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women under the age of fifty were required to register with the employment office for work assignments to help the war effort. Womens wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.  In 1944–45 more than 500,000 women were volunteer uniformed auxiliaries in the German armed forces . About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses, and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy.  In the Luftwaffe they served in auxiliary roles helping to operate the anti-aircraft systems that shot down Allied bombers.               Hitlers diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  , rejected the  |Versailles_Treaty|Versailles_Treaty|  and began to re-arm , won back the Saar , remilitarized the Rhineland , formed an alliance with Mussolinis Italy , sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War , annexed Austria , took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with  |Joseph_Stalins|Joseph_Stalin|  Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in Europe began.     After establishing the Rome-Berlin axis with  |Benito_Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini| , and signing the  |Anti-Comintern_Pact|Anti-Comintern_Pact|  with Japan  – which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937  – Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered  |Vienna|Vienna| , he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation  of their country Austria to the  |German_Reich|German_Reich| . After Austria, Hitler turned to  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , where the 3.5  million-strong  |Sudeten_German|Sudeten_German|  minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the  |Munich_Conference|Munich_Agreement|  of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister  |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain|  and French Prime Minister  |Édouard_Daladier|Édouard_Daladier|  agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| . Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reichs territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between  |Slovaks|Slovak_People|  and  |Czechs|Czechs|  as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the  |Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia|Protectorate_Of_Bohemia_And_Moravia| . In the same month, he secured the return of  |Memel|Klaipėda_Region|  from  |Lithuania|Lithuania|  to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of  |appeasement|Appeasement|  towards Hitler had failed.             At first Germany was very successful in its military operations, including the invasions of  |Poland|Poland|  ,  |Norway|Norway|  , the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  , and  |France|Battle_Of_France|  in 1940. The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitlers popularity and an upsurge in war fever. Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  in July 1940, but Churchill, remained dogged in his defiance. Churchill had major financial, military, and diplomatic help from President  |Franklin_D._Roosevelt|Franklin_D._Roosevelt|  in the U.S. Hitlers emphasis on maintaining a higher living standard postponed the full mobilization of the national economy until 1942. Germanys armed forces  |invaded_the_Soviet_Union|Operation_Barbarossa|  in June 1941  – weeks behind schedule due to the  |invasion_of_Yugoslavia|Invasion_Of_Yugoslavia|   – but swept forward until they reached the gates of Moscow.        The tide began to turn in December 1941, when the invasion of the Soviet Union hit determined resistance in the  |Battle_of_Moscow|Battle_Of_Moscow|  and Hitler declared war on the United States in the wake of the Japanese  |Pearl_Harbor_attack|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor| . After surrender in  |North_Africa|North_African_Campaign|  and losing the  |Battle_of_Stalingrad|Battle_Of_Stalingrad|  in 1942–43, the Germans were forced into the defensive. By late 1944, the United States, Canada, France, and Great Britain were closing in on Germany in the West, while the Soviets were victoriously advancing in the East. Overy estimated in 2014 that in all about 353,000 civilians were killed by British and American strategic bombing of German cities, and nine million left homeless. Richard Overy,  The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940–1945 pp 306–7     Nazi Germany collapsed as Berlin was taken by the Red Army in a fight to the death on the city streets. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945. The final  |German_Instrument_of_Surrender|German_Instrument_Of_Surrender|  was signed on 8 May 1945.     By September 1945, Nazi Germany and its  |Axis|Axis_Powers|  partners had all been defeated, chiefly by the forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain. Much of Europe lay in ruins, over 60 million people worldwide had been killed , including approximately 6 million Jews and 5 million non-Jews in what became known as the  |Holocaust|Holocaust| . World War II resulted in the destruction of Germanys political and economic infrastructure and led directly to its partition, considerable loss of territory , and historical legacy of guilt and shame.              As a consequence of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and the onset of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  in 1947, the country was split between the two global blocs in the East and West, a period known as the division of Germany. Millions of refugees from Central and Eastern Europe moved west, most of them to West Germany. Two countries emerged:  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  was a parliamentary democracy, a  |NATO|Nato|  member, a founding member of what since became the  |European_Union|European_Union|  as one of the worlds largest economies and under allied military control until 1955,  while  |East_Germany|East_Germany|  was a totalitarian Communist dictatorship controlled by the Soviet Union that was a satellite of Moscow. With the collapse of Communism in 1989,  |reunion_on_West_Germanys_terms_followed.|Reunification_Of_Germany|      No one doubted Germanys economic and engineering prowess; the question was how long bitter memories of the war would cause Europeans to distrust Germany, and whether Germany could demonstrate it had rejected totalitarianism and militarism and embraced democracy and human rights.              The total of  |German_war_dead|World_War_Ii_Casualtiesthird_Reich|  was 8% to 10% out of a prewar population of 69,000,000, or between 5.5 million and 7 million people. This included 4.5 million in the military, and between 1 and 2 million civilians. There was chaos as 11 million foreign workers and POWs left, while 14 million displaced refugees from the east and soldiers returned home.  During the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , the  |West_German|West_German|  government estimated a death toll of 2.2 million civilians due to the  |flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans|  and through  |forced_labour_in_the_Soviet_Union|Forced_Labor_Of_Germans_In_The_Soviet_Union| .   This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s, when some historians put the death toll at 500,000–600,000 confirmed deaths. Robert Bard, Historical Memory and the expulsion of ethnic Germans in Europe, 1944  In 2006 the German government reaffirmed its position that 2.0–2.5 million deaths occurred.        At the  |Potsdam_Conference|Potsdam_Conference| , Germany was  |divided_into_four_military_occupation_zones|Partitions_Of_Germany|  by the Allies and did not regain independence until 1949. The provinces east of the Oder and Neisse rivers  were transferred to Poland, Lithuania,  and Russia ; the 6.7 million Germans living in Poland and the 2.5 million in Czechoslovakia were forced to move west, although most had already left when the war ended. . Most had left is p. 158       |Denazification|Denazification|  removed, imprisoned, or executed most top officials of the old regime, but most middle and lower ranks of civilian officialdom were not seriously affected. In accordance with the Allied agreement made at the  |Yalta_conference|Yalta_Conference|  millions of POWs were used as  |forced_labor|Foreign_Forced_Labor_In_The_Soviet_Union|  by the Soviet Union and other European countries.      In the East, the Soviets crushed dissent and imposed another police state, often employing ex-Nazis in the dreaded  |Stasi|Stasi| . The Soviets extracted about 23% of the East German GNP for reparations, while in the West reparations were a minor factor.      In 1945–46 housing and food conditions were bad, as the disruption of transport, markets, and finances slowed a return to normal. In the West, bombing had destroyed the fourth of the housing stock, 2.3 million units out of 9.5 million were destroyed. and over 10 million refugees from the east had crowded in, most living in camps.  Food production in 1946–48 was only two-thirds of the prewar level, while grain and meat shipments – which usually supplied 25% of the food – no longer arrived from the East. Furthermore, the end of the war brought the end of large shipments of food seized from occupied nations that had sustained Germany during the war. Coal production was down 60%, which had cascading negative effects on railroads, heavy industry, and heating.  Industrial production fell more than half and reached prewar levels only at the end of 1949.      Allied economic policy originally was one of  |industrial_disarmament|Industrial_Plans_For_Germany|  plus building the agricultural sector. In the western sectors, most of the industrial plants had minimal bomb damage and the Allies dismantled 5% of the industrial plants for reparations.      However, deindustrialization became impractical and the U.S. instead called for a strong industrial base in Germany so it could stimulate European economic recovery.  The U.S. shipped food in 1945–47 and made a $600 million loan in 1947 to rebuild German industry. By May 1946 the removal of machinery had ended, thanks to lobbying by the U.S. Army. The Truman administration finally realised that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent. Washington decided that an orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.  For US and Allied official policy statements see U.S. Dept. of State Germany, 1947–1949: The Story in Documents – available ; these are primary sources.     In 1945 the occupying powers took over all newspapers in Germany and purged them of Nazi influence. The American occupation headquarters, the Office of Military Government, United States began its own newspaper based in Munich, Die Neue Zeitung. It was edited by German and Jewish émigrés who fled to the United States before the war. Its mission was to encourage democracy by exposing Germans to how American culture operated. The paper was filled with details on American sports, politics, business, Hollywood, and fashions, as well as international affairs.              In 1949 the western half of the Soviet zone became the Deutsche Demokratische Republik – DDR , under control of the Socialist Unity Party. Neither country had a significant army until the 1950s, but East Germany built the  |Stasi|Stasi|  into a powerful secret police that infiltrated every aspect of the society.      East Germany was an  |Eastern_bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  state under political and military control of the Soviet Union through her occupation forces and the  |Warsaw_Treaty|Warsaw_Pact| . Political power was solely executed by leading members  of the communist-controlled  |Socialist_Unity_Party|Socialist_Unity_Party_Of_Germany|  . A Soviet-style  |command_economy|Command_Economy|  was set up; later the GDR became the most advanced  |Comecon|Comecon|  state. While  |East_German_propaganda|Communist_Propaganda|  was based on the benefits of the GDRs social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.       |Walter_Ulbricht|Walter_Ulbricht|  was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary of the Socialist Unity party in 1950.  Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall|  to stop them – shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the Anti-Fascist Protective Wall was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse.   Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969–70, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbrichts détente policies toward the West.     The transition to  |Erich_Honecker|Erich_Honecker|   led to a change in the direction of national policy and efforts by the Politburo to pay closer attention to the grievances of the proletariat.  |Honeckers|Erich_Honecker|  plans were not successful, however, with the dissent growing among East Germanys population.     In 1989, the socialist regime collapsed after 40 years, despite its omnipresent secret police, the  |Stasi|Stasi| . Main reasons for the collapse include severe economic problems and growing emigration towards the West.     East Germanys culture was shaped by Communism and particularly Stalinism. It was characterized by East German psychoanalyst Hans-Joachim Maaz in 1990 as having produced a Congested Feeling among Germans in the East as a result of Communist policies criminalizing personal expression that deviates from government approved ideals, and through the enforcement of Communist principals by physical force and intellectual repression by government agencies, particularly the Stasi.  Critics of the East German state have claimed that the states commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical tool of a ruling elite. This argument has been challenged by some scholars who claim that the Party was committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress. However, the vast majority regarded the states Communist ideals to be nothing more than a deceptive method for government control.     According to German historian  |Jürgen_Kocka|Jürgen_Kocka|  :   :Conceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies. Massive evidence has been collected that proves the repressive, undemocratic, illiberal, nonpluralistic character of the GDR regime and its ruling party.                In 1949, the three western  |occupation_zones|Allied-Occupied_Germany|  were combined into the Federal Republic of Germany . The government was formed under Chancellor  |Konrad_Adenauer|Konrad_Adenauer|  and his conservative CDU/CSU coalition. The  |Christian_Social_Union|Christian_Social_Union_Of_Bavaria|  or CSU is the Bavaria branch of the CDU. It has always operated in close collaboration with the CDU, and the CDU/CSU is usually treated as a single party in national affairs. The CDU/CSU was in power during most of the period since 1949. The capital was  |Bonn|Bonn|  until it was moved to Berlin in 1990. In 1990 FRG absorbed East Germany and gained full sovereignty over Berlin. At all points West Germany was much larger and richer than East Germany, which became a dictatorship under the control of the Communist Party and was closely monitored by Moscow. Germany, especially Berlin, was a cockpit of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , with NATO and the Warsaw Pact assembling major military forces in west and east. However, there was never any combat. Jürgen Weber, Germany, 1945–1990: A Parallel History           West Germany enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s .  Industrial production doubled from 1950 to 1957, and gross national product grew at a rate of 9 or 10% per year, providing the engine for economic growth of all of Western Europe. Labor unions supported the new policies with postponed wage increases, minimized strikes, support for technological modernization, and a policy of  |co-determination|Co-Determination|  , which involved a satisfactory grievance resolution system as well as requiring representation of workers on the boards of large corporations.  The recovery was accelerated by the  |currency_reform_of_June_1948|D-Markcurrency_Reform_Of_June_1948| , U.S. gifts of $1.4 billion as part of the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan| , the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the opening of the global market.  West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis.     West Germany played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined  |NATO|Nato|  in 1955 and was a founding member of the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community|  in 1958.            The most dramatic and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948.  Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new  |Deutsche_Mark|Deutsche_Mark|  at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan|  money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.     In addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls , and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had turned a corner.     The success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and  |West_Berlin|West_Berlin| . This was the  |Berlin_Blockade|Berlin_Blockade| , which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well. The city thereby became economically integrated into West Germany.            |Konrad_Adenauer|Konrad_Adenauer|  was the dominant leader in West Germany.  He was the first chancellor of the FRG, 1949–63, and until his death was the founder and leader of the Christian Democratic Union , a coalition of conservatives,  |ordoliberals|Ordoliberalism| , and adherents of Protestant and  |Catholic_social_teaching|Catholic_Social_Teaching|  that dominated West Germany politics for most of its history. During his chancellorship, the West Germany economy grew quickly, and West Germany established friendly relations with France, participated in the emerging  |European_Union|European_Union| , established the countrys armed forces , and became a pillar of  |NATO|Nato|  as well as firm ally of the United States. Adenauers government also commenced the long process of reconciliation with the Jews and  |Israel|Israel|  after the Holocaust.         |Ludwig_Erhard|Ludwig_Erhard|  was in charge of economic policy as economics director for the British and American occupation zones and was Adenauers long-time economics minister. Erhards decision to lift many price controls in 1948 , plus his advocacy of free markets, helped set the Federal Republic on its strong growth from wartime devastation.  Norbert Walter, a former chief economist at  |Deutsche_Bank|Deutsche_Bank| , argues that Germany owes its rapid economic advance after World War II to the system of the Social Market Economy, established by Ludwig Erhard. . Quote from p. 64  Erhard was politically less successful when he served as the CDU Chancellor from 1963 until 1966. Erhard followed the concept of a  |social_market_economy|Social_Market_Economy| , and was in close touch with professional economists. Erhard viewed the market itself as social and supported only a minimum of welfare legislation. However, Erhard suffered a series of decisive defeats in his effort to create a free, competitive economy in 1957; he had to compromise on such key issues as the anti-cartel legislation. Thereafter, the West German economy evolved into a conventional west European welfare state.      Meanwhile, in adopting the  |Godesberg_Program|Godesberg_Program|  in 1959, the  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  largely abandoned Marxism ideas and embraced the concept of the  |market_economy|Market_Economy|  and the welfare state. Instead it now sought to move beyond its old working class base to appeal the full spectrum of potential voters, including the middle class and professionals. Labor unions  |cooperated|Social_Corporatism|  increasingly with industry, achieving labor representation on corporate boards and increases in wages and benefits.           In 1966 Erhard lost support and  |Kurt_Kiesinger|Kurt_Kiesinger|  was elected as Chancellor by a new CDU/CSU- |SPD|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  alliance combining the two largest parties. Socialist leader  |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt|  was Deputy Federal Chancellor and Foreign Minister. The Grand Coalition lasted 1966–69 and is best known for reducing tensions with the Soviet bloc nations and establishing diplomatic relations with  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| ,  |Romania|Romania|  and  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| .          With a booming economy short of unskilled workers, especially after the Berlin Wall cut off the steady flow of East Germans, the FRG negotiated migration agreements with Italy , Spain , Greece , and Turkey that brought in hundreds of thousands of temporary guest workers, called  Gastarbeiter . In 1968 the FRG signed a guest worker agreement with Yugoslavia that employed additional guest workers. Gastarbeiter were young men who were paid full-scale wages and benefits, but were expected to return home in a few years.      The agreement with Turkey ended in 1973 but few workers returned because there were few good jobs in Turkey.  By 2010 there were about 4 million people of Turkish descent in Germany. The generation born in Germany attended German schools, but had a poor command of either German or Turkish, and had either low-skilled jobs or were unemployed. . In  |Project_MUSE|Project_Muse| |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt|  was the leader of the  |Social_Democratic_Party|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  in 1964–87 and West German Chancellor in 1969–1974. Under his leadership, the German government sought to reduce tensions with the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and improve relations with the  |German_Democratic_Republic|German_Democratic_Republic| , a policy known as the  Ostpolitik . Relations between the two German states had been icy at best, with propaganda barrages in each direction. The heavy outflow of talent from East Germany prompted the building of the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall|  in 1961, which worsened  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  tensions and prevented East Germans from travel. Although anxious to relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, Brandts Ostpolitik was intent on holding to its concept of two German states in one German nation.     Ostpolitik was opposed by the conservative elements in Germany, but won Brandt an international reputation and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.  In September 1973, both West and East Germany were admitted to the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| . The two countries exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East Germanys leader  |Erich_Honecker|Erich_Honecker|  paid an  |official_state_visit|Erich_Honeckers_1987_Visit_To_West_Germany|  to West Germany.              After 1973, Germany was hard hit by a worldwide economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and stubbornly high unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975. The  |Ruhr|Ruhr|  region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for the large number of unemployed workers, and many factories reduced their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items. After 1990 the Ruhr moved into service industries and high technology. Cleaning up the heavy air and water pollution became a major industry in its own right. Meanwhile, formerly rural Bavaria became a high-tech center of industry.     A spy scandal forced Brandt to step down as Chancellor while remaining as party leader. He was replaced by  |Helmut_Schmidt|Helmut_Schmidt|  , of the SPD, who served as Chancellor in 1974–1982. Schmidt continued the Ostpolitik with less enthusiasm. He had a  |PhD|Phd|  in economics and was more interested in domestic issues, such as reducing  |inflation|Inflation| . The debt grew rapidly as he borrowed to cover the cost of the ever more expensive welfare state.  After 1979, foreign policy issues grew central as the Cold War turned hot again. The German peace movement mobilized hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to protest against American deployment in Europe of new  |medium-range_ballistic_missiles|Medium-Range_Ballistic_Missile| . Schmidt supported the deployment but was opposed by the left wing of the SPD and by Brandt.     The pro-business  |Free_Democratic_Party|Free_Democratic_Party|  had been in coalition with the SPD, but now it changed direction.  Led by Finance Minister  |Otto_Graf_Lambsdorff|Otto_Graf_Lambsdorff|  the FDP adopted the market-oriented Kiel Theses in 1977; it rejected the Keynesian emphasis on consumer demand, and proposed to reduce social welfare spending, and try to introduce policies to stimulate production and facilitate jobs. Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself solve both the social problems and the financial problems. As a consequence, the FDP switched allegiance to the CDU and Schmidt lost his parliamentary majority in 1982. For the only time in West Germanys history, the government fell on a  |vote_of_no_confidence|Vote_Of_No_Confidence| . For a primary source see Helmut Schmidt,  Men and Power: A Political Retrospective           |Helmut_Kohl|Helmut_Kohl|  brought the conservatives back to power with a  |CDU/CSU-FDP_coalition|Cabinet_Kohl_I|  in 1982, and served as Chancellor until 1998. After repeated victories in 1983, 1987, 1990 and 1994 he was finally defeated by a landslide that was the biggest on record, for the left in the  |1998_federal_elections|1998_German_Federal_Election| , and was succeeded as Chancellor by  |Gerhard_Schröder|Gerhard_Schröder|  of the SPD. Kohl is best known for orchestrating reunification with the approval of all the Four Powers from World War II, who still had a voice in German affairs.                During the summer of 1989, rapid changes known as peaceful revolution or  Die Wende  took place in East Germany, which quickly led to  |German_reunification|German_Reunification| . Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated to West Germany, many via Hungary after Hungarys reformist government opened its borders. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals, most notably in Prague. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and  |mass_demonstrations_in_several_cities|Monday_Demonstrations_In_East_Germany|  continued to grow.     Unable to stop the growing civil unrest,  |Erich_Honecker|Erich_Honecker|  was forced to resign in October, and on 9 November, East German authorities unexpectedly allowed East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany. Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity; new crossing points were opened in the Berlin Wall and along the border with West Germany. This led to the acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that ended with the  |German_reunification|German_Reunification|  that came into force on 3 October 1990. For primary sources in English translation and a brief survey see Konrad H. Jarausch, and Volker Gransow, eds. Uniting Germany: Documents and Debates, 1944–1993                      The SPD in coalition with the Greens won the elections of 1998. SPD leader  |Gerhard_Schröder|Gerhard_Schröder|  positioned himself as a  |centrist|Centrist| |Third_Way|Third_Way|  candidate in the mold of  |British_Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  and  |United_States_President|President_Of_The_United_States| |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton| .     Schröder, in March 2003, reversed his position and proposed a significant downsizing of the welfare state, known as  |Agenda_2010|Agenda_2010| . He had enough support to overcome opposition from the trade unions and the SPDs left wing. Agenda 2010 had five goals: tax cuts; labor market deregulation, especially relaxing rules protecting workers from dismissal and setting up  |Hartz_concept|Hartz_Concept|  job training; modernizing the welfare state by reducing entitlements; decreasing bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses; and providing new low-interest loans to local governments.      On 26 December 2004 during a  |Christmas_holiday|Christmas_Day|  and  |Boxing_Day|Boxing_Day|  celebration, a several thousands of  |Germans|Germans|  in  |Thailand|Thailand|  and the other part across the region of  |South|South_Asia|  and  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia|  were  |affected_by_the_catastrophic_tsunami|Countries_Affected_By_The_2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake|  from the  |magnitude_9.0_earthquake|2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake_And_Tsunami|  off the  |Indonesia|Indonesia| n islands west coast of  |Sumatra|Sumatra| , and many thousands are lost of German lives. A memorial service held at  |Berlin_Cathedral|Berlin_Cathedral|  and  |Bundestag|Bundestag|  on 20 January 2005. On behalf of all  |Germans|Germans| .     On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the  |Christian_Democratic_Union|Christian_Democratic_Union|  in  |North_Rhine-Westphalia|North_Rhine-Westphalia| ,  |Gerhard_Schröder|Gerhard_Schröder|  announced he would call federal elections as soon as possible . A  |motion_of_confidence|Motion_Of_Confidence|  was subsequently defeated in the  |Bundestag|Bundestag|  on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 , after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the neo-communist  |Party_of_Democratic_Socialism|Party_Of_Democratic_Socialism|  agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election, with Schröders rival  |Oskar_Lafontaine|Oskar_Lafontaine|  leading the new group.       From 2005 to 2009, Germany was ruled by a  |grand_coalition|Grand_Coalition|  led by the CDUs  |Angela_Merkel|Angela_Merkel|  as chancellor. Since the  |2009_elections|2009_German_Federal_Election| , Merkel has headed a centre-right government of the CDU/CSU and FDP.           Together with France and other EU states, Germany has played the leading role in the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Germany  was one of the main supporters of admitting many East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schröder expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the  |UN_Security_Council|Un_Security_Council| , identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germanys bid. Germany formally adopted the Euro on 1 January 1999 after permanently fixing the Deutsche Mark rate on 31 December 1998.       Since 1990, the German  |Bundeswehr|Bundeswehr|  has participated in a number of peacekeeping and disaster relief operations abroad. Since 2002, German troops formed part of the  |International_Security_Assistance_Force|International_Security_Assistance_Force|  in the  |war_in_Afghanistan|War_In_Afghanistan| , resulting in the first German  |casualties|German_Armed_Forces_Casualties_In_Afghanistan|  in combat missions since World War II.     In  |the_worldwide_economic_recession|Late-2000S_Recession|  that began in 2008, Germany did relatively well. However, the economic instability of Greece and several other EU nations in 2010–11 forced Germany to reluctantly sponsor a massive financial rescue.     In the wake of the 2011 natural disaster to the nuclear industry in  |Japan|Japan|  following its  |9.0_magnitude_earthquake_and_tsunami|2011_Tohoku_Earthquake_And_Tsunami| , German public opinion turned sharply against  |nuclear_power_in_Germany|Nuclear_Power_In_Germany| , which produces a fourth of the electricity supply. In response Merkel has announced plans to close down the nuclear system over the next decade, and to rely even more heavily on wind and other alternative energy sources, in addition to coal and natural gas.  For further information, see  |Germany_in_2011|Germany_In_2011| .     Germany was affected by the  |European_migrant_crisis|European_Migrant_Crisis|  in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from  |Africa|Africa|  and the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  entering the EU. The country took in over a million refugees and migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density.  The decision by Merkel to authorize unrestricted entry led to heavy criticism in Germany as well as within Europe.                   A major historiographical debate about the German history concerns the Sonderweg, the alleged special path that separated German history from the normal course of historical development, and whether or not Nazi Germany was the inevitable result of the Sonderweg. Proponents of the Sonderweg theory such as  |Fritz_Fischer|Fritz_Fischer|  point to such events of the  |Revolution_of_1848|Revolution_Of_1848| , the  |authoritarianism|Authoritarianism|  of the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar and Nazi periods. Opponents such as  |Gerhard_Ritter|Gerhard_Ritter|  of the Sonderweg theory argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples, and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there was much debate within the supporters of the Sonderweg concept as for the reasons for the Sonderweg, and whether or not the Sonderweg ended in 1945. Was there a Sonderweg? Winkler says:   : For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germanys deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a unique German path. And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the normal path. Heinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West.
