Robinson, The Coins from the Ephesian Artemision Reconsidered, Journal of Hellenic Studies 71 , p. 159. The most prolific mint for early electrum coins was Sardis which produced large quantities of the lion head thirds, sixths and twelfths along with lion paw fractions.  To complement the largest denomination, fractions were made, including a hekte , hemihekte , and so forth down to a 96th, with the 1/96 stater weighing only about 0.15  grams.
