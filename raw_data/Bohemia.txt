                 Bohemia  is the westernmost and largest  |historical_region|Historical_Region|  of the  |Czech_lands|Czech_Lands|  in the present-day  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic| . In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including  |Moravia|Moravia|  and  |Czech_Silesia|Czech_Silesia| , The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05 especially in a historical context, such as the  |Lands_of_the_Bohemian_Crown|Lands_Of_The_Bohemian_Crown|  ruled by  |Bohemian_kings|List_Of_Bohemian_Monarchs| .     Bohemia was a  |duchy|Duchy_Of_Bohemia|  of  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia| , later an independent principality, a  |kingdom|Kingdom_Of_Bohemia|  in the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , and subsequently a part of the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  and the  |Austrian_Empire|Austrian_Empire| . Jiří Pehe:  After  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and the establishment of an  |independent_Czechoslovak_state|History_Of_Czechoslovakia| , the total of Bohemia became a part of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , defying claims of the German speaking inhabitants that regions with German speaking majority should be included in the  |Republic_of_German-Austria|Republic_Of_German-Austria| . Between 1938 and 1945, these border regions were joined to  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  as the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland| .      The remainder of Czech territory became the  |Second_Czechoslovak_Republic|Second_Czechoslovak_Republic|  and was subsequently occupied as the  |Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia|Protectorate_Of_Bohemia_And_Moravia| . In 1969, the Czech lands were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the  |Czech_Socialist_Republic|Czech_Socialist_Republic| . In 1990, the name was changed to the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic| , which became a separate state in 1993 with the  |breakup_of_Czechoslovakia|Breakup_Of_Czechoslovakia| .     Until 1948, Bohemia was an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia as one of its lands . Since then, administrative reforms have replaced self-governing lands with a modified system of regions which do not follow the borders of the historical Czech lands . Petr Jeřábek: , Deník.cz, 2 January 2014,  However, the three lands are mentioned in the preamble of the  |Constitution_of_the_Czech_Republic|Constitution_Of_The_Czech_Republic| , 1/1993 Sb.     Bohemia had an area of  and today is home to approximately 6.5 million of the Czech Republics 10.5 million inhabitants. Bohemia was bordered in the south by  |Upper|Upper_Austria|  and  |Lower_Austria|Lower_Austria|  , in the west by  |Bavaria|Bavaria|  and in the north by  |Saxony|Saxony|  and  |Lusatia|Lusatia|  , in the northeast by  |Silesia|Silesia|  , and in the east by  |Moravia|Moravia|  . Bohemias borders were mostly marked by mountain ranges such as the  |Bohemian_Forest|Bohemian_Forest| , the  |Ore_Mountains|Ore_Mountains| , and the  |Krkonoše|Krkonoše| , a part of the  |Sudetes|Sudetes|  range; the Bohemian-Moravian border roughly follows the  |Elbe|Elbe| - |Danube|Danube| |watershed|European_Watershed| .       In the 2nd century BC, the  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  were competing for dominance in  |northern_Italy|Northern_Italy|  with various peoples including the  |Gauls|Gauls| -Celtic tribe  |Boii|Boii| . The Romans defeated the Boii at the  |Battle_of_Placentia|Battle_Of_Placentia|  and the  |Battle_of_Mutina|Battle_Of_Mutina| . Afterward, many of the Boii retreated north across the Alps. Collis, John. The Celts: Origins, Myth and Inventions. Tempus Publishing, 2003.  Much later Roman authors refer to the area they had once occupied  as Boiohaemum. The earliest mention was by  |Tacitus|Tacitus|   Germania  28 ,  and later mentions of the same name are in Strabo and  |Velleius_Paterculus|Velleius_Paterculus| .  The name appears to include the tribal name Boi- plus the  |Germanic|Proto-Germanic_Language|  element haimaz home , indicating a Proto-Germanic Bajōhaimaz.   Boiohaemum was apparently isolated to the area where King  |Marobods|Marobod|  kingdom was centred, within the  |Hercynian_forest|Hercynian_Forest| . Byzantine Emperor  |Constantine_VII|Constantine_Vii|  in his 10th century work  De Administrando Imperio  also mentioned the region as Boïki .          The Czech name Čechy is derived from the name of the  |Slavic|Slavs| |ethnic_group|Ethnic_Group| , the  |Czechs|Czechs| , who settled in the area during the 6th or 7th century AD.                 Bohemia, like neighbouring  |Bavaria|Bavaria| , is named after the  |Boii|Boii| , a large  |Celtic_nation|Celtic_Nations|  known to the Romans for their migrations and settlement in northern Italy and other places. Another part of the nation moved west with the  |Helvetii|Helvetii|  into southern France, which was one of the events leading to the interventions of Julius Caesars Gaulish campaign of 58 BC. The emigration of the Helvetii and Boii left southern Germany and Bohemia a lightly inhabited desert into which  |Suebi|Suebi| c peoples arrived, speaking Germanic languages, and became dominant over remaining Celtic groups. To the south, over the Danube, the Romans extended their empire, and to the southeast, in present-day Hungary, were  |Dacian|Dacians|  peoples.     In the area of modern Bohemia the  |Marcomanni|Marcomanni|  and other Suebic groups were led by their king,  |Marobodus|Marobodus| , after they had suffered defeat to Roman forces in Germany. He took advantage of the natural defenses provided by its mountains and forests. They were able to maintain a strong alliance with neighbouring tribes including the  |Lugii|Lugii| ,  |Quadi|Quadi| ,  |Hermunduri|Hermunduri| ,  |Semnones|Semnones| , and  |Buri|Buri| , which was sometimes partly controlled by the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  and sometimes in conflict with it; for example, in the 2nd century, they fought  |Marcus_Aurelius|Marcus_Aurelius| .     In late classical times and the early  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , two new Suebic groupings appeared to the west of Bohemia in southern Germany, the  |Alemanni|Alemanni|  , and the Bavarians . Many Suebic tribes from the Bohemian region took part in such movements westwards, even settling as far away as Spain and Portugal. With them were also tribes who had pushed from the east, such as the  |Vandals|Vandals| , and  |Alans|Alans| .     Other groups pushed southwards towards  |Pannonia|Pannonia| . The last known mention of the kingdom of the Marcomanni, concerning a queen named  |Fritigil|Fritigil| , is from the 4th century, and she was thought to have lived in or near Pannonia. The Suebian  |Langobardi|Langobardi| , who moved over many generations from the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| , via the Elbe and Pannonia to Italy, recorded in a  |tribal_history|Origo_Gentis_Langobardorum|  a time spent in Bainaib .     After the  |Migration_Period|Migration_Period| , Bohemia was partially repopulated around the 6th century, and eventually  |Slavic|Slavic_Peoples|  tribes arrived from the east, and their language began to replace the older Germanic, Celtic and  |Sarmatian|Sarmatians|  ones. These are precursors of todays  |Czechs|Czech_People| , but the exact amount of Slavic immigration is a subject of debate. The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves. The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic  |Lombards|Lombards|  left Bohemia . Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by  |Samos|Samo|  tribal confederation. His death marked the end of the old Slavonic confederation, the second attempt to establish such a Slavonic union after  |Carantania|Carantania|  in  |Carinthia|Carinthia| .     Other sources  divide the population of Bohemia into the Merehani, Marharaii, Beheimare and Fraganeo. . Christianity first appeared in the early 9th century but became dominant only much later, in the 10th or 11th century.     The 9th century was crucial for the future of Bohemia. The  |manorial_system|Manorialism|  sharply declined, as it did in Bavaria. The influence of the central Fraganeo-Czechs grew, as a result of the important cultic centre in their territory. They were Slavic-speaking and thus contributed to the transformation of diverse neighbouring populations into a new nation named and led by them with a united slavic ethnic consciousness. Petr Charvát: Zrod Českého státu March 2007, , in Czech               Bohemia was made a part of the early Slavic state of  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia| , under the rule of  |Svatopluk_I|Svatopluk_I|  . After Svatopluks death Great Moravia was weakened by years of internal conflict and constant warfare, ultimately collapsing and fragmenting because of the continual incursions of the invading nomadic  |Magyars|Magyars| . Bohemias initial incorporation into the Moravian Empire resulted in the extensive  |Christianization_of_the_population|Christianization_Of_Bohemia| . A native monarchy arose to the throne, and Bohemia came under the rule of the  |Přemyslid_dynasty|Přemyslid_Dynasty| , which would rule the Czech lands for the next several hundred years.     The Přemyslids secured their frontiers from the remnant Asian interlocurs, after the collapse of the Moravian state, by entering into a state of semi-vassalage to the Frankish rulers. The alliance was facilitated by Bohemias conversion to Christianity, in the 9th century. Continuing close relations were developed with the East  |Frankish|Franks|  kingdom, which devolved from the  |Carolingian|Carolingians|  Empire, into  |East_Francia|East_Francia| , eventually becoming the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .     After a decisive victory of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia over invading Magyars in the 955  |Battle_of_Lechfeld|Battle_Of_Lechfeld| ,  |Boleslaus_I|Boleslav_I_Of_Bohemia|  of Bohemia was granted the  |Moravia|Moravia|  by German emperor  |Otto_the_Great|Otto_The_Great| . Bohemia would remain a largely autonomous state under the Holy Roman Empire for several decades. The jurisdiction of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  was definitively reasserted when  |Jaromír_of_Bohemia|Jaromir,_Duke_Of_Bohemia|  was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor  |King_Henry_II|Henry_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  of the Holy Roman Empire, with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004, ending the rule of  |Boleslaw_I_of_Poland|Boleslaw_I_Of_Poland| .     The first to use the title of King of Bohemia were the Přemyslid dukes  |Vratislav_II|Vratislav_Ii_Of_Bohemia|  and  |Vladislav_II|Vladislaus_Ii,_Duke_And_King_Of_Bohemia|  , but their heirs would return to the title of  |duke|Duke| . The title of king became hereditary under  |Ottokar_I|Ottokar_I_Of_Bohemia|  . His grandson  |Ottokar_II|Ottokar_Ii_Of_Bohemia|  conquered a short-lived empire which contained modern  |Austria|Austria|  and  |Slovenia|Slovenia| . The mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial German immigration as the court sought to replace losses from the brief  |Mongol_invasion_of_Europe|Mongol_Invasion_Of_Europe|  in 1241. Germans settled primarily along the northern, western, and southern borders of Bohemia, although many lived in towns throughout the kingdom.             The  |House_of_Luxembourg|House_Of_Luxembourg|  accepted the invitation to the Bohemian throne with the marriage to the Premyslid heiress, Elizabeth and the crowning subsequent of  |John_I_of_Bohemia|John_I_Of_Bohemia|  in 1310. His son,  |Charles_IV|Charles_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  became King of Bohemia in 1346. He founded  |Charles_University_in_Prague|Charles_University_In_Prague| , central Europes first university, two years later.     His reign brought Bohemia to its peak both politically and in total area, resulting in his being the first King of Bohemia to also be elected as  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| . Under his rule the  |Bohemian_crown|Bohemian_Crown|  controlled such diverse lands as  |Moravia|Moravia| ,  |Silesia|Silesia| ,  |Upper_Lusatia|Upper_Lusatia|  and  |Lower_Lusatia|Lower_Lusatia| , Brandenburg, an area around  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg|  called New Bohemia,  |Luxembourg|Luxembourg| , and several small towns scattered around Germany.     From the 13th century on, settlements of Germans developed throughout Bohemia, making Bohemia a bilingual country. The German settlers particularly brought mining technology to the mountainous regions of the  |Sudetes|Sudetes| . In the mining town of Sankt Joachimsthal , famous coins called Joachimsthalers were coined, which gave their name to the  |Thaler|Thaler|  and the  |dollar|Dollar| .     Meanwhile,  |Prague_German|Prague_German|  intermediated between  |Upper_German|Upper_German|  and  |East_Central_German|East_Central_German| , influencing the foundations of modern standard German. At the same time and place, the teachings of  |Jan_Hus|Jan_Hus| , the  |rector|Rector|  of Charles University and a prominent reformer and religious thinker, influenced the rise of modern Czech.          During the ecumenical  |Council_of_Constance|Council_Of_Constance|  in 1415,  |Jan_Hus|Jan_Hus|  was sentenced to be burnt at the stake as a  |heretic|Heresy| . The verdict was passed despite the fact that Hus was granted formal protection by Emperor  |Sigismund_of_Luxembourg|Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  prior to the journey. Hus was invited to attend the council to defend himself and the Czech positions in the religious court, but with the emperors approval, he was executed on 6 July 1415. The execution of Hus, as well as five consecutive papal  |crusades|Crusades|  against followers of Hus, forced the Bohemians to defend themselves in the  |Hussite_Wars|Hussite_Wars| .     The uprising against imperial forces was led by a former mercenary,  |Jan_Žižka|Jan_Žižka|  of Trocnov. As the leader of the Hussite armies, he used innovative tactics and weapons, such as howitzers, pistols, and fortified wagons, which were revolutionary for the time, and established Žižka as a great general who never lost a battle.     After Žižkas death,  |Prokop_the_Great|Prokop_The_Great|  took over the command for the army, and under his lead the Hussites were victorious for another ten years, to the sheer terror of Europe. The Hussite cause gradually splintered into two main factions, the moderate  |Utraquists|Utraquism|  and the more fanatic  |Taborites|Taborite| . The  |Utraquists|Utraquists|  began to lay the groundwork for an agreement with the Catholic Church and found the more radical views of the Taborites distasteful. Additionally, with general  |war-weariness|War-Weariness|  and yearning for order, the Utraquists were able to eventually defeat the Taborites in the  |Battle_of_Lipany|Battle_Of_Lipany|  in 1434. Sigismund said after the battle that only the Bohemians could defeat the Bohemians.     Despite an apparent victory for the Catholics, the Bohemian Utraquists were still strong enough to negotiate  |freedom_of_religion|Freedom_Of_Religion|  in 1436. That happened in the so-called  |Compacts_of_Basel|Compacts_Of_Basel| , declaring peace and freedom between Catholics and Utraquists. It lasted for only a short period of time, as  |Pope_Pius_II|Pope_Pius_Ii|  declared the compacts to be invalid in 1462.     In 1458,  |George_of_Podebrady|George_Of_Podebrady|  was elected to ascend to the Bohemian throne. He is remembered for his attempt to set up a pan-European Christian League , which would form all the states of Europe into a community based on religion. In the process of negotiating, he appointed  |Leo_of_Rozmital|Leo_Of_Rozmital|  to tour the European courts and to conduct the talks. However, the negotiations were not completed because Georges position was substantially damaged over time by his deteriorating relationship with the Pope.             After the death of King  |Louis_II_of_Hungary_and_Bohemia|Louis_Ii_Of_Hungary_And_Bohemia|  in the  |Battle_of_Mohács|Battle_Of_Mohács|  in 1526, Archduke  |Ferdinand_I|Ferdinand_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  of  |Austria|Habsburg_Monarchy|  became the new King of Bohemia and the country became a constituent state of the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy| .     Bohemia enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period. In 1609, Holy Roman Emperor  |Rudolph_II|Rudolf_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , who made Prague again the capital of the  |Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  at the time, himself a Roman Catholic, was moved by the Bohemian nobility to publish Maiestas Rudolphina, which confirmed the older Confessio Bohemica of 1575.     After Emperor  |Matthias_II|Matthias,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and then King of Bohemia  |Ferdinand_II|Ferdinand_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  began oppressing the rights of Protestants in Bohemia, the resulting  |Bohemian_Revolt|Bohemian_Revolt|  led to outbreak of the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War|  in 1618. Elector  |Frederick_V|Frederick_V,_Elector_Palatine|  of the  |Electorate_of_the_Palatinate|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate| , a  |Calvinist|Calvinist| |Protestant|Protestant| , was elected by the Bohemian nobility to replace Ferdinand on the Bohemian throne, and was known as the  |Winter_King|Winter_King| . Fredericks wife, the popular  |Elizabeth_Stuart|Elizabeth_Of_Bohemia|  and subsequently Elizabeth of Bohemia, known as the Winter Queen or Queen of Hearts, was the daughter of King  |James_VI_of_Scotland|James_Vi_Of_Scotland| .     After Fredericks defeat in the  |Battle_of_White_Mountain|Battle_Of_White_Mountain|  in 1620, 27 Bohemian estates leaders together with  |Jan_Jesenius|Jan_Jesenius| , rector of the  |Charles_University|Charles_University|  of Prague were executed on the Pragues Old Town Square on 21 June 1621 and the rest were exiled from the country; their lands were then given to Catholic loyalists . That ended the pro-reformation movement in Bohemia and also ended the role of Prague as ruling city of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .     In the so-called renewed constitution of 1627, the German language was established as a second official language in the Czech lands. Czech formally remained the first language in the kingdom, but both German and Latin were widely spoken among the ruling classes although German became increasingly dominant, and Czech was spoken in much of the countryside.     The formal independence of Bohemia was further jeopardized when the Bohemian  |Diet|Diet|  approved administrative reform in 1749. It included the indivisibility of the  |Habsburg_Empire|Habsburg_Monarchyrulers_Of_The_Habsburg_Monarchy,_1526–1918|  and the centralization of rule, which essentially meant the merging of the Royal Bohemian Chancellery with the Austrian Chancellery.     At the end of the 18th century, the  |Czech_National_Revival|Czech_National_Revival|  movement, in cooperation with part of the Bohemian aristocracy, started a campaign for restoration of the kingdoms historic rights, whereby the Czech language was to regain its historical role and replace German as the language of administration. The  |enlightened_absolutism|Enlightened_Absolutism|  of  |Joseph_II|Joseph_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and  |Leopold_II|Leopold_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , who introduced minor language concessions, showed promise for the Czech movement, but many of these reforms were later rescinded. During the  |Revolution_of_1848|Revolutions_Of_1848_In_The_Habsburg_Areas| , many Czech nationalists called for autonomy for Bohemia from Habsburg Austria, but the revolutionaries were defeated. The old Bohemian Diet, one of the last remnants of the independence, was dissolved, although the Czech language experienced a rebirth as  |romantic_nationalism|Romantic_Nationalism|  developed among the Czechs, so that in particular  |Prague|Prague|  ceased to have the German speaking majority it had for centuries.     In 1861, a new elected Bohemian Diet was established. The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown  became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy , while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution .     After the defeat of Austria in the  |Austro-Prussian_War|Austro-Prussian_War|  in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the  |Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867|Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_Of_1867| , ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. An attempt by the Czechs to create a tripartite monarchy failed in 1871. The state rights program remained the official platform of all Czech political parties until 1918.     Under the state rights program , appealing to the stability of Bohemias borders over many centuries, the Czech emancipation movement claimed the right to the whole of the Bohemian lands over the Germans right to the lands, amounting to a third of Bohemia, where they formed the majority.                After  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , Bohemia became the core of the newly formed country of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , which combined Bohemia,  |Moravia|Moravia| ,  |Czech_Silesia|Czech_Silesia| ,  |Upper_Hungary|Upper_Hungary|   and  |Carpathian_Ruthenia|Carpathian_Ruthenia|  into one state. Preclík, Vratislav.

Under its first president,  |Tomáš_Masaryk|Tomáš_Masaryk| , Czechoslovakia became a liberal democratic republic but serious issues emerged regarding the Czech majoritys relationship with the native  |German|Sudeten_Germans|  and Hungarian minorities. The  |German_Bohemians|Sudeten_Germans|  had demanded that the regions with German speaking majority be included in a  |German_state|Republic_Of_German-Austria| .     Following the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement|  in 1938, the border regions of Bohemia historically inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans  were annexed to  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| . The remnants of Bohemia and Moravia were then annexed by Germany in 1939, while the Slovak lands became the separate  |Slovak_Republic|Slovak_Republic| , a puppet state of  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| . From 1939 to 1945 Bohemia, , together with Moravia formed the German  |Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia|Protectorate_Of_Bohemia_And_Moravia|  .     Any open opposition to German occupation was brutally suppressed by the Nazi authorities and many Czech patriots were executed as a result. In 1942, Nazi forces murdered the population of a whole village  |Lidice|Lidice_Massacre| . After  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  ended in 1945, after initial plans to cede lands to Germany or to create German-speaking cantons had been abandoned, the vast majority the Bohemian Germans were  |expelled|Expulsion_Of_Germans_From_Czechoslovakia_After_World_War_Ii|  by force by the order of the re-established Czechoslovak central government, based on the  |Potsdam_Agreement|Potsdam_Agreement|  that acquiesced in large-scale  |ethnic_cleansing|Ethnic_Cleansing| . The Bohemian Germans property was confiscated by the Czech authorities and amounted, according to contemporary estimates, to a third of the Czechoslovak national income. Germans who were valued for their skills were allowed to stay to pass on their knowledge to the Czech migrants. The expulsion severely depopulated the area and from then on, locales were referred to in only their Czech equivalents regardless of their previous demographic makeup. The re-settlement of the formerly German-settled areas allowed many poorer people to acquire property, thus equalizing the Czechoslovak society.     The Communist Party won the most votes in free elections but not a  |simple_majority|Majority| .  |Klement_Gottwald|Klement_Gottwald| , the communist leader, became Prime Minister of a coalition government.      In February 1948 the non-communist members of the government resigned in protest against arbitrary measures by the communists and their Soviet protectors in many of the states institutions. Gottwald and the communists responded with a coup détat and installed a pro-Soviet authoritarian state. In 1949, Bohemia ceased to be an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia, as the country was divided into administrative regions that did not follow the historical borders.     In 1989,  |Agnes_of_Bohemia|Agnes_Of_Bohemia|  became the first saint from a  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe| an country to be canonized by  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii|  before the  |Velvet_Revolution|Velvet_Revolution|  later that year.     After the  |Velvet_Divorce|Velvet_Divorce|  in 1993, the territory of Bohemia remained in the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic| . The new  |Constitution_of_the_Czech_Republic|Constitution_Of_The_Czech_Republic|  provided for higher administrative units to be established, providing for the possibility of Bohemia as an administrative unit, but did not specify the form they would take. A constitutional act in 1997 rejected the restoration of self-governing historical Czech lands and decided for the regional system that has been in use since 2000.   |Petr_Pithart|Petr_Pithart| , former Czech prime minister and president of the  |Senate|Senate_Of_The_Parliament_Of_The_Czech_Republic|  at the time, remained one of the main advocates of the land system, Petr Zídek: , Lidovky.cz, 17 October 2015, interview with Petr Pithart claiming that the primary reason for its refusal was the fear of possible Moravian separatism.     Bohemia thus remains a  |historical_region|Historical_Region| , and its administration is divided between the Prague,  |Central_Bohemia|Central_Bohemian_Region| ,  |Plzeň|Pilsen_Region| ,  |Karlovy_Vary|Carlsbad_Region| ,  |Ústí_nad_Labem|Ústí_Nad_Labem_Region| ,  |Liberec|Liberec_Region| , and  |Hradec_Králové|Hradec_Králové_Region| |Regions|Regions_Of_The_Czech_Republic| , as well as parts of the  |Pardubice|Pardubice_Region| ,  |Vysočina|Vysočina_Region| ,  |South_Bohemian|South_Bohemian_Region| ,  |Olomouc|Olomouc_Region|  and  |South_Moravian_Regions|South_Moravian_Region| . In addition to their use in the names of the regions, the historical land names remain in use in names of municipalities, cadastral areas, railway stations , List of railway stations, České dráhy – seek for v Čechách , na Moravě , Český , České , Moravský , Moravské etc. or geographical names.  , KČT Tábor The distinction and border between the Czech lands is also preserved in  |local_dialects|Czech_Language| .          The area around  |Kłodzko|Kłodzko|   in south-western  |Poland|Poland|  was culturally and traditionally a part of Bohemia, and was settled by German speakers like neighboring Sudentenland.  |Kłodzko_Land|Kłodzko_Land|  has now been a part of  |Lower_Silesia|Lower_Silesia|  since its conquest by the  |Kingdom_of_Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  in 1763. Referred to as Little  |Prague|Prague|  , the  |Kłodzko_Valley|Kłodzko_Valley|  region on the  |Nysa_Kłodzka|Nysa_Kłodzka|  river was the focus of several attempts to reincorporate the area into  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , one of several  |Polish–Czechoslovak_border_conflicts|Polish–Czechoslovak_Border_Conflicts| .     The last attempt occurred in May 1945 when  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  tried to annex the area, whose German speaking majority was being  |expelled_by_Polish_authorities|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans_From_Poland_During_And_After_World_War_Ii| . The Czech argued that because of the small  |Czech|Czechs|  minority present in the western part of the  |Kłodzko_Valley|Kłodzko_Valley| , which was called the regions  |Czech_Corner|Czech_Corner|  by the German majority, the area should go over to Czechoslovakia instead of being assigned to Poland, as no relevant Polish minority lived in the area.
