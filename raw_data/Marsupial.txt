        Marsupials are any members of the  |mammal|Mammal| ian  |infraclass|Class|  Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to  |Australasia|Australasia|  and the  |Americas|Americas| . A distinctive characteristic common to these  |species|Species|  is that most of the young are carried in a  |pouch|Pouch| . Well-known marsupials include  |kangaroos|Kangaroo| ,  |wallabies|Wallaby| ,  |koalas|Koala| ,  |phalangeriformes|Phalangeriformes| ,  |opossums|Opossum| ,  |wombats|Wombat| , and  |Tasmanian_devils|Tasmanian_Devil| . Some lesser-known marsupials are the  |dunnarts|Dunnart| ,  |potoroos|Potoroo| ,  |cuscus|Cuscus| es and  |thylacine|Thylacine| .   Marsupials represent the  |clade|Clade|  originating from the  |last_common_ancestor|Last_Common_Ancestor|  of extant  |metatheria|Metatheria| ns. Like other mammals in the Metatheria, they give birth to relatively undeveloped young that often reside in a pouch located on their mothers’ abdomen for a certain amount of time. Close to 70% of the 334  |extant|Extant_Taxon|  species occur on the  |Australian_continent|Australia|  . The remaining 30% are found in the Americas — primarily in  |South_America|South_America| , but thirteen in  |Central_America|Central_America| , and  |one|Virginia_Opossum|  in North America, north of Mexico.     The word marsupial comes from  marsupium , the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from Latin and ultimately from the ancient Greek  , meaning pouch .            Marsupials are taxonomically identified as members of  |mammal|Mammal| ian  |infraclass|Infraclass|  Marsupialia, first  |described|Scientific_Description|  as a family under the order Pollicata by German zoologist  |Johann_Karl_Wilhelm_Illiger|Johann_Karl_Wilhelm_Illiger|  in his 1811 work Prodromus Systematis Mammalium et Avium. However, James Rennie, author of The Natural History of Monkeys, Opossums and Lemurs , pointed out that the placement of five different groups of mammals -  |monkeys|Monkey| ,  |lemurs|Lemur| ,  |tarsiers|Tarsier| ,  |aye_ayes|Aye_Aye|  and marsupials - under a single order did not appear to have a strong justification. In 1816, French zoologist  |George_Cuvier|George_Cuvier|  classified all marsupials under the order Marsupialia.   In 1997, researcher J. A. W. Kirsch and others accorded infraclass rank to Marsupialia. There are two primary divisions: American marsupials  and Australian marsupials .          Marsupialia is further divided as follows:     † - Extinct     Superorder  |Ameridelphia|Ameridelphia| |_Didelphimorphia|Didelphimorphia|    Family  |Didelphidae|Didelphidae| |Paucituberculata|Paucituberculata|    Family  |Caenolestidae|Caenolestidae| |shrew_opossums|Shrew_Opossum|    Superorder  |Australidelphia|Australidelphia| |_Microbiotheria|Microbiotheria|    Family  |Microbiotheriidae|Microbiotheriidae| |monito_del_monte|Monito_Del_Monte| |_Yalkaparidontia|Yalkaparidontia|     Order  |Dasyuromorphia|Dasyuromorphia|    Family † |Thylacinidae|Thylacinidae| |thylacine|Thylacine| |_Dasyuridae|Dasyuridae| |antechinus|Antechinus| es,  |quolls|Quoll| ,  |dunnarts|Dunnart| ,  |Tasmanian_devil|Tasmanian_Devil| , and relatives   Family  |Myrmecobiidae|Myrmecobiidae| |numbat|Numbat| |_Notoryctemorphia|Notoryctemorphia|    Family  |Notoryctidae|Notoryctidae| |marsupial_moles|Marsupial_Mole|    Order  |Peramelemorphia|Peramelemorphia|    Family  |Thylacomyidae|Thylacomyidae| |bilbies|Bilby| |pig_footed_bandicoots|Pig_Footed_Bandicoot|    Family  |Peramelidae|Peramelidae| |bandicoots|Bandicoot|  and allies   Order  |Diprotodontia|Diprotodontia|    Suborder  |Vombatiformes|Vombatiformes| |_Vombatidae|Vombatidae| |wombats|Wombat|    Family  |Phascolarctidae|Phascolarctidae| |koalas|Koala|    Family † |Diprotodontidae|Diprotodontidae| |Giant_wombats|Diprotodontidae| |_Palorchestidae|Palorchestidae| |Marsupial_tapirs|Palorchestidae| |_Thylacoleonidae|Thylacoleonidae| |marsupial_lions|Thylacoleonidae| |_Phalangeriformes|Phalangeriformes| |_Acrobatidae|Acrobatidae| |feathertail_glider|Feathertail_Glider|  and  |feather_tailed_possum|Feather_Tailed_Possum| |_Burramyidae|Burramyidae| |pygmy_possums|Pygmy_Possum|    Family † |Ektopodon|Ektopodon| tidae:  |sprite_possums|Sprite_Possum|    Family  |Petauridae|Petauridae| |striped_possum|Striped_Possum| ,  |Leadbeaters_possum|Leadbeaters_Possum| ,  |yellow_bellied_glider|Yellow_Bellied_Glider| ,  |sugar_glider|Sugar_Glider| ,  |mahogany_glider|Mahogany_Glider| ,  |squirrel_glider|Squirrel_Glider| |_Phalangeridae|Phalangeridae| |brushtail_possums|Brushtail_Possum|  and  |cuscus|Cuscus| es   Family  |Pseudocheiridae|Pseudocheiridae| |ringtailed_possums|Common_Ringtail_Possum|  and relatives   Family  |Tarsipedidae|Tarsipedidae| |honey_possum|Honey_Possum| |_Macropodiformes|Macropodiformes| |_Macropodidae|Macropodidae| |kangaroos|Kangaroo| ,  |wallabies|Wallaby| , and relatives   Family  |Potoroidae|Potoroidae| |potoroos|Potoroo| , rat kangaroos,  |bettongs|Bettong|    Family  |Hypsiprymnodontidae|Hypsiprymnodontidae| |musky_rat_kangaroo|Musky_Rat_Kangaroo| |_Balbaridae|Balbaridae| |phylogenetic|Phylogeny|  relationships among the different marsupial orders. Studies differ on whether Didelphimorphia or Paucituberculata is the  |sister_group|Sister_Taxon|  to all other marsupials. Though the order  |Microbiotheria|Microbiotheria|   is found in South America, morphological similarities suggest it is closely related to Australian marsupials.  Molecular analyses in 2010 and 2011 identified Microbiotheria as the sister group to all Australian marsupials. However, the relations among the four Australidelphid orders are not as well understood. The  |cladogram|Cladogram|  below, depicting the relationships among the various marsupial orders, is based on a 2015 phylogenetic study.           DNA evidence supports a South American origin for marsupials, with Australian marsupials arising from a single  |Gondwana|Gondwana| n migration of marsupials from South America to Australia.   There are many small  |arboreal|Arboreal|  species in each group. The term  |opossum|Opossum|  is used to refer to American species , while  |similar_Australian_species|Phalangeriformes|  are properly called possums .            Marsupials have the typical characteristics of  |mammals|Mammal| —e.g., mammary glands, three  |middle_ear_bones|Middle_Ear| , and true  |hair|Hair| . There are, however, striking differences as well as a number of anatomical features that separate them from  |Eutheria|Eutheria| ns.     In addition to the front  |pouch|Pouch| , which contains multiple  |teats|Teat|  for the sustenance of their young, marsupials have other common structural features.  |Ossified|Ossification| |patellae|Patella|  are absent in most modern marsupials  and  |epipubic_bones|Epipubic_Bone|  are present. Marsupials  also lack a gross communication  between the right and left brain hemispheres.       The skull has peculiarities in comparison to placental mammals. In general, the skull is relatively small and tight. Holes  are located in the front of the orbit. The cheekbone is enlarged and extends further to the rear. The angular extension  of the lower jaw is bent toward the center. Another feature is the hard palate which, in contrast to the placental mammals foramina, always have more openings. The teeth differ from that of placental mammals, so that all  |taxa|Taxon|  except  |wombats|Wombat|  have a different number of incisors in the upper and lower jaws. The early marsupials had a dental formula from 5/4 - 1/1 - 3/3 - 4/4, that is, per pine half; they have five maxilla or four mandibular incisors, one canine, three premolars and four molars, for a total of 50 teeth. Some taxa, such as the  |opossum|Opossum| , have the original number of teeth. In other groups the number of teeth is reduced. The dental formula for  |Macropodidae|Macropodidae|  is 3/1 - /0 - 2/2 - 4/4. Marsupials in many cases have 40 to 50 teeth, significantly more than placental mammals. The upper jaw has a high number of incisors, up to ten, and they have more molars than premolars. The second set of teeth grows in only at the 3rd premolar: all remaining teeth are already created as permanent teeth.       Few general characteristics describe their skeleton. In addition to details in the construction of the ankle, bones  are characteristic, two from the pubic bone of the pelvis, which is a forwardly projecting bone. Since these are present in males and pouchless species, it is believed that they originally had nothing to do with reproduction, but served in the muscular approach to the movement of the hind limbs. This could be explained by an original feature of mammals, as these  |epipubic_bones|Epipubic_Bone|  are also found in  |monotremes|Monotreme| . Marsupial reproductive organs differ from the placental mammals. For them, the reproductive tract is doubled. The females have two uteri and two vaginas, and before birth, a birth canal forms between them, the median vagina. The males have a split or double penis lying in front of the scrotum.     A pouch is present in most, but not all, species. Many marsupials have a permanent bag, whereas in others the pouch develops during gestation, as with the  |shrew_opossum|Shrew_Opossum| , where the young are hidden only by skin folds or in the fur of the mother. The arrangement of the pouch is variable to allow the offspring to receive maximum protection. Locomotive kangaroos have a pouch opening at the front, while many others that walk or climb on all fours have the opening in the back. Usually, only females have a pouch, but the male  |water_opossum|Water_Opossum|  has a pouch that is used to accommodate his genitalia while swimming or running.          Marsupials have adapted to many habitats, reflected in the wide variety in their build. The largest living marsupial, the  |red_kangaroo|Red_Kangaroo| , grows up to 1.8m in height and  in weight, but extinct genera, such as  Diprotodon , were significantly larger and heavier. The smallest members of this group are the  |marsupial_mice|Marsupial_Mice| , which often reach only  in body length.     Some species resemble placental mammals and are examples of  |convergent_evolution|Convergent_Evolution| . The extinct  Thylacine  strongly resembled the placental wolf, hence its nickname Tasmanian wolf . Flying and the associated ability to glide occurred both with marsupials  and some placental mammals , which developed independently. Other groups such as the kangaroo, however, do not have clear placental counterparts, though they share similarities in lifestyle and ecological niches with  |ruminants|Ruminant| .     Reproductive system        Marsupials reproductive systems differ markedly from  |those_of_placental_mammals|Mammalian_Reproductive_System| .  During embryonic development, a  |choriovitelline_placenta|Choriovitelline_Placenta|  forms in all marsupials. In  |bandicoots|Bandicoots| , an additional  |chorioallantoic_placenta|Chorioallantoic_Placenta|  forms, although it lacks the  |chorionic_villi|Chorionic_Villi|  found in  |eutherian|Eutherian|  placentas.     The evolution of reproduction in marsupials, and speculation about the ancestral state of  |mammalian_reproduction|Mammalian_Reproduction| , have engaged discussion since the end of the 19th century. Both sexes possess a  |cloaca|Cloaca| , which is connected to a urogenital sac used to store waste before expulsion. The  |bladder|Urinary_Bladder|  of marsupials functions as a site to concentrate urine and empties into the common urogenital sinus in both females and males.          Male reproductive system   Most male marsupials, except for  |macropods|Macropodidae|   and  |marsupial_moles|Marsupial_Mole| ,      E. D. Cope   The American Naturalist   Vol. 26, No. 302 , pp. 121–128 have a bifurcated penis, separated into two columns, so that the penis has two ends corresponding to the females two vaginas.
