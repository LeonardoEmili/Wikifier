      Sulawesi , formerly known as Celebes , is one of the four  |Greater_Sunda_Islands|Greater_Sunda_Islands| . It is governed by  |Indonesia|Indonesia| . The  |worlds_eleventh-largest_island|List_Of_Islands_By_Area| , it is situated east of  |Borneo|Borneo| , west of the  |Maluku_Islands|Maluku_Islands| , and south of  |Mindanao|Mindanao|  and the  |Sulu_Archipelago|Sulu_Archipelago| . Within Indonesia, only  |Sumatra|Sumatra| ,  |Borneo|Borneo|  and  |Papua|Papua|  are larger in territory, and only  |Java|Java|  and Sumatra have larger populations.     The landmass of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas: the northern  |Minahasa_Peninsula|Minahassa_Peninsula| ; the  |East_Peninsula|East_Peninsula,_Sulawesi| ; the  |South_Peninsula|South_Peninsula,_Sulawesi| ; and the  |Southeast_Peninsula|Southeast_Peninsula,_Sulawesi| . Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: the  |Gulf_of_Tomini|Gulf_Of_Tomini|  between the northern Minahasa and East peninsulas; the  |Tolo_Gulf|Tolo_Gulf|  between the East and Southeast peninsulas; and the  |Bone_Gulf|Bone_Gulf|  between the South and Southeast peninsulas. The  |Strait_of_Makassar|Strait_Of_Makassar|  runs along the western side of the island and separates the island from Borneo.            The name Sulawesi possibly comes from the words sula and besi and may refer to the historical export of  |iron|Iron|  from the rich  |Lake_Matano|Lake_Matano| |iron_deposits|Iron_Ore| . Watuseke, F. S. 1974. On the name Celebes. Sixth International Conference on Asian History, International Association of Historians of Asia, Yogyakarta, 26–30 August. Unpublished. The name came into common use in English following  |Indonesian_independence|Indonesian_Independence| .     The name Celebes was originally given to the island by  |Portuguese_explorers|Portuguese_Explorers| . While its direct translation is unclear, it may be considered a Portuguese rendering of the native name Sulawesi .        Sulawesi is the  |worlds_eleventh-largest_island|List_Of_Islands_By_Area| ,  covering an area of . The central part of the island is ruggedly mountainous, such that the islands peninsulas have traditionally been remote from each other, with better connections by sea than by road. The three bays that divide Sulawesis peninsulas are, from north to south, the  |Tomini|Bay_Of_Tomini| , the  |Tolo|Bay_Of_Tolo|  and the  |Boni|Gulf_Of_Boni| . These separate the  |Minahassa_or_Northern_Peninsula|Semenanjung_Minahassa| , the  |East_Peninsula|East_Peninsula,_Sulawesi| , the  |Southeast_Peninsula|Southeast_Peninsula,_Sulawesi|  and the  |South_Peninsula|South_Peninsula,_Sulawesi| .     The  |Strait_of_Makassar|Strait_Of_Makassar|  runs along the western side of the island.  The island is surrounded by  |Borneo|Borneo|  to the west, by the  |Philippines|Philippines|  to the north, by  |Maluku|Maluku_Islands|  to the east, and by  |Flores|Flores|  and  |Timor|Timor|  to the south.       The  |Selayar_Islands|Selayar_Islands|  make up a peninsula stretching southwards from Southwest Sulawesi into the  |Flores_Sea|Flores_Sea|  are administratively part of Sulawesi. The  |Sangihe_Islands|Sangihe_Islands|  and  |Talaud_Islands|Talaud_Islands|  stretch northward from the northeastern tip of Sulawesi, while  |Buton_Island|Buton|  and its neighbours lie off its southeast peninsula, the  |Togian_Islands|Togian_Islands|  are in the Gulf of Tomini, and  |Peleng_Island|Peleng_Island|  and  |Banggai_Islands|Banggai_Islands_Regency|  form a cluster between Sulawesi and  |Maluku|Maluku_Islands| . All the above-mentioned islands, and many smaller ones are administratively part of Sulawesis six provinces.            The island slopes up from the shores of the deep seas surrounding the island to a high, mostly non-volcanic, mountainous interior. Active volcanoes are found in the northern  |Minahassa_Peninsula|Minahassa_Peninsula| , stretching north to the  |Sangihe_Islands|Sangihe_Islands| . The northern peninsula contains several active volcanoes such as  |Mount_Lokon|Mount_Lokon| ,  |Mount_Awu|Mount_Awu| ,  |Soputan|Soputan|  and  |Karangetang|Karangetang| .     According to  |plate_reconstructions|Plate_Reconstruction| , the island is believed to have been formed by the collision of  |terranes|Terrane|  from the  |Asian_Plate|Asian_Plate|  and from the  |Australian_Plate|Australian_Plate|  , with  |island_arcs|Island_Arc|  previously in the Pacific .  Because of its several tectonic origins, various  |faults|Fault|  scar the land and as a result the island is prone to  |earthquakes|Earthquake| .     Sulawesi, in contrast to most of the other islands in the  |biogeographical|Biogeography|  region of  |Wallacea|Wallacea| , is not truly oceanic, but a composite island at the centre of the Asia-Australia  |collision_zone|Collision_Zone| . Parts of the island were formerly attached to either the  |Asia|Asia| n or  |Australian|Australia|  continental margin and became separated from these areas by  |vicariant_processes|Vicariance| . In the west, the opening of the  |Makassar_Strait|Makassar_Strait|  separated West Sulawesi from  |Sundaland|Sundaland|  in the  |Eocene|Eocene|  c. 45 Mya. In the east, the traditional view of collisions of multiple  |micro-continent|Micro-Continent| al fragments sliced from New Guinea with an active volcanic margin in West Sulawesi at different times since the  |Early_Miocene|Early_Miocene|  c. 20 Mya has recently been replaced by the hypothesis that extensional fragmentation has followed a single Miocene collision of West Sulawesi with the  |Sula_Spur|Sula_Spur| , the western end of an ancient folded belt of  |Variscan_origin|Variscan_Orogeny|  in the Late Paleozoic.          Before October 2014, the settlement of South Sulawesi by modern humans had been dated to c. 30,000 BC on the basis of radiocarbon dates obtained from rock shelters in Maros.

No earlier evidence of human occupation had at that point been found, but the island almost certainly formed part of the land bridge used for the settlement of Australia and  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea|  by at least 40,000 BCE.

Initial settlement was probably around the mouth of the Sadan river, on the northwest coast of the peninsula, although the south coast has also been suggested. Bulbeck, F.D. 1992. A tale of two kingdoms; The historical archaeology of Gowa and Tallok, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Ph.D thesis,  |The_Australian_National_University|The_Australian_National_University| .     Subsequent migrations across the mountainous landscape resulted in the geographical isolation of PSS speakers and the evolution of their languages into the eight families of the South Sulawesi language group.   If each group can be said to have a homeland, that of the  |Bugis|Bugis|  – today the most numerous group – was around lakes  |Témpé|Témpé|  and  |Sidénréng|Sidénréng|  in the Walennaé depression. Here for some 2,000 years lived the linguistic group that would become the modern Bugis; the archaic name of this group was Ugiq. Despite the fact that today they are closely linked with the  |Makasar|Makasar| , the closest linguistic neighbours of the Bugis are the  |Toraja|Toraja| .     Pre-1200 Bugis society was most likely organised into chiefdoms. Some anthropologists have speculated these chiefdoms would have warred and, in times of peace, exchanged women with each other. Further, they have speculated that personal security would have been negligible and head-hunting an established cultural practice. The political economy would have been a mixture of hunting and gathering and swidden or shifting agriculture. Speculative planting of  |wet_rice|Wet_Rice|  may have taken place along the margins of the lakes and rivers.        In Central Sulawesi, there are over 400 granite  |megaliths|Megalith| , which various archaeological studies have dated to be from 3000 BC to AD 1300. They vary in size from a few centimetres to around . The original purpose of the megaliths is unknown. About 30 of the megaliths represent human forms. Other megaliths are in form of large pots  and stone plates .   , retrieved 11 October 2010      In October 2014 it was announced that  |cave_paintings|Cave_Painting|  in Maros had been dated as being about 40,000 years old. Dr Maxime Aubert, of  |Griffith_University|Griffith_University|  in  |Queensland|Queensland| ,  |Australia|Australia| , said that the minimum age for the outline of a hand was 39,900 years old, which made it the oldest  |hand_stencil|Hand_Stencil|  in the world and added, Next to it is a pig that has a minimum age of 35,400 years old, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one.              Starting in the 13th century, access to prestige trade goods and to sources of iron started to alter long-standing cultural patterns and to permit ambitious individuals to build larger political units. It is not known why these two ingredients appeared together; one was perhaps the product of the other.     In 1367, several identified polities, located on the island, were mentioned in the Javanese manuscript  |Nagarakretagama|Nagarakretagama|  dated from the  |Majapahit|Majapahit|  period. Canto 14 mentioned polities including Gowa, Makassar,  |Luwu|Luwu|  and Banggai. It seems that by the 14th century, polities in the island were connected in an archipelagic maritime trading network, centered in the Majapahit port in East Java. By 1400, a number of nascent agricultural principalities had arisen in the western Cenrana valley, as well as on the south coast and on the west coast near modern Parepare. Caldwell, I.A. 1988.

The Dutch had arrived in Sulawesi in 1605 and were quickly followed by the English, who established a factory in Makassar. Bassett, D.

From 1660, the Dutch were at war with  |Gowa|Gowa| , the major Makassar west coast power. In 1669, Admiral Speelman forced the ruler, Sultan Hasanuddin, to sign the  |Treaty_of_Bongaya|Treaty_Of_Bongaja| , which handed control of trade to the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company| . The Dutch were aided in their conquest by the Bugis warlord Arung Palakka, ruler of the Bugis kingdom of  |Bone|Bone_State| . The Dutch built a fort at Ujung Pandang, while Arung Palakka became the regional overlord and Bone the dominant kingdom. Political and cultural development seems to have slowed as a result of the status quo.     In 1905 the entire island became part of the Dutch state colony of the  |Netherlands_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies|  until  |Japanese_occupation|Japanese_Occupation_Of_Indonesia|  in the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| .

The Kaili were an important group based in the  |Palu|Palu_River|  valley and related to the Toraja. Scholars relate that their control swayed under Ternate and Makassar, but this might have been a decision by the Dutch to give their vassals a chance to govern a difficult group. Padbruge commented that in the 1700s Kaili numbers were significant and a highly militant society. In the 1850s a war erupted between the Kaili groups, including the Banawa, in which the Dutch decided to intervene. A complex conflict also involving the Sulu Island pirates and probably Wyndham .     In the late 19th century the Sarasins journeyed through the Palu valley as part of a major initiative to bring the Kaili under Dutch rule. Some very surprising and interesting photographs were taken of shamans called Tadulako. Further Christian religious missions entered the area to make one of the most detailed ethnographic studies in the early 20th century. Kruyt & Adriani. A Swede by the name of  |Walter_Kaudern|Walter_Kaudern|  later studied much of the literature and produced a synthesis. Erskine Downs in the 1950s produced a summary of Kruyts and Andrianis work: The religion of the Baree-Speaking Toradja of Central Celebes, which is invaluable for English-speaking researchers. One of the most recent publications is When the bones are left, a study of the material culture of central Sulawesi, Eija-Maija Kotilainen – History – 1992. offering extensive analysis. Also worthy of study are the brilliant works of Monnig Atkinson on the Wana shamans who live in the Mori area.       The 2000 census population of the provinces of Sulawesi was 14,946,488, about 7.25% of Indonesias total population.     By the 2010 Census the total had reached 17,371,782, and the latest official estimate is 19,573,800. The largest city is  |Makassar|Makassar| .        |Islam|Islam_In_Indonesia|  is the majority religion in Sulawesi. The conversion of the lowlands of the south western peninsula to Islam occurred in the early 17th century. The kingdom of Luwu in the Gulf of Bone was the first to accept Islam in February 1605; the Makassar kingdom of Goa-Talloq, centred on the modern-day city of  |Makassar|Makassar| , followed suit in September.

Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 151: 394–421 However, the  |Gorontalo|Gorontaloan_People|  and the  |Mongondow|Mongondow_People|  peoples of the northern peninsula largely converted to Islam only in the 19th century. Most Muslims are  |Sunnis|Sunni| .         |Christians|Christianity_In_Indonesia|  form a substantial minority on the island. According to the  |demographer|Demography|  Toby Alice Volkman, 17% of Sulawesis population is  |Protestant|Protestantism_In_Indonesia|  and less than 2% is  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholicism_In_Indonesia| . Christians are concentrated on the tip of the northern peninsula around the city of  |Manado|Manado| , which is inhabited by the  |Minahasa|Minahasa| , a predominantly Protestant people, and the northernmost  |Sangir|Sangir_Islands|  and  |Talaud_Islands|Talaud_Islands| . The  |Toraja|Toraja|  people of  |Tana_Toraja|Tana_Toraja|  in Central Sulawesi have largely converted to Christianity since Indonesias independence. There are also substantial numbers of Christians around  |Lake_Poso|Lake_Poso|  in Central Sulawesi, among the  |Pamona|Pamona|  speaking peoples of Central Sulawesi, and near  |Mamasa|Mamasa,_Mamasa| .     Though most people identify themselves as Muslims or Christians, they often subscribe to local beliefs and deities as well. It is not uncommon for both groups to make offerings to local gods, goddesses, and spirits.     Smaller communities of  |Buddhists|Buddhism_In_Indonesia|  and  |Hindus|Hinduism_In_Indonesia|  are also found on Sulawesi, usually among the  |Chinese|Chinese_Indonesian| ,  |Balinese|Balinese_People|  and  |Indian|Indian_Indonesian|  communities.              The island is subdivided into six  |provinces|Provinces_Of_Indonesia| |Gorontalo|Gorontalo| ,  |West_Sulawesi|West_Sulawesi| ,  |South_Sulawesi|South_Sulawesi| ,  |Central_Sulawesi|Central_Sulawesi| ,  |Southeast_Sulawesi|Southeast_Sulawesi|  and  |North_Sulawesi|North_Sulawesi| . West Sulawesi is a new province, created in 2004 from part of South Sulawesi. The largest cities on the island are  |Makassar|Makassar| ,  |Manado|Manado| ,  |Palu|Palu| ,  |Kendari|Kendari| ,  |Bitung|Bitung| ,  |Gorontalo|Gorontalo| ,  |Palopo|Palopo|  and  |Baubau|Baubau| .                                Sulawesi is part of  |Wallacea|Wallacea| , meaning that it has a mix of both  |Indomalayan|Indomalayan_Realm|  and  |Australasian|Australasian_Realm|  species that reached the island by  |crossing_deep-water_oceanic_barriers|Oceanic_Dispersal| .   The flora includes one native eucalypt,  E. deglupta . There are 8  |national_parks|List_Of_National_Parks_Of_Indonesiasulawesi|  on the island, of which 4 are mostly  |marine|Marine_Park| . The parks with the largest terrestrial area are  |Bogani_Nani_Wartabone|Bogani_Nani_Wartabone_National_Park|  with 2,871  km 2 and  |Lore_Lindu_National_Park|Lore_Lindu_National_Park|  with 2,290  km 2 .  |Bunaken_National_Park|Bunaken_National_Park| , which protects a rich coral ecosystem, has been proposed as an UNESCO  |World_Heritage_Site|World_Heritage_Site| .       Early in the Pleistocene, Sulawesi had a  |dwarf_elephant|Dwarf_Elephant|  and a  |dwarf|Insular_Dwarfism|  form of  Stegodon , ; later both were replaced by larger forms.  A giant  |suid|Suidae| ,  Celebochoerus , was also formerly present.  It is thought that many of the migrants to Sulawesi arrived via the  |Philippines|Philippines| , while Sulawesi in turn served as a way station for migrants to  |Flores|Flores| . Morwood & van Oosterzee ,  A Pleistocene faunal turnover is recognised, with the competitive displacement of several indigenous tarsiers by more recently arriving ones and by  Celebochoerus  by other medium-sized herbivores like the  |babirusa|Babirusa| ,  |anoa|Anoa|  and  |Celebes_warty_pig|Celebes_Warty_Pig| .

A large percentage, 62% are  |endemic|Endemism| , meaning that they are found nowhere else in the world. The largest of these are the two species of  |anoa|Anoa|  or dwarf buffalo. Other artiodactyl species inhabiting Sulawesi are the  |warty_pig|Celebes_Warty_Pig|  and the  |babirusas|Babirusas| , which are aberrant pigs. The only native  |carnivora|Carnivora| n is the  |Sulawesi_palm_civet|Sulawesi_Palm_Civet|  . Primates present include a number of  |nocturnal|Nocturnal| |tarsiers|Tarsier|   as well as  |diurnal|Diurnality| |macaques|Macaque|  . While most of Sulawesis mammals are  |placental|Eutheria|  and have Asian relatives, several species of  |cuscus|Cuscus| , arboreal  |marsupials|Marsupials|  of Australasian origin, are also present .     Sulawesi is home to a large number of endemic  |rodent|Rodent|  genera.  |Murid|Muridae|  rodent genera endemic to Sulawesi and immediately adjacent islands  are  Bunomys ,  Echiothrix ,  Margaretamys ,  Taeromys  and  Tateomys  as well as the single-species genera  Eropeplus ,  Hyorhinomys ,  Melasmothrix ,  Paucidentomys ,  Paruromys  and  Sommeromys . Endemic  |sciurid|Sciuridae|  genera are  Hyosciurus ,  Prosciurillus ,  Rubrisciurus  and  Waiomys .     While over 20 bat species are present on Sulawesi, only a portion of these are endemic:  Rhinolophus tatar ,  Scotophilus celebensis  and the  |megabats|Megabat|   Acerodon celebensis ,  Boneia bidens ,  Dobsonia exoleta ,  Harpyionycteris celebensis ,  Neopteryx frosti ,  Rousettus celebensis  and  Styloctenium wallacei .     Several endemic shrews, the  |Sulawesi_shrew|Sulawesi_Shrew| ,  |Sulawesi_tiny_shrew|Sulawesi_Tiny_Shrew|  and the  |Sulawesi_white-handed_shrew|Sulawesi_White-Handed_Shrew| , are found on the island.          By contrast, Sulawesian bird species tend to be found on other nearby islands as well, such as  |Borneo|Borneo| ; 31% of Sulawesis birds are found nowhere else. One endemic is the largely ground-dwelling, chicken-sized  |maleo|Maleo| , a  |megapode|Megapode|  which sometimes uses hot sand close to the islands volcanic vents to incubate its eggs. An international partnership of conservationists, donors, and local people have formed the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation,  in an effort to raise awareness and protect the nesting grounds of these birds on the central-eastern arm of the island. Other endemic birds include the flightless  |snoring_rail|Snoring_Rail| , the  |fiery-browed_starling|Fiery-Browed_Starling| , the  |Sulawesi_masked_owl|Sulawesi_Masked_Owl| , the  |Sulawesi_myna|Sulawesi_Myna| , the  |satanic_nightjar|Satanic_Nightjar|  and the  |grosbeak_starling|Grosbeak_Starling| . There are around 350 known bird species in Sulawesi.       The larger reptiles of Sulawesi are not endemic and include  |reticulated|Reticulated_Python|  and  |Burmese|Burmese_Python|  pythons,  |king_cobras|King_Cobra| ,  |water_monitors|Water_Monitor| ,  |sailfin_lizards|Hydrosaurus_Amboinensis| ,   |saltwater_crocodiles|Saltwater_Crocodile|   and  |green_sea_turtles|Green_Sea_Turtle| . An extinct giant  |tortoise|Tortoise| ,  Megalochelys atlas , was formerly present, but disappeared by 840,000 years ago, possibly because of the arrival of humans.   Similarly,  |komodo_dragons|Komodo_Dragon|  or similar lizards appear to have inhabited the island, being among its apex predators. Hocknull, S. A.; Piper, P. J.; van den Bergh, G. D.; Due, R.

Sulawesi island was recently the subject of an Ecoregional Conservation Assessment, coordinated by  |The_Nature_Conservancy|The_Nature_Conservancy| . Detailed reports about the vegetation of the island are available.   – Reports from the Nature Conservancys Indonesian Program and Texas Tech University, Department of Biological Sciences; 2004 The assessment produced a detailed and annotated list of conservation portfolio sites. This information was widely distributed to local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Detailed conservation priorities have also been outlined in a recent publication.  – Cannon, C.H. et al.     The lowland forests on the island have mostly been removed.  – mongabay.com Because of the relative geological youth of the island and its dramatic and sharp topography, the lowland areas are naturally limited in their extent. The past decade has seen dramatic conversion of this rare and endangered habitat. The island also possesses one of the largest outcrops of  |serpentine_soil|Serpentine_Soil|  in the world, which support an unusual and large community of specialized plant species. Overall, the flora and fauna of this unique center of global biodiversity is very poorly documented and understood and remains critically threatened.     The islands of Pepaya, Mas and Raja islands, located in Sumalata Village -  |North_Gorontalo_Regency|North_Gorontalo_Regency|  , have been named a nature reserve since the Dutch colonial time in 1936. Four of the only seven species of  |sea_turtles|Sea_Turtle|  can be found in the islands, the worlds best turtle habitat. They include penyu hijau , penyu sisik , penyu tempayan  and penyu belimbing . In 2011, the habitat was threatened by human activities such as illegal poaching and fish bombing activities; furthermore, a lot of coral reefs, which represent a source of food for turtles, have been damaged.           The largest environmental issue in Sulawesi is  |deforestation|Deforestation| . In 2007, scientists found that 80 percent of Sulawesis forest had been lost or degraded, especially centered in the lowlands and the mangroves.  – mongabay.com Forests have been felled for logging and large agricultural projects. Loss of forest has resulted in many of Sulawesis endemic species becoming endangered. In addition, 99 percent of Sulawesis wetlands have been lost or damaged.     Other environmental threats included bushmeat hunting and mining.
