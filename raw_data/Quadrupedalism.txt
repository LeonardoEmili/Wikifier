     Quadrupedalism or pronograde posture is a form of  |terrestrial_locomotion_in_animals|Terrestrial_Locomotion_In_Animals|  using four  |limbs|Limb|  or  |legs|Leg| . An  |animal|Animal|  or  |machine|Machine|  that usually moves in a quadrupedal manner is known as a quadruped, meaning four feet . The majority of quadrupeds are  |vertebrate|Vertebrate|  animals, including  |mammals|Mammal|  such as  |cattle|Cattle| ,  |dogs|Dog|  and  |cats|Cat| , and  |reptiles|Reptile|  such as  |lizards|Lizard| .     Few other animals are quadrupedal, though a few  |birds|Bird|  like the  |shoebill|Shoebill|  sometimes use their wings to right themselves after lunging at prey.             Although the words quadruped and tetrapod are both derived from terms meaning four-footed , they have distinct meanings. A  |tetrapod|Tetrapod|  is any member of the  |taxonomic|Linnaean_Taxonomy|  unit  Tetrapoda  whereas a quadruped actually uses four limbs for locomotion. Not all tetrapods are quadrupeds and not all quadrupeds are tetrapods.     The distinction between quadrupeds and tetrapods is important in  |evolutionary_biology|Evolutionary_Biology| , particularly in the context of tetrapods whose limbs have adapted to other roles . All of these animals are tetrapods, but none is a quadruped. Even snakes, whose limbs have become  |vestigial|Vestigial_Structure|  or lost entirely, are nevertheless tetrapods.     Most quadrupedal animals are tetrapods but there are a few exceptions. For instance, among the insects, the  |praying_mantis|Praying_Mantis|  is a quadruped.             In July 2005, in rural  |Turkey|Turkey| , scientists discovered five  |Kurd|Kurd| ish siblings who had learned to walk naturally on their hands and feet. Unlike  |chimpanzees|Common_Chimpanzee| , which ambulate  |on_their_knuckles|Knuckle-Walking| , the  |Kurdish_siblings|The_Family_That_Walks_On_All_Fours|  walked on their palms, allowing them to preserve the dexterity of their fingers.         Many people, especially practitioners of  |parkour|Parkour|  and  |freerunning|Freerunning|  and  |Georges_Héberts|Georges_Hébert|  Natural Method,  find benefit in quadrupedal movements to build full body strength.  |Kenichi_Ito|Kenichi_Ito|  is a Japanese man famous for speed running on four limbs.  Quadrupedalism is sometimes referred to as being on all fours, and is observed in  |crawling|Crawling|  especially by infants. Mondschein, Emily R., Karen E. Adolph, and Catherine S. Tamis-LeMonda. Gender bias in mothers expectations about infant crawling. Journal of experimental child psychology 77.4 : 304-316.          |BigDog|Bigdog|  is a dynamically stable quadruped  |robot|Robot|  created in 2005 by  |Boston_Dynamics|Boston_Dynamics|  with  |Foster-Miller|Foster-Miller| , the  |NASA|Nasa| |Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory| , and the  |Harvard_University_Concord_Field_Station|Harvard_University_Concord_Field_Station| .      Also by NASA JPL, in collaboration with  |University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara|University_Of_California,_Santa_Barbara|  Robotics Lab, is RoboSimian, with emphasis on stability and deliberation. It has been demonstrated at the  |DARPA_Robotics_Challenge|Darpa_Robotics_Challenge| .
