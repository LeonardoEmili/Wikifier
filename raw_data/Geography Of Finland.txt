     The geography of Finland is characterized by its northern position, its ubiquitous landscapes of intermingled  |boreal_forests|Taiga|  and lakes, and its low population density. Finland can be divided into three areas: archipelagoes and coastal lowlands, a slightly higher  |central_lake_plateau|Finnish_Lakeland|  and uplands to north and northeast. Bordering the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| ,  |Gulf_of_Bothnia|Gulf_Of_Bothnia| , and  |Gulf_of_Finland|Gulf_Of_Finland| , as well as  |Sweden|Sweden| ,  |Norway|Norway| , and  |Russia|Russia| , Finland is the northernmost country in the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Most of the population and agricultural resources are concentrated in the south. Northern and eastern Finland are sparsely populated containing vast wilderness areas.  |Taiga_forest|Taiga|  is the dominant vegetation type.          Finlands total area is . Of this area 10% is water, 69% forest, 8% cultivated land and 13% other. Finland is the eighth largest country in Europe after Russia, France, Ukraine, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Germany.     As a whole, the shape of Finlands boundaries resembles a figure of a one-armed human. In Finnish, parallels are drawn between the figure and the  |national_personification|National_Personification|  of Finland –  |Finnish_Maiden|Finnish_Maiden|   – and the country as a whole can be referred in the Finnish language by her name. Even in official context the area around  |Enontekiö|Enontekiö|  in northwestern part of the country between  |Sweden|Sweden|  and  |Norway|Norway|  can be referred to as the Arm . After the  |Continuation_War|Continuation_War|  Finland lost major land areas to Russia in the  |Moscow_Armistice|Moscow_Armistice|  of 1944, and the figure was said to have lost the other of her arms, as well as a  |hem|Wiktionary_Hem|  of her skirt .               The  |bedrock|Bedrock|  of Finland belong to the  |Baltic_Shield|Baltic_Shield|  and was formed by a succession of  |orogenies|Orogeny|  in  |Precambrian|Precambrian|  time. The oldest rocks of Finland, those of  |Archean|Archean|  age, are found in the east and north. These rocks are chiefly  |granitoids|Granite|  and  |migmatitic|Migmatite| |_gneiss|Gneiss| . Rocks in central and western Finland originated or came to place during the  |Svecokarelian_orogeny|Svecofennian_Orogeny| . Following this last orogeny  |Rapakivi_granites|Rapakivi_Granite| |_intruded|Intrusion|  various locations of Finland during the  |Mesoproterozoic|Mesoproterozoic|  and  |Neoproterozoic|Neoproterozoic| , specially at  |Åland|Åland|  and the southeast. So-called  |Jotnian_sediments|Jotnian|  occur usually together with Rapakivi granites.  The youngest rocks in Finland are those found in the northwestern arm which belong to  |Scandinavian_Caledonides|Scandinavian_Caledonides|  that assembled in  |Paleozoic|Paleozoic|  times. During the  |Caledonian_orogeny|Caledonian_Orogeny|  Finland was likely a sunken  |foreland_basin|Foreland_Basin|  covered by sediments, subsequent uplift and erosion would have eroded all of these sediments.           About one third of Finland lies below 100 m, and about two thirds lies under 200 m. Finland can be divided into three topographical areas; the coastal landscapes, the  |interior_lake_plateau|Finnish_Lakeland|  also known as Finnish lake district and  |Upland_Finland|Upland_Finland| .  The coastal landscapes are made up mostly of plains below 20 m. These plains tilt gently towards the sea so that where its irregularities surpasses sea-level groups is islands like the  |Kvarken_Archipelago|Norra_Kvarken|  or the  |Åland_Islands|Åland_Islands|  are found. Åland Islands is connected to the Finnish mainland by a shallow submarine plateau that does not exceed 20 m in depth.  Next to the  |Gulf_of_Bothnia|Gulf_Of_Bothnia|  the landscape of Finland is extremely flat with height differences no larger than 50 m.  This region called the  |Ostrobothnian_Plain|Ostrobothnian_Plain|  extends inland about 100  km and constitute the largest plain in the  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries| .     The interior lake plateau is dominated by undulating hilly terrain with valley to top height differences of 100 or less and occasionally up to 200 m. Only the area around the lakes  |Pielinen|Pielinen|  and  |Päijänne|Lake_Päijänne|  stand with a subtly more pronounced relief. The relief of the interior lake plateau bears some resemblance to the Swedish  |Norrland_terrain|Norrland_Terrain| . Upland Finland and areas higher than 200 m are found mostly in the north and east of the country. A limited number of hills and mountains exceed 500 m in height in these regions.  |Inselberg_plains|Inselberggeology|  are common in the northern half of the country.  In the far north hills reach 200 to 400 m and the landscape is a  |Förfjäll|Fellförfjäll|  . Only the extreme northwest contain a more dramatic  |mountain_landscape|Scandinavian_Mountains| .      The subdued landscape of Finland is the result of protracted erosion that has leveled down ancient mountain massifs into near-flat landforms called  |peneplains|Peneplain| . The last major leveling event resulted in the formation of the  |Sub_Cambrian_peneplain|Sub_Cambrian_Peneplain|  in  |Late_Neoproterozoic|Neoproterozoic|  time.  While Finland has remained very close to sea-level since the formation of this last peneplain some further relief was formed by a slight uplift resulting in the  |carving_of_valleys|River_Incision|  by rivers. The slight uplift does also means that at parts the uplifted peneplain can be traced as  |summit_accordances|Summit_Accordance| .  The  |Quaternary_ice_ages|Quaternary_Glaciation|  resulted in the erosion of weak rock and loose materials by glaciers. When the ice masses  |retreated|Deglaciation|  eroded depressions turned into lakes.   |Fractures|Joint|  in Finlands bedrock were particularly affected by weathering and erosion, leaving as result trace straight sea and lake inlets.     Except a few rivers along the coasts most rivers in Finland drain at some stage into one or more lakes. The drainage basins drain into various directions. Much of Finland drain into the  |Gulf_of_Bothnia|Gulf_Of_Bothnia|  including the countrys largest and longest rivers,  |Kokemäenjoki|Kokemäenjoki|  and  |Kemijoki|Kemijoki|  respectively. Finlands largest lake drain by  |Vuoksi_River|Vuoksi_River|  into  |Lake_Ladoga|Lake_Ladoga|  in Russia. Upland Finland in the east drain east across Russian  |Republic_of_Karelia|Republic_Of_Karelia|  into the  |White_Sea|White_Sea| . In the northeast  |Lake_Inari|Lake_Inari|  discharges by  |Paatsjoki|Paatsjoki|  into  |Barents_Sea|Barents_Sea|  in the Arctic.               The  |ice_sheet|Ice_Sheet|  that covered Finland intermittently during the  |Quaternary|Quaternary|  grew out from the  |Scandinavian_Mountains|Scandinavian_Mountains| .  During the last  |deglaciation|Deglaciation|  the first parts of Finland to become ice-free, the southeastern coast, did so slightly prior to the  |Younger_Dryas|Younger_Dryas|  cold-spell 12,700 years  |before_present|Before_Present|  . The retreat of the ice cover occurred simultaneously from the north-east, the east and southeast. The retreat was fastest from the southeast resulting in the lower course of  |Tornio|Torne|  being the last part of Finland to be deglaciated. Finally by 10,100 years BP the ice cover had all but left Finland to concentrate in Sweden and Norway before fading away.      As the ice sheet became thinner and retreated the land begun to rise by effect of  |isostacy|Post_Glacial_Rebound| . Much of Finland was under water when the ice retreated and was gradually uplifted in a process that continues today.  Albeit not all areas were drowned at the same time it is estimated at time or another about 62% has been under water.  Depending on location in Finland the ancient shoreline reached different maximum heights. In southern Finland 150 to 160 m, in central Finland about 200 m and in eastern Finland up to 220 m.             Latitude is the principal influence on Finlands climate. Because of Finlands northern location, winter is the longest season. Only in the south coast is summer as long as winter. On the average, winter lasts from early December to mid March in the archipelago and the southwestern coast and from early October to early May in Lapland. This means that southern portions of the country are snow-covered about three to four months of the year and the northern, about seven months. The long winter causes about half of the annual  of precipitation in the north to fall as snow. Precipitation in the south amounts to about  annually. Like that of the north, it occurs all through the year, though not so much of it is snow.     The  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean|  to the west and the  |Eurasian_continent|Eurasia|  to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the  |Gulf_Stream|Gulf_Stream|  and the  |North_Atlantic_Drift_Current|North_Atlantic_Current| , which warm Norway and Sweden, also warm Finland. Westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the Baltic areas and to the countrys shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south. These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and high temperatures in the summer.     The highest ever recorded temperature is  .  The lowest,  . The annual middle temperature is relatively high in the southwestern part of the country , with quite mild winters and warm summers, and low in the northeastern part of  |Lapland|Lapland|  .
