           The Daily Planet is a fictional  |broadsheet|Broadsheet| |_newspaper|Newspaper|  appearing in  |American_comic_books|American_Comic_Book|  published by  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| , commonly in association with  |Superman|Superman| . The newspaper was first mentioned in Action Comics 23 . The Daily Planet buildings most distinguishing and famous feature is the enormous  |globe|Globe|  that sits on top of the building.     The newspaper is based in the fictional city of  |Metropolis|Metropolis| , and employs  |Clark_Kent|Clark_Kent| ,  |Lois_Lane|Lois_Lane| , and  |Jimmy_Olsen|Jimmy_Olsen| , with  |Perry_White|Perry_White|  as its  |editor_in_chief|Editor_In_Chief| . The buildings original features appear to be based upon the  |Old_Toronto_Star_Building|Old_Toronto_Star_Building| , where Superman co-creator  |Joe_Shuster|Joe_Shuster|  was a newsboy when the  Toronto Star  was still called the Daily Star. Shuster has claimed that Metropolis was visually inspired by  |Toronto|Toronto| . . Retrieved July 25, 2007. However, over the years, Metropolis has served as a fictional analogue to  |New_York_City|New_York_City| . Fleisher, Michael and Lincoln, Janet E. The Great Superman Book , pp. 223–225.              When Superman first appeared in comics , his  |alter_ego|Alter_Ego| |_Clark_Kent|Clark_Kent|  worked for a newspaper named the  Daily Star , under editor  |George_Taylor|George_Taylor| . Superman co-creator  |Joe_Shuster|Joe_Shuster|  named the Daily Star after the  Toronto Daily Star  newspaper in  |Toronto|Toronto| ,  |Ontario|Ontario| , which had been the newspaper that Shusters parents received and for which Shuster had worked as a newsboy. It was not until later years that the fictional paper became the Daily Planet.      While choosing a name for the fictitious newspaper, consideration was given to combining the names of  The Globe and Mail  and the Daily Star to become The Daily Globe. But when the  |comic_strip|Superman|  appeared, the newspapers name was permanently made the Daily Planet to avoid a name conflict with real newspapers. In Superman 5 , the publisher of the Daily Planet is shown to be Burt Mason, a man who is determined to print the truth even when corrupt politician Alex Evell threatens him. In Superman 6 , Mason gives free printing equipment to The Gateston Gazette after its editor, Jim Tirrell, is killed and its equipment is destroyed by racketeers that Tirrell insisted on reporting.     When DC made use of its  |multiverse|Multiverse|  means of continuity tracking between the early 1960s and mid-1980s, it was declared that the Daily Star was the newspapers name in the  |Golden_Age|Golden_Age_Of_Comics|  or Earth-Two versions of Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, while the Daily Planet was used in the  |Silver_Age|Silver_Age_Of_Comics|  or Earth-One versions. The  |Clark_Kent_of_Earth_Two|Superman|  eventually became the editor-in-chief of the Daily Star, something his Earth-One counterpart did not achieve. Superman Family 196        In the Silver and Bronze Age universes, Clarks first contact with the Daily Planet came when reporter Perry White came to  |Smallville|Smallville|  to write a story about  |Superboy|Superboy| , and wound up getting an interview where the Boy of Steel first revealed his  |extraterrestrial|Extraterrestrial_Life|  origins. The story resulted in Perry earning a  |Pulitzer_Prize|Pulitzer_Prize| . New Adventures of Superboy 12 During Clark Kents years in college, Perry White was promoted to editor-in-chief upon the retirement of the Daily Planets previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor. Superman: The Secret Years 4     After graduating from Metropolis University with a degree in journalism , Clark Kent went to work at the Planet, and quickly met Lois Lane . Superman 133 After Clark was hired, Jimmy Olsen joined the papers staff. Superman’s Pal, Jimmy Olsen 36     In 1971, the Daily Planet was purchased by Morgan Edge , president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System. Edge proceeded to integrate Metropolis television station WGBS-TVs studios into the Daily Planet building, and named Clark Kent as the anchor for the WGBS evening news. Superman 233 Eventually, Clarks former schoolmate from Smallville Lana Lang joined Clark as a co-anchor. Superman 317     After the 1985–1986 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths , many of these elements, including Morgan Edge buying the Daily Planet, were retroactively changed or eliminated from the Superman canon.       In the post-Crisis comics canon, years before Clark or Lois began working for the paper, Lex Luthor owned the Daily Planet. When Luthor, deciding to sell the paper, began taking bids for the Planet, Perry White convinced an international conglomerate, TransNational Enterprises, to buy the paper. They agreed to this venture with only one stipulation: that Perry White would become editor-in-chief. White had served as the Planet editor-in-chief ever since, barring the few times he was absent. During those times people such as Sam Foswell and Clark Kent have looked after the paper. Franklin Stern , an old friend of Whites, became the Daily Planets publisher.     thu   The Planet saw its share of rough times during Whites tenure. For example, it had many violent worker strikes . The building itself, along with most of the city, was destroyed during the Fall of Metropolis storyline; it is only much later that it was restored by the efforts of various superheroes. The Planet building sustained heavy damages after the villain Doomsday s rampage. Later, Franklin Stern decided to put the paper up for sale. Lex Luthor , disliking the heavy criticism of himself and his company that the Planet became noted for, purchased the Daily Planet and subsequently closed the paper down. Luthor fired every employee of the newspaper except for four people: Simone DNeige, Dirk Armstrong, Jimmy Olsen , and Lois Lane . As a final insult, Luthor saw to it that the Planet globe was unceremoniously dumped in the Metropolis landfill . In the Planets place emerged LexCom, a news-oriented Internet website that primarily catered to Luthors views of quality journalism.     After Lois Lane made a deal with Luthor where, in exchange for him returning the Planet to Perry, she would kill one story of his choosing with no questions asked, Luthor sold the Daily Planet to Perry White for the token sum of one dollar. The paper was quickly reinstated, rehiring all of its old staff. Sometime later, ownership of the Planet fell into the hands of Bruce Wayne , where it has remained ever since. In the  |Batman_Hush|Batman_Hush|  storyline, it is named a subsidiary of Wayne Entertainment .     During the Y2K storyline , the Daily Planet building was upgraded along with the rest of Metropolis, and a holographic globe replaced the physical one. Eventually due to temporal instabilities caused by the B13 Virus, Metropolis and the Daily Planet building, globe and all, were restored to their former states.     In the current comics and media spinoffs, the Daily Planet is presented as a thoroughly modern news operation, including operating an Internet website much like most large newspapers. The Planets reporters also have access to the best modern equipment to aid their work, though Perry White has often been shown as still favoring his manual typewriter . In 2008, it was said that Clark uses a typewriter at his desk due to his powers causing minor interference in regular desktop computers.  |Action_Comics_Annual|Action_Comics|  11     During this era, the Planet s major competitors in Metropolis include the tabloid newspaper the Daily Star, WGBS-TV , and Lex Luthor s various media operations. A contemporary publication is Newstime Magazine, where Clark Kent worked as the editor for a time. The publisher of Newstime is Colin Thornton, who is secretly the demon Satanus , an enemy of Supermans.     Superman: Birthright |Superman_Birthright|Superman_Birthright|  limited series, the Daily Planets publisher was Quentin Galloway, an abrasive overbearing loudmouth who bullied Jimmy Olsen, and later Clark Kent, before being told off by Lois Lane, whom Galloway could not fire because of her star status. Bailey, Neal. Accessed May 5, 2009. This was meant to be a new origin for Superman but one that applied to the Post-Crisis continuity, so later Planet history concerning Luthor temporarily owning it and other events still applied.       During the story  |Infinite_Crisis|Infinite_Crisis| , parts of the Post-Crisis history were altered. These changes were explained gradually over the next several years. The 2009 mini-series  |Superman_Secret_Origin|Superman_Secret_Origin|  clarified the earlier history of the Planet in the new continuity. The story established that while Lex Luthor, in the revised history, owns every media in Metropolis and uses it to enforce his public image as a wealthy benefactor, the Planet had always stood free, refusing him ownership and even condemning his actions in editorials signed by Perry White himself. As a result, when Clark Kent is first inducted into the Planet, the newspaper was almost bankrupt, dilapidated and unable to afford new reporters. Superman: Secret Origin 3 This changed after Superman begins his career. Thanks to Superman granting exclusive interviews and photographs to Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen when he debuts, the papers circulation increased 700%.     General Sam Lane attempted to capture Superman, seeing him as an alien threat. When he failed to do so, he forcibly shut down the Planet as part of an attempt to force Perry White and Lois to turn over any information they had on Superman that they havent released to the public. Eventually, Superman turned the public to his favor and Sam Lane was seen in a bad light after his soldier John Corben AKA Metallo ruthlessly endangered civilians. These events lead to the people of Metropolis no longer looking at Lex Luthor as a savior and The Daily Planet becomes the citys top-selling paper, as well as a major player in media.     In  |Final_Crisis|Final_Crisis|  2, the villain Clayface triggers an explosion in The Daily Planet building, greatly damaging the offices, leaving many injured and at least one person dead. Lois Lane is hospitalized. Despite the chaos of Final Crisis and more than half of humanity being enslaved by evil, the newspaper continues to spread news and inform the public via a printing press in Supermans Fortress of Solitude . In Final Crisis 7, it is shown functioning once again.       thu   With the reboot of DCs line of comics in 2011, the Daily Planet was shown in the Superman comics as being bought by Morgan Edge and merged with the Galaxy Broadcasting System , similar to the Silver/Bronze Age continuity. Superman 1 In Action Comics, it is revealed that in the new history/universe, Clark Kent begins his journalism career in Metropolis roughly six years before Galaxy Broadcasting merges with the Daily Planet. Along with being a writer for The Daily Star, partly because editor George Taylor was a friend of his adopted parents, Clark is an active blogger who speaks against political corruption and reports on the troubles of everyday citizens who are not often the focus of news media. While working at the Star, Clark meets Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and the two become friends despite working at rival publications. Clark is also a great fan of Lois Lanes work at the Daily Planet, eventually meeting her through Jimmy. Months after Superman makes his public debut, Clark leaves The Daily Star on good terms and accepts a position at The Daily Planet.     After the merger with Galaxy Broadcasting, Lois was promoted to run the TV division, with Clark acting as an on-the-scene reporter for the TV division. Clark is later assigned the Superman beat. But after rising tension between himself and Lois, as well as with Galaxy Broadcasting head Morgan Edge, Clark concludes that the Daily Planet is now more concerned with ratings and internet page views than actual journalism. He quits and goes off to begin an independent, internet news site with fellow journalist Cat Grant. Though Lois and Jimmy consider this to be a bad and risky decision, they continue to act as Clarks friends and confidants, offering aid when they can.     At the conclusion of the New 52, following the New 52 Supermans death, Lex Luthor buys the Daily Planet.
