Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a Tertiary Period as well as of Tertiary Rocks.

It has evolved to describe an epoch starting some time in the past and on the whole defined by anthropogenic carbon emissions and production and consumption of plastic goods that are left in the ground.      Critics of this term say that the term should not be used because it is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to define a specific time when humans started influencing the rock strata—defining the start of an epoch.  Others say that humans have not even started to leave their biggest impact on Earth, and therefore the Anthropocene has not even started yet.     The ICS has not officially approved the term .  The Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch.
