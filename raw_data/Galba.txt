           Servius Sulpicius Galba  was  |Roman_emperor|Roman_Emperor|  from 68 to 69, the first emperor in the  |Year_of_the_Four_Emperors|Year_Of_The_Four_Emperors| . He was known as Lucius Livius Galba Ocella prior to taking the throne as a result of his adoption by his stepmother,  |Livia_Ocellina|Livia_Ocellina| . The governor of  |Hispania|Hispania|  at the time of the rebellion of  |Gaius_Julius_Vindex|Gaius_Julius_Vindex|  in  |Gaul|Roman_Gaul| , he seized the throne following  |Neros|Nero|  suicide.     Born into a wealthy family, Galba held at various times the offices of  |praetor|Praetor| ,  |consul|Consul| , and governor of the provinces  |Aquitania|Aquitania| ,  |Upper_Germany|Upper_Germany| , and  |Africa|Africa|  during the first half of the first century AD. He retired during the latter part of  |Claudius|Claudius|  reign but Nero later granted him the governorship of Hispania. Taking advantage of the defeat of Vindexs rebellion and Neros suicide, he became emperor with the support of the  |Praetorian_Guard|Praetorian_Guard| . His physical weakness and general apathy led to his being dominated by favorites. Unable to gain popularity with the people or maintain the support of the Praetorian Guard, Galba was murdered by  |Otho|Otho| , who then became emperor.       Galba was not related to any of the emperors of the  |Julio-Claudian_dynasty|Julio-Claudian_Dynasty| , but he was a member of a distinguished noble family. The origin of  |the_cognomen_Galba|Galba|  is uncertain.  |Suetonius|Suetonius|  offers a number of possible explanations; the first member of the  |gens_Sulpicia|Gens_Sulpicia|  to bear the name might have gotten the name from the term galba, which the Romans used to describe the  |Gauls|Gauls| , or after an insect called galbae.  |One_of_Galbas_ancestors|Publius_Sulpicius_Galba_Maximus|  had been consul in 200 BC, and  |another_of_his_ancestors|Servius_Sulpicius_Galba|  was consul in 144 BC; the later emperors  |father|Gaius_Sulpicius_Galba|  and  |brother|Gaius_Sulpicius_Galba| , both named Gaius, would hold the office in 5 BC and AD 22 respectively.   Galbas grandfather was a historian and his son was a barrister whose first marriage was to  |Mummia_Achaica|Mummia_Achaica| , granddaughter of  |Quintus_Lutatius_Catulus|Quintus_Lutatius_Catulus|  and great-granddaughter of  |Lucius_Mummius_Achaicus|Lucius_Mummius_Achaicus| ; Galba prided himself on his descent from his great-grandfather Catulus. According to Suetonius, he fabricated a  |genealogy|Genealogy|  of paternal descent from the god  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  and maternal descent from the legendary  |Pasiphaë|Pasiphaë| , wife of  |Minos|Minos| .     Servius Sulpicius Galba was born near  |Terracina|Terracina|  on 24 December 3 BC. His elder brother Gaius fled from Rome and committed suicide because the emperor  |Tiberius|Tiberius|  would not allow him to control a  |Roman_province|Roman_Province| .  |Livia_Ocellina|Livia_Ocellina|  became the second wife of Galbas father, whom she may have married because of his wealth; he was short and  |hunchback|Hunchback| ed. Ocellina adopted Galba, and he took the name Lucius Livius Galba Ocella. Galba had a sexual appetite for males, whom he preferred over females; according to Suetonius, he was more inclined to … the hard bodied and those past their prime . Nevertheless, he married a woman named  |Aemilia_Lepida|Aemilia_Lepida|  and had two sons. Aemilia and their sons died during the early years of the reign of  |Claudius|Claudius|  . Galba would remain a widower for the rest of his life.       Galba became  |praetor|Praetor|  in about 30, then governor of  |Aquitania|Aquitania|  for about a year, then  |consul|Roman_Consul|  in 33. In 39 the emperor  |Caligula|Caligula|  learned of a plot against himself in which  |Gnaeus_Cornelius_Lentulus_Gaetulicus|Gnaeus_Cornelius_Lentulus_Gaetulicus| , the general of the  |Upper_German|Upper_Germany|  legions, was an important figure; Caligula installed Galba in the post held by Gaetulicus. As commander of the legions of Upper Germany, Galba gained a reputation as a disciplinarian. Suetonius writes that Galba was advised to take the throne following the assassination of Caligula in 41, but loyally served Caligulas uncle and successor Claudius ; this story may simply be fictional. Galba was appointed as governor of  |Africa|Africa|  in 44 or 45. He retired at an uncertain time during the reign of Claudius, possibly in 49. He was recalled in 59 or 60 by the emperor  |Nero|Nero|  to govern  |Hispania|Hispania| .     A rebellion against Nero was orchestrated by  |Gaius_Julius_Vindex|Gaius_Julius_Vindex|  in  |Gaul|Roman_Gaul|  on the anniversary of the death of Neros mother,  |Agrippina_the_Younger|Agrippina_The_Younger| , in 68. Shortly afterwards Galba, in rebellion against Nero, rejected the title General of Caesar in favor of General of the  |Senate_and_People_of_Rome|Senate_And_People_Of_Rome|  . He was supported by the imperial official  |Tigellinus|Tigellinus| . On 8 June 68 another imperial official,  |Nymphidius_Sabinus|Nymphidius_Sabinus| , falsely announced to the  |Praetorian_Guard|Praetorian_Guard|  that Nero had fled to  |Egypt|Egypt| , and the  |Senate|Roman_Senate|  proclaimed Galba emperor. Nero then committed  |assisted_suicide|Assisted_Suicide|  with help from his secretary.                Upon becoming emperor Galba was faced by the rebellion of Nymphidius, who had his own aspirations for the imperial throne. However, he was killed by the Praetorians before he could take the throne. While Galba was arriving to  |Rome|Rome|  with the  |Lusitania|Lusitania| n governor  |Marcus_Salvius_Otho|Marcus_Salvius_Otho| , his army was attacked by a legion that had been organized by Nero; a number of Galbas troops were killed in the fighting. Galba, who suffered from chronic  |gout|Gout|  by the time he came to the throne, was advised by a corrupt group which included the Spanish general  |Titus_Vinius|Titus_Vinius| , the praetorian prefect  |Cornelius_Laco|Cornelius_Laco| , and Icelus, a freedman of Galba. Galba seized the property of Roman citizens, disbanded the German legions, and did not pay the Praetorians and the soldiers who fought against Vindex. These actions caused him to become unpopular.       On 1 January 69, the day Galba and Vinius took the office of consul, the fourth and twenty-second legions of Upper Germany refused to swear loyalty to Galba. They toppled his statues, demanding that a new emperor be chosen. On the following day, the soldiers of  |Lower_Germany|Lower_Germany|  also refused to swear their loyalty and proclaimed the governor of the province,  |Aulus_Vitellius|Aulus_Vitellius| , as emperor. Galba tried to ensure his authority as emperor was recognized by adopting the nobleman  |Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Licinianus|Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Licinianus|  as his successor. Nevertheless, Galba was killed by the Praetorians on 15 January, followed shortly by Vinius and Piso. Their heads were placed on poles and Otho was then acclaimed as emperor.
