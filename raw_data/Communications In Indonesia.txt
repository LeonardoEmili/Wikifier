      Communications in Indonesia has a complex history due to the need to reach an extended archipelago of over 17,500 islands. The once important non-electronic communication methods of the past have given away to a considerable telecommunications infrastructure in contemporary  |Indonesia|Indonesia| .       Indonesia has long been using traditional forms of slayed communications between various islands and villages. It was not until the sixteenth century when the  |Dutch|Dutch_Empire|  colonised Indonesia, constructing a more elaborate communication system, both within Indonesia and to other countries. The first connection to  |Australia|Australia|  was an undersea  |telegraph|Telegraph|  cable that was completed on 18 November 1871, connecting  |Java|Java|  to  |Darwin|Darwin_Northern_Territory| , and eventually to the  |Australian_Overland_Telegraph_Line|Australian_Overland_Telegraph_Line|  across Australia.     After gaining Independence, Indonesia started to develop its own communication systems, generally following the rest of the world. The construction of communication towers and launch of the Palapa series of communication satellites was done during the  |New_Order|New_Order|  period.       A number of lines connect Indonesia to international communication routes. For example, the  |SEA_ME_WE_3|Sea_Me_We_3| |_optical|Optical_Fiber| |_submarine_telecommunications_cable|Submarine_Telecommunications_Cable|  lands at both  |Medan|Medan|  and  |Jakarta|Jakarta|  connecting Europe with South eastern Asia  and Australia .     Domestically, Indonesia has good coverage for media across most major islands, although smaller and less populated Islands do not always receive attention from media companies, and rely on satellite communication.                Indonesia has a long list of print media, in the form of  |newspapers|Newspapers|  and  |magazines|Magazines| . Some, such as  |Kompas|Kompas|  and  |Koran_Tempo|Koran_Tempo|  are circulated daily and are relatively simple to obtain. Others are island- or city-specific, and are usually not distributed to other regions.            |Telephones|Telephone|  - main lines in use: 9.99 million   Telephones - mobile cellular: At the end of 2010, the mobile cellular penetration rate was 67 percent . , Josh Franken, Jakarta Post, 16 May 2011  |CDMA|Cdma|  use is declining in favour of  |GSM|Gsm| .
