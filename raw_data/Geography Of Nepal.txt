|Nepal|Nepal|  measures about  along its Himalayan axis by  across. Nepal has an area of .     Nepal is landlocked by India on three sides and  |Chinas|China| |Tibet_Autonomous_Region|Tibet_Autonomous_Region|  to the north.  |West_Bengals|West_Bengal|  narrow  Siliguri Corridor  or Chickens Neck separate Nepal and  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| . To the east are  |India|India|  and  |Bhutan|Bhutan| . Nepal depends on India for  |goods_transport|Freight_Transport|  facilities and access to the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| , even for most goods imported from China.       For a country of its size, Nepal has tremendous geographic diversity. It rises from as low as  elevation in the tropical  |Terai|Terai| —the northern rim of the  |Gangetic_Plain|Gangetic_Plain| , beyond the perpetual  |snow_line|Snow_Line|  to some 90 peaks over  including Earths highest   |Mount_Everest|Mount_Everest|  or Sagarmatha. In addition to the continuum from tropical warmth to cold comparable to polar regions, average annual precipitation varies from as little as  in the  |rainshadow|Rain_Shadow|  north of the  |Himalayas|Himalayas|  to as much as  on windward slopes.      Along a south-to-north transect, Nepal can be divided into three belts: Terai, Pahad and Himal. In the other direction, it is divided into three major river systems, from east to west:  |Koshi|Koshi_River| ,  |Gandaki/Narayani|Gandaki_River|  and  |Karnali|Karnali_River|  , all tributaries of the  |Ganges|Ganges_River|  river. The Ganges- |Yarlung_Zangbo|Yarlung_Zangbo_River| / |Brahmaputra|Brahmaputra_River|  watershed largely coincides with the Nepal-Tibet border, however several Ganges tributaries rise inside Tibet.           Terai Region    Terai is a low land region containing some hill ranges. Looking out for its coverage, it covers 19% of the total area of Nepal. The Terai region begins at the Indian border and includes the southernmost part of the flat, intensively farmed  |Gangetic_Plain|Gangetic_Plain|  called the Outer Terai. By the 19th century, timber and other resources were being exported to India. Industrialization based on agricultural products such as  |jute|Jute|  began in the 1930s and infrastructure such as roadways, railways and electricity were extended across the border before it reached Nepals Pahad region.     The Outer Terai is culturally more similar to adjacent parts of Indias  |Bihar|Bihari_People|  and  |Uttar_Pradesh|Culture_Of_Uttar_Pradesh|  than to the Pahad of Nepal.  |Nepali|Nepali_Language|  is taught in schools and often spoken in government offices, however the local population mostly uses  |Maithali|Maithil| ,  |Bhojpuri|Bhojpuri_Language|  and  |Tharu|Tharu_Languages|  languages.     The Outer Terai ends at the base of the first range of foothills called the  Siwaliks  or Churia. This range has a densely forested skirt of coarse alluvium called the  bhabhar . Below the bhabhar, finer, less permeable sediments force groundwater to the surface in a zone of springs and marshes. In  |Persian|Persian_Language| , terai refers to wet or marshy ground. Before the use of  |DDT|Ddtuse_Against_Malaria|  this was dangerously  |malaria|Malaria| l. Nepals rulers used this for a defensive frontier called the char kose jhadi .     Above the Bhabhar belt, the Siwaliks rise to about  with peaks as high as , steeper on their southern flanks because of faults known as the Main Frontal Thrust. This range is composed of poorly consolidated, coarse sediments that do not retain water or support soil development so there is virtually no agricultural potential and sparse population.     In several places beyond the Siwaliks there are  |dūn_valleys|Doon_Valley|  called  |Inner_Terai|Inner_Terai_Valleys_Of_Nepal| . These valleys have productive soil but were dangerously malarial except to  |indigenous|Adivasi| |Tharu_people|Tharu_People|  who had  |genetic_resistance|Thalassemia| . In the mid-1950s  |DDT|Ddt|  came into use to  |suppress_mosquitos|Ddtuse_Against_Malaria|  and the way was open to settlement from the land-poor hills, to the detriment of the Tharu.     The Terai ends and the Pahad begin at a higher range of foothills called the  |Mahabharat_Range|Mahabharat_Lekh| .      Hilly |Mahabharat_Range|Lower_Himalayan_Range|  where a fault system called the Main Boundary Thrust creates an escarpment  high, to a crest between . It covers 65% of the total area of Nepal.     These steep southern slopes are nearly uninhabited, thus an effective buffer between languages and culture in the Terai and Hilly.  |Hindu|Hindu| |Paharis|Pahari_People|  mainly populate river and stream bottoms that enable  |rice_cultivation|Paddy_Field|  and are warm enough for winter/spring crops of  |wheat|Wheat|  and  |potato|Potato| . The increasingly urbanized  |Kathmandu|Kathmandu_Valley|  and  |Pokhara|Pokhara_Valley|  valleys fall within the Hill region.  |Newars|Newa_People|  are an  |indigenous|Adivasi|  ethnic group with their own  |Tibeto-Burman|Tibeto-Burman| |language|Newar_Language| . The Newar were originally indigenous to the Kathmandu valley but have spread into Pokhara and  |other_towns|Newa_Peoplesettlements|  alongside urbanized Pahari.     Other indigenous Janajati ethnic groups -— natively speaking highly localized Tibeto-Burman languages and dialects -— populate hillsides up to about . This group includes  |Magar|Magar_People|  and  |Kham_Magar|Kham_Magar|  west of Pokhara,  |Gurung|Gurung|  south of the Annapurnas,  |Tamang|Tamang|  around the periphery of Kathmandu Valley and  |Rai|Rai_People| ,  |Koinch_Sunuwar|Sunuwar|  and  |Limbu|Limbu_People|  further east. Temperate and subtropical fruits are grown as cash crops.  |Marijuana|Cannabis|  was grown and processed into  Charas   until international pressure persuaded the  |government|Kingdom_Of_Nepal|  to outlaw it in 1976. There is increasing reliance on animal husbandry with elevation, using land above  for summer grazing and  |moving_herds_to_lower_elevations_in_winter|Transhumance| . Grain production has not kept pace with population growth at elevations above  where colder temperatures inhibit  |double_cropping|Multiple_Cropping| . Food deficits drive emigration out of the Pahad in search of employment.     The Hilly ends where ridges begin substantially rising out of the  |temperate_climate|Temperate_Climate|  zone into  |subalpine_zone|Subalpine_Zone|  above .          Himal   Himal is a mountain region containing snow.   The Mountain Region or Parbat begins where high ridges begin substantially rising above  into the  |subalpine|Montanesubalpine_Zone|  and  |alpine_zone|Montanealpine_Grasslands_And_Tundra|  which are mainly used for seasonal pasturage. By geographical view, it covers 16% of the total area of Nepal. A few tens kilometers further north the high Himalaya abruptly rise along the Main Central Thrust fault zone above the  |snow_line|Snow_Line|  at . Some 90 of Nepals peaks exceed  and eight exceed  including  |Mount_Everest|Mount_Everest|  at  and  |Kanchenjunga|Kanchenjunga|  at .     Unlike the Mahabharats, the Himalayas are not continuous across Nepal. Instead, there are some 20 subranges including the  |Kanchenjunga|Kangchenjunga|  massif along the  |Sikkim|Sikkim|  border,  |Mahalangur_Himal|Mahalangur_Himal|  around Mt. Everest.  |Langtang|Langtang|  north of Kathmandu,  |Annapurna|Annapurna|  and  |Manaslu|Manaslu|  north of Pokhara, then  |Dhaulagiri|Dhaulagiri|  further west with  |Kanjiroba|Kanjiroba_Himal|  north of  |Jumla|Jumla_District|  and finally  |Gurans_Himal|Gurans_Himal|  in the far west.            The main watershed between the  |Brahmaputra|Brahmaputra_River|   and the  |Ganges|Ganges|  system actually lies north of the highest ranges. Alpine, often semi-arid valleys—including  |Humla|Humla_District| ,  |Jumla|Jumla_District| ,  |Dolpo|Dolpo| ,  |Mustang|Mustang_District| ,  |Manang|Manang|  and  |Khumbu|Khumbu| —cut between Himalayan sub ranges or lie north of them.     Some of these valleys historically were more accessible from  |Tibet|Tibet|  than Nepal and are populated by people with  |Tibetan|Tibetan_People|  affinities called  Bhotiya  or  Bhutia  including the famous  |Sherpas|Sherpa_People|  in Kumbu valley near Mount Everest. With  |Chinese_cultural_hegemony|Sinicization_Of_Tibet|  in Tibet itself, these valleys have become repositories of traditional ways. Valleys with better access from the hill regions to the south are culturally linked to Nepal as well as Tibet, notably the  |Kali_Gandaki_Gorge|Kali_Gandaki_Gorge|  where  |Thakali|Thakali_People|  culture shows influences in both directions.     Permanent villages in the mountain region stand as high as  with summer encampments even higher. Bhotiyas graze  |yaks|Yak| , grow cold-tolerant crops such as  |potato|Potato| es,  |barley|Barley| ,  |buckwheat|Buckwheat|  and  |millet|Millet| . They traditionally traded across the mountains, e.g., Tibetan salt for  |rice|Rice|  from lowlands in Nepal and India. Since trade was restricted in the 1950s they have found work as high altitude porters, guides, cooks and other accessories to tourism and alpinism.                 Nepals latitude is about the same as that of the United States state of  |Florida|Florida| , however with elevations ranging from less than  to over  and precipitation from  to over  the country has eight climate zones from tropical to perpetual snow.
