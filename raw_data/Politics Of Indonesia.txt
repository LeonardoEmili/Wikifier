         The politics of Indonesia take place in the framework of a  |presidential|Presidential_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |republic|Republic|  whereby the  |President_of_Indonesia|President_Of_Indonesia|  is both  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government|  and of a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| .  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the  |government|Government_Of_Indonesia| .  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the government and the two  |Peoples_Representative_Councils|Peoples_Representative_Council| . The  |judiciary|Judiciary|  is  |independent|Judicial_Independence|  of the executive and the legislature. King, Blair. A   access date 23 May 2009     The  |1945_constitution|Constitution_Of_Indonesia|  provided for a limited separation of executive, legislative and judicial power. The governmental system has been described as presidential with parliamentary characteristics . Following the  |Indonesian_riots_of_May_1998|Indonesian_Riots_Of_May_1998|  and the  |resignation_of_President_Suharto|Fall_Of_Suharto| , several political reforms were set in motion via amendments to the  |Constitution_of_Indonesia|Constitution_Of_Indonesia| , which resulted in changes to all branches of government.                    An era of Liberal Democracy  in  |Indonesia|Indonesia|  began on August 17, 1950 following the dissolution of the federal  |United_States_of_Indonesia|United_States_Of_Indonesia|  less than a year after its formation, and ended with the imposition of  |martial_law|Martial_Law|  and  |President_Sukarnos_1959_Decree|President_Sukarnos_1959_Decree|  regarding the introduction of  |Guided_Democracy|Guided_Democracy_In_Indonesia|   on July 5. It saw a number of important events, including the 1955  |Bandung_Conference|Bandung_Conference| , Indonesias first  |general|1955_Indonesian_Legislative_Election|  and  |Constitutional_Assembly|1955_Indonesian_Constitutional_Assembly_Election|  elections, and an extended period of political instability, with no cabinet lasting as long as two years.     From 1957, Guided Democracy was the political system in place until the  |New_Order|New_Order|  began in 1966. It was the brainchild of President  |Sukarno|Sukarno| , and was an attempt to bring about political stability. He believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesias situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders.            The transition to the  |New_Order|New_Order|  in the mid-1960s, ousted Sukarno after 22 years in the position. One of the most tumultuous periods in  |the_countrys_modern_history|History_Of_Indonesia| , it was the commencement of  |Suhartos|Suharto|  three-decade presidency. Described as the great  dhalang  , Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and the  |Communist_Party_of_Indonesia|Communist_Party_Of_Indonesia|  .     By 1965, the PKI extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army. Ricklefs , pp. 271-283 On 30 September 1965, six of the militarys most senior officers were killed in an action by the so-called  |30_September_Movement|30_September_Movement| , a group from within the armed forces. Within a few hours,  |Major_General_Suharto|Suharto|  mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta. Anti-communists, initially following the armys lead, went on  |a_violent_purge_of_communists_throughout_the_country|Indonesian_Mass_Killings_Of_1965–66| , killing an estimated half million people and destroying the PKI, which was officially blamed for the crisis. ; Ricklefs , pages 280–283, 284, 287–290 ; Friend , page 107-109, 113.     The politically weakened Sukarno was  |forced_to_transfer_key_political_and_military_powers|Supersemar|  to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Provisional  |Peoples_Consultative_Assembly|Peoples_Consultative_Assembly|  named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suhartos pro-Western New Order stabilised the economy but continued with the official state philosophy of  |Pancasila|Pancasila| .            The New Order  is the term coined by President  |Suharto|Suharto|  to characterise his regime as he came to power in 1966. He used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor,  |Sukarno|Sukarno|  . The term New Order in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years .     Immediately following the  |attempted_coup|30_September_Movement|  in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesias problems since its independence. The generation of 66  epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following communal and political conflicts, and economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, the New Order was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the New Order established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident  |anti-communism|Anti-Communism|  remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.     Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced  |Suharto_to_resign_in_1998|Fall_Of_Suharto|  and then gained power, the term New Order has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the New Order, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption,  |collusion|Collusion|  and  |nepotism|Nepotism|  .  . The Jakarta Post .             The Post-Suharto era began with the  |fall_of_Suharto|Fall_Of_Suharto|  in 1998 during which Indonesia has been in a period of transition, an era known as Reformasi . This period has seen a more open and liberal political-social environment.     A process of constitutional reform lasted from 1999 to 2002, with four amendments producing major changes. Denny Indrayana , pp. 360-361 Among these are  |term_limits|Term_Limit|  of up to 2 five-year terms for the  |President|President|  and  |Vice-President|Vice-President| , and measures to institute checks and balances. The highest state institution is the  |Peoples_Consultative_Assembly|Peoples_Consultative_Assembly|  , whose functions previously included electing the president and vice-president , establishing broad guidelines of state policy, and amending the constitution. The 695-member MPR includes all 550 members of the  |Peoples_Representative_Council|Peoples_Representative_Council|   plus 130 members of  |Regional_Representative_Council|Regional_Representative_Council|   elected by the 26 provincial parliaments and 65 appointed members from societal groups. Denny Indrayana , pp. 361-362     The DPR, which is the premier legislative institution, originally included 462 members elected through a mixed proportional/district representational system and thirty-eight appointed members of the Indonesian Armed Forces and police . TNI/POLRI representation in the DPR and MPR ended in 2004. Societal group representation in the MPR was eliminated in 2004 through further constitutional change. Denny Indrayana , pp. 293-296  Having served as rubberstamp bodies in the past, the DPR and MPR have gained considerable power and are increasingly assertive in oversight of the executive branch. Under constitutional changes in 2004, the MPR became a  |bicameral_legislature|Bicameral_Legislature| , with the creation of the DPD, in which each province is represented by four members, although its legislative powers are more limited than those of the DPR. Through his/her appointed cabinet, the president retains the authority to conduct the administration of the government. Denny Indrayana , pp. 265, 361, 441     A general election in June 1999 produced the first freely elected national, provincial and regional parliaments in over 40 years. In October 1999, the MPR elected a compromise candidate,  |Abdurrahman_Wahid|Abdurrahman_Wahid| , as the countrys fourth president, and  |Megawati_Sukarnoputri|Megawati_Sukarnoputri|   a daughter of Sukarno  as the vice-president. Megawatis PDI-P party had won the largest share of the vote in the general election, while  |Golkar|Golkar| , the dominant party during the New Order, came in second . Several other, mostly Islamic parties won shares large enough to be seated in the DPR. Further democratic elections took place in 2004, 2009 and 2014.            |President|List_Of_Presidents_Of_Indonesia| |Joko_Widodo|Joko_Widodo| |Indonesian_Democratic_Party-Struggle|Indonesian_Democratic_Party_–_Struggle| |Vice_President|List_Of_Vice_Presidents_Of_Indonesia| |Maruf_Amin|Maruf_Amin|  2008 |dones|Dones| , KPU5Pengadilan NegeriPengadilan TinggiPengadilan Tata Usaha NegaraMahkamah KonstitusiPengadilan AgamashariaKomisi Yudisial .
