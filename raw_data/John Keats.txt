        John Keats  was an English  |Romantic|Romanticism|  poet. He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with  |Lord_Byron|Lord_Byron|  and  |Percy_Bysshe_Shelley|Percy_Bysshe_Shelley| , despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis|  at the age of 25. ONeill and Mahoney , 418     Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all  |English_poets|English_Poets| . He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers.  |Jorge_Luis_Borges|Jorge_Luis_Borges|  stated that his first encounter with Keats work was the most significant literary experience of his life. Jorge Luis Borges . This Craft of Verse. Harvard University Press, 98–101     The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the  |series_of_odes|John_Keatss_1819_Odes| . This is typical of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through an emphasis on natural imagery. Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature. Some of the most acclaimed works of Keats are  |Ode_to_a_Nightingale|Ode_To_A_Nightingale|  ,  |Sleep_and_Poetry|Sleep_And_Poetry|  , and the famous sonnet  |On_First_Looking_into_Chapmans_Homer|On_First_Looking_Into_Chapmans_Homer|  .           John Keats was born in  |Moorgate|Moorgate| , London, on 31 October 1795 to Thomas Keats and his wife, Frances Jennings. There is little evidence of his exact birthplace. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29  October, baptism records give the date as the 31st. Motion , 10 , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Online He was the eldest of four surviving children; his younger siblings were  |George|George_Keats|  , Thomas , and Frances Mary Fanny who eventually married Spanish author Valentín Llanos Gutiérrez.  Another son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as a  |hostler|Hostler|  Gittings , 11 at the stables attached to the Swan and Hoop Inn, an establishment he later managed, and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed that he was born at the inn, a birthplace of humble origins, but there is no evidence to support his belief. The Globe pub now occupies the site , a few yards from the modern-day  |Moorgate_station|Moorgate_Station| .  He was baptised at  |St_Botolph-without-Bishopsgate|St_Botolph-Without-Bishopsgate| , and sent to a local  |dame_school|Dame_School|  as a child. Gittings , 24          His parents were unable to afford  |Eton|Eton_College|  or  |Harrow|Harrow_School| , Harrow. Motion , 22 Milnes so in the summer of 1803, he was sent to board at John Clarkes school in  |Enfield|Enfield_Town| , close to his grandparents house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools. In the family atmosphere at Clarkes, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmasters son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  literature, including  |Tasso|Torquato_Tasso| ,  |Spenser|Edmund_Spenser| , and  |Chapmans_translations|George_Chapman| . The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, always in extremes , given to indolence and fighting. However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809. Gittings , 1–3     In April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture, suffered when he fell from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school. John Keats, Colvin, S, Thomas Keats died  |intestate|Intestacy| . Frances remarried two months later, but left her new husband soon afterwards, and the four children went to live with their grandmother, Alice Jennings, in the village of  |Edmonton|Edmonton,_London| . Monckton Milnes , xiii     In March 1810, when Keats was 14, his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving the children in the custody of their grandmother. She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, to take care of them. That autumn, Keats left Clarkes school to apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813. Cowden Clarke, who remained a close friend of Keats, described this period as the most placid time in Keats life. Motion , 46       From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his grandfather John Jennings and a portion of his mothers legacy, £8000 , to be equally divided between her living children. Keats share would have increased on the death of his brother Tom in 1818. It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware.  William Walton, solicitor for Keats mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a  |duty_of_care|Duty_Of_Care|  to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poets expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.           Having finished his apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered as a medical student at  |Guys_Hospital|Guys_Hospital|   and began studying there in October 1815. Within a month of starting, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital, assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload. Keats long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guys Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomass Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including  |Henry_Stephens|Henry_Stephens|  who became a famous inventor and ink magnate. Motion , 74     However, Keats training took up increasing amounts of his writing time, and he was increasingly ambivalent about his medical career. He felt that he faced a stark choice. Motion , 98 He had written his first extant poem, An Imitation of Spenser, in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as  |Leigh_Hunt|James_Henry_Leigh_Hunt|  and  |Lord_Byron|Lord_Byron| , and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John feared that he should never be a poet, & if he was not he would destroy himself . Motion , 94 In 1816, Keats received his  |apothecarys_licence|Worshipful_Society_Of_Apothecaries| , which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician, and surgeon, but before the end of the year he announced to his guardian that he was resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.     Although he continued his work and training at Guys, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet. In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet O Solitude in his magazine,  The Examiner , a leading liberal magazine of the day. Hirsch, Edward It was the first appearance in print of Keats poetry, and  |Charles_Cowden_Clarke|Charles_Cowden_Clarke|  described it as his friends red letter day, Colvin , 35 the first proof that Keats ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was To My Brothers.  In the summer of that year, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of  |Margate|Margate|  to write. There he began Calidore and initiated the era of his great letter writing. On his return to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself for further study in order to become a member of the  |Royal_College_of_Surgeons|Royal_College_Of_Surgeons| . Motion , 104–5     In October 1816, Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of Poems, the first volume of Keats verse, which included I stood tiptoe and Sleep and Poetry, both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in The Champion. Clarke commented that the book might have emerged in Timbuctoo. Keats publishers,  |Charles_and_James_Ollier|Charles_Ollier| , felt ashamed of the book. Keats immediately changed publishers to  |Taylor_and_Hessey|John_Taylor|  on  |Fleet_Street|Fleet_Street| . Motion proposes that the Olliers suggested Keats leave their publishing lists. See Motion p156 Unlike the Olliers, Keats new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of Poems they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the companys rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists eventually included  |Coleridge|Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge| ,  |Hazlitt|William_Hazlitt| ,  |Clare|John_Clare| ,  |Hogg|Thomas_Jefferson_Hogg| ,  |Carlyle|Thomas_Carlyle|  and  |Lamb|Charles_Lamb| . Motion , 156     Through Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their  |Eton|Eton_College| -educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by Poems. Although he noted that Keats could be wayward, trembling, easily daunted, Woodhouse was convinced of Keats genius, a poet to support as he became one of Englands greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about Keats poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats work. Andrew Motion represents him as  |Boswell|James_Boswell|  to Keats  |Johnson|Samuel_Johnson| , ceaselessly promoting the writers work, fighting his corner, and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few people to accompany Keats to  |Gravesend|Gravesend,_Kent|  to embark on his final trip to Rome. Motion , 157     In spite of the bad reviews of Poems, Hunt published the essay Three Young Poets  and the sonnet  |On_First_Looking_into_Chapmans_Homer|On_First_Looking_Into_Chapmans_Homer| , foreseeing great things to come. Gittings , 155 He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of  The Times ,  |Thomas_Barnes|Thomas_Barnes| ; the writer  |Charles_Lamb|Charles_Lamb| ; the conductor  |Vincent_Novello|Vincent_Novello| ; and the poet  |John_Hamilton_Reynolds|John_Hamilton_Reynolds| , who would become a close friend. Motion , 116–120 He was also regularly meeting  |William_Hazlitt|William_Hazlitt| , a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a decisive turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed a new school of poetry. Motion 130 At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey: I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Hearts affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth. Keats letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817 This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of  |Ode_on_a_Grecian_Urn|Ode_On_A_Grecian_Urn|  : Beauty is truth, truth beauty – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know . In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey that he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbeys fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training and, despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, had made large loans to friends such as painter  |Benjamin_Haydon|Benjamin_Haydon| . Keats would go on to lend £700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts. Bate p632     Having left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of  |Hampstead|Hampstead|  in April 1817. Both John and George nursed their brother Tom, who was suffering from  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| . The house was close to Hunt and others from his circle in Hampstead, as well as to  |Coleridge|Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge| , respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, at that time living in  |Highgate|Highgate| . On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had a long walk together on  |Hampstead_Heath|Hampstead_Heath| . In a letter to his brother George, Keats wrote that they talked about a thousand things,... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics. Motion , 365–66 Around this time he was introduced to  |Charles_Wentworth_Dilke|Charles_Wentworth_Dilke|  and James Rice. Motion , 364, 184     In June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the  |Lake_District|Lake_District|  with his friend  |Charles_Armitage_Brown|Charles_Armitage_Brown| . Keats brother George and his wife Georgina accompanied them as far as  |Lancaster|Lancaster,_Lancashire|  and then continued to  |Liverpool|Liverpool| , from where the couple emigrated to America. They lived in  |Ohio|Ohio|  and  |Louisville,_Kentucky|Louisville,_Kentucky| , until 1841, when Georges investments failed. Like Keats other brother, they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment until the next century.  Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin. 1839, p82.  |Consumption|Tuberculosis|  was not identified as a disease with a single infectious origin until 1820, and there was considerable stigma attached to the condition, as it was often associated with weakness, repressed sexual passion, or masturbation. Keats refuses to give it a name in his letters.
