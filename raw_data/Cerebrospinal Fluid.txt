        Cerebrospinal fluid  is a clear, colorless  |body_fluid|Extracellular_Fluidtranscellular_Fluid|  found in the  |brain|Human_Brain|  and  |spinal_cord|Spinal_Cord| . It is produced by specialised  |ependymal_cells|Ependyma|  in the  |choroid_plexus|Choroid_Plexus| es of the  |ventricles|Ventricular_System|  of the brain, and absorbed in the  |arachnoid_granulations|Arachnoid_Granulation| . There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500  mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer, providing basic mechanical and  |immunological|Immunological|  protection to the brain inside the  |skull|Human_Skull| . CSF also serves a vital function in the  |cerebral_autoregulation|Cerebral_Autoregulation|  of  |cerebral_blood_flow|Cerebral_Blood_Flow| .     CSF occupies the  |subarachnoid_space|Subarachnoid_Space|   and the  |ventricular_system|Ventricular_System|  around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It fills the  |ventricles|Ventricular_System|  of the brain,  |cisterns|Subarachnoid_Cisterns| , and  |sulci|Sulcus| , as well as the  |central_canal|Central_Canal|  of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the  |bony_labyrinth|Bony_Labyrinth|  of the  |inner_ear|Inner_Ear|  via the  |perilymphatic_duct|Perilymphatic_Duct|  where the  |perilymph|Perilymph|  is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid. The ependymal cells of the choroid plexuses have multiple  |motile_cilia|Ciliummotile_Cilia|  on their apical surfaces that beat to move the CSF through the ventricles.     A sample of CSF can be taken via  |lumbar_puncture|Lumbar_Puncture| . This can reveal the  |intracranial_pressure|Intracranial_Pressure| , as well as indicate diseases including  |infections_of_the_brain|Encephalitis|  or  |its_surrounding_meninges|Meningitis| . Although noted by  |Hippocrates|Hippocrates| , it was only in the 18th century that  |Emanuel_Swedenborg|Emanuel_Swedenborg|  is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that  |Harvey_W._Cushing|Harvey_W._Cushing|  demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.              There is about 125–150  mL of CSF at any one time. This CSF circulates within the  |ventricular_system|Ventricular_System|  of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two  |lateral_ventricles|Lateral_Ventricles| . From here, CSF passes through the  |interventricular_foramina|Interventricular_Foramina|  to the  |third_ventricle|Third_Ventricle| , then the  |cerebral_aqueduct|Cerebral_Aqueduct|  to the  |fourth_ventricle|Fourth_Ventricle| . From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the  |subarachnoid_space|Subarachnoid_Space|  through four openings the  |central_canal|Central_Canal|  of the spinal cord, the  |median_aperture|Median_Aperture| , and the two  |lateral_apertures|Lateral_Aperture| . CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the  |sacrum|Sacrum| . There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the  |bony_labyrinth|Bony_Labyrinth|  of the  |inner_ear|Inner_Ear|  making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the  |perilymph|Perilymph|  in 93% of people.      CSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-from cranio-spinal CSF movements.        CSF is derived from  |blood_plasma|Blood_Plasma|  and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with plasma and has some different  |electrolyte|Electrolyte|  levels. Due to the way it is produced, CSF has a higher  |chloride|Chloride|  level than plasma, and an equivalent  |sodium|Sodium|  level.     CSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40  mg/dL, depending on sampling site.  In general, globular proteins and albumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or cisternal fluid.   This continuous flow into the  |venous_system|Venous_System|  dilutes the concentration of larger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.  CSF is normally free of  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell| , and at most contains only a few  |white_blood_cells|White_Blood_Cell| . Any white blood  |cell_count|Cell_Counting|  higher than this constitutes  |pleocytosis|Pleocytosis| .    CSF contains nucleic acids, in particular cell-free DNA.        At around the third week of  |development|Human_Embryogenesis| , the  |embryo|Embryo|  is a three-layered disc, covered with  |ectoderm|Ectoderm| ,  |mesoderm|Mesoderm|  and  |endoderm|Endoderm| . A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the  |notochord|Notochord| . The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The  |neural_tube|Neural_Tube| , forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior to the development of the choroid plexuses. The open  |neuropores|Neuropore|  of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.     As the  |brain_develops|Braindevelopment| , by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the  |central_nervous_system|Central_Nervous_System| |prosencephalon|Prosencephalon| ,  |mesencephalon|Mesencephalon|  and  |rhombencephalon|Rhombencephalon| . Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.     The developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a  |choroid_plexus|Choroid_Plexus|  develops, producing and releasing CSF. CSF quickly fills the neural canal.  Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.     The  |subcommissural_organ|Subcommissural_Organ|  secretes  |SCO-spondin|Sco-Spondin| , which forms  |Reissners_fiber|Reissners_Fiber|  within CSF assisting movement through the cerebral aqueduct. It is present in early intrauterine life but disappears during early development.           CSF serves several purposes:     Buoyancy: The actual  |mass|Mass|  of the  |human_brain|Human_Brain|  is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net  |weight|Weight|  of the brain suspended in CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams.   The brain therefore exists in  |neutral_buoyancy|Neutral_Buoyancy| , which allows the brain to maintain its  |density|Density|  without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill  |neurons|Neuron|  in the lower sections without CSF.   Protection: CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit, by providing a fluid buffer that acts as a  |shock_absorber|Shock_Absorber|  from some forms of mechanical injury.   Prevention of brain ischemia : The prevention of brain ischemia is aided by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total  |intracranial_pressure|Intracranial_Pressure|  and facilitates blood  |perfusion|Perfusion| .    Homeostasis : CSF allows for regulation of the distribution of substances between cells of the brain, and  |neuroendocrine|Neuroendocrine|  factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high  |glycine|Glycine| |concentration|Concentration|  disrupts  |temperature|Temperature|  and  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure|  control, and high CSF  |pH|Ph|  causes  |dizziness|Dizziness|  and  |syncope|Syncope| .   Clearing waste: CSF allows for the removal of waste products from the brain, and is critical in the brains  |lymphatic_system|Lymphatic_System| .  Metabolic waste products  |diffuse|Diffusion|  rapidly into CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed. Allan H. Ropper, Robert H. Brown Adams and Victors Principles of Neurology McGraw-Hill Professional; 8 edition Ch. 30 p. 530.          The brain produces roughly 500  mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day, at a rate of about 25  mL an hour. This  |transcellular_fluid|Transcellular_Fluid|  is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125–150  mL is present at any one time.     CSF volume is higher on a mL/kg basis in children compared to adults. Infants have a CSF volume of 4 mL/kg, children have a CSF volume of 3 mL/kg, and adults have a CSF volume of 1.5-2 mL/kg. A high CSF volume is why a larger dose of local anesthetic, on a mL/kg basis, is needed in infants. Additionally, the larger CSF volume may be one reason as to why children have lower rates of postdural puncture headache. Janssens E, et al. Post-dural puncture headaches in children. A literature review. European Journal of Peds. 2003:162;117-121.     Most of CSF is produced by the  |choroid_plexus|Choroid_Plexus| . The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the  |four_ventricles|Ventricular_System|  of the brain. It is present throughout the  |ventricular_system|Ventricular_System|  except for the  |cerebral_aqueduct|Cerebral_Aqueduct| , and the  |frontal_and_occipital_horns_of_the_lateral_ventricles|Lateral_Ventriclesstructure| .  CSF is also produced by the  |single_layer_of_column-shaped|Simple_Columnar_Epithelium| |ependymal_cells|Ependymal_Cell|  which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the  |subarachnoid_space|Subarachnoid_Space| ; and a small amount directly from the  |tiny_spaces_surrounding_blood_vessels|Perivascular_Space|  around the brain.      CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of  |plasma|Blood_Plasma|  moves from  |fenestrated_capillaries|Capillaryfenestrated|  in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs to pass through the  |epithelium|Epithelium|  cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of  |sodium|Sodium| ,  |potassium|Potassium|  and  |chloride|Chloride|  that draws water into CSF by creating  |osmotic_pressure|Osmotic_Pressure| . Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain  |tight_junctions|Tight_Junctions|  between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into CSF.   |Cilia|Ciliummotile_Cilia|  on the apical surfaces of the ependymal cells beat to help transport the CSF.       |Water|Water|  and  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  from the interstitial fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells,  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase|  converts the substances into  |bicarbonate|Bicarbonate|  and  |hydrogen_ions|Hydrogen_Ions| . These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates  |osmotic_pressure|Osmotic_Pressure|  and draws water into CSF, facilitated by  |aquaporins|Aquaporin| . Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain  |electroneutrality|Paulings_Principle_Of_Electroneutrality| . Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.  Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors,  |iodine|Iodine| ,   |vitamins_B1|Vitamin_B1| ,  |B12|Vitamin_B12| ,  |C|Vitamin_C| ,  |folate|Folate| ,  |beta-2_microglobulin|Beta-2_Microglobulin| ,  |arginine_vasopressin|Arginine_Vasopressin|  and  |nitric_oxide|Nitric_Oxide|  into CSF. A  |Na-K-Cl_cotransporter|Na-K-Cl_Cotransporter|  and  |Na/K_ATPase|Na/K_Atpase|  found on the surface of the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.     Orešković and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not primarily produced by the choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, as a consequence of water filtration through the capillary walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by  |AQP-4|Aquaporin_4| .     There are circadian variations in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating to differences in the activation of the  |autonomic_nervous_system|Autonomic_Nervous_System|  over the course of the day.     Choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle produces CSF from the arterial blood provided by the  |anterior_choroidal_artery|Anterior_Choroidal_Artery| .  In the fourth ventricle, CSF is produced from the artierial blood from the  |anterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery|Anterior_Inferior_Cerebellar_Artery|  , the  |posterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery|Posterior_Inferior_Cerebellar_Artery|  , and the  |superior_cerebellar_artery|Superior_Cerebellar_Artery| .        CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the  |dural_venous_sinuses|Dural_Venous_Sinuses|  via  |arachnoid_granulations|Arachnoid_Granulation| . These are outpouchings of the  |arachnoid_mater|Arachnoid_Mater|  into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into  |lymph|Lymph| atic vessels,  particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the  |olfactory_nerve|Olfactory_Nerve|  through the  |cribriform_plate|Cribriform_Plate| . The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the  |neonate|Neonate| . CSF turns over at a rate of three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of  |cranial|Cranial_Nerves|  and  |spinal_nerve|Spinal_Nerve|  sheathes, and through the ependyma.       The composition and rate of CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there is less of a pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The  |autonomic_nervous_system|Autonomic_Nervous_System|  influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the  |sympathetic_nervous_system|Sympathetic_Nervous_System|  increasing secretion and the  |parasympathetic_nervous_system|Parasympathetic_Nervous_System|  decreasing it. Changes in the  |pH_of_the_blood|Phliving_Systems|  can affect the activity of  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase| , and some drugs  have the potential to impact membrane channels.         CSF pressure, as measured by  |lumbar_puncture|Lumbar_Puncture| , is 10–18   |cmH_2_O|Centimetre_Of_Water|   with the patient lying on the side and 20–30 cmH 2 O with the patient sitting up.  In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10  |cmH_2_O|Centimetre_Of_Water|  . Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of  |jugular_veins|Jugular_Vein|  in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the  |intracranial_pressure|Intracranial_Pressure| .      |Hydrocephalus|Hydrocephalus|  is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.  Hydrocephalus can occur because of  |obstruction|Obstructive_Hydrocephalus|  of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or  |congenital_abnormality|Congenital_Abnormality| .  |Hydrocephalus_without_obstruction_associated_with_normal_CSF_pressure|Normal_Pressure_Hydrocephalus|  may also occur. Symptoms can include  |problems_with_gait|Gait_Dysfunction|  and  |coordination|Motor_Coordination| ,  |urinary_incontinence|Urinary_Incontinence| ,  |nausea|Nausea|  and  |vomiting|Vomiting| , and progressively impaired  |cognition|Cognition| . In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A  |CT_scan|Ct_Scan|  or  |MRI_scan|Mri_Scan|  may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and  |lumbar_puncture|Lumbar_Puncture|  may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.  Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a  |ventriculo-peritoneal_shunt|Ventriculo-Peritoneal_Shunt| , which diverts fluid to another part of the body.       |Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension|Idiopathic_Intracranial_Hypertension|  is a condition of unknown cause characterized by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches,  |double_vision|Double_Vision| , difficulties seeing, and a  |swollen_optic_disc|Papilledema| . It can occur in association with the use of Vitamin A and  |tetracycline|Tetracycline|  antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger  |obese|Obese|  women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a  |carbonic_anhydrase_inhibitor|Carbonic_Anhydrase_Inhibitor|  such as  |acetazolamide|Acetazolamide| , repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.        |CSF_can_leak|Cerebrospinal_Fluid_Leak|  from the  |dura|Dura_Mater|  as a result of different causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from  |no_known_cause|Idiopathy|  when it is termed a  |spontaneous_cerebrospinal_fluid_leak|Spontaneous_Cerebrospinal_Fluid_Leak| . It is usually associated with  |intracranial_hypotension|Intracranial_Hypotension| |beta-2_transferrin|Beta-2_Transferrin|  test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage.   |Medical_imaging|Medical_Imaging|  such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified.   |Caffeine|Caffeine| , given either orally or  |intravenous|Intravenous| ly, often offers symptomatic relief. Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a persons blood into the epidural space ,  |spinal_surgery|Spinal_Surgery| , or  |fibrin_glue|Fibrin_Glue| .             CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of  |neurological_diseases|Neurological_Disease| , usually obtained by a procedure called  |lumbar_puncture|Lumbar_Puncture| .  Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth  |lumbar_vertebrae|Lumbar_Vertebrae| . CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising,  |meningitis|Meningitis|  or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.     Testing often including observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying  |white|White_Blood_Cell|  and  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell|  within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and  |culturing|Microbiological_Culture|  the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and  |xanthochromia|Xanthochromia|  may indicate  |subarachnoid_hemorrhage|Subarachnoid_Hemorrhage| ; whereas  |central_nervous_system|Central_Nervous_System|  infections such as  |meningitis|Meningitis| , may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the  |microorganism|Microorganism|  that has caused the infection, or  |PCR|Polymerase_Chain_Reaction|  may be used to identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including  |multiple_sclerosis|Multiple_Sclerosis| ,  |paraneoplastic_syndromes|Paraneoplastic_Syndrome| ,  |systemic_lupus_erythematosus|Systemic_Lupus_Erythematosus| ,  |neurosarcoidosis|Neurosarcoidosis| ,  |cerebral_angiitis|Cerebral_Angiitis| ; and specific  |antibodies|Antibodies|  such as  |Aquaporin_4|Aquaporin_4|  may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of  |autoimmune|Autoimmune|  conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including  |idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension|Idiopathic_Intracranial_Hypertension|  and  |normal_pressure_hydrocephalus|Normal_Pressure_Hydrocephalus| .     Lumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the  |intracranial_pressure|Intracranial_Pressure| , which might be increased in certain types of  |hydrocephalus|Hydrocephalus| . However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to fatal  |brain_herniation|Brain_Herniation| .          Some  |anaesthetics|Anesthetic|  and  |chemotherapy|Chemotherapy|  are injected  |intrathecal|Intrathecal| ly into the subarachnoid space, where they spread around CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the  |blood-brain_barrier|Blood-Brain_Barrier|  can still be active throughout the central nervous system.   |Baricity|Baricity|  refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in  |general_anesthesia|General_Anesthesia|  to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the  |intrathecal|Intrathecal|  space.        Various comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF.  |Hippocrates|Hippocrates|  discussed water surrounding the brain when describing congenital  |hydrocephalus|Hydrocephalus| , and  |Galen|Galen|  referred to excremental liquid in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose. But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remained unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of CSF before the brain was examined.     The modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to  |Emanuel_Swedenborg|Emanuel_Swedenborg| . In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as spirituous lymph secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.       |Albrecht_von_Haller|Albrecht_Von_Haller| , a Swiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the water in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.  |Francois_Magendie|Francois_Magendie|  studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the  |pia_mater|Pia_Mater| .      |Thomas_Willis|Thomas_Willis|   made note of the fact that the consistency of CSF is altered in meningitis. In 1869  |Gustav_Schwalbe|Gustav_Schwalbe|  proposed that CSF drainage could occur via lymphatic vessels.     In 1891,  |W._Essex_Wynter|W._Essex_Wynter|  began treating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and  |Heinrich_Quincke|Heinrich_Quincke|  began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of CSF. In 1914,  |Harvey_W._Cushing|Harvey_W._Cushing|  published conclusive evidence that CSF is secreted by the  |choroid_plexus|Choroid_Plexus| .       During  |phylogenesis|Phylogenesis| , CSF is present within the  |neuraxis|Neuraxis|  before it circulates. The CSF of  |Teleostei|Teleostei|  fish is contained within the ventricles of the brains, but not in a nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in  |amniotes|Amniote|  and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.     The amount of cerebrospinal fluid varies by size and species.  In humans and other  |mammal|Mammal| .
