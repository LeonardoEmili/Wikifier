In  |geometry|Geometry| , a convex uniform honeycomb is a  |uniform|Uniform_Polytope| |tessellation|Tessellation|  which fills three-dimensional  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space|  with non-overlapping  |convex|Convex_Polyhedron| |uniform_polyhedral|Uniform_Polyhedron|  cells.     Twenty-eight such honeycombs are known:   the familiar  |cubic_honeycomb|Cubic_Honeycomb|  and 7 truncations thereof;   the  |alternated_cubic_honeycomb|Alternated_Cubic_Honeycomb|  and 4 truncations thereof;   10 prismatic forms based on the  |uniform_plane_tilings|Prismaticstacks|  ;   5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration.     They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the  |uniform_tilings_of_the_plane|List_Of_Uniform_Planar_Tilings| .     The  |Voronoi_diagram|Voronoi_Diagram|  of any  |lattice|Lattice|  forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are  |zonohedra|Zonohedra| .       1900 |Thorold_Gosset|Thorold_Gosset|  enumerated the list of semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells  in his publication On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions, including one regular cubic honeycomb, and two semiregular forms with tetrahedra and octahedra.   1905 |Alfredo_Andreini|Alfredo_Andreini|  enumerated 25 of these tessellations.   1991 |Norman_Johnsons|Norman_Johnson|  manuscript Uniform Polytopes identified the list of 28.    1994 |Branko_Gr端nbaum|Branko_Gr端nbaum| , in his paper Uniform tilings of 3-space, also independently enumerated all 28, after discovering errors in Andreinis publication. He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and  |4_being_missing|Convex_Uniform_Honeycombnonwythoffian_Forms| . Gr端nbaum states in this paper that Norman Johnson deserves priority for achieving the same enumeration in 1991. He also mentions that  |I._Alexeyev|I._Alexeyev|  of Russia had contacted him regarding a putative enumeration of these forms, but that Gr端nbaum was unable to verify this at the time.   2006Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs, along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs .
