        In  |physics|Physics|  and  |engineering|Engineering| , fluid dynamics is a subdiscipline of  |fluid_mechanics|Fluid_Mechanics|  that describes the flow of  |fluids|Fluid| — |liquids|Liquid|  and  |gas|Gas| es. It has several subdisciplines, including  |aerodynamics|Aerodynamics|  and hydrodynamics . Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating  |forces|Force|  and  |moments|Moment|  on  |aircraft|Aircraft| , determining the  |mass_flow_rate|Mass_Flow_Rate|  of  |petroleum|Petroleum|  through  |pipelines|Pipeline_Transport| ,  |predicting_weather_patterns|Weather_Forecasting| , understanding  |nebulae|Nebula|  in  |interstellar_space|Interstellar_Space|  and  |modelling_fission_weapon_detonation|Nuclear_Weapon_Design| .     Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these  |practical_disciplines|Practical_Disciplines| —that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from  |flow_measurement|Flow_Measurement|  and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as  |flow_velocity|Flow_Velocity| ,  |pressure|Pressure| ,  |density|Density| , and  |temperature|Temperature| , as functions of space and time.     Before the twentieth century, hydrodynamics was synonymous with fluid dynamics. This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like  |magnetohydrodynamics|Magnetohydrodynamics|  and  |hydrodynamic_stability|Hydrodynamic_Stability| , both of which can also be applied to gases.        The foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the  |conservation_laws|Conservation_Law| , specifically,  |conservation_of_mass|Conservation_Of_Mass| ,  |conservation_of_linear_momentum|Conservation_Of_Momentum| , and  |conservation_of_energy|Conservation_Of_Energy|  . These are based on  |classical_mechanics|Classical_Mechanics|  and are modified in  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  and  |general_relativity|General_Relativity| . They are expressed using the  |Reynolds_transport_theorem|Reynolds_Transport_Theorem| .     In addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the . Fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at  |infinitesimal|Infinitesimal| ly small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.     For fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for  |Newtonian_fluids|Newtonian_Fluid|  are the  |Navier–Stokes_equations|Navier–Stokes_Equations| —which is a  |non_linear|Non_Linear|  set of  |differential_equations|Differential_Equations|  that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general  |closed_form_solution|Solution_In_Closed_Form| , so they are primarily of use in  |Computational_Fluid_Dynamics|Computational_Fluid_Dynamics| . The equations can be simplified in a number of ways, all of which make them easier to solve. Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.     In addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a  |thermodynamic|Thermodynamics|  equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem. An example of this would be the  |perfect_gas_equation_of_state|Ideal_Gas_Law| p is pressure, ρ is density, T the absolute temperature, while R u  is the  |gas_constant|Gas_Constant|  and M is  |molar_mass|Molar_Mass|  for a particular gas.       Three conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in  |integral|Integral|  or  |differential|Differential|  form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a control volume. A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow. The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume. Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply  |Stokes_theorem|Stokes_Theorem|  to yield an expression which may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume within the flow.      |Mass_continuity|Continuity_Equationfluid_Dynamics|  : The rate of change of fluid mass inside a control volume must be equal to the net rate of fluid flow into the volume. Physically, this statement requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed in the control volume,  and can be translated into the integral form of the continuity equation:   ::       dV -        :Above,   is the fluid density, u is the  |flow_velocity|Flow_Velocity|  vector, and t is time. The left-hand side of the above expression is the rate of increase of mass within the volume and contains a triple integral over the control volume, whereas the right-hand side contains an integration over the surface of the control volume of mass convected into the system. Mass flow into the system is accounted as positive, and since the normal vector to the surface is opposite the sense of flow into the system the term is negated. The differential form of the continuity equation is, by the  |divergence_theorem|Divergence_Theorem| |Conservation_of_momentum|Momentum| |Newtons_second_law_of_motion|Newtons_Second_Law_Of_Motion|  applied to a control volume, is a statement that any change in momentum of the fluid within that control volume will be due to the net flow of momentum into the volume and the action of external forces acting on the fluid within the volume.     ::         dV -     -            dV +       :In the above integral formulation of this equation, the term on the left is the net change of momentum within the volume. The first term on the right is the net rate at which momentum is convected into the volume. The second term on the right is the force due to pressure on the volumes surfaces. The first two terms on the right are negated since momentum entering the system is accounted as positive, and the normal is opposite the direction of the velocity   and pressure forces. The third term on the right is the net acceleration of the mass within the volume due to any  |body_forces|Body_Force|  .  |Surface_forces|Surface_Force| , such as viscous forces, are represented by    , the net force due to  |shear_forces|Stress|  acting on the volume surface. The momentum balance can also be written for a moving control volume.          :The following is the differential form of the momentum conservation equation. Here, the volume is reduced to an infinitesimally small point, and both surface and body forces are accounted for in one total force, F. For example, F may be expanded into an expression for the frictional and gravitational forces acting at a point in a flow.   ::     -     :In aerodynamics, air is assumed to be a  |Newtonian_fluid|Newtonian_Fluid| , which posits a linear relationship between the shear stress and the rate of strain of the fluid. The equation above is a vector equation in a three-dimensional flow, but it can be expressed as three scalar equations in three coordinate directions. The conservation of momentum equations for the compressible, viscous flow case are called the Navier–Stokes equations.    |Conservation_of_energy|Conservation_Of_Energy| |energy|Energy|  can be converted from one form to another, the total  |energy|Energy|  in a closed system remains constant.     ::     +       +       :Above, h is  |enthalpy|Enthalpy| , k is the  |thermal_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity|  of the fluid, T is temperature, and   is the viscous dissipation function. The viscous dissipation function governs the rate at which mechanical energy of the flow is converted to heat. The  |second_law_of_thermodynamics|Second_Law_Of_Thermodynamics|  requires that the dissipation term is always positive: viscosity cannot create energy within the control volume.  The expression on the left side is a  |material_derivative|Material_Derivative| .       All fluids are  |compressible|Compressibility|  to some extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an  |incompressible_flow|Incompressible_Flow| . Otherwise the more general  |compressible_flow|Compressible_Flow|  equations must be used.     Mathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density ρ of a  |fluid_parcel|Fluid_Parcel|  does not change as it moves in the flow field, i.e.,   :   0   ,   where D/Dt is the  |material_derivative|Material_Derivative| , which is the sum of  |local|Time_Derivative|  and  |convective_derivatives|Convective_Derivative| . This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.     For flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the  |Mach_number|Mach_Number|  of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties and the flow conditions .  |Acoustic|Acoustics|  problems always require allowing compressibility, since  |sound_waves|Sound_Waves|  are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.            All fluids are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a  |strain_rate|Strain| ; it has dimensions T .  |Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  showed that for many familiar fluids such as  |water|Water|  and  |air|Earths_Atmosphere| , the  |stress|Stress|  due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called  |Newtonian_fluids|Newtonian_Fluids| . The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluids viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.      |Non_Newtonian_fluids|Non_Newtonian_Fluid|  have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of  |rheology|Rheology|  describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include  |emulsions|Emulsion|  and  |slurries|Slurries| , some  |viscoelastic|Viscoelasticity|  materials such as  |blood|Blood|  and some  |polymers|Polymer| , and sticky liquids such as  |latex|Latex| ,  |honey|Honey|  and  |lubricants|Lubricants| .         The dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of  |Newtons_second_law|Newtons_Second_Law| . An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects.     The  |Reynolds_number|Reynolds_Number|  is a  |dimensionless_quantity|Dimensionless_Quantity|  which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number  indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an  |inviscid_flow|Inviscid_Flow| , an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the  |Navier–Stokes_equations|Navier–Stokes_Equations|  to be simplified into the  |Euler_equations|Euler_Equations| . The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields  |Bernoullis_equation|Bernoullis_Equation| . When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is  |irrotational|Lamellar_Field|  everywhere, Bernoullis equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called  |potential_flows|Potential_Flow| , because the velocity field may be expressed as the  |gradient|Gradient|  of a potential energy expression.     This idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the  |no_slip_condition|No_Slip_Condition|  generates a thin region of large strain rate, the  |boundary_layer|Boundary_Layer| , in which  |viscosity|Viscosity|  effects dominate and which thus generates  |vorticity|Vorticity| . Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies , viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict  |drag_forces|Drag| , a limitation known as the  |dAlemberts_paradox|Dalemberts_Paradox| .     A commonly used model, especially in  |computational_fluid_dynamics|Computational_Fluid_Dynamics| , is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and  |boundary_layer|Boundary_Layer|  equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the  |method_of_matched_asymptotic_expansions|Method_Of_Matched_Asymptotic_Expansions| .
