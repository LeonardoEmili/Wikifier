During the Second World War paper shortages had a serious impact on pulp production, starting a steady rise in costs and the decline of the pulps. Beginning with Ellery Queens Mystery Magazine in 1941, pulp magazines began to switch to digest size ; smaller, thicker magazines. In 1949, Street & Smith closed most of their pulp magazines in order to move upmarket and produce slicks. Ashley , Michael.

In a more affluent post-war America, the price gap compared to slick magazines was far less significant. In the 1950s, mens adventure magazines began to replace the pulp.

Over the course of their evolution, there were a huge number of pulp magazine titles; Harry Steeger of Popular Publications claimed that his company alone had published over 300, and at their peak they were publishing 42 titles per month. Many titles of course survived only briefly. While the most popular titles were monthly, many were bimonthly and some were quarterly.     The collapse of the pulp industry changed the landscape of publishing because pulps were the single largest sales outlet for short stories. Combined with the decrease in slick magazine fiction markets, writers attempting to support themselves by creating fiction switched to novels and book-length anthologies of shorter pieces. Some ex-pulp writers like Hugh B. Cave and Robert Leslie Bellem moved on to writing for television by the 1950s.       Pulp magazines often contained a wide variety of genre fiction , including, but not limited to,   adventure   aviation   detective / mystery   fantasy   gangster   horror / occult   humor   railroad   romance   science fiction   Série Noire   spicy/saucy   sports   war   Westerns ; the Colorado artist Arthur Roy Mitchell is particularly known for his sketches of the covers of such western magazines.     The American Old West was a mainstay genre of early turn of the 20th century novels as well as later pulp magazines, and lasted longest of all the traditional pulps. In many ways, the later mens adventure was the replacement of pulps.     Many classic science fiction and crime novels were originally serialized in pulp magazines such as ": null

While the majority of pulp magazines were anthology titles featuring many different authors, characters and settings, some of the most enduring magazines were those that featured a single recurring character. These were often referred to as hero pulps because the recurring character was almost always a larger-than-life hero in the mold of Doc Savage or The Shadow .

        ":         Pulp covers were printed in color on higher-quality paper. They were famous for their half-dressed damsels in distress , usually awaiting a rescuing hero . Cover art played a major part in the marketing of pulp magazines. The early pulp magazines could boast covers by some distinguished American artists; The Popular Magazine had covers by N.C. Wyeth , and Edgar Franklin Wittmack contributed cover art to Argosy and Short Stories. Robinson, Frank M., and Davidson, Lawrence. Pulp Culture – The Art of Fiction Magazines. Collectors Press, 2007. . Later, many artists specialized in creating covers mainly for the pulps; a number of the most successful cover artists became as popular as the authors featured on the interior pages. Among the most famous pulp artists were Walter Baumhofer , Earle K. Bergey , Margaret Brundage , Edd Cartier , Virgil Finlay , Frank R. Paul , Norman Saunders , Nick Eggenhofer , , Hugh J. Ward , George Rozen , and Rudolph Belarski . The Adventure House Guide to the Pulps, edited by Doug Ellis, John Locke, and John Gunnison. Silver Spring, MD, Adventure House, 2000. . Covers were important enough to sales that sometimes they would be designed first; authors would then be shown the cover art and asked to write a story to match.     Later pulps began to feature interior illustrations, depicting elements of the stories. The drawings were printed in black ink on the same cream-colored paper used for the text, and had to use specific techniques to avoid blotting on the coarse texture of the cheap pulp. Thus, fine lines and heavy detail were usually not an option. Shading was by crosshatch ing or pointillism , and even that had to be limited and coarse. Usually the art was black lines on the papers background, but Finlay and a few others did some work that was primarily white lines against large dark areas.       Another way pulps kept costs down was by paying authors less than other markets; thus many eminent authors started out in the pulps before they were successful enough to sell to better-paying markets, and similarly, well-known authors whose careers were slumping or who wanted a few quick dollars could bolster their income with sales to pulps. Additionally, some of the earlier pulps solicited stories from amateurs who were quite happy to see their words in print and could thus be paid token amounts. John A. Dinan, Sports in the Pulp Magazines. McFarland, 1998, ISB0786404817 .     There were also career pulp writers, capable of turning out huge amounts of prose on a steady basis, often with the aid of dictation to stenographer s, machines or typist s. Before he became a novelist, Upton Sinclair was turning out at least 8,000 words per day seven days a week for the pulps, keeping two stenographers fully employed. Pulps would often have their authors use multiple pen names so that they could use multiple stories by the same person in one issue, or use a given authors stories in three or more successive issues, while still appearing to have varied content. One advantage pulps provided to authors was that they paid upon acceptance for material instead of on publication; since a story might be accepted months or even years before publication, to a working writer this was a crucial difference in cash flow .     Some pulp editors became known for cultivating good fiction and interesting features in their magazines. Preeminent pulp magazine editors included Arthur Sullivant Hoffman , Bleiler,Richard Forgotten Giant: Hoffman’s Adventure . Purple Prose Magazine, November 1998, p. 3-12. Robert H. Davis , Harry E. Maule , Sampson,Robert. Yesterdays Faces:Dangerous Horizons Popular Press, 1991, . Donald Kennicott , Joseph T. Shaw , Farnsworth Wright , John W. Campbell  and Daisy Bacon .

The Browne Popular Culture Library News noted:     Many of the paperback houses that contributed to the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were actually started by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and the newsstand distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines for reprints. This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. The Return of the Continental Op reprints material first published in Black Mask; Five Sinister Characters contains stories first published in Dime Detective; and The Pocket Book of Science Fiction collects material from Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.     In 1992, Rich W. Harvey came out with a magazine called Pulp Adventures reprinting old classics. It came out regularly until 2001, and then started up again in 2014.     In 1994, Quentin Tarantino directed the film ": null

        ". The working title of the film was Black Mask, in homage to the pulp magazine of that name , and it embodied the seedy, violent, often crime-related spirit found in pulp magazines.     In 1997 C. Cazadessus Jr. launched PULPDOM, a continuation of his Hugo Award-winning ERB-dom which began in 1960. It ran for 75 issues and featured articles about the content and selected fiction from the pulps. It became PULPDOM ONLINE in 2013 and continues quarterly publication.     After the year 2000, several small independent publishers released magazines which published short fiction, either short stories or novel-length presentations, in the tradition of the pulp magazines of the early 20th century. These included Blood N Thunder, High Adventure and a short-lived magazine which revived the title Argosy. These specialist publications, printed in limited press runs, were pointedly not printed on the brittle, high-acid wood pulp paper of the old publications and were not mass market publications targeted at a wide audience. In 2004, Lost Continent Library published Secret of the Amazon Queen by E.A. Guest, their first contribution to a New Pulp Era , featuring the hallmarks of pulp fiction for contemporary mature readers: violence, horror and sex. E.A. Guest was likened to a blend of pulp era icon Talbot Mundy and Stephen King by real-life explorer David Hatcher Childress.     In 2002, the tenth issue of ": null

The Scottish publisher DC Thomson publishes My Weekly Compact Novel every week. It is literally a pulp novel, though it does not fall into the hard-edged genre most associated with pulp fiction.
