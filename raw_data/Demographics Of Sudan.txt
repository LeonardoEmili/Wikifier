                     Sudanese people  and the  |demographic|Demographics|  features of the population of  |Sudan|Sudan| , including population density,  |ethnicity|Ethnic_Group| , education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.     In Sudans 1993 census, the population was calculated at 30 million. No comprehensive census has been carried out since that time due to the civil war. Estimates of Sudan, including the population of  |South_Sudan|South_Sudan| , ranged from 37 million to 45 million . Since the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, estimates place the current population of Sudan at about  million. The population of metropolitan  |Khartoum|Khartoum|   is growing rapidly and ranges from six to seven million, including around two million displaced persons from the southern war zone as well as western and eastern drought-affected areas.       The population of Sudan is a combination of indigenous inhabitants of the  |Nile_Valley|Nile_Valley| , and descendants of migrants from the  |Arabian_Peninsula|Arabian_Peninsula| . Due to the process of  |Arabisation|Arabisation|  common throughout the rest of the  |Arab_world|Arab_World| , today Arab culture predominates in Sudan. The ethnic groups of Sudan are  |Arabs|Sudanese_Arabs| , and the majority being African ethnic groups such as  |Nubians|Nubian_People| ,  |Beja|Beja_People| ,   |Fur|Fur_People| ,  |Nuba|Nuba| , and  |Fallata|Fula_People| .  When counted as one people  |Sudanese_Arabs|Sudanese_Arabs|  are by far the largest ethnic group in Sudan, however African ethnic groups greatly outnumber Sudanese Arabs if counted as one group. They are almost entirely Muslim; while the majority speak  |Sudanese_Arabic|Sudanese_Arabic| ; some other Arab tribes speak different Arabic dialects like  |Awadia_and_Fadnia|Awadia_And_Fadnia_Tribes|  and  |Bani_Arak|Arakieen|  tribes who speak  |Najdi_Arabic|Najdi_Arabic| ;  |Bani_Hassan|Beni_Ḥassān| ,  |Al-Ashraf|Al-Ashraf| ,  |Kinanah|Banu_Kinanah|  and  |Rashaida|Rashaida_People|  who speak  |Hejazi_Arabic|Hejazi_Arabic| . In addition, Arab tribes like the  |Baggara|Baggara|  and other  |Darfur|Darfur| ians, both who speak  |Chadian_Arabic|Chadian_Arabic| . The Darfur Conflict: Geography Or Institutions? Osman Suliman, Mohamed Osman Suliman, p.115 Sudanese Arabs of northern and eastern parts descend primarily from migrants from the Arabian Peninsula and some of the pre-existing indigenous populations of Sudan, most predominately the  |Nubian_people|Nubian_People|  who also share a common history with  |Egypt|Egypt| . Additionally, a few pre-Islamic Arabian tribes existed in Sudan from earlier migrations into the region from Western Arabia, although most Arabs in Sudan are dated from migrations after the 12th century.    The vast majority of Arab tribes in Sudan migrated into the Sudan in the 12th century, intermarried with the indigenous African populations and introduced Islam.        Achieving good counts of the population is difficult in Sudan, because conducting a census has been difficult due to various conflicts and wars in the southern, eastern and western regions of Sudan over the past few decades. The government of  |South_Sudan|South_Sudan|   has in the past accused Sudan of deliberately manipulating the census in oil-rich regions such as the  |Abyei|Abyei|  district, on the border between Sudan and South Sudan. The population count is a determining factor for the share of wealth and power each part of Sudan receives after the secession of South Sudan . Another complication is the Southern Sudanese refugees present in the north, whose citizenship in Sudan after the secession of South Sudan is now in question. Broere, Kees.

Before 2005, only Arabic was the official language. Leclerc, Jacques.  In the 2005 constitution, Sudans official languages became Arabic and English:                         97% of the population adheres to Islam, with the overwhelming majority being adherents of the  |Sunni|Sunni|  Sufi branch and the  |Maliki|Maliki|  school of  |Islamic_jurisprudence|Islamic_Jurisprudence| .  The remainder of the population follows either  |animist|Animist|  and indigenous beliefs or Christianity, especially in Khartoum and in southern regions of the country bordering  |South_Sudan|South_Sudan| .     Christians in Sudan which are refugees or immigrants from the south belong to various churches including the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| , small  |Melkite|Melkite_Greek_Catholic_Church|  and  |Maronite|Maronite_Church|  communities in the north, as well as  |Anglicans|Anglicanism|  followers in the  |Episcopal_Church_of_Sudan|Episcopal_Church_Of_The_Sudan|  and the recently formed Reformed Episcopal Church. There are significant but long-established groups of  |Coptic_Orthodox|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_Of_Alexandria|  and  |Greek_Orthodox|Greek_Orthodox_Church|  Christians in Khartoum and other northern cities.     There are also  |Ethiopian|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  and  |Eritrean_Orthodox|Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  communities in Khartoum and eastern Sudan, largely made up of refugees and migrants from the past few decades. Other Christian groups with smaller followings in the country include the Africa Inland Church, the  |Armenian_Apostolic_Church|Armenian_Apostolic_Church| , the Sudan Church of Christ, the Sudan Interior Church,  |Jehovahs_Witnesses|Jehovahs_Witnesses| , the Sudan Pentecostal Church, the Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church .     Religious identity plays a role in the countrys political divisions. Northern and western Muslims have dominated the countrys political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from  |Islamists|Islamists| ,  |Salafis|Salafis| / |Wahhabis|Wahhabis|  and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The  |Umma|Ummah|  Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan.     The Democratic Unionist Party includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia  |Sufi|Sufi|  sect.
