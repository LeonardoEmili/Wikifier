        Nerve agents, sometimes also called nerve gases, are a class of  |organic_chemicals|Organic_Chemistry|  that disrupt the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages to organs. The disruption is caused by the blocking of  |acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase| , an  |enzyme|Enzyme|  that catalyzes the breakdown of  |acetylcholine|Acetylcholine| , a  |neurotransmitter|Neurotransmitter| .     Poisoning by a nerve agent leads to constriction of  |pupils|Pupil| , profuse  |salivation|Salivation| ,  |convulsions|Convulsion| , and involuntary  |urination|Urination|  and  |defecation|Defecation| , with the first symptoms appearing in seconds after exposure. Death by  |asphyxiation|Asphyxiation|  or  |cardiac_arrest|Cardiac_Arrest|  may follow in minutes due to the loss of the bodys control over  |respiratory|Respiration|  and other muscles. Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or  |aerosol|Aerosol| ized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the  |respiratory_system|Respiratory_System| . Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a  |respirator|Respirator| .     Nerve agents are generally colorless to  |amber_colored|Amber| , tasteless liquids that may evaporate to a  |gas|Gas| . Agents  |sarin|Sarin|  and  |VX|Vx|  are odorless;  |tabun|Tabun|  has a slightly fruity odor and  |soman|Soman|  has a slight  |camphor|Camphor|  odor.        Nerve agents attack the  |nervous_system|Nervous_System| . All such agents function the same way resulting in  |cholinergic_crisis|Cholinergic_Crisis| |inhibit|Enzyme_Inhibitor|  the enzyme  |acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase| , which is responsible for the breakdown of  |acetylcholine|Acetylcholine|  in the  |synapses|Synapse|  between nerves that control muscle contraction. If the agent cannot be broken down, muscles are prevented from relaxing and they are effectively paralyzed.   This includes the heart and the muscles used for breathing. Because of this, the first symptoms usually appear within seconds of exposure and death can occur via  |asphyxia|Asphyxia| tion or  |cardiac_arrest|Cardiac_Arrest|  in a few minutes.     Initial symptoms following exposure to nerve agents  are a runny nose, tightness in the chest, and  |constriction_of_the_pupils|Miosis| . Soon after, the victim will have difficulty breathing and will experience nausea and salivation. As the victim continues to lose control of bodily functions, involuntary  |salivation|Salivation| ,  |lacrimation|Tears| ,  |urination|Urination| ,  |defecation|Defecation| ,    |gastrointestinal|Gastrointestinal|  pain and  |vomiting|Vomiting|  will be experienced.  |Blisters|Blister|  and burning of the eyes and/or lungs may also occur.   This phase is followed by initially  |myoclonic_jerks|Myoclonic_Jerks|  followed by  |status_epilepticus|Status_Epilepticus|  -type epileptic seizure. Death then comes via complete respiratory depression, most likely via the excessive peripheral activity at the  |neuromuscular_junction|Neuromuscular_Junction|  of the  |diaphragm|Thoracic_Diaphragm| .      The effects of nerve agents are long lasting and increase with continued exposure. Survivors of nerve agent poisoning almost invariably suffer chronic neurological damage and related  |psychiatric|Psychiatric|  effects.  Possible effects that can last at least up to 2–3 years after exposure include blurred vision,  |tiredness|Fatigue| , declined memory, hoarse voice,  |palpitations|Palpitations| ,  |sleeplessness|Insomnia| , shoulder stiffness and  |eye_strain|Eye_Strain| . In people exposed to nerve agents,  |serum|Serum|  and  |erythrocyte|Red_Blood_Cell|  acetylcholinesterase in the long-term are noticeably lower than normal and tend to be lower the worse the persisting symptoms are.         When a normally functioning  |motor_nerve|Motor_Nerve|  is stimulated, it releases the  |neurotransmitter|Neurotransmitter| |_acetylcholine|Acetylcholine| , which transmits the impulse to a muscle or organ. Once the impulse is sent, the enzyme  |acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase|  immediately breaks down the acetylcholine in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.     Nerve agents disrupt the nervous system by inhibiting the function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase by forming a  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond|  with its  |active_site|Active_Site| , where acetylcholine would normally be broken down . Acetylcholine thus builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. This same action also occurs at the gland and organ levels, resulting in uncontrolled drooling, tearing of the eyes and excess production of mucus from the nose .     The reaction product of the most important nerve agents, including soman, sarin, tabun and VX, with  |acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase|  were solved by the U.S. Army using  |X_ray_crystallography|X_Ray_Crystallography|  in the 1990s.   The reaction products have been confirmed subsequently using different sources of acetylcholinesterase and the closely related target enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase. The X-ray structures clarify important aspects of the reaction mechanism at atomic resolution and provide a key tool for antidote development.        |Atropine|Atropine|  and related  |anticholinergic|Anticholinergic|  drugs act as antidotes to nerve agent poisoning because they block acetylcholine receptors, but they are poisonous in their own right.  Some synthetic anticholinergics, such as  |biperiden|Biperiden| ,  may counteract the central symptoms of nerve agent poisoning better than atropine, since they pass the  |blood–brain_barrier|Blood–Brain_Barrier|  better than atropine.  While these drugs will save the life of a person affected by nerve agents, that person may be incapacitated briefly or for an extended period, depending on the extent of exposure. The endpoint of atropine administration is the clearing of bronchial secretions. Atropine for field use by military personnel is often loaded in an  |autoinjector|Autoinjector|  , for ease of use in stressful conditions.      |Pralidoxime_chloride|Pralidoxime_Chloride| , also known as 2-PAM chloride, is also used as an antidote. Rather than counteracting the initial effects of the nerve agent on the nervous system as does atropine, pralidoxime chloride reactivates the poisoned enzyme by scavenging the phosphoryl group attached on the functional hydroxyl group of the enzyme.  Though safer to use than atropine, it takes longer to act.     Revival of acetylcholinesterase with pralidoxime chloride works more effectively on  |nicotinic_receptors|Nicotinic_Receptors|  while blocking acetylcholine receptors with atropine is more effective on  |muscarinic_receptors|Muscarinic_Receptors| . Often, severe cases of poisoning are treated with both drugs.        |Butyrylcholinesterase|Butyrylcholinesterase|  is under development by the U.S. Department of Defense as a  |prophylactic|Prophylactic| |_countermeasure|Countermeasure|  against  |organophosphate|Organophosphate|  nerve agents. It binds nerve agent in the bloodstream before the poison can exert effects in the nervous system.      Both purified  |acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase|  and  |butyrylcholinesterase|Butyrylcholinesterase|  have demonstrated success in animal studies as biological scavengers to provide  |stoichiometric|Stoichiometry|  protection against the entire spectrum of organophosphate nerve agents.   Butyrylcholinesterase currently is the preferred enzyme for development as a pharmaceutical drug primarily because it is a naturally circulating human plasma protein  and its larger active site compared with acetylcholinesterase may permit greater flexibility for future design and improvement of butyrylcholinesterase to act as a nerve agent scavenger.        There are two main classes of nerve agents. The members of the two classes share similar properties and are given both a common name  and a two-character  |NATO|Nato|  identifier .             The G-series is thus named because German scientists first synthesized them. G series agents are known as non-persistent, while the V series are persistent. All of the compounds in this class were discovered and synthesized during or prior to  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , led by  |Gerhard_Schrader|Gerhard_Schrader|  .     This series is the first and oldest family of nerve agents. The first nerve agent ever synthesised was GA  in 1936. GB  was discovered next in 1939, followed by GD  in 1944, and finally the more obscure GF  in 1949. GB was the only G agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets,  |aerial_bombs|Aerial_Bombs| , and  |artillery_shells|Artillery_Shell| .                  The V-series is the second family of nerve agents and contains five well known members:  |VE|Ve| ,  |VG|Vg| ,  |VM|Vm| ,  |VR|Vr| , and  |VX|Vx| , along with several more obscure analogues.     The most studied agent in this family,  |VX|Vx| , was invented in the 1950s at  |Porton_Down|Porton_Down|  in the United Kingdom. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of  |Imperial_Chemical_Industries|Imperial_Chemical_Industries|  was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds . Like Schrader, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name  |Amiton|Vg| . It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed and some of the more toxic materials had been sent to the British Armed Forces research facility at  |Porton_Down|Porton_Down|  for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents . The best known of these is probably  |VX|Vx| , with VR coming a close second . All of the V-agents are persistent agents, meaning that these agents do not degrade or wash away easily and can therefore remain on clothes and other surfaces for long periods. In use, this allows the V-agents to be used to blanket terrain to guide or curtail the movement of enemy ground forces. The consistency of these agents is similar to oil; as a result, the contact hazard for V-agents is primarily – but not exclusively – dermal. VX was the only V-series agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets,  |artillery_shells|Artillery_Shell| , airplane spray tanks, and  |landmines|Landmine| . FM 3-8 Chemical Reference handbook; US Army; 1967  , U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, December 26, 2007, accessed January 4, 2007          The Novichok  agents, a series of  |organophosphate|Organophosphate|  compounds, were developed in the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and in Russia from the mid-1960s to the 1990s. The Novichok program aimed to develop and manufacture highly deadly chemical weapons that were unknown to the West. The new agents were designed to be undetectable by standard NATO chemical-detection equipment and to defeat chemical-protective gear.     In addition to the newly-developed third generation weapons, binary versions of several Soviet agents were developed and were designated as Novichok agents.       Contrary to some claims,   not all nerve agents are  |organophosphates|Organophosphate| . A large group of them are  |carbamates|Carbamate|  like  |EA_3990|Ea_3990|  and  |EA_4056|Ea_4056| , both of which have been claimed to be about 3 times more toxic than VX. Both the USA  and the Soviet Union        developed carbamate nerve agents during the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| . They are sometimes grouped as fourth generation agents along with the Novichok agents due to their falling outside the definitions of controlled substances under the  |_CWC|Chemical_Weapons_Convention| .       Some  |insecticides|Insecticide| , including  |carbamates|Carbamates|  and  |organophosphates|Organophosphates|  such as  |dichlorvos|Dichlorvos| ,  |malathion|Malathion|  and  |parathion|Parathion| , are nerve agents. The metabolism of  |insects|Insect|  is sufficiently different from  |mammals|Mammal|  that these compounds have little effect on humans and other mammals at proper doses, but there is considerable concern about the effects of long-term exposure to these chemicals by farm workers and animals alike. At high enough doses,  |acute|Acute|  toxicity and death can occur through the same mechanism as other nerve agents. Some insecticides such as  |demeton|Demeton| ,  |dimefox|Dimefox|  and  |paraoxon|Paraoxon|  are sufficiently toxic to humans that they have been withdrawn from agricultural use, and were at one stage investigated for potential military applications. Paraoxon was allegedly used as an assassination weapon by the apartheid South African government as part of  |Project_Coast|Project_Coast| . Organophosphate  |pesticide_poisoning|Pesticide_Poisoning|  is a major cause of disability in many developing countries and is often the preferred method of suicide.        Many methods exist for spreading nerve agents such as:   uncontrolled  |aerosol|Aerosol|  munitions   smoke generation   explosive dissemination    |atomizers|Aerosolgeneration_And_Applications| ,  |humidifiers|Humidifier|  and  |foggers|Fogger|    The method chosen will depend on the physical properties of the nerve agent used, the nature of the target, and the achievable level of sophistication.                 This first class of nerve agents, the G-series, was accidentally discovered in Germany on December 23, 1936, by a research team headed by  |Gerhard_Schrader|Gerhard_Schrader|  working for  |IG_Farben|Ig_Farben| . Since 1934, Schrader had been working in a laboratory in  |Leverkusen|Leverkusen|  to develop new types of  |insecticides|Insecticide|  for  |IG_Farben|Ig_Farben| . While working toward his goal of improved insecticide, Schrader experimented with numerous compounds, eventually leading to the preparation of  |tabun|Tabun| .     In experiments, tabun was extremely potent against insects: as little as 5  |ppm|Parts_Per_Million|  of tabun killed all the  |leaf_lice|Aphids|  he used in his initial experiment. In January 1937, Schrader observed the effects of nerve agents on human beings first-hand when a drop of tabun spilled onto a lab bench. Within minutes he and his laboratory assistant began to experience  |miosis|Miosis|  , dizziness and severe shortness of breath. It took them three weeks to recover fully.     In 1935 the  |Nazi|Nazism|  government had passed a decree that required all inventions of possible military significance to be reported to the  |Ministry_of_War|Ministry_Of_The_Reichswehr| , so in May 1937 Schrader sent a sample of tabun to the  |chemical_warfare|Chemical_Warfare|  section of the  |Army_Weapons_Office|Waffenamt|  in  |Berlin_Spandau|Berlin_Spandau| . Schrader was summoned to the Wehrmacht chemical lab in Berlin to give a demonstration, after which Schraders  |patent|Patent|  application and all related research was classified as secret. Colonel Rüdiger, head of the CW section, ordered the construction of new laboratories for the further investigation of tabun and other organophosphate compounds and Schrader soon moved to a new laboratory at  |Wuppertal|Wuppertal| - |Elberfeld|Elberfeld|  in the  |Ruhr_valley|Ruhr_Valley|  to continue his research in secret throughout  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . The compound was initially codenamed Le-100 and later Trilon-83.      |Sarin|Sarin|  was discovered by Schrader and his team in 1938 and named in honor of its discoverers:  |Schrader|Gerhard_Schrader| ,  |Ambros|Otto_Ambros| , Gerhard Ritter, and von der Linde.      It was codenamed T-144 or Trilon-46. It was found to be more than ten times as potent as tabun.      |Soman|Soman|  was discovered by  |Richard_Kuhn|Richard_Kuhn|  in 1944 as he worked with the existing compounds; the name is derived from either the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  to sleep or the  |Latin|Latin|  to bludgeon. It was codenamed T-300.      |Cyclosarin|Cyclosarin|  was also discovered during WWII but the details were lost and it was rediscovered in 1949.     The G-series naming system was created by the United States when it uncovered the German activities, labeling tabun as GA , sarin as GB and soman as GD. Ethyl sarin was tagged GE and cyclosarin as GF.       In 1939, a pilot  |plant|Factory|  for tabun production was set up at  |Munster_Lager|Munster_Training_Areamunsterlager| , on  |Lüneburg_Heath|Lüneburg_Heath|  near the German Army proving grounds at . In January 1940, construction began on a secret plant, code named  |Hochwerk|Hochwerk|  , for the production of tabun at Dyhernfurth an der Oder , on the  |Oder_River|Oder_River|   from  |Breslau|Breslau|   in  |Silesia|Silesia| .     The plant was large, covering an area of  and was completely self-contained, synthesizing all intermediates as well as the final product, tabun. The factory even had an underground plant for filling munitions, which were then stored at Krappitz  in Upper Silesia. The plant was operated by , a subsidiary of  |IG_Farben|Ig_Farben| , as were all other  |chemical_weapon_agent|Chemical_Weapon_Agent|  production plants in Germany at the time.     Because of the plants deep secrecy and the difficult nature of the production process, it took from January 1940 until June 1942 for the plant to become fully operational. Many of tabuns chemical precursors were so corrosive that reaction chambers not lined with quartz or silver soon became useless. Tabun itself was so hazardous that the final processes had to be performed while enclosed in double glass-lined chambers with a stream of pressurized air circulating between the walls.     Three thousand German nationals were employed at Hochwerk, all equipped with  |respirators|Respirators|  and  |clothing|Clothing|  constructed of a poly-layered rubber/cloth/rubber sandwich that was destroyed after the tenth wearing. Despite all precautions, there were over 300 accidents before production even began and at least ten workers died during the two and a half years of operation. Some incidents cited in A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare are as follows:    Four pipe fitters had liquid tabun drain onto them and died before their rubber suits could be removed.   A worker had two liters of tabun pour down the neck of his rubber suit. He died within two minutes.   Seven workers were hit in the face with a stream of tabun of such force that the liquid was forced behind their respirators. Only two survived despite  |resuscitation|Resuscitation|  measures.      and moved, probably to  |Dzerzhinsk|Dzerzhinsk_Russia| ,  |USSR|Soviet_Union| .       In 1940 the  |German_Army_Weapons_Office|German_Army_Weapons_Office|  ordered the mass production of sarin for wartime use. A number of pilot plants were built and a high-production facility was under construction by the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Estimates for total sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500   |kg|Kilogram|  to 10  |tons|Ton| .     During that time, German  |intelligence|Intelligence|  believed that the  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  also knew of these compounds, assuming that because these compounds were not discussed in the Allies scientific journals information about them was being suppressed. Though sarin, tabun and soman were incorporated into  |artillery|Artillery|  shells, the German government ultimately decided not to use nerve agents against Allied targets. The Allies did not learn of these agents until shells filled with them were captured towards the end of the war. German forces used chemical warfare against partisans during the  |Battle_of_the_Kerch_Peninsula|Battle_Of_The_Kerch_Peninsula|  in 1942, but did not use any nerve agent. Bellamy, Chris . Absolute War: Soviet Russia in the Second World War. Knopf.     This is detailed in Joseph Borkins book The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben            Since World War II, Iraqs use of mustard gas against Iranian troops and  |Kurds|Kurdish_People|   has been the only large-scale use of any chemical weapons. On the scale of the single Kurdish village of  |Halabja|Halabja|  within its own territory, Iraqi forces did expose the populace to some kind of chemical weapons, possibly mustard gas and most likely nerve agents.      Operatives of the  |Aum_Shinrikyo|Aum_Shinrikyo|  religious group made and used  |Sarin|Sarin|  several times on other Japanese, most notably the  |Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack|Tokyo_Subway_Sarin_Attack| .       In the  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , no nerve agents were used, but a number of U.S. and UK personnel were exposed to them when the  |Khamisiyah|Khamisiyah|  chemical depot was destroyed. This and the widespread use of anticholinergic drugs as a protective treatment against any possible nerve gas attack have been proposed as a possible cause of  |Gulf_War_syndrome|Gulf_War_Syndrome| .       |Sarin|Sarin|  gas was deployed in  |a_2013_attack|Ghouta_Chemical_Attack|  on  |Ghouta|Ghouta|  during the  |Syrian_Civil_War|Syrian_Civil_War| , killing several hundred people. Most governments contend that forces loyal to President  |Bashar_al_Assad|Bashar_Al_Assad|  deployed the gas;  however, the  |Syrian_Government|Syrian_Government|  has denied responsibility.     On 13 February 2017, the nerve agent  |VX|Vx|  was used in the  |assassination_of_Kim_Jong_nam|Assassination_Of_Kim_Jong_Nam| , half-brother of the North Korean leader  |Kim_Jong_un|Kim_Jong_Un| , at  |Kuala_Lumpur_International_Airport|Kuala_Lumpur_International_Airport|  in  |Malaysia|Malaysia| .      On 4 March 2018, a former Russian agent ,  |Sergei_Skripal|Sergei_Skripal|  and his daughter, who was visiting from Moscow, were both poisoned by a nerve agent. They survived and were subsequently released from the hospital.  In addition, a  |Wiltshire_Police|Wiltshire_Police|  officer, Nick Bailey, was exposed to the substance. He was one of the first to respond to the incident. Twenty-one members of the public received medical treatment following exposure to the nerve agent. Despite this, only Bailey and the Skripals remained in critical conditions.  On 11 March 2018,  |Public_Health_England|Public_Health_England|  issued advice for the other people believed to have been in the Mill pub or the nearby  |Zizzi|Zizzi|  Restaurant.  On 12 March 2018, British Prime Minister  |Theresa_May|Theresa_May|  stated that the substance used was a Novichok nerve agent.        In 1972, the United States Congress banned the practice of disposing chemical weapons into the ocean. 32 000  |tons|Ton|  of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the ocean waters off the United States by the U.S. Army, primarily as part of  |Operation_CHASE|Operation_Chase| . According to a 1998 report by William Brankowitz, a deputy project manager in the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, the Army created at least 26 chemical weapons dump sites in the ocean off at least 11 states on both the west and east coasts. Due to poor records, they currently only know the rough whereabouts of half of them.      There is currently a lack of scientific data regarding the ecological and health effects of this dumping. In the event of leakage, many nerve agents are soluble in water and would dissolve in a few days, while other substances like  |sulfur_mustard|Sulfur_Mustard|  could last longer. There have also been a few incidents of chemical weapons washing ashore or being accidentally retrieved, for example during dredging or  |trawl_fishing|Trawling|  operations.            The methods of detecting gaseous nerve agents include but are not limited to the following.       Laser  |photoacoustic_spectroscopy|Photoacoustic_Spectroscopy|  is a method that has been used to detect nerve agents in the air. In this method, laser light is absorbed by gaseous matter. This causes a heating/cooling cycle and changes in pressure. Sensitive microphones convey sound waves that result from the pressure changes. Scientists at the  |U_S_Army_Research_Laboratory|United_States_Army_Research_Laboratory|  engineered an LPAS system that can detect multiple trace amounts of toxic gases in one air sample.      This technology contained three lasers  |modulated|Modulation|  to different frequency, each producing a different sound wave tone. The different wavelengths of light were directed into a sensor referred to as the photoacoustic cell. Within the cell were the vapors of different nerve agents. The traces of each nerve agent had a signature effect on the “loudness” of the lasers’ sound wave tones.  Some overlap of nerve agents’ effects did occur in the acoustic results. However, it was predicted that specificity would increase as additional lasers with unique wavelengths were added. Yet, too many lasers set to different wavelengths could result in overlap of absorption spectra. Citation LPAS technology can identify gases in parts per billion concentrations.       The following nerve agents have been identified with this multiwavelength LPAS:     dimethyl methyl phosphonate   diethyl methyl phosphonate   diisopropyl methyl phosphonate   dimethylpolysiloxane , triethyl phosphate   tributyl phosphate   two volatile organic compounds   acetone   isopropanol     Other gases and air contaminants identified with LPAS include:      CO 2   Benzene   Formaldehyde   Acetaldehyde   Ammonia   NOx   SO 2   Ethylene Glycol   TATP   TNT        |Non_dispersive_infrared|Nondispersive_Infrared_Sensor|  techniques have been reported to be used for gaseous nerve agent detection.        Traditional  |IR|Infrared_Spectroscopy|  absorption has been reported to detect gaseous nerve agents.        |Fourier_transform_infrared|Fourier_Transform_Infrared_Spectroscopy| .
