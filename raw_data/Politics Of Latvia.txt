        The politics of Latvia takes place in a framework of a  |parliamentary|Parliamentary_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |republic|Republic| , whereby the  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Latvia|  is the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and of a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| . The  |President|List_Of_Presidents_Of_Latvia|  holds a primarily ceremonial role as Head of State.  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the government.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the  |government|Forms_Of_Government|  and parliament, the  |Saeima|Saeima| . The  |Judiciary|Judiciary|  is independent of the executive and the legislature.        On March 19, 1991 the Supreme Council passed a law explicitly guaranteeing equal rights to all nationalities and ethnic groups and guarantees to all permanent residents in the Republic regardless of their nationality, equal rights to work and wages. The law also prohibits any activity directed toward nationality discrimination or the promotion of national superiority or hatred.     In autumn 1992 Latvia re-implemented significant portions of its 1922 constitution and in spring 1993 the government took a census to determine eligibility for citizenship. After almost three years of deliberations, Latvia finalized a citizenship and naturalization law in summer 1994.     In the 5–6 June 1993 elections, with a turnout of over 90%, eight of Latvias 23 registered political parties passed the four percent threshold to enter parliament. The Popular Front, which spearheaded the drive for independence two years previously with a 75% majority in the last parliamentary elections in 1990, did not qualify for representation. The centrist  |Latvian_Way|Latvian_Way|  party received a 33% plurality of votes and joined with the Farmers Union to head a center-right coalition government.     Led by the opposition  |National_Conservative_Party|Latvian_National_Independence_Movement| , right-wing nationalists won a majority of the seats nationwide and also captured the  |Riga|Riga|  mayoralty in the 29 May 1994 municipal elections.  |OSCE|Organization_For_Security_And_Co-Operation_In_Europe|  and COE observers pronounced the elections free and fair, and turnout averaged about 60%. In February 1995, the Council of Europe granted Latvia membership.     With  |President_Bill_Clintons|Bill_Clinton|  assistance, on 30 April 1994 Latvia and Russia signed a troop withdrawal agreement. Russia withdrew its troops by 31 August 1994, but maintained several hundred technical specialists to staff an OSCE-monitored phased-array  |ABM|Anti-Ballistic_Missile|  radar station at Skrunda until 31 August 1998.     The 30 September-1 October 1995 elections produced a deeply fragmented parliament with nine parties represented and the largest party - the newly founded centrist  |Democratic_Party_Saimnieks|Democratic_Party_Saimnieks|  - commanding only 18 of 100 seats. Attempts to form right-of-center and left-wing governments failed; 7 weeks after the election, a broad but fractious coalition government of six of the nine parties was voted into office under Prime Minister  |Andris_Šķēle|Andris_Šķēle| , a nonpartisan businessman. The also-popular president,  |Guntis_Ulmanis|Guntis_Ulmanis| , had limited constitutional powers but played a key role in leading the various political forces to agree finally to this broad coalition. In June 1996, the Saeima re-elected Ulmanis to another 3-year term. In the summer of 1997, the daily newspaper Diena revealed that half the cabinet ministers and two-thirds of parliamentarians appeared to violate the 1996 anti-corruption law, which bars senior officials from holding positions in private business. Under pressure from Šķēle, several ministers subsequently resigned or were fired. However, after months of increasing hostility between Šķēle and leading coalition politicians, the coalition parties demanded and received the prime ministers resignation on 28 July. The new government was formed by the recent Minister of Economy  |Guntars_Krasts|Guntars_Krasts| . It included the same parties and mostly the same ministers as Šķēles government. It pursued the same course of reform, albeit not as vigorously.     In the 1998 elections, the Latvian party structure began to consolidate with only six parties winning seats in the Saeima. Andris Šķēles newly formed  |Peoples_Party|Peoples_Party|  garnered a plurality with 24 seats. Though the election represented a victory for the center-right, personality conflicts and scandals within the two largest right of center parties   |Latvian_Way|Latvian_Way|  and the  |Peoples_Party|Peoples_Party|   prevented stable coalitions from forming. Two shaky governments under  |Vilis_Krištopans|Vilis_Krištopans|  and Andris Šķēle quickly collapsed in less than a year. In May 2000, a compromise candidate was found in the form of Andris Bērziņš, the  |Latvian_Way|Latvian_Way|  mayor of Rīga. His four-party coalition government lasted till the next elections in 2002.     In 1999, the Saeima elected  |Vaira_Vīķe-Freiberga|Vaira_Vīķe-Freiberga| , a compromise candidate with no party affiliation, to the presidency.  Though born in Rīga in 1937, she settled in Canada during the years of the Soviet occupation, becoming a well-respected academic in the subject of Latvian culture. Since her election, she has become one of the most popular political figures in Latvia.     Local elections in 2001 represented a victory for the left-of-center parties in several municipalities, including Rīga. A leftist coalition in the Rīga City Council elected  |Gundars_Bojārs|Gundars_Bojārs| , a Social Democrat, to the office of mayor.      Between local elections in 2001 and Saeima elections in 2002, two new parties formed: the conservative  |New_Era_Party|New_Era_Party|  led by  |Einars_Repše|Einars_Repše|  and Christian Democratic  |Latvias_First_Party|Latvias_First_Party| . Both of them promised to fight corruption and made that the most important issue in 2002 elections. Six parties were elected to Saeima in 2002 elections.  |New_Era_Party|New_Era_Party|  with 26 seats out of 100 became the largest party in the parliament. Several previously successful parties such as  |Latvian_Way|Latvian_Way|  and the Social Democrats did not reach the 5% threshold of the popular vote needed to be in the parliament. This was mostly due to voters perceiving these parties as corrupt. After elections, Einars Repše formed a government consisting of his  |New_Era_Party|New_Era_Party|  and three other parties.      In 2003, Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga was reelected to the presidency for the second term, until 2007.  On 20 September 2003, Latvia voted to join the European Union in a  |referendum|2003_Latvian_European_Union_Membership_Referendum| . Virtually all of major political parties and major Latvian-language media supported the YES vote. Latvian government also spent significant amount of money for the YES campaign. The NO campaign lacked both funding and media access. Out of voters who participated in the referendum, 66.9% of cast votes in favor of EU. The vote was largely along the ethnic lines. It is estimated that 84% of ethnic Latvians voted YES, while 91% of ethnic Russians voted NO .     After the referendum, Repšes government started to fall apart and he eventually resigned in January 2004. A new government, led by  |Indulis_Emsis|Indulis_Emsis| , head of the conservative  |Union_of_Greens_and_Farmers|Union_Of_Greens_And_Farmers|  was approved by the parliament in March 2004. The government was a coalition of the ZZS, the  |Peoples_Party|Peoples_Party|  , and the  |Latvias_First_Party|Latvias_First_Party|  ; the coalition had only 46 out of 100 seats in Latvias parliament, but was also supported by the leftist  |National_Harmony_Party|National_Harmony_Party|  . After the Saeima did not accept the budget for 2005 proposed by the government of Indulis Emsis, the government resigned. On 2 December 2004,  |Aigars_Kalvītis|Aigars_Kalvītis|  became the new Prime Minister and thus head of the government.     Kalvītis was the first prime minister in the history of post-soviet independent Latvia whose government was reelected by an election in 2006. New Era Party, however, weakened, so a coalition reshuffle took place, and a 4-party centre-right coalition emerged. The government lasted only until 5 December 2007, when Kalvitis resigned  due to his continuous and unsuccessful attempts to dismiss  |Aleksejs_Loskutovs|Aleksejs_Loskutovs| , the head of  |KNAB|Corruption_Prevention_And_Combating_Bureau| , the State Anti-Corruption Agency, after Loskutovs had investigated shadowy matters of the PMs party.     After negotiations, a crisis-handling government was formed, with the participation of the same parties, led by former PM  |Ivars_Godmanis|Ivars_Godmanis| , a respectable public figure, and member of  |Latvian_Way|Latvian_Way| . The government tried to impose  |austerity|Austerity|  measures, with moderate success. This was accompanied, though, with a widespread public opposition, which resulted in two referenda, one on  |pensions|2008_Latvian_Pensions_Law_Referendum| , the other on  |constitutional_amendments|2008_Latvian_Constitutional_Referendum| , which would have allowed the electorate to initiate the dissolution of the parliament.     Both of the referenda failed,   but the country entered into the worst political crisis since the independence from the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , together with the economic situation severely deteriorating, due to the world financial crisis. The popularity of the governing parties melted and was below the parliamentary threshold. By the end of 2008, parties had a hard time agreeing on further budget cuts, the planned reorganization of the government, and layoffs.     On 13 January 2009, there were  |severe_riots_in_Riga|2009_Riga_Riot| , with protesters attacking the building of the parliament. The President  |Valdis_Zatlers|Valdis_Zatlers|  gave an ultimatum to parties, saying that should they not agree on constitutional amendments about the dissolution of the  |Saeima|Saeima| , he would dissolve the parliament by the end of March.  After background talks and a failed  |vote_of_no_confidence|Vote_Of_No_Confidence| , PM Ivars Godmanis chose to resign in late February.  On the 26 February, Zatlers nominated the candidate of  |New_Era_Party|New_Era_Party| ,  |MEP|Member_Of_The_European_Parliament| |Valdis_Dombrovskis|Valdis_Dombrovskis|  to the post of prime minister.  After talks, on 4 March 2009 five parties confirmed their participation in the coalition: New Era, Peoples Party, Union of Greens and Peasants,  |For_Fatherland_and_Freedom/LNNK|For_Fatherland_And_Freedom/Lnnk| , and Civic Union.            The current edition of the citizenship law was adopted in 1998 after much debate and pressure from  |Russia|Russia|  and  |European_Union|European_Union| , amending a more restrictive law, initially passed in 1994. In accordance with law, Latvian citizens are those who had Latvian citizenship prior to June 17, 1940, and their descendants. Those who settled in Latvia during the  |Soviet_occupation|Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic| , with exception of those who did so subsequent to retirement from the  |Soviet_Army|Soviet_Army| , or were employees, informers, agents or safehouse keepers of the  |KGB|Kgb| , or of the security services, intelligence services or other special services of some other foreign state, see Section 11., 5.
