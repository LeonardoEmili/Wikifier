Chemical engineering is a branch of  |engineering|Engineering|  that uses principles of  |chemistry|Chemistry| ,  |physics|Physics| ,  |mathematics|Mathematics| ,  |biology|Biology| , and  |economics|Economics|  to efficiently use, produce, design, transport and transform energy and materials. The work of chemical engineers can range from the utilisation of nano-technology and nano-materials in the laboratory to large-scale industrial processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.     Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments,  |process_design|Process_Engineering|  and analysis,  |modeling|Modeling_And_Simulation| ,  |control_engineering|Control_Engineering| ,  |chemical_reaction_engineering|Chemical_Reaction_Engineering| ,  |nuclear_engineering|Nuclear_Engineering| ,  |biological_engineering|Biological_Engineering| , construction specification, and operating instructions.     Chemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical Engineering or Process Engineering. Practising engineers may have professional certification and be accredited members of a professional body. Such bodies include the  |Institution_of_Chemical_Engineers|Institution_Of_Chemical_Engineers|  or the  |American_Institute_of_Chemical_Engineers|American_Institute_Of_Chemical_Engineers|  .   A degree in chemical engineering is directly linked with all of the other engineering disciplines, to various extents.            A 1996  British Journal for the History of Science  article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| . In the same paper however,  |George_E_Davis|George_E_Davis| , an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term. Davis also tried to found a Society of Chemical Engineering, but instead it was named the  |Society_of_Chemical_Industry|Society_Of_Chemical_Industry|  , with Davis as its first Secretary.   The History of Science in United States: An Encyclopedia puts the use of the term around 1890. Chemical engineering , describing the use of mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850. By 1910, the profession, chemical engineer, was already in common use in Britain and the United States.          Chemical engineering emerged upon the development of  |unit_operations|Unit_Operations| , a fundamental concept of the discipline of chemical engineering. Most authors agree that Davis invented the concept of unit operations if not substantially developed it. He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at the  |Manchester_Technical_School|Manchester_Technical_School|   in 1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about chemical engineering. Three years before Davis lectures,  |Henry_Edward_Armstrong|Henry_Edward_Armstrong|  taught a degree course in chemical engineering at the  |City_and_Guilds_of_London_Institute|City_And_Guilds_Of_London_Institute| . Armstrongs course failed simply because its graduates were not especially attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have rather hired chemists and  |mechanical_engineers|Mechanical_Engineers| . Courses in chemical engineering offered by  |Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology|  in the United States,  |Owens_College|Owens_College_Manchester|  in  |Manchester|Manchester| , England, and  |University_College_London|University_College_London|  suffered under similar circumstances.          Starting from 1888,  |Lewis_M_Norton|Lewis_M_Norton|  taught at MIT the first chemical engineering course in the United States. Nortons course was contemporaneous and essentially similar to Armstrongs course. Both courses, however, simply merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. Its practitioners had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and chemists that they were not simply chemists.  Unit operations was introduced into the course by  |William_Hultz_Walker|William_Hultz_Walker|  in 1905. By the early 1920s, unit operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other US universities, as well as at  |Imperial_College_London|Imperial_College_London| . The  |American_Institute_of_Chemical_Engineers|American_Institute_Of_Chemical_Engineers|  , established in 1908, played a key role in making chemical engineering considered an independent science, and unit operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical engineering to be a science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit operations in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered satisfactory chemical engineering courses. Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in Britain led to the establishment of the  |Institution_of_Chemical_Engineers|Institution_Of_Chemical_Engineers|  in 1922. IChemE likewise helped make unit operations considered essential to the discipline.          In 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in developing  |chemical_reactors|Chemical_Reactor| . While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s,  |transport_phenomena|Transport_Phenomena|  started to experience greater focus. Along with other novel concepts, such as  |process_systems_engineering|Process_Systems_Engineering|  , a second paradigm was defined. Transport phenomena gave an  |analytical|Systems_Analysis|  approach to chemical engineering while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as  |control_system|Control_System|  and  |process_design|Process_Design| . Developments in chemical engineering before and after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  were mainly incited by the  |petrochemical_industry|Petrochemical_Industry| , however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements in  |biochemical_engineering|Biochemical_Engineering|  in the 1940s, for example, found application in the  |pharmaceutical_industry|Pharmaceutical_Industry| , and allowed for the  |mass_production|Mass_Production|  of various  |antibiotics|Antibiotic| , including  |penicillin|Penicillin|  and  |streptomycin|Streptomycin| . Meanwhile, progress in  |polymer_science|Polymer_Science|  in the 1950s paved way for the age of plastics .       Concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of large-scale chemical manufacturing facilities were also raised during this period.  Silent Spring , published in 1962, alerted its readers to the harmful effects of  |DDT|Ddt| , a potent  |insecticide|Insecticide| . The 1974  |Flixborough_disaster|Flixborough_Disaster|  in the United Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a  |chemical_plant|Chemical_Plant|  and three nearby villages. The 1984  |Bhopal_disaster|Bhopal_Disaster|  in India resulted in almost 4,000 deaths. These incidents, along with  |other_incidents|List_Of_Industrial_Disasters| , affected the reputation of the trade as  |industrial_safety|Industrial_Safety|  and  |environmental_protection|Environmental_Protection|  were given more focus. In response, the IChemE required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after 1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States.       Advancements in  |computer_science|Computer_Science|  found applications designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done manually. The completion of the  |Human_Genome_Project|Human_Genome_Project|  is also seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but  |genetic_engineering|Genetic_Engineering|  and  |genomics|Genomics|  as well. Chemical engineering principles were used to produce  |DNA_sequences|Dna_Sequences|  in large quantities.            Chemical engineering involves the application of several principles. Key concepts are presented below.       Chemical engineering design concerns the creation of plans, specification, and economic analyses for  |pilot_plants|Pilot_Plant| , new plants or plant modifications. Design engineers often work in a consulting role, designing plants to meet clients needs. Design is limited by a number of factors, including funding, government regulations and safety standards. These constraints dictate a plants choice of process, materials and equipment.     Plant construction is coordinated by  |project_engineers|Project_Engineering|  and project managers Herbst, Andrew; Hans Verwijs . Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control . Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 1  |ABET|Abet|  do not usually stress project engineering education, which can be obtained by specialized training, as electives, or from  |graduate_programs|Graduate_Programs| . Project engineering jobs are some of the largest employers for chemical engineers.             A unit operation is a physical step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations  are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a unit operation. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes  involve the conversion of material by  |biochemical|Biochemical| ,  |thermochemical|Thermochemical|  and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called  |process_engineers|Process_Engineer| .     Process design requires the definition of equipment types and sizes as well as how they are connected together and the materials of construction. Details are often printed on a  |Process_Flow_Diagram|Process_Flow_Diagram|  which is used to control the capacity and reliability of a new or modified chemical factory.      |Education_for_chemical_engineers|Education_For_Chemical_Engineers|  in the first college degree 3 or 4 years of study stresses the principles and practices of process design. The same skills are used in existing chemical plants to evaluate the  |efficiency|Economicseconomic_Efficiency|  and make recommendations for improvements.            Modeling and analysis of transport phenomena is essential for many industrial applications. Transport phenomena involve  |fluid_dynamics|Fluid_Dynamics| ,  |heat_transfer|Heat_Transfer|  and  |mass_transfer|Mass_Transfer| , which are governed mainly by  |momentum_transfer|Momentum_Transfer| ,  |energy_transfer|Energy_Transfer|  and transport of  |chemical_species|Chemical_Species| , respectively. Models often involve separate considerations for  |macroscopic|Macroscopic_Scale| ,  |microscopic|Microscopic_Scale|  and  |molecular|Molecular|  level phenomena. Modeling of transport phenomena, therefore, requires an understanding of applied mathematics.                |Chemical_engineers|Chemical_Engineer|  develop economic ways of using materials and energy . Chemical engineers use  |chemistry|Chemistry|  and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products, such as medicine, petrochemicals and plastics on a large-scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in  |waste_management|Waste_Management|  and research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers.     Chemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a  |project_engineer|Project_Engineer| . Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers may be involved in equipment upgrades, process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles.
