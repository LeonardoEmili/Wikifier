   The Golden Turkey Awards is a 1980 book by film critic  |Michael_Medved|Michael_Medved|  and his brother Harry.       The book awards Golden Turkey Awards to  |films|Film|  judged by the authors as poor in quality, and to  |directors|Film_Director|  and actors judged to have created a chronically inept body of work. The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as  Rat Pfink a Boo Boo ,  Attack of the 50 Foot Woman , and the apparently lost  Him . Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like  The Swarm  and popular films such as  Jesus Christ Superstar .     In the introduction the authors admit that we know our choices will not please everyone  least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly  sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years  and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time.     The Medveds had previously celebrated bad cinema in  The Fifty Worst Films of All Time , many of which were also featured in the various Golden Turkey Awards categories. Subsequently, they turned their attention to  |box_office_bombs|Box_Office_Bomb|  in  The Hollywood Hall of Shame . They also published a sequel to The Golden Turkey Awards, Son of Golden Turkey Awards, in 1986. They declared that Son of Golden Turkey Awards is our last word...we hereby solemnly pledge that the years ahead will produce no further Golden Turkey publications by the Medved Brothers...we now pass the torch to whichever brave souls feel ready to take up the challenge. Son of Golden Turkey Awards also listed a Whos Who in the World of Bad Movies at the end of its awards presentations.     The Golden Turkey Awards formed the basis of a 1983 television series  The Worst of Hollywood  hosted by Michael Medved.       In the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time the authors invited readers to write in nominating their favorite worst films . More than 3,000 ballots were received. Based on these votes, the Worst Film of All Time award was given to  Plan 9 from Outer Space  by  |Ed_Wood|Ed_Wood| .     Wood is also awarded the title of Worst Director of All Time, judged by the authors.    |Raquel_Welch|Raquel_Welch|  is judged the Worst Actress of All Time over nominees including  |Candice_Bergen|Candice_Bergen|  and  |Mamie_van_Doren|Mamie_Van_Doren| .      |Richard_Burton|Richard_Burton|  is judged as the Worst Actor of All Time over nominees  |John_Agar|John_Agar| ,  |Tony_Curtis|Tony_Curtis|  and  |Victor_Mature|Victor_Mature| . While conceding he is sometimes brilliant, the authors claim Burtons occasional triumphs only serve to highlight the pathetic waste in most of his films; for every  Equus  in which he appears there are at least a half-dozen  Cleopatra s or  Boom! s. The authors state that when he is bad ... well, hes just the pits and list several bad films in which he has appeared:  The Sandpiper ,  Hammersmith Is Out ,  The Voyage ,  The Medusa Touch  and  The Assassination of Trotsky . Another Burton film,  Exorcist II: The Heretic , is the books first runner up in the Worst Film of All Time award based on reader response.

At certain times in the film small vibrators attached to the underside of some seats within the auditorium were activated to give some audience members a tingle.

First Runner-Up:  Exorcist II: The Heretic   Plan 9 from Outer Space           One of the films nominated in the book was in fact an invention of the authors, and readers were challenged to figure out which film was actually fake. The fake film was Dog of Norway featuring Muki the Wonder Hound . This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-authors dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film  Him , has also been cited as the hoax, though it is known to have existed.      No formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, The Hollywood Hall of Shame. That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors . In The Hollywood Hall of Shame, in reference to the dish barbecued dog, the authors explain that it was a snack which produced a mixed reaction among the representatives of an industry that had given the world  |Lassie|Lassie| ,  |Rin_Tin_Tin|Rin_Tin_Tin| ,  |Benji|Benji| ,  |Phyllis_Diller|Phyllis_Diller| , and Muki the Wonder Hound.
