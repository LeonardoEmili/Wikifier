Using helium or xenon has the advantage of reduced background noise, and therefore increased contrast for the image itself, because these elements are not normally present in biological tissues.      Moreover, the nucleus of any atom that has a net nuclear spin and that is bonded to a hydrogen atom could potentially be imaged via heteronuclear magnetization transfer MRI that would image the high-gyromagnetic-ratio hydrogen nucleus instead of the low-gyromagnetic-ratio nucleus that is bonded to the hydrogen atom.  In principle, hetereonuclear magnetization transfer MRI could be used to detect the presence or absence of specific chemical bonds.       Multinuclear imaging is primarily a research technique at present. However, potential applications include functional imaging and imaging of organs poorly seen on 1 H MRI or as alternative contrast agents. Inhaled hyperpolarized 3 He can be used to image the distribution of air spaces within the lungs. Injectable solutions containing 13 C or stabilized bubbles of hyperpolarized 129 Xe have been studied as contrast agents for angiography and perfusion imaging. 31 P can potentially provide information on bone density and structure, as well as functional imaging of the brain. Multinuclear imaging holds the potential to chart the distribution of lithium in the human brain, this element finding use as an important drug for those with conditions such as bipolar disorder.

To achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities.  A new class of gene targeting MR contrast agents has been introduced to show gene action of unique mRNA and gene transcription factor proteins.   This new CA can trace cells with unique mRNA, microRNA and virus; tissue response to inflammation in living brains.  The MR reports change in gene expression with positive correlation to TaqMan analysis, optical and electron microscopy.           In the UK, the price of a clinical 1.5-tesla MRI scanner is around Â£920,000/, with the lifetime maintenance cost broadly similar to the purchase cost.  In the Netherlands, the average MRI scanner costs around â‚¬1 million,  with a 7-T MRI having been taken in use by the UMC Utrecht in December 2007, costing â‚¬7 million.  Construction of MRI suites could cost up to /â‚¬370.000 or more, depending on project scope. Pre-polarizing MRI systems using resistive electromagnets have shown promise as a low-cost alternative and have specific advantages for joint imaging near metal implants; however, they are likely unsuitable for routine whole-body or neuroimaging applications.          MRI scanners have become significant sources of revenue for healthcare providers in the US. This is because of favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and federal government programs. Insurance reimbursement is provided in two components, an equipment charge for the actual performance and operation of the MRI scan and a professional charge for the radiologists review of the images and/or data. In the US Northeast, an equipment charge might be $3,500/â‚¬2,600 and a professional charge might be $350/â‚¬260, Stamford Hospital price quotation October 2008, Stamford CT US although the actual fees received by the equipment owner and interpreting physician are often significantly less and depend on the rates negotiated with insurance companies or determined by the Medicare fee schedule. For example, an orthopedic surgery group in Illinois billed a charge of $1,116/â‚¬825 for a knee MRI in 2007, but the Medicare reimbursement in 2007 was only $470.91/â‚¬350.  Many insurance companies require advance approval of an MRI procedure as a condition for coverage.
