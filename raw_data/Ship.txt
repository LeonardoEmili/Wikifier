               A ship is a large  |watercraft|Watercraft|  that travels the worlds oceans and other sufficiently deep  |waterways|Sea_Lane| , carrying passengers or goods, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Historically, a  |ship|Full-Rigged_Ship|  was a  |sailing_vessel|Sailing_Ship|  with at least three  |square-rigged|Square_Rig| |masts|Mast|  and a full  |bowsprit|Bowsprit| . Ships are generally distinguished from  |boats|Boat| , based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition.     Ships have been important contributors to human migration and commerce. They have supported the spread of  |colonization|Colonization|  and the  |slave_trade|Slave_Trade| , but have also served scientific, cultural, and humanitarian needs. After the 15th century,  |new_crops|Columbian_Exchange|  that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the  |world_population_growth|World_Population_Growth| .   . The University of North Carolina.  |Ship_transport|Ship_Transport|  is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.     As of 2016, there were more than 49,000  |merchant_ships|Merchant_Ship| , totaling almost 1.8 billion  |dead_weight_tons|Deadweight_Tonnage| . Of these 28% were  |oil_tankers|Oil_Tanker| , 43% were  |bulk_carriers|Bulk_Carrier| , and 13% were  |container_ships|Container_Ship| .            Ships are generally larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. Cutler 1999, p. 620. A legal definition of ship from  |India|India| n  |case_law|Case_Law|  is a vessel that carries goods by sea.    A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa.  A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the inside    because of the relative location of the  |center_of_mass|Center_Of_Mass|  versus the  |center_of_buoyancy|Center_Of_Buoyancy| .   American and British 19th Century maritime law distinguished vessels from other craft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.        In the  |Age_of_Sail|Age_Of_Sail| , a  |full-rigged_ship|Full-Rigged_Ship|  was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full  |bowsprit|Bowsprit| ; other types of vessel were also defined by their  |sailplan|Sailplan| , e.g.  |barque|Barque| ,  |brigantine|Brigantine| , etc.      A number of large vessels are usually referred to as boats.  |Submarines|Submarine|  are a prime example.  Other types of large vessel which are traditionally called boats are  |Great_Lakes_freighters|Lake_Freighter| ,  |riverboats|Riverboat| , and  |ferryboats|Ferryboat| . Though large enough to carry their own boats and heavy cargoes, these vessels are designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.     In most maritime traditions ships have  |individual_names|Ship_Naming_And_Launching| , and modern ships may belong to a  |ship_class|Ship_Class|  often named after its first ship.       In the northern parts of Europe and America a ship is traditionally referred to with a female  |grammatical_gender|Grammatical_Gender| , represented in English with the  |pronoun|English_Personal_Pronouns|  she , even if named after a man. This is not universal usage and some English language journalistic  |style_guides|Style_Guides|  advise using it as referring to ships with female pronouns can be seen as offensive and outdated.   In many documents the ship name is introduced with a  |ship_prefix|Ship_Prefix|  being an abbreviation of the ship class, for example MS or SV , making it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual names in a text.                 The first known vessels date back about 10,000  years ago, but could not be described as ships. The first navigators began to use animal skins or woven fabrics as  |sails|Sail| . Affixed to the top of a pole set upright in a boat, these sails gave early ships range.           The first sea-going sailing ships were developed by the  |Austronesian_peoples|Austronesian_Peoples|  from what is now  |Southern_China|Southern_China|  and  |Taiwan|Taiwan| . Their invention of  |catamarans|Catamaran| ,  |outriggers|Outrigger_Ship| , and  |crab_claw_sails|Crab_Claw_Sail|  enabled their ships to sail for vast distances in open ocean. It led to the  |Austronesian_Expansion|Austronesian_Expansion|  at around 3000 to 1500 BC. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of  |Maritime_Southeast_Asia|Maritime_Southeast_Asia| , then sailed further onwards to  |Micronesia|Micronesia| ,  |Island_Melanesia|Island_Melanesia| ,  |Polynesia|Polynesia| , and  |Madagascar|Madagascar| , eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.              Austronesian rigs were distinctive in that they had spars supporting both the upper and lower edges of the sails , in contrast to western rigs which only had a spar on the upper edge.    The sails were also made from woven leaves, usually from  |pandan|Pandanus|  plants.   These were complemented by paddlers, who usually positioned themselves on platforms on the  |outriggers|Outrigger|  in the larger boats.  Austronesian ships ranged in complexity from simple  |dugout_canoes|Dugout_Canoe|  with outriggers or lashed together to large edge-pegged plank-built boats built around a keel made from a dugout canoe. Their designs were unique, evolving from ancient rafts to the characteristic double-hulled, single-outrigger, and double-outrigger designs of Austronesian ships.        Early Austronesian sailors influenced the development of sailing technologies in  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka|  and  |Southern_India|Southern_India|  through the  |Austronesian_maritime_trade_network|Austronesian_Maritime_Trade_Network|  of the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| , the precursor to the  |spice_trade|Spice_Trade|  route and the  |maritime_silk_road|Maritime_Silk_Road| , which was established at around 1500 BC.  Some scholars believe that the triangular Austronesian crab claw sail may have influenced the development of the  |lateen|Lateen|  sail in western ships due to early contact. The  |junk_rigs|Junk_Rig|  of Chinese ships is also believed to be originally  |Javanese|Javanese_People|  in origin. Shaffer, Lynda Norene . Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500. M.E. Sharpe.

Worlds Oldest Planked Boats, in  Archaeology  .  |Archaeological_Institute_of_America|Archaeological_Institute_Of_America| .  They used woven  |straps|Strap|  to lash the planks together, and  |reeds|Cyperus_Papyrus|  or  |grass|Grass|  stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams. The earliest known Egyptian boats date to 3000 BC and were found in Abydos in 1991. They consisted of planks joined by ropes passing through mortises. Similar boats dating back to 2600 BC were found in 1954 and 1987 in pits at the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Giza. In 1894, Egyptian boats composed of planks joined by mortises and tenons were found in Dashur.

He was recorded as the builder of a cedarwood vessel called Praise of the Two Lands.      The  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ians were perfectly at ease building sailboats. A remarkable example of their  |shipbuilding|Shipbuilding|  skills was the  |Khufu_ship|Khufu_Ship| , a vessel  in length entombed at the foot of the  |Great_Pyramid_of_Giza|Great_Pyramid_Of_Giza|  around 2500 BC and found intact in 1954.     It is known that ancient  |Nubia|Nubia| / |Axum|Axum|  traded with  |India|India| , and there is evidence that ships from Northeast Africa may have sailed back and forth between India/Sri Lanka and Nubia trading goods and even to  |Persia|Persia| , Himyar and  |Rome|Ancient_Rome| .   |Aksum|Aksumite_Empire|  was known by the  |Greeks|Ancient_Greece|  for having seaports for ships from Greece and  |Yemen|Yemen| .

Shaffer, Lynda Norene . Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500. M.E. Sharpe.       A panel found at  |Mohenjodaro|Mohenjodaro|  depicted a sailing craft. Vessels were of many types; their construction is vividly described in the Yukti Kalpa Taru, an ancient Indian text on shipbuilding. This treatise gives a technical exposition on the techniques of shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the various types of ships, their sizes, and the materials from which they were built. The Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the available information. The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information and dates to prove that, in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a good knowledge of the materials which were used in building ships. In addition to describing the qualities of the different types of wood and their suitability for shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru gives an elaborate classification of ships based on their size.     The  |Swahili_people|Swahili_People|  had various extensive trading ports dotting the coast of medieval East Africa and  |Great_Zimbabwe|Great_Zimbabwe|  had extensive trading contacts with  |Central_Africa|Central_Africa| , and likely also imported goods brought to Africa through the Southeast African shore trade of  |Kilwa|Kilwa_District|  in modern-day  |Tanzania|Tanzania| .      It is known by historians that at its height the  |Mali_Empire|Mali_Empire|  built a large naval fleet under Emperor  |Mansa_Musa|Mansa_Musa|  in the late 13th and early 14th century.   Arabic sources describe what some consider to be visits to the New World by a Mali fleet in 1311.      Before the introduction of the compass,  |celestial_navigation|Celestial_Navigation|  was the main method for navigation at sea. In China, early versions of the  |magnetic_compass|Magnetic_Compass|  were being developed and used in navigation between 1040 and 1117. Li Shu-hua, “Origine de la Boussole 11. Aimant et Boussole,” Isis, Vol. 45, No. 2. , p. 181 The true mariners  |compass|Compass| , using a pivoting needle in a dry box, was developed in  |Europe|Europe|  no later than 1300. Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” The American Historical Review, Vol. 68, No. 3. , pp. 615ff. Chisholm, 1911:284.          Until the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , navigational technology remained comparatively primitive. This absence of technology did not prevent some civilizations from becoming sea powers. Examples include the maritime republics of  |Genoa|Republic_Of_Genoa|  and  |Venice|Republic_Of_Venice| ,  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League| , and the  |Byzantine_navy|Byzantine_Navy| . The  |Vikings|Viking|  used their  |knarrs|Knarr|  to explore  |North_America|North_America| , trade in the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  and plunder many of the coastal regions of Western Europe.     Towards the end of the 14th century, ships like the  |carrack|Carrack|  began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers decreased the vessels stability, and in the 15th century, the  |caravel|Caravel| , designed by the  |Portuguese|Portugal| , based on the Arabic qarib which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the  |forecastle|Forecastle|  and  |stern|Stern| castle, as in the carrack  |Santa_María|Santa_María|  of  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| . This increased  |freeboard|Freeboard|  allowed another innovation: the freeing port, and the artillery associated with it.      In the 16th century, the use of freeboard and freeing ports became widespread on  |galleons|Galleon| .     At this time, ships were developing in Asia in much the same way as Europe. Japan used defensive naval techniques in the  |Mongol_invasions_of_Japan|Mongol_Invasions_Of_Japan|  in 1281. It is likely that the Mongols of the time took advantage of both European and Asian shipbuilding techniques. During the 15th century, Chinas  |Ming_dynasty|Ming_Dynasty|  assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the  |diplomatic_and_power_projection_voyages|Ming_Treasure_Voyages|  of  |Zheng_He|Zheng_He| . Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the worlds first iron-clads, Tekkōsen , literally meaning iron ships , Stephen Turnbull, “Samurai Warfare” , Cassell & Co, p. 102  was also developed. In Japan, during the  |Sengoku_era|Sengoku_Era|  from the fifteenth to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the  |atakebune|Atakebune| . In Korea, in the early 15th century during the  |Joseon|Joseon|  era,  |Geobukseon|Turtle_Ship|  , was developed. The turtle ship , as it was called is recognized as the first armored ship in the world.

In the 16th century,  |Duarte_Barbosa|Duarte_Barbosa|  noted that many ships from the  |Kingdom_of_Cambaya|Khambhat|  in what is modern-day  |India|India|  sailed to Mogadishu with  |cloth|Textile|  and  |spices|Spice| , for which they in return received  |gold|Gold| ,  |wax|Wax|  and  |ivory|Ivory| . Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of  |meat|Meat| ,  |wheat|Wheat| ,  |barley|Barley| ,  |horses|Horse| , and  |fruit|Fruit|  on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants. East Africa and its Invaders p.38     Middle Age  |Swahili_Kingdoms|Swahili_Culture|  are known to have had trade port bullship and trade routes  with the Islamic world and Asia and were described by Greek historians as metropolises .  Famous African trade ports such as  |Mombasa|Mombasa| ,  |Zanzibar|Zanzibar| , and  |Kilwa|Kilwa_Kisiwani|   were known to Chinese sailors such as  |Zheng_He|Zheng_He|  and medieval Islamic historians such as the Berber Islamic voyager  |Abu_Abdullah_ibn_Battua|Ibn_Battuta| .  In the 14th century AD, King  |Abubakari_I|Abu_Bakr| , the brother of King  |Mansa_Musa|Mansa_Musa|  of the  |Mali_Empire|Mali_Empire| , is thought to have had a great armada of ships sitting on the coast of  |West_Africa|West_Africa| .  This is corroborated by ibn Battuta himself who recalls several hundred Malian ships off the coast.  This has led to great speculation, with historical evidence, that it is possible that Malian sailors may have reached the coast of  |Pre-Columbian|Pre-Columbian|  America under the rule of  |Abubakari_II|Abu_Bakr_Ii| , nearly two hundred years before Christopher Columbus  and that  |black_traders_may_have_been_in_the_Americas_before_Columbus|Pre-Columbian_Africa-Americas_Contact_Theories| .    Fifty years before  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| , Chinese navigator  |Zheng_He|Zheng_He|  traveled the world at the head of what was for the time a  |huge_armada|Chinese_Treasure_Fleet| . The largest of his ships had nine masts, were  long and had a beam of . His fleet carried 30,000 men aboard 70 vessels, with the goal of bringing glory to the Chinese emperor.     At the same time Zheng He made his expedition, Portuguese explorer  |Gil_Eanes|Gil_Eanes|  sailed on a  |square-rigged_caravel|Square-Rigged_Caravel|  beyond  |Cape_Bojador|Cape_Bojador|  the end of what was then considered the known world opening the route to deep sea exploration, continental sea communication technology and the  |spherical_earth|Spherical_Earth|  principle.

In 1498, by reaching India,  |Vasco_da_Gama|Vasco_Da_Gama|  proved that the access to the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean|  from the  |Atlantic|Atlantic|  was possible. These explorations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans were soon followed by  |France|France| ,  |England|England|  and the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| , reaching  |Australia|Australia|  in 1606 and  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  in 1642. Love, Ronald S., Maritime exploration in the age of discovery, 1415–1800 , Greenwood guides to historic events, 1500–1900, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006,  In the 17th century Dutch and Spanish explorers such as  |Abel_Tasman|Abel_Tasman|  and  |Luís_Vaz_de_Torres|Luís_Vaz_De_Torres|  explored the coasts of Australia, while in the 18th century it was British explorer  |James_Cook|James_Cook|  who mapped much of  |Polynesia|Polynesia| .                Parallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.     Maritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent  |towpath|Towpath| , contended with the  |railway|Railway|  up to and past the early days of the  |industrial_revolution|Industrial_Revolution| . Flat-bottomed and flexible  |scow|Scow|  boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.     During the first half of the 18th century, the  |French_Navy|French_Navy|  began to develop a new type of vessel known as a  |ship_of_the_line|Ship_Of_The_Line| , featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were  long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and  of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers.     During the 19th century the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  enforced a ban on the  |slave_trade|Slave_Trade| , acted to suppress  |piracy|Piracy| , and continued to map the world. A  |clipper|Clipper|  was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The  |clipper_routes|Clipper_Route|  fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of  |steam_ships|Steamboat|  with better fuel efficiency, and the opening of the  |Suez|Suez_Canal|  and  |Panama_Canals|Panama_Canal| .     Ship designs stayed fairly unchanged until the late 19th century. The industrial revolution, new mechanical methods of  |propulsion|Propulsion| , and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. Factors including the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created an avalanche of more specialized boats and ships. Ships built for entirely new functions, such as firefighting, rescue, and research, also began to appear.     In light of this, classification of vessels by type or function can be difficult. Even using very broad functional classifications such as fishery, trade, military, and exploration fails to classify most of the old ships. This difficulty is increased by the fact that the terms such as sloop and frigate are used by old and new ships alike, and often the modern vessels sometimes have little in common with their predecessors.          In 2007, the worlds fleet included 34,882 commercial vessels with  |gross_tonnage|Gross_Tonnage|  of more than 1,000  |tons|Ton| , UNCTAD 2007, p. 32. totaling 1.04  billion tons. UNCTAD 2007, p. x. These ships carried 7.4  billion tons of cargo in 2006, a sum that grew by 8% over the previous year. In terms of tonnage, 39% of these ships are  |tankers|Tanker| , 26% are  |bulk_carriers|Bulk_Carrier| , 17%  |container_ships|Container_Ship|  and 15% were  |other_types|General_Cargo_Ship| .     In 2002, there were 1,240  |warships|Warship|  operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as  |patrol_boats|Patrol_Boat| . The  |United_States|United_States|  accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels,  |Russia|Russia|  1.35 million tons, the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  504,660 tons and  |China|China|  402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two  |world_wars|World_War| , the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The worlds major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  in the  |Falkland_Islands|Falkland_Islands|  and the  |United_States|United_States|  in  |Iraq|Iraq| .     The size of the worlds  |fishing_fleet|Fishing_Fleet|  is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion.  |Fishing_vessels|Fishing_Vessel|  can be found in most seaside villages in the world. As of 2004, the United Nations  |Food_and_Agriculture_Organization|Food_And_Agriculture_Organization|  estimated 4  million fishing vessels were operating worldwide. The same study estimated that the worlds 29  million fishermen UNFAO 2005, p. 6. caught  of fish and shellfish that year. UNFAO 2005, p. 9.          Because ships are constructed using the principles of naval architecture that require same structural components, their classification is based on their function such as that suggested by Paulet and Presles,  which requires modification of the components. The categories accepted in general by naval architects are:     |High-speed_craft|High-Speed_Craft|  –  |Multihulls|Multihull|  including wave piercers,  |small-waterplane-area_twin_hull|Small-Waterplane-Area_Twin_Hull|  ,  |surface_effect_ships|Surface_Effect_Ship|  and  |hovercraft|Hovercraft| ,  |hydrofoil|Hydrofoil| ,  |wing_in_ground_effect|Ground_Effect|  craft .    |Off_shore_oil|Offshore_Drilling|  vessels –  |Platform_supply_vessel|Platform_Supply_Vessel| , pipe layers, accommodation and  |crane|Crane_Vessel| |barges|Barge| , non and semi-submersible  |drilling_rigs|Drilling_Rig| ,  |production_platforms|Oil_Platform| ,  |floating_production_storage_and_offloading|Floating_Production_Storage_And_Offloading|  units.    |Fishing_vessels|Fishing_Vessel|    : Motorised  |fishing_trawlers|Fishing_Trawler| ,  |trap_setters|Fish_Traps| ,  |seiners|Seine_Fishing| ,  |longliners|Longline_Fishing| ,  |trollers|Trolling|  &  |factory_ships|Factory_Ship| .   : Traditional  |sailing|Sailboat|  and  |rowed|Watercraft_Rowing|  fishing vessels and  |boats|Boat|  used for  |handline_fishing|Handline_Fishing| |Harbour|Harbour|  work craft   : |Cable_layers|Cable_Layer|    : |Tugboats|Tugboat| ,  |dredgers|Dredger| ,  |salvage|Marine_Salvage|  vessels,  |tenders|Ships_Tender| ,  |Pilot_boats|Pilot_Boat| .   : |Floating_dry_docks|Drydockfloating| ,  |floating_cranes|Crane_Vessel| ,  |lightership|Lighter_Aboard_Ship| .

Submersibles – industrial exploration, scientific research, tourist and hydrographic survey.    |Warships|Warships|  and other  |surface_combatants|Surface_Combatants|  –  |aircraft_carriers|Aircraft_Carrier| ,  |destroyers|Destroyer| ,  |frigates|Frigate| ,  |corvettes|Corvette| ,  |minesweepers|Minesweeper| , etc.     Some of these are discussed in the following sections.          Freshwater shipping may occur on lakes, rivers and canals. Ships designed for those venues may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the  |Danube|Danube| ,  |Mississippi|Mississippi_River| ,  |Rhine|Rhine_River| ,  |Yangtze|Yangtze|  and  |Amazon|Amazon_River|  Rivers, and the  |Great_Lakes|Great_Lakes| .        |Lake_freighters|Lake_Freighter| , also called lakers, are  |cargo|Cargo|  vessels that ply the  |Great_Lakes|Great_Lakes| . The most well-known is , the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called salties. Because of their additional  |beam|Beam| , very large salties are never seen inland of the  |Saint_Lawrence_Seaway|Saint_Lawrence_Seaway| . Because the smallest of the  |Soo_Locks|Soo_Locks|  is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, topping off when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes  because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the  |Welland_Canal|Welland_Canal|  that bypasses the  |Niagara_River|Niagara_River| .     Since the  |freshwater|Freshwater|  lakes are less corrosive to ships than the  |salt_water|Seawater|  of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50  years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20  years of age. Office of Data and Economic Analysis, 2006, p. 2.     , built in 1906 as William P Snyder, was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, E.M. Ford, built in 1898 as Presque Isle, was sailing the lakes 98  years later in 1996. As of 2007 E.M. Ford was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in  |Saginaw,_Michigan|Saginaw,_Michigan| .              |Merchant_ships|Merchant_Ship|  are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing,  |cargo_ships|Cargo_Ship| ,  |passenger_ships|Passenger_Ship| , and special-purpose ships. UNCTAD 2007, p. xii uses a similar, but slightly more detailed classification system. The  |UNCTAD_review_of_maritime_transport|Unctad_Review_Of_Maritime_Transport|  categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and other ships , which includes liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo . General cargo ships include multi-purpose and project vessels and roll-on/roll-off cargo .        Modern commercial vessels are typically powered by a single propeller driven by a  |diesel|Diesel_Engine|  or, less usually,  |gas_turbine_engine|Gas_Turbine_Engine| ., but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use  |pump-jet_engines|Pump-Jet_Engine| . Most commercial vessels have full hull-forms to maximize cargo capacity. Hulls are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass on the smallest service vessels. Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a  |sea_captain|Sea_Captain| , with  |deck_officers|Deck_Officer|  and  |engine_officers|Engine_Officer|  on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard  |research_vessels|Research_Vessel| .     Fishing boats are generally small, often little more than  but up to  for a large tuna or  |whaling_ship|Whaling_Ship| . Aboard a  |fish_processing_vessel|Fish_Processing_Vessel| , the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004,  of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery. UNFAO, 2007, p. 11.  |Anchoveta|Anchoveta|  represented the largest single catch at . That year, the top ten marine capture species also included  |Alaska_pollock|Alaska_Pollock| ,  |Blue_whiting|Blue_Whiting| ,  |Skipjack_tuna|Skipjack_Tuna| ,  |Atlantic_herring|Atlantic_Herring| ,  |Chub_mackerel|Chub_Mackerel| ,  |Japanese_anchovy|Anchovy| ,  |Chilean_jack_mackerel|Trachurus| ,  |Largehead_hairtail|Largehead_Hairtail| , and  |Yellowfin_tuna|Yellowfin_Tuna| . Other species including  |salmon|Salmon| ,  |shrimp|Shrimp| ,  |lobster|Lobster| ,  |clams|Clam| ,  |squid|Squid|  and  |crab|Crab| , are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by  |nets|Fishing_Net| , such as  |purse_seine|Seine_Fishing| , beach seine, lift nets,  |gillnets|Gillnet| , or entangling nets. Another is  |trawl|Trawl| ing, including  |bottom_trawl|Bottom_Trawling| .  |Hooks|Fish_Hook|  and lines are used in methods like  |long-line_fishing|Long-Line_Fishing|  and  |hand-line_fishing|Hand-Line_Fishing| . Another method is the use of  |fishing_trap|Fishing_Trap| .     Cargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo.  Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by  |bulk_carriers|Bulk_Carrier| , packed directly onto a  |general_cargo_ship|General_Cargo_Ship|  in break-bulk, packed in  |intermodal_containers|Intermodal_Container|  as aboard a  |container_ship|Container_Ship| , or driven aboard as in  |roll-on_roll-off_ships|Roll-On_Roll-Off_Ship| . Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as  |oil_tankers|Oil_Tanker|  which may include both crude and finished products of oil,  |chemical_tankers|Chemical_Tanker|  which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and  |LPG/LNG_tankers|Lpg/Lng_Tanker| , although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in  |tank_containers|Tank_Container| .     Passenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large  |cruise_ships|Cruise_Ship| . This type of vessel includes  |ferries|Ferry| , which move passengers and vehicles on short trips;  |ocean_liners|Ocean_Liner| , which carry passengers from one place to another; and  |cruise_ships|Cruise_Ship| , which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation.  |Riverboats|Riverboat|  and  |inland_ferries|Ferry_Boat|  are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.         |Fishing_vessels|Fishing_Vessel|  are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the worlds fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels. UNFAO, 2007, p. 25. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels. Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars. More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels UNFAO defines a large fishing vessel as one with  |gross_tonnage|Gross_Tonnage|  over 100 GT. were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America. UNFAO, 2007, p. 28.             A  |weather_ship|Weather_Ship|  was a ship stationed in the  |ocean|Ocean|  as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in  |marine_weather_forecasting|Marine_Weather_Forecasting| . Surface weather observations were taken hourly, and four radiosonde releases occurred daily.  It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights.  Proposed as early as 1927 by the  |aviation|Aviation|  community,  the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  that the  |International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|  established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by the United States. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine.      The weather ship crews were normally at sea for three weeks at a time, returning to port for 10-day stretches. Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like other ships tended to for safety reasons.  They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as  |tropical_cyclones|Tropical_Cyclone| .  The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the  |Great_Storm_of_1987|Great_Storm_Of_1987| .  Beginning in the 1970s, their role became largely superseded by  |weather_buoys|Weather_Buoy|  due to the ships significant cost.  The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1990. The last weather ship was  Polarfront , known as weather station M , which was put out of operation on 1 January 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of  |voluntary_merchant_vessels|Voluntary_Observing_Ship_Program|  in routine commercial operation.             Naval vessels are those used by a  |navy|Navy|  for  |military|Military|  purposes.   There have been many  |types_of_naval_vessel|List_Of_Types_Of_Naval_Vessels| . Modern naval vessels can be broken down into three categories:  |surface_warships|List_Of_Naval_Ship_Classes_In_Service| ,  |submarines|List_Of_Submarine_Classes_In_Service| , and  |auxiliary_ships|Auxiliary_Ship| .     Modern warships are generally divided into seven main categories:  |aircraft_carriers|Aircraft_Carrier| ,  |cruisers|Cruiser| ,  |destroyers|Destroyer| ,  |frigates|Frigate| ,  |corvettes|Corvette| ,  |submarines|Submarine|  and  |amphibious_assault_ships|Amphibious_Assault_Ship| . The distinction between cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes is not rigorous; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies.  |Battleships|Battleship|  were used during the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  and occasionally since then , but were made obsolete by the use of  |carrier-borne_aircraft|Carrier-Borne_Aircraft|  and  |guided_missiles|Guided_Missile| . With the addition of corvettes, this is the categorization used at      Most military submarines are either  |attack_submarines|Attack_Submarine|  or  |ballistic_missile_submarines|Ballistic_Missile_Submarine| . Until the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the  |homing_torpedo|Homing_Torpedo| , better  |sonar|Sonar|  systems, and  |nuclear_propulsion|Nuclear_Navy| , submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of  |submarine-launched_nuclear|Submarine-Launched_Ballistic_Missile|  and  |cruise_missiles|Cruise_Missiles|  gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from  |cluster_munitions|Cluster_Munition|  to  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapon| .     Most  |navies|Navy|  also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as  |minesweepers|Minesweeper| ,  |patrol_boats|Patrol_Boat| ,  |offshore_patrol_vessels|Opv| ,  |replenishment_ships|Replenishment_Ship| , and  |hospital_ships|Hospital_Ship|  which are designated  |medical_treatment|Healthcare|  facilities.       Fast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability. Cutter, 1999, p. 224. They also usually have advanced  |marine_electronics|Marine_Electronics|  and communication systems, as well as weapons.          Some components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether its a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.             For a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ships hull.  There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of  |Americas_Cup|Americas_Cup|  sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull , two in the case of  |catamarans|Catamaran| , or three in the case of  |trimarans|Trimaran| . Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.     Hulls have several elements. The  |bow|Bow|  is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a  |bulbous_bow|Bulbous_Bow| . The  |keel|Keel|  is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the  |stern|Stern| , and many hulls have a flat back known as a  |transom|Transom| . Common hull appendages include  |propellers|Propeller|  for propulsion,  |rudders|Rudder|  for steering, and  |stabilizers|Stabilizer|  to quell a ships rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessels work, such as fishing gear and  |sonar_domes|Sonar| .     Hulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.     Older ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and  |composite_materials|Composite_Material|  are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with  |concrete_hulls|Concrete_Ship| .             Propulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion,  |sailing|Sailing| , and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes  |rowing|Watercraft_Rowing| , which was used even on large  |galleys|Galley| . Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the  |turbosails|Turbosail| ,  |rotorsails|Rotorsail| , and  |wingsails|Wingsail|  have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.     Mechanical  |propulsion_systems|Propulsion_Systems|  generally consist of a motor or engine turning a  |propeller|Propeller| , or less frequently, an  |impeller|Impeller|  or  |wave_propulsion_fins|Wave_Power_Ship| .  |Steam_engines|Steam_Engine|  were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by  |two-stroke|Two-Stroke_Engine|  or  |four-stroke|Four-Stroke_Engine|  diesel engines, outboard motors, and  |gas_turbine_engines|Gas_Turbine_Engine|  on faster ships.  |Nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Marine_Propulsion|  producing steam are used to propel  |warships|Warship|  and  |icebreakers|Icebreaker| , and there have been attempts to utilize them to power commercial vessels .     In addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with  |transverse_thrusters|Bow_Thruster|  for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a  |diesel-electric_powertrain|Diesel-Electric_Transmission|  in which the propeller is turned by an  |electric_motor|Electric_Motor|  powered by the ships generators.          For ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some  |paddles|Paddle_Steamer| , Almost all paddle steamers had a single engine with their paddles permanently coupled, without any clutches, and so could not be used for steering. Only a few examples with separate engines were steerable. The  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  however operated diesel-electric harbour tugs with paddles into the 1970s, for their superior maneuverability. steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a  |tiller|Tiller| , manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems.  |Autopilot|Autopilot|  systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems.  |Ducted_propellers|Ducted_Propeller|  are sometimes used for steering.     Some propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the  |outboard_motor|Outboard_Motor| , the  |bow_thruster|Bow_Thruster| , and the  |Z-drive|Z-Drive| .       Larger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate  |berthings|Berthing|  and  |heads|Head|  are found on sailboats over about . Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a  |galley|Galley| , and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ships trim and modify its stability.     Superstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ships stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.       Shipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ships era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:    |Masts|Mast|  can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law.    |Ground_tackle|Ground_Tackle|  includes equipment such as mooring winches, windlasses, and anchors. Anchors are used to  |moor|Mooring|  ships in shallow water. They are connected to the ship by a rope or chain. On larger vessels, the chain runs through a  |hawsepipe|Hawsepipe| .   Cargo equipment such as  |cranes|Crane|  and  |cargo_booms|Cargo_Boom|  are used to load and unload cargo and ships stores.   Safety equipment such as  |lifeboats|Lifeboat| ,  |liferafts|Liferaft| , and  |survival_suits|Survival_Suit|  are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.                 Ships float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, such that the downwards force of  |gravity|Gravity|  equals the upward force of  |buoyancy|Buoyancy| . As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessels mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its  |beam|Beam|  . A vessels stability is considered in both this  |hydrostatic|Initial_Stability|  sense as well as a  |hydrodynamic|Ship_Stability|  sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.                The advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and  |wave_making_resistance|Wave_Making_Resistance| . To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there.  |Antifouling|Antifouling|  paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the  |bulbous_bow|Bulbous_Bow|  assist in decreasing wave resistance.     A simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in  |amplitude|Amplitude| . Since the water is not able to get out of the way of the hull fast enough , the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an  |exponential|Exponential_Function|  increase in resistance with increasing speed.     This  |hull_speed|Hull_Speed|  is found by the formula:          or, in  |metric|Metric_System|  units:          where L is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.     When the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its  |bow_wave|Bow_Wave| , and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.     For large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of  |computational_fluid_dynamics|Computational_Fluid_Dynamics| .     Vessels are also subject to  |ocean_surface_waves|Ocean_Surface_Wave|  and  |sea_swell|Sea_Swell|  as well as effects of  |wind|Wind|  and  |weather|Weather| . These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as  |fin_stabilizers|Stabilizer| . Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.     How it has been convincingly shown in scientific studies of the 21st century,   controllability of some vessels decreases dramatically in some cases that are conditioned by effects of the  |bifurcation_memory|Bifurcation_Memory| . This class of vessels includes ships with high manoeuvring capabilities, aircraft and controlled underwater vehicles designed to be unstable in steady-state motion that are interesting in terms of applications. These features must be considered in designing ships and in their control in critical situations.                A ship will pass through several stages during its career. The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the  |shipowners|Shipowner| , operators,  |designers|Naval_Architect|  and the  |shipyard|Shipyard| . Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from  |shipwrecks|Shipwreck|  to service as a  |museum_ship|Museum_Ship|  to  |the_scrapyard|Ship_Breaking| .          A vessels design starts with a specification, which a  |naval_architect|Naval_Architect|  uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ships propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ships design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.     The designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.     As environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be  |disassembled|Ship_Breaking|  or  |disposed|Ship_Disposal|  easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.             Ship construction takes place in a  |shipyard|Shipyard| , and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate Hermione, to more than 10  years for an aircraft carrier. During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for  |Liberty_Ships|Liberty_Ship|  went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today. Sawyer, L.A. and Mitchell, W.H. The Liberty Ships: The History of the Emergency Type Cargo Ships Constructed in the United States During the Second World War, pp. 7–10, 2nd Edition, Lloyds of London Press Ltd., London. 1985. . Jaffee, Capt. Walter W. The Lane Victory: The Last Victory Ship in War and Peace, pp. 4–9, 15–32, 2nd Edition, Glencannon Press, Palo Alto, California, 1997. . Herman, Arthur. Freedoms Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 135–36, 178–80, Random House, New York. 2012. .     Hull materials and vessel size play a large part in determining the method of construction. The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.     Generally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about , by the laying of the keel. This is done in a  |drydock|Drydock|  or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.     Once completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer.  |Ship_launching|Ship_Naming_And_Launching|  is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a  |Vendée_Globe|Vendée_Globe|  class sailboat. A  trawler may cost $2.5  million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50  million. A ships cost partly depends on its complexity: a small,  |general_cargo_ship|General_Cargo_Ship|  will cost $20  million, a  |Panamax|Panamax| -sized  |bulk_carrier|Bulk_Carrier|  around $35  million, a  |supertanker|Supertanker|  around $105  million and a large  |LNG_carrier|Lng_Carrier|  nearly $200  million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a  costs around $2  billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5  billion.          Ships undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.     Most ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a  |drydock|Drydock|  at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull,  |sandblasting|Sandblasting|  and repainting the hull, and replacing  |sacrificial_anodes|Sacrificial_Anode|  used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.     Some vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose:  |oil_tankers|Oil_Tanker|  are often converted into  |floating_production_storage_and_offloading_units|Floating_Production_Storage_And_Offloading_Unit| .               Most ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30  years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40  years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100  years.     As ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be  |scuttled|Scuttling|  at sea or  |scrapped|Ship_Breaking|  by  |shipbreakers|Ship_Breaking| . Ships can also be used as  |museum_ships|Museum_Ships| , or expended to construct  |breakwaters|Breakwater|  or  |artificial_reefs|Artificial_Reef| .     Many ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions,  |grounding|Ship_Grounding| , or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .

Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in  |jail|Jail| . Plimsoll, a  |Member_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament| , realised the problem and engaged some  |engineers|Engineer|  to derive a fairly simple  |formula|Formula|  to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ships hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the  |Plimsoll_Line|Waterline|  , exists on ships sides, and consists of a  |circle|Circle|  with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the ladder of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. This is called the  |freeboard_mark|Freeboard_Mark|  or  |load_line_mark|Waterlinestandard_Load_Line_Marks|  in the  |marine_industry|Marine_Industry| .       Ship pollution is the pollution of air and water by  |shipping|Shipping| . It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world’s oceans and waterways as  |globalization|Globalization|  continues. It is expected that shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020. Watson, T. . Ship pollution clouds USAs skies. USA Today. Retrieved November 1, 2006, from  Because of increased traffic in ocean  |ports|Port| , pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects  |biodiversity|Biodiversity| , climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30  years.             Oil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains  |polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons|Polycyclic_Aromatic_Hydrocarbons|  which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the  |sediment|Sediment|  and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.     By the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry  of crude oil, or   . This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known  |Exxon_Valdez_incident|Exxon_Valdez_Oil_Spill| . In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped  of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000  |seabirds|Seabirds| , about 1,000  |sea_otters|Sea_Otters| , and immense numbers of fish were killed.     The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974.  According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7  tons per spill. Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700  tons.     Following the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States passed the  |Oil_Pollution_Act_of_1990|Oil_Pollution_Act_Of_1990|  , which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be  |double-hulled|Double-Hulled_Tanker|  by 2015. Following the sinkings of  Erika  and  Prestige  , the  |European_Union|European_Union|  passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages , which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of serious negligence .              When a large vessel such as a  |container_ship|Container_Ship|  or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.      One of the problems with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz Meinesz, A. .

Ship breaking or ship demolition is a type of  |ship_disposal|Ship_Disposal|  involving the breaking up of ships for  |scrap|Scrap| |recycling|Recycling| , with the hulls being discarded in  |ship_graveyards|Ship_Graveyard| . Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.        In addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in  |developed_countries|Developed_Countries| .  |Asbestos|Asbestos|  and  |polychlorinated_biphenyls|Polychlorinated_Biphenyls|  are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid 1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of  |personal_injury_lawsuits|Personal_Injury|  or  |workers_health_claims|Workers_Compensation| , meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.     Aside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major  |environmental_concern|Environmentalism| . Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no  |environmental_law|Environmental_Law| , enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as  |Greenpeace|Greenpeace|  have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.
