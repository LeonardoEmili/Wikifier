Isaac Klein was a prominent  |rabbi|Rabbi|  and  |halakhic|Halakhah|  authority within  |Conservative_Judaism|Conservative_Judaism| .         Klein was born in the small village of  |Várpalánka|Palanok_Castle| , today part of  |Mukachevo|Mukachevo| , in what was then  |Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| . He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1921. He earned a BA from  |City_College_of_New_York|City_College_Of_New_York|  in 1931. Although nearing ordination at the  |Yeshiva_Universitys|Yeshiva_University| |Rabbi_Isaac_Elchanan_Theological_Seminary|Rabbi_Isaac_Elchanan_Theological_Seminary| , he transferred to the  |Jewish_Theological_Seminary_of_America|Jewish_Theological_Seminary_Of_America|  , where he was ordained in 1934 and received the advanced Jewish legal degree of Hattarat Hora’ah under the great talmudic scholar Rabbi Professor  |Louis_Ginzberg|Louis_Ginzberg| . He was one of only three people, along with Boaz Cohen and  |Louis_Finkelstein|Louis_Finkelstein| , to ever to receive this degree from JTSA. Klein subsequently earned a PhD from  |Harvard|Harvard|  under the pioneering academic of Judaic studies  |Harry_Wolfson|Harry_Wolfson| .     He married the former Henriette Levine in 1932 and had three daughters, Hannah, Miriam, and Rivke. Devoted to his family, he dedicated his major work, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice to his children, sons-in-law and 13 grandchildren listing each by name.     Klein served as rabbi at Kadimoh Congregation in  |Springfield,_Massachusetts|Springfield,_Massachusetts|  from 1934–1953; Temple Emanu-El,  |Buffalo,_New_York|Buffalo,_New_York| , 1953–1968; Temple Shaarey Zedek, Buffalo, , 1968-1972. A beloved Rabbi, he influenced generations of congregants and visiting students and, together with his wife who was an educator, founded Jewish day schools in both Springfield and Buffalo.     Despite the difficulties facing a congregational Rabbi raising a family, Klein volunteered for the U.S. Army during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  as a chaplain, motivated by a cause he saw as clearly right with important implications for the Jewish People. He served over 4 years, rising to the rank of Major and was an advisor to the high commissioner of the Occupation government. He also served on special assignments for Jewish soldiers in the U.S. Army in the 1950s, receiving the simulated rank of Brigadier General for these missions. His experiences in the war are described in his book The Anguish and the Ecstasy of a Jewish Chaplain.         Klein was a leader of the right-wing of the Conservative movement. He was president of the  |Rabbinical_Assembly|Rabbinical_Assembly| , 1958–1960, and a member of its Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, 1948-1979. He was the author of several books, notably, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice. One of the outstanding halakhists of the movement, he served as a leading member of the  |Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards|Committee_On_Jewish_Law_And_Standards|  from 1948 until his death in 1979.     As a leading authority on  |halakha|Halakha|  he authored many important  |teshuvot|Responsa| , many of which were published in his influential  |Responsa|Responsa|  and Halakhic Studies . From the 1950s to 1970s, he wrote a comprehensive guide to  |Jewish_law|Halakha|  that was used to teach halakha at the JTSA. In 1979 he assembled this into A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, which is used widely by laypeople and rabbis within  |Conservative_Judaism|Conservative_Judaism| .         The philosophy upon which A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice is written is stated in the foreword: The premise on which Torah is based is that all aspects of life - leisure no less than business, worship or rites of passage - are part of the covenant and mandate under which every Jew is to serve God in everything he does. In the eyes of Torah there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as the purely private domain, for even in solitude - be it the privacy of the bath or the unconsciousness of sleep - one has the capacity and the duty to serve God. This message, of life seen in consonance with the dictates of Judaism, permeates many pages of the book. Rabbi  |Louis_Finkelstein|Louis_Finkelstein| , scholar of the JTSA, wrote: There are those who would think that we have but two alternatives, to reject or to accept the law, but in either case to treat it as a dead letter. Both of these alternatives are repugnant to the whole tradition of Judaism. Jewish law must be preserved but it is subject to interpretation by those who have mastered it, and the interpretation placed upon it by duly authorized masters in every generation must be accepted with as much reverence as those which were given in previous generations.      This understanding of traditional preservation of the law through its continuous interpretation lies at the heart of Kleins extensive study of Jewish law.     Kleins papers are located at the University Archives,  |State_University_of_New_York_at_Buffalo|University_At_Buffalo,_The_State_University_Of_New_York|  .
