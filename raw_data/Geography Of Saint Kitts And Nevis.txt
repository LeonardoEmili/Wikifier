           Saint Kitts and Nevis  is a twin  |island_country|Island_Country|  with a total landmass of just . The island of  |St._Kitts|St._Kitts| , the larger of the two, is  in size and is located at latitude 17.30 N, and longitude 62.80 W.  |Nevis|Nevis|  is  and located at latitude 17.10 N, longitude 62.35 W, approximately 3  km south-east of St. Kitts. The islands are about one-third of the way from  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico|  to  |Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad_And_Tobago| . The islands are volcanic and mountainous.          The island of  |St._Kitts|St._Kitts|  is composed almost exclusively of  |volcanic|Volcanic|  rocks of  |andesite|Andesite|  or  |dacite|Dacite| |mineralogy|Mineralogy| . Its  |geology|Geology|  is similar to that of other volcanic islands in the  |Lesser_Antillean_Archipelago|Antilles| . The islands are the summits of a submerged mountain range which forms the eastern boundary of what is known as the  |Caribbean_Tectonic_Plate|Caribbean_Plate| . St. Kitts is oriented northwest-southeast, about 80  km long and 16  km wide. The entire island archipelago is geologically young, having begun to form probably less than 50 million years ago, during the Miocene era. Volcanic activity occurred along the  |ridges|Ridge|  of this arc during the  |Miocene_era|Miocene_Era|  and has continued since.     Nevis is a volcanic island that began its formation in mid- |Pliocene|Pliocene|  times . However, the island comprises a number of discrete eruptive centers that range in age from mid-Pliocene to  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene| , these prevent any single model of the islands geological evolution. The geology of Nevis can be subdivided into four informal units: Volcanic of the eruptive centers, volcanigenic rocks -  |pyroclastics|Pyroclastic|  and  |lahars|Lahar| ,  |fluviatile|Fluviatile|  and  |lacustrine|Lake|  deposits, and  |raised_beach|Raised_Beach| es.
