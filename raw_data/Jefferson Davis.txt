                  Jefferson Finis Davis was an American politician who served as the  |president_of_the_Confederate_States|President_Of_The_Confederate_States_Of_America|  from 1861 to 1865. As a member of the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party| , he represented  |Mississippi|Mississippi|  in the  |United_States_Senate|United_States_Senate|  and the  |House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives|  before the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War| . He previously served as the  |United_States_Secretary_of_War|United_States_Secretary_Of_War|  from 1853 to 1857 under President  |Franklin_Pierce|Franklin_Pierce| .     Davis was born in  |Fairview,_Kentucky|Fairview,_Kentucky| , to a moderately prosperous farmer, the youngest of ten children. He grew up in  |Wilkinson_County,_Mississippi|Wilkinson_County,_Mississippi| , and also lived in  |Louisiana|Louisiana| . His eldest brother  |Joseph_Emory_Davis|Joseph_Emory_Davis|  secured the younger Daviss appointment to the  |United_States_Military_Academy|United_States_Military_Academy| . After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the  |United_States_Army|United_States_Army| . He fought in the  |Mexican–American_War|Mexican–American_War|  , as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War| , he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi, which his brother Joseph gave him, and owned as many as 113 slaves.  Although Davis argued against  |secession|Secession_In_The_United_States|  in 1858,  he believed that states had an unquestionable right to leave the  |Union|United_States| .     Davis married  |Sarah_Knox_Taylor|Sarah_Knox_Taylor| , daughter of general and future President  |Zachary_Taylor|Zachary_Taylor| , in 1835, when he was 27 years old. They were both stricken with  |malaria|Malaria|  soon thereafter, and Sarah died after three months of marriage. Davis recovered slowly and suffered from recurring bouts of the disease throughout his life.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 70–71. At the age of 36, Davis married again, to 18-year-old  |Varina_Howell|Varina_Davis| , a native of  |Natchez,_Mississippi|Natchez,_Mississippi| , who had been educated in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  and had some family ties in the North. They had six children. Only two survived him, and only one married and had children.     Many historians attribute some of the Confederacys weaknesses to the poor leadership of Davis.  |Cooper_2008|Cooper| , pp.  3–4. His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors and generals, favoritism toward old friends, inability to get along with people who disagreed with him, neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones, and resistance to public opinion all worked against him.  Escott 1978, pp. 197, 256–74. Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart, President  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln| . After Davis was captured in 1865, he was accused of  |treason|Treasonunited_States|  and imprisoned at  |Fort_Monroe|Fort_Monroe|  in Hampton, Virginia. He was never tried and was released after two years. While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general,  |Robert_E._Lee|Robert_E._Lee| . Davis wrote a memoir entitled  The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot. He became a hero of the  |Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy|Lost_Cause_Of_The_Confederacy|  in the post- |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era|  South.          Jefferson Finis Davis was born at the family homestead in  |Fairview,_Kentucky|Fairview,_Kentucky| , on June 3, 1808. He sometimes gave his year of birth as 1807. Davis 1996, p. 709. He dropped his middle name in later life, although he sometimes used a middle initial. Davis was the youngest of ten children born to Jane and Samuel Emory Davis; his oldest brother  |Joseph_Emory_Davis|Joseph_Emory_Davis|  was 23 years his senior. He was named after then-incumbent President  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| , whom his father admired. Strode 1955, p. 3. In the early 20th century, the  |Jefferson_Davis_State_Historic_Site|Jefferson_Davis_State_Historic_Site|  was established near the site of Daviss birth.  Coincidentally,  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln|  was born in  |Hodgenville,_Kentucky|Hodgenville,_Kentucky| , only eight months later, less than  to the northeast of Fairview.     Daviss paternal grandparents were born in the region of  |Snowdonia|Snowdonia|  in  |North_Wales|North_Wales| , and immigrated separately to North America in the early 18th century. His maternal ancestors were English. After initially arriving in Philadelphia, Daviss paternal grandfather Evan settled in the  |colony_of_Georgia|Colony_Of_Georgia| , which was developed chiefly along the coast. He married the widow Lydia Emory Williams, who had two sons from a previous marriage, and their son Samuel Emory Davis was born in 1756. He served in the  |Continental_Army|Continental_Army|  during the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| , along with his two older half-brothers. In 1783, after the war, he married Jane Cook. She was born in 1759 to William Cook and his wife Sarah Simpson in what is now  |Christian_County,_Kentucky|Christian_County,_Kentucky| . In 1793, the Davis family relocated to Kentucky, establishing a community named Davisburg on the border of Christian and  |Todd|Todd_County,_Kentucky|  counties; it was eventually renamed Fairview.        During Daviss childhood, his family moved twice: in 1811 to  |St._Mary_Parish,_Louisiana|St._Mary_Parish,_Louisiana| , and less than a year later to  |Wilkinson_County,_Mississippi|Wilkinson_County,_Mississippi| . Three of his older brothers served in the  |War_of_1812|War_Of_1812| . In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy in the small town of  |Woodville|Woodville,_Mississippi| , near the family cotton  |plantation|Plantations_In_The_American_South| . His brother Joseph acted as a surrogate father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at  |St._Rose_Priory|St._Rose_Priory| , a school operated by the  |Dominican_Order|Dominican_Order|  in  |Washington_County,_Kentucky|Washington_County,_Kentucky| . At the time, he was the only Protestant student at the school. Davis returned to Mississippi in 1818, studying at  |Jefferson_College|Jefferson_College|  in  |Washington|Washington,_Mississippi| . He returned to Kentucky in 1821, studying at  |Transylvania_University|Transylvania_University|  in  |Lexington|Lexington,_Kentucky| . Strode, 1955, pp. 11–27. His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old. Strode 1955, pp. 4–5.       Joseph arranged for Davis to get an appointment and attend the  |United_States_Military_Academy|United_States_Military_Academy|  starting in late 1824.  While there, he was placed under house arrest for his role in the  |Eggnog_Riot|Eggnog_Riot|  during Christmas 1826. Cadets smuggled whiskey into the academy to make eggnog, and more than one-third of the cadets were involved in the incident. In June 1828, Davis graduated 23rd in a class of 33. U.S. Military Academy, Register of Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy from March 16 to January 1, 1850. Compiled by Capt. George W. Cullum. West Point, N.Y.: 1850, p. 148.     Following graduation, Second Lieutenant Davis was assigned to the  |1st_Infantry_Regiment|1St_Infantry_Regiment|  and was stationed at  |Fort_Crawford|Fort_Crawford| ,  |Prairie_du_Chien|Prairie_Du_Chien| ,  |Michigan_Territory|Michigan_Territory| .  |Zachary_Taylor|Zachary_Taylor| , a future  |president_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States| , had assumed command shortly before Davis arrived in early 1829. In March 1832, Davis returned to Mississippi on furlough, having had no leave since he first arrived at Fort Crawford. He was still in Mississippi during the  |Black_Hawk_War|Black_Hawk_War|  but returned to the fort in August. At the conclusion of the war, Colonel Taylor assigned him to escort  |Black_Hawk|Black_Hawk|  to prison. Davis made an effort to shield Black Hawk from curiosity seekers, and the chief noted in his autobiography that Davis treated him with much kindness and showed empathy for the leaders situation as a prisoner. Strode 1955, p. 76.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 53–55.       Davis fell in love with  |Sarah_Knox_Taylor|Sarah_Knox_Taylor| , daughter of his commanding officer, Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylors permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 65. Daviss own experience led him to appreciate Taylors objection. He consulted his older brother  |Joseph|Joseph_Emory_Davis| , and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. Strode 1955, pp. 86–94. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave, Davis 1996, pp. 70–71. but he did not tell Taylor he intended to resign. Davis 1996, p. 69. Against his former commanders wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in  |Louisville,_Kentucky|Louisville,_Kentucky| . His resignation became effective June 30. Davis 1996, pp. 69, 72.     Daviss older brother Joseph had been very successful and owned  |Hurricane_Plantation|Hurricane_Plantation|  and  Strode 1955, p. 94. of adjoining land along the  |Mississippi_River|Mississippi_River|  on a peninsula  south of  |Vicksburg,_Mississippi|Vicksburg,_Mississippi| . The adjoining land was known as Brierfield, since it was largely covered with brush and briers. Wanting to have his youngest brother and his wife nearby, Joseph gave use of Brierfield to Jefferson, who eventually developed  |Brierfield_Plantation|Brierfield_Plantation|  there. Joseph retained the title.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 81–83, 616.     In August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah traveled south to his sister Annas home in  |West_Feliciana_Parish,_Louisiana|West_Feliciana_Parish,_Louisiana| ; the plantation was known as Locust Grove. They intended to spend the hot summer months in the countryside away from the river floodplain, for their health, but both of them contracted either  |malaria|Malaria|  or  |yellow_fever|Yellow_Fever| .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 70–71 Sarah died at the age of 21 on September 15, 1835, after three months of marriage. Davis 1996, pp. 74–75.  Davis was also severely ill, and his family feared for his life. In the month following Sarahs death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak. Davis 1996, p. 75.     In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to  |Havana,_Cuba|Havana,_Cuba| , to help restore his health. He was accompanied by James Pemberton, his only slave at the time. Davis 1996, pp.  75–76. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate  |George_Wallace_Jones|George_Wallace_Jones| . He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi. Davis 1996, p. 76. Strode 1955, p. 108–09.     For several years following Sarahs death, Davis was reclusive and honored her memory. He spent time clearing Brierfield and developing his plantation, studied government and history, and had private political discussions with his brother Joseph. Strode 1955, pp. 105, 109–11. By early 1836, Davis had purchased 16 slaves; he held 40 slaves by 1840, and 74 by 1845. Davis promoted Pemberton to be overseer of the field teams. In 1860, he owned 113 slaves.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp.  75–79, 229. Davis 1996, p. 89.     In 1840, Davis first became involved in politics when he attended a  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  meeting in Vicksburg and, to his surprise, was chosen as a delegate to the partys state convention in  |Jackson|Jackson,_Mississippi| . In 1842, he attended the Democratic convention, and, in 1843, became a Democratic candidate for the state House of Representatives from the  |Warren_County|Warren_County,_Mississippi| -Vicksburg district; he lost his first election. Strode 1955, pp. 121–23. In 1844, Davis was sent to the party convention for a third time, and his interest in politics deepened. He was selected as one of six presidential electors for the  |1844_presidential_election|1844_United_States_Presidential_Election|  and campaigned effectively throughout Mississippi for the Democratic candidate  |James_K._Polk|James_K._Polk| .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 84–88, 98–100.          In 1844, Davis met  |Varina_Banks_Howell|Varina_Davis| , then 18 years old, whom his brother Joseph had invited for the Christmas season at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor  |Richard_Howell|Richard_Howell| ; her mothers family was from the South and included successful Scots-Irish planters. Within a month of their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents initial concerns about his age and politics. They were married on February 26, 1845. Strode 1955, pp. 125, 136.         During this time, Davis was persuaded to become a candidate for the United States House of Representatives and began canvassing for the election. In early October 1845 he traveled to  |Woodville|Woodville,_Mississippi|  to give a speech. He arrived a day early to visit his mother there, only to find that she had died the day before. After the funeral, he rode the  back to Natchez to deliver the news, then returned to Woodville again to deliver his speech. He won the election and entered the 29th Congress. Strode 1955, pp. 140–41.         Jefferson and Varina had six children; three died before reaching adulthood. Samuel Emory, born July 30, 1852, was named after his grandfather; he died June 30, 1854, of an undiagnosed disease. Strode 1955, pp. 242, 268. Margaret Howell was born February 25, 1855, Strode 1955, p. 273. and was the only child to marry and raise a family. She married Joel Addison Hayes, Jr. , and they had five children.  They were married in  |St._Lazarus_Church|Grace-St._Lukes_Episcopal_Churchhistory| , nicknamed The Confederate Officers Church , in  |Memphis,_Tennessee|Memphis,_Tennessee| .  Allen 1999, pp. 197–98. In the late 19th century, they moved from Memphis to  |Colorado_Springs,_Colorado|Colorado_Springs,_Colorado| . She died on July 18, 1909, at the age of 54.      Jefferson Davis, Jr., was born January 16, 1857. He died at age 21 because of  |yellow_fever|Yellow_Fever|  on October 16, 1878, during an  |epidemic|History_Of_Yellow_Feverlower_Mississippi_Valley:_1878|  in the Mississippi River Valley that caused 20,000 deaths. Strode 1964, p. 436. Joseph Evan, born on April 18, 1859, died at the age of five due to an accidental fall on April 30, 1864.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 480. William Howell, born on December 6, 1861, was named for Varinas father; he died of  |diphtheria|Diphtheria|  at age 10 on October 16, 1872.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 595.  |Varina_Anne|Varina_Anne_Davis| , known as Winnie , was born on June 27, 1864, several months after her brother Josephs death. She was known as the Daughter of the Confederacy as she was born during the war. After her parents refused to let her marry into a northern abolitionist family, she never married. Strode 1964, pp. 527–28. She died nine years after her father, on September 18, 1898, at age 34.    |Jim_Limber|Jim_Limber|  an  |octoroon|Octoroon|  orphan was briefly a  |ward|Ward|  of Jefferson Davis and Varina Howell Davis. New York Times, June 4, 1865      Davis had poor health for most of his life, including repeated bouts of malaria, battle wounds from fighting in the  |Mexican–American_War|Mexican–American_War|  and a chronic eye infection that made bright light painful. He also had  |trigeminal_neuralgia|Trigeminal_Neuralgia| , a nerve disorder that causes severe pain in the face; it has been called one of the most painful known ailments.        In 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis raised a volunteer regiment, the  |Mississippi_Rifles|155Th_Infantry_Regiment| , becoming its colonel under the command of his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. Strode 1955, p. 157. On July 21 the regiment sailed from New Orleans for Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the  |M1841_Mississippi_rifle|M1841_Mississippi_Rifle| . At this time,  |smoothbore|Smoothbore|  muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. President  |James_K._Polk|James_K._Polk|  had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long enough for an important vote on the  |Walker_tariff|Walker_Tariff| . General  |Winfield_Scott|Winfield_Scott|  objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was armed with the rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. Allen 1999, pp. 135–36. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles because it was the first to be fully armed with these new weapons. Strode 1955, pp. 157–62. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.      In September 1846, Davis participated in the  |Battle_of_Monterrey|Battle_Of_Monterrey| , during which he led a successful charge on the La Teneria fort. Strode 1955, pp. 164–67. On October 28, Davis resigned his seat in the House of Representatives.   On February 22, 1847, Davis fought bravely at the  |Battle_of_Buena_Vista|Battle_Of_Buena_Vista|  and was shot in the foot, being carried to safety by  |Robert_H._Chilton|Robert_H._Chilton| . In recognition of Daviss bravery and initiative, Taylor is reputed to have said, My daughter, sir, was a better judge of men than I was. On May 17, President Polk offered Davis a federal commission as a  |brigadier_general|Brigadier_General|  and command of a  |brigade|Brigade|  of militia. Davis declined the appointment, arguing that the  |Constitution|U.S._Constitution|  gives the power of appointing militia officers to the states, not the federal government. Strode 1955, p. 188.              Honoring Daviss war service, Governor  |Albert_G._Brown|Albert_G._Brown|  of Mississippi appointed him to the vacant position of United States Senator  |Jesse_Speight|Jesse_Speight| , a Democrat, who had died on May 1, 1847. Davis, also a Democrat, took his temporary seat on December 5, and in January 1848 he was elected by the state legislature to serve the remaining two years of the term. Dodd 1907, pp. 12, 93.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 165–66. In December, during the  |30th_United_States_Congress|30Th_United_States_Congress| , Davis was made a regent of the  |Smithsonian_Institution|Smithsonian_Institution|  and began serving on the Committee on Military Affairs and the Library Committee. Strode 1955, p. 195.     In 1848, Senator Davis proposed and introduced an amendment to the  |Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo|Treaty_Of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo|  that would have annexed most of northeastern Mexico, but it failed on a vote of 11 to 44.  Southerners wanted to increase territory held in Mexico as an area for the expansion of slavery. Regarding  |Cuba|Cuba| , Davis declared that it must be ours to increase the number of slaveholding constituencies. McPherson 1989, p. 104. He also was concerned about the security implications of a Spanish holding lying relatively close to the coast of  |Florida|Florida| . Strode 1955, p. 210.     A group of Cuban revolutionaries led by Venezuelan adventurer  |Narciso_López|Narciso_López|  intended to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule by the sword. Searching for a military leader for a  |filibuster|Filibuster|  expedition, they first offered command of the Cuban forces to General  |William_J._Worth|William_J._Worth| , but he died before making his decision. Strode 1955, p. 211. In the summer of 1849, López visited Davis and asked him to lead the expedition. He offered an immediate payment of $100,000 , plus the same amount when Cuba was liberated. Davis turned down the offer, stating that it was inconsistent with his duty as a senator. When asked to recommend someone else, Davis suggested  |Robert_E._Lee|Robert_E._Lee| , then an army major in  |Baltimore|Baltimore| ; López approached Lee, who also declined on the grounds of his duty.  Strode 1955, pp. 211–12.     The Senate made Davis chairman of the  |Committee_on_Military_Affairs|United_States_Senate_Committee_On_Armed_Services|  on December 3, 1849, during the first session of the  |31st_United_States_Congress|31St_United_States_Congress| . On December 29 he was elected to a full six-year term . Davis had not served a year when he resigned to run for the governorship of Mississippi on the issue of the  |Compromise_of_1850|Compromise_Of_1850| , which he opposed. He was defeated by fellow Senator  |Henry_Stuart_Foote|Henry_Stuart_Foote|  by 999 votes.  Left without political office, Davis continued his political activity. He took part in a convention on  |states_rights|States_Rights| , held at  |Jackson,_Mississippi|Jackson,_Mississippi| , in January 1852. In the weeks leading up to the  |presidential_election_of_1852|1852_United_States_Presidential_Election| , he campaigned in numerous Southern states for Democratic candidates  |Franklin_Pierce|Franklin_Pierce|  and  |William_R._King|William_R._King| . Dodd 1907, pp. 130–31.           |Franklin_Pierce|Franklin_Pierce| , after winning the presidential election, made Davis his  |Secretary_of_War|United_States_Secretary_Of_War|  in 1853.  In this capacity, Davis began the  |Pacific_Railroad_Surveys|Pacific_Railroad_Surveys|  in order to determine various possible routes for the proposed  |Transcontinental_Railroad|First_Transcontinental_Railroad| . He promoted the  |Gadsden_Purchase|Gadsden_Purchase|  of todays southern  |Arizona|Arizona|  from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed and the land was purchased in December 1853.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 257. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, maintaining that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale. It also added four regiments, which increased the armys size from about 11,000 to about 15,000.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 251. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. Dodd 1907, pp. 80, 133–35. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the  |Washington_Aqueduct|Washington_Aqueduct|  and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 259. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierces loss of the Democratic nomination to  |James_Buchanan|James_Buchanan| . Daviss term was to end with Pierces, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857. Dodd 1907, pp. 152–53.       In the 1840s, tensions were growing between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The  |Wilmot_Proviso|Wilmot_Proviso| , introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, it would have banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The  |Compromise_of_1850|Compromise_Of_1850|  brought a temporary respite, but the  |Dred_Scott|Dred_Scott_V._Sandford|  case, decided by the  |United_States_Supreme_Court|United_States_Supreme_Court|  in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice  |Roger_Taney|Roger_Taney|  ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union. Dodd 1909, pp. 122–29.     Daviss renewed service in the Senate was interrupted in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him with the loss of his left eye. He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks. Allen 1999, p. 232. He spent the summer of 1858 in  |Portland,_Maine|Portland,_Maine| . On the  |Fourth_of_July|Independence_Day| , Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near  |Boston|Boston| . He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in  |Faneuil_Hall|Faneuil_Hall| , Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after. Dodd 1907, pp. 12, 171–72.     As he explained in his memoir The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Davis believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. At the same time, he counseled delay among his fellow Southerners, because he did not think that the North would permit the peaceable exercise of the right to secession. Having served as secretary of war under President Pierce, he also knew that the South lacked the military and naval resources necessary for defense in a war. Following the election of  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln|  in  |1860|1860_United_States_Presidential_Election| , however, events accelerated.  |South_Carolina|South_Carolina|  adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860, and Mississippi did so on January 9, 1861. Davis had expected this but waited until he received official notification. On January 21, the day Davis called the saddest day of my life ,  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 3. he delivered a farewell address to the United States Senate,  |resigned|Resignation_From_The_United_States_Senate|  and returned to Mississippi.      In 1861, the  |Episcopal_Church|Episcopal_Church|  split and Davis became a member of the newly founded  |Protestant_Episcopal_Church_in_the_Confederate_States_of_America|Protestant_Episcopal_Church_In_The_Confederate_States_Of_America| . He attended  |St._Pauls_Episcopal_Church|St._Pauls_Episcopal_Church|  in Richmond while he was President of the Confederacy. The two denominations were reunited in 1865.           Anticipating a call for his services since Mississippi had seceded, Davis had sent a telegraph message to Governor  |John_J._Pettus|John_J._Pettus|  saying, Judge what Mississippi requires of me and place me accordingly.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 322. On January 23, 1861, Pettus made Davis a major general of the  |Army_of_Mississippi|Army_Of_Mississippi| . On February 9, a constitutional convention met at  |Montgomery,_Alabama|Montgomery,_Alabama| , and considered Davis and  |Robert_Toombs|Robert_Toombs|  of Georgia as a possible president. Davis, who had widespread support from six of the seven states, easily won. He was seen as the champion of a slave society and embodied the values of the planter class , and was elected provisional Confederate President by acclamation.  Coulter 1950, p. 25. He was inaugurated on February 18, 1861. Strode 1955, pp. 402–03.   |Alexander_H._Stephens|Alexander_H._Stephens|  was chosen as Vice President, but he and Davis feuded constantly. Dodd 1907, p. 221.     Davis was the first choice because of his strong political and military credentials. He wanted to serve as commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies but said he would serve wherever directed. Coulter 1950, p. 24. His wife  |Varina_Davis|Varina_Davis|  later wrote that when he received word that he had been chosen as president, Reading that telegram he looked so grieved that I feared some evil had befallen our family.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 352.     Several forts in Confederate territory remained in Union hands. Davis sent a commission to Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, as well as the Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State  |William_Seward|William_H._Seward|  through  |Supreme_Court_Justice|Supreme_Court_Justice| |John_A._Campbell|John_Archibald_Campbell| , the latter of whom later resigned from the federal government, as he was from Alabama. Seward hinted that  |Fort_Sumter|Fort_Sumter|  would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp.  361–62.     On March 1, 1861, Davis appointed General  |P._G._T._Beauregard|P._G._T._Beauregard|  to command all  |Confederate_troops|Confederate_States_Army|  in the vicinity of  |Charleston,_South_Carolina|Charleston,_South_Carolina| , where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geopolitical posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union garrison had but half a dozen officers and 127 soldiers under Major  |Robert_Anderson|Robert_Anderson| . Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Captain  |Abner_Doubleday|Abner_Doubleday| . More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce  |Fort_Pickens|Fort_Pickens|  in Florida and Fort Sumter. The U.S. President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. For Lincoln, Davis, as the leader of an insurrection, was without legal standing in U.S. affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. The fact that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fort. He informed Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from  at sea.     Davis faced the most important decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, to use military force to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Anderson did not surrender. With Daviss endorsement, Beauregard began the  |bombarding_of_the_fort|Battle_Of_Fort_Sumter|  in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fort meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up 75,000 state militiamen to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 337–40.  Strode 1959, pp. 24–66. McPherson 1989, pp. 273–75.       When  |Virginia|Virginia_In_The_American_Civil_War|  joined the Confederacy, Davis moved his government to  |Richmond|Richmond,_Virginia|  in May 1861. He and his family took up his residence there at the  |White_House_of_the_Confederacy|White_House_Of_The_Confederacy|  later that month. Strode 1959, pp. 90–94. Having served since February as the provisional president, Davis was  |elected|Confederate_States_Presidential_Election|  to a full six-year term on November 6, 1861, and was inaugurated on February 22, 1862. Dodd 1907, p. 263.     At the start of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North compared to 9 million in the South. While the Norths population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color. While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners were terrified at the idea of a black man with a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. There was also the additional burden that the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and owned . The North had vastly greater industrial capacity; built nearly all the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery; and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.      Much of the railroad track that existed in the Confederacy was of simple railway design just meant to carry the large bales of cotton to local river ports in the harvest season. These often did not connect to other rail-lines, making internal shipments of goods difficult at best. While the Union had a large navy, the new Confederate Navy had only a few captured warships or newly built vessels. These did surprisingly well but ultimately were sunk or abandoned as the Union Navy controlled more rivers and ports. Rebel raiders loosed on the Northern ships on the Atlantic did tremendous damage and sent Yankee ships into safe harbors as insurance rates soared. The Union blockade of the South, however, made imports via blockade runners difficult and expensive. Somewhat awkwardly, these runners didnt bring significant amounts of war materials that were so desperately needed, but rather the European luxuries sought as a relief from the wars horrifying conditions. McPherson 1989, pp. 313–19.      In June 1862, Davis was forced to assign General  |Robert_E._Lee|Robert_E._Lee|  to replace the wounded  |Joseph_E._Johnston|Joseph_E._Johnston|  to command of the  |Army_of_Northern_Virginia|Army_Of_Northern_Virginia| , the main Confederate army in the  |Eastern_Theater|Eastern_Theater_Of_The_American_Civil_War| . That December Davis made a tour of Confederate armies in the  |west_of_the_country|Western_Theater_Of_The_American_Civil_War| . He had a very small circle of military advisers. He largely made the main strategic decisions on his own, though he had special respect for Lees views. Given the Confederacys limited resources compared with the Union, Davis decided that the Confederacy would have to fight mostly on the strategic defensive. He maintained this outlook throughout the war, paying special attention to the defense of his national capital at Richmond. He approved Lees strategic offensives when he felt that military success would both shake Northern self-confidence and strengthen the peace movements there. However, the several campaigns invading the North were met with defeat. A bloody battle at  |Antietam|Battle_Of_Antietam|  in Maryland as well as the ride into Kentucky,  |the_Confederate_Heartland_Offensive|Confederate_Heartland_Offensive| |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 401–02. drained irreplaceable men and talented officers. A final offense led to the three-day bloodletting at  |Gettysburg|Battle_Of_Gettysburg|  in Pennsylvania ,  crippling the South still further. The status of techniques and munitions made the defensive side much more likely to endure: an expensive lesson vindicating Daviss initial belief.            As provisional president in 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of  |Georgia|Georgia|  was the first Secretary of State and  |Christopher_Memminger|Christopher_Memminger|  of  |South_Carolina|South_Carolina|  became Secretary of the Treasury.  |LeRoy_Pope_Walker|Leroy_Pope_Walker|  of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by  |Clement_Clay|Clement_Claiborne_Clay|  and  |William_Yancey|William_Lowndes_Yancey|  .  |John_Reagan|John_Henninger_Reagan|  of  |Texas|Texas|  became Postmaster General.  |Judah_P._Benjamin|Judah_P._Benjamin|  of  |Louisiana|Louisiana|  became Attorney General. Although  |Stephen_Mallory|Stephen_Mallory|  was not put forward by the delegation from his state of  |Florida|Florida| , Davis insisted that he was the best man for the job of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed. Patrick 1944, p. 51.     Since the Confederacy was founded, among other things, on states rights, one important factor in Daviss choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions. Patrick 1944, pp. 49–50, 56.     As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction increased and there were frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned within a few months of his appointment to join the army.  |Robert_Hunter|Robert_M._T._Hunter|  of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. Patrick 1944, pp. 53, 89. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and  |Thomas_Bragg|Thomas_Bragg|  of North Carolina  took Benjamins place as Attorney General. Patrick 1944, p. 53, 116–17.      Following the  |November_1861_election|1861_Confederate_States_Presidential_Election| , Davis announced the permanent cabinet in March 1862. Benjamin moved again, to Secretary of State.  |George_W._Randolph|George_W._Randolph|  of Virginia had been made the Secretary of War. Mallory continued as Secretary of the Navy and Reagan as Postmaster General. Both kept their positions throughout the war. Memminger remained Secretary of the Treasury, while  |Thomas_Hill_Watts|Thomas_Hill_Watts|  of Alabama was made Attorney General. Patrick 1944, pp. 55–57.     In 1862 Randolph resigned from the War Department, and  |James_Seddon|James_Seddon|  of Virginia was appointed to replace him. In late 1863, Watts resigned as Attorney General to take office as the Governor of Alabama, and  |George_Davis|George_Davis|  of North Carolina took his place. In 1864, Memminger withdrew from the Treasury post due to congressional opposition, and was replaced by  |George_Trenholm|George_Trenholm|  of South Carolina. In 1865 congressional opposition likewise caused Seddon to withdraw, and he was replaced by  |John_C._Breckinridge|John_C._Breckinridge|  of  |Kentucky|Kentucky| . Patrick 1944, p. 57.     Cotton was the Souths primary export and the basis of its economy and the system of production the South used was dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to European nations, but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The  |Union_blockade|Union_Blockade|  of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade would cut off the supply of cotton to Britain and other European nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincolns  |Emancipation_Proclamation|Emancipation_Proclamation|  of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the Souths military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were not convinced that the Confederacy had the strength to become independent. In the end, not a single foreign nation recognized the Confederate States of America.           Most historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed military strategy, his selection of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Beringer, Richard E., Hattaway, Herman, Jones, Archer, and Still, William N., Jr. . Why the South Lost the Civil War. Athens: University of Georgia Press. Woodworth 1990, p. 309. Until late in the war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. Davis was loathed by much of his military, Congress and the public — even before the Confederacy died on his watch, and General Beauregard wrote in a letter: If he were to die today, the whole country would rejoice at it.      On January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it was far too late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater . He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg,  |Vicksburg|Siege_Of_Vicksburg|  simultaneously fell, and the Union took control of the  |Mississippi_River|Mississippi_River| , splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces on both sides of the Mississippi River rested primarily on Daviss inability to create a harmonious departmental arrangement or to force such generals as  |Edmund_Kirby_Smith|Edmund_Kirby_Smith| ,  |Earl_Van_Dorn|Earl_Van_Dorn| , and  |Theophilus_H._Holmes|Theophilus_H._Holmes|  to work together.  In fact, during the late stages of the  |Franklin–Nashville_Campaign|Franklin–Nashville_Campaign| , Davis warned Beauregard that Kirby Smith would prove uncooperative to whatever proposal the Creole general had in mind for him. Hood, Stephen M. John Bell Hood: The Rise, Fall, and Resurrection of a Confederate General. El Dorado Hills, CA: Savas Beatie, 2013. p. 189–94.      Davis has been faulted for poor coordination and management of his generals. This includes his reluctance to resolve a dispute between  |Leonidas_Polk|Leonidas_Polk| , a personal friend, and  |Braxton_Bragg|Braxton_Bragg| , who was defeated in important battles and distrusted by his subordinates. Woodworth 1990, pp. 92–93. He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious  |Joseph_E._Johnston|Joseph_E._Johnston|  until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with  |John_Bell_Hood|John_Bell_Hood| , Hattaway and Beringer 2002, pp. 338–44. Jefferson Davis to Col. James Phelan, March 1, 1865, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I , Vol. 47, pt. 2, pp. 1303–12. a fellow Kentuckian who had shared the Confederate Presidents views on aggressive military policies. Hood, p. 10.     Davis gave speeches to soldiers and politicians but largely ignored the  |common_people|Plain_Folk_Of_The_Old_South| , who came to resent the favoritism shown to the rich and powerful; Davis thus failed to harness Confederate nationalism. Escott 1978, pp. 269–70. One historian speaks of the heavy-handed intervention of the Confederate government. Economic intervention, regulation, and state control of manpower, production and transport were much greater in the Confederacy than in the Union.  Davis did not use his presidential pulpit to rally the people with stirring rhetoric; he called instead for people to be fatalistic and to die for their new country.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 475, 496. Apart from two month-long trips across the country where he met a few hundred people, Davis stayed in Richmond where few people saw him; newspapers had limited circulation, and most Confederates had little favorable information about him.      To finance the war, the Confederate government initially issued bonds, but investment from the public never met the demands. Taxes were lower than in the Union and collected with less efficiency; European investment was also insufficient. As the war proceeded, both the Confederate government and the individual states printed more and more paper money. Inflation increased from 60% in 1861 to 300% in 1863 and 600% in 1864. Davis did not seem to grasp the enormity of the problem.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 351–52. Escott 1978, pp. 146, 269.     In April 1863, food shortages led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 447, 480, 496. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even more seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 511.     Davis is widely evaluated as a less effective war leader than Lincoln, even though Davis had extensive military experience and Lincoln had little. Davis would have preferred to be an army general and tended to manage military matters himself. Lincoln and Davis led in very different ways. According to one historian,          There were many factors that led to Union victory over the Confederacy, and Davis recognized from the start that the South was at a distinct disadvantage; but in the end, Lincoln helped to achieve victory, whereas Davis contributed to defeat.             In March 1865, General Order 14 provided for enlisting slaves into the army, with a promise of freedom for service. The idea had been suggested years earlier, but Davis did not act upon it until late in the war, and very few slaves were enlisted.      On April 3, with  |Union_troops|Union_Army|  under  |Ulysses_S._Grant|Ulysses_S._Grant|  poised to capture Richmond, Davis escaped to  |Danville,_Virginia|Danville,_Virginia| , together with the Confederate Cabinet, leaving on the  |Richmond_and_Danville_Railroad|Richmond_And_Danville_Railroad| . Lincoln was in Daviss Richmond office just 40 hours later.  |William_T._Sutherlin|William_T._Sutherlin|  turned over  |his_mansion|Danville_Public_Library| , which served as Daviss temporary residence from April 3 to April 10, 1865.  On about April 12, Davis received  |Robert_E._Lees_letter_announcing_surrender|Conclusion_Of_The_American_Civil_War| .  He issued his last official proclamation as president of the Confederacy, and then went south to  |Greensboro,_North_Carolina|Greensboro,_North_Carolina| . Dodd 1907, pp. 353–57.     After Lees surrender, a public meeting was held in  |Shreveport,_Louisiana|Shreveport,_Louisiana| , at which many speakers supported continuation of the war. Plans were developed for the Davis government to flee to  |Havana|Havana| , Cuba. There, the leaders would regroup and head to the Confederate-controlled Trans-Mississippi area by way of the  |Rio_Grande|Rio_Grande| .  None of these plans were put into practice.     On April 14,  |Lincoln_was_shot|Assassination_Of_Abraham_Lincoln| , dying the next day. Davis expressed regret at his death. He later said that he believed Lincoln would have been less harsh with the South than his successor,  |Andrew_Johnson|Andrew_Johnson| .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 528–29. In the aftermath, Johnson issued a $100,000 reward for the capture of Davis and accused him of helping to plan the assassination. As the Confederate military structure fell into disarray, the search for Davis by Union forces intensified.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 533.     President Davis met with his Confederate Cabinet for the last time on May 5, 1865, in  |Washington,_Georgia|Washington,_Georgia| , and officially dissolved the Confederate government.  The meeting took place at the Heard house, the Georgia Branch Bank Building, with 14 officials present. Along with their hand-picked escort led by  |Given_Campbell|Given_Campbell| , Davis and his wife  |Varina_Davis|Varina_Davis|  were captured by Union forces on May 10 at  |Irwinville|Irwinville,_Georgia|  in  |Irwin_County,_Georgia|Irwin_County,_Georgia| .         Mrs. Davis recounted the circumstances of her husbands capture as described below: Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons ... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning he would not be recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved. From Varina Banks Howell Davis to  |Francis_Preston_Blair|Francis_Preston_Blair| , Savannah, Ga., June 6, 1865. In Blair, Gist.  Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C., Vol. 21 , pp. 155–85.      It was reported in the media that Davis put his wifes overcoat over his shoulders while fleeing. This led to the persistent rumor that he attempted to flee in womens clothes, inspiring caricatures that portrayed him as such.  Over 40 years later, an article in the  Washington Herald  claimed that Mrs. Daviss heavy  |shawl|Shawl|  had been placed on Davis who was always extremely sensitive to cold air , to protect him from the chilly atmosphere of the early hour of the morning by the slave James Henry Jones, Daviss  |valet|Valet|  who served Davis and his family during and after the Civil War. , The Washington Herald, 4 November 1906: 6, col. 5. Meanwhile, Daviss belongings continued on the train bound for  |Cedar_Key,_Florida|Cedar_Key,_Florida| . They were first hidden at Senator  |David_Levy_Yulees|David_Levy_Yulee|  plantation in Florida, then placed in the care of a railroad agent in  |Waldo|Waldo,_Florida| . On June 15, 1865, Union soldiers seized Daviss personal baggage from the agent, together with some of the Confederate governments records. A historical marker was erected at this site.    In 1939,  |Jefferson_Davis_Memorial_Historic_Site|Jefferson_Davis_Memorial_Historic_Site|  was opened to mark the place where Confederate President Jefferson Davis was captured.          On May 19, 1865, Davis was imprisoned in a  |casemate|Casemate|  at  |Fortress_Monroe|Fort_Monroe| , on the coast of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General  |Nelson_Miles|Nelson_Miles| , who was in charge of the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the attending physician warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Daviss treatment continued to improve. Dodd 1907, pp. 366–68.       |Pope_Pius_IX|Pope_Pius_Ix|  , after learning that Davis was a prisoner, sent him a portrait inscribed with the Latin words Venite ad me omnes qui laboratis, et ego reficiam vos, dicit Dominus , which correspond to ,  . Retrieved: 27 March 2014.  Come to me, all you that labor, and are burdened, and I will refresh you, sayeth the Lord . A hand-woven  |crown_of_thorns|Crown_Of_Thorns|  associated with the portrait is often said to have been made by the Pope Strode 1964, p. 302.  but may have been woven by Daviss wife Varina.      Varina and their young daughter Winnie were allowed to join Davis, and the family was eventually given an apartment in the officers quarters. Davis was  |indicted|Indictment|  for  |treason|Treason|  while imprisoned; one of his attorneys was ex-Governor  |Thomas_Pratt|Thomas_Pratt|  of  |Maryland|Maryland| .  |Blackford,_Charles_M.|Charles_Minor_Blackford|  The Trials and Trial of Jefferson Davis. Vol. XXIX, in Southern Historical Society, edited by R. A. Brock, 45–81. Richmond, VA: William Ellis Jones, 1901, p. 62. There was a great deal of discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis. While there was no consensus in President Johnsons cabinet to do so, on June 11, 1866 the House of Representatives voted, 105-19, to support such a trial against Davis. Although Davis wanted such a trial for himself, there were no treason trials against anyone, as it was felt they would probably not succeed and would impede reconciliation. There was also a concern at the time that such action could result in a  |judicial_decision|Judicial_Opinion|  that would validate the  |constitutionality|Constitutionality|  of secession .                 A jury of 12 black and 12 white men was recruited by United States Circuit Court judge  |John_Curtiss_Underwood|John_Curtiss_Underwood|  in preparation for the trial.      After two years of imprisonment, Davis was released on bail of $100,000, which was posted by prominent citizens including  |Horace_Greeley|Horace_Greeley| ,  |Cornelius_Vanderbilt|Cornelius_Vanderbilt|  and  |Gerrit_Smith|Gerrit_Smith| . Strode 1955, p. 305.  Davis went to  |Montreal,_Quebec|Montreal,_Quebec|  to join his family which had fled there earlier, and lived in  |Lennoxville,_Quebec|Lennoxville,_Quebec|  until 1868,  also visiting Cuba and Europe in search of work.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 568–84. At one stage he stayed as a guest of James Smith, a foundry owner in Glasgow, who had struck up a friendship with Davis when he toured the Southern States promoting his foundry business.  Davis remained under indictment until Andrew Johnson issued on  |Christmas_Day|Christmas|  of 1868 a presidential  |pardon|Pardonfederal_Law|  and  |amnesty|Amnesty|  for the offense of treason to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion and after a federal  |circuit_court|Circuit_Court|  on February 15, 1869, dismissed the case against Davis after the governments attorney informed the court that he would no longer continue to prosecute Davis.            After his release from prison and pardon, Davis faced continued financial pressures, as well as an unsettled family life. His elder brother  |Joseph|Joseph_Emory_Davis|  died in 1870, his son William Howell Davis in 1872 and Jefferson Davis Jr. in 1878. His wife Varina was often ill or abroad, and for a time refused to live with him in  |Memphis,_Tennessee|Memphis,_Tennessee| . Davis resented having to resort to charity, and would only accept jobs befitting his former positions as U.S. Senator and Confederate President; several that he accepted proved financial failures. Collins 2005, p. 20.     On one of his many trips to England,  Davis sought a mercantile position in  |Liverpool|Liverpool,_England| . However, British companies were wary, both because Britons were not interested in Canadian mines, and because Mississippi defaulted on debts in the 1840s, and  |Judah_Benjamin|Judah_Benjamin|  cautioned him against countering former wartime propaganda by  |Robert_J._Walker|Robert_J._Walker| .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 582. Davis also refused positions as head of  |Randolph-Macon_Academy|Randolph-Macon_Academy|  in Virginia and the  |University_of_the_South|University_Of_The_South|  in  |Sewanee,_Tennessee|Sewanee,_Tennessee| , for financial reasons.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 586.     In 1869, Davis became president of the Carolina Life Insurance Company in  |Memphis,_Tennessee|Memphis,_Tennessee| , at an annual salary of $12,000, plus travel expenses, and resided at the  |Peabody_Hotel|Peabody_Hotel| . He recruited former Confederate officers as agents, and the board ratified his position in 1870.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 586–88, 594. By 1873, he suggested that the company have boards of trustees at its various branches, and that qualification for such be that the trustee either take out a policy of at least $5,000 or own at least $1,000 in the companys stock. Letter to W.T. Walthall from Memphis, Tennessee dated March 14, 1873 in William J. Cooper, Jr., Jefferson Davis: The essential Writings p. 405 By midyear the  |Panic_of_1873|Panic_Of_1873|  affected the company, and Davis resigned when it merged with another firm over his objections.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 596. He also planned a Davis Land Company in which investors would pay $10 per share for 5,700 acres Davis owned in Arkansas. He drafted a prospectus that stated he owed more than $40,000 and his income did not amount to $200. Collins 2005, p. 50.     Upon General Lees death, Davis agreed to preside over the Presbyterian memorial in Richmond on November 3, 1870. That speech prompted further invitations, although he declined them until July 1871, when he was commencement speaker at the  |University_of_the_South|University_Of_The_South| . Two years later Davis addressed the  |Virginia_Historical_Society|Virginia_Historical_Society|  at  |White_Sulpher_Springs|White_Sulphur_Springs,_Virginia| , where Davis proclaimed southerners were cheated not conquered and would never have surrendered if they had foreseen  |Congressional_Reconstruction|Congressional_Reconstruction| . Collins 2005, p. 21. In the summer of 1875, Davis agreed to speak at 17 agricultural fairs in the Midwest. He received criticism from the  |Chicago_Tribune|Chicago_Tribune|  and threats to his life in Indiana, but crowds in  |Kansas_City,_Missouri|Kansas_City,_Missouri|  and  |Fairview,_Kentucky|Fairview,_Kentucky|  received him well. During the next two years Davis began writing his books about the Confederacy, but only addressed fellow former soldiers: first veterans of the Mexican War , then Confederate veterans .     Early in  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era| , Davis publicly remained silent on his opinions, but privately condemned federal military rule and believed Republican authority over former Confederate states unjustified. Mississippi had elected  |Hiram_Rhodes_Revels|Hiram_Rhodes_Revels| , an African-American, as a U.S. Senator in 1870 to finish the term of  |Albert_G._Brown|Albert_G._Brown| . Furthermore, during the war, after Joseph Daviss departure from his plantations at  |Davis_Bend|Davis_Bend|  and the Union capture of Vicksburg and the surrounding area, General Grant had continued Joseph Daviss utopian experiment and ordered that the land be leased to the freedman and black refugees allowed to settle in the area. Although Joseph Davis ultimately received the land back, many black leaders came from the plantation, which had its own political system, including elected black judges and sheriffs. After the 1867 floods changed the course of the Mississippi River, Joseph Davis sold the plantation to the former slave who had operated a store and handled the white brothers cotton transaction,  |Ben_Montgomery|Ben_Montgomery| . Bens son  |Isaiah_Thornton_Montgomery|Isaiah_Montgomery|  became the first black to hold office in Mississippi when General E.O.C. Ord appointed him Davis Bends postmaster in 1867. Ben himself was elected justice of the peace. Other black leaders during Mississippi Reconstruction with Davis Bend ties included Israel Shadd, who became speaker of the states House of Representatives, and legislator Albert Johnson . Foner 1988, pp. 58–59.     Jefferson Davis considered Yankee and Negroe rule in the South oppressive, and said so in 1871 and especially after 1873.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 602–3 and notes, although no footnotes given for quotations in most relevant paragraph on p. 602 Like most of his white contemporaries, Davis believed that blacks were inferior to whites. One recent biographer believes Davis favored a  |Southern_social_order|Treatment_Of_Slaves_In_The_United_States|  that included a democratic white polity based firmly on dominance of a controlled and excluded black caste .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp.574–575, 602–603; the associated footnote only cites to letters.     While seeking to reclaim Davis Bend in 1865, Joseph Davis had filed documents with the  |Freedmans_Bureau|Freedmans_Bureau|  insisting that he had intentionally never given Jefferson Davis title to the latter. After receiving first a pardon, and then the lands back, he sold both plantations to former slave  |Ben_Montgomery|Ben_Montgomery|  and his sons, taking back a mortgage for $300,000 at 6% interest, with payments due each January 1 beginning in 1867.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 572–74. While Joseph Davis recognized he could not farm successfully without his 375 enslaved people, he expected the Montgomerys could better manage the labor situation, since in 1865 they had raised nearly 2000 bales of cotton and earned $160,000 in profits. Foner 1988, p. 59. However, when the Mississippi River flooded in spring 1867, it also changed course, ruining many acres and creating Davis Island . After Joseph Davis died two years later, his 1869 will left property to his two orphaned grandchildren, as well as to his brothers children, and named Jefferson Davis one of three executors . After the Montgomery men entertained the three executors in May 1870, and he suffered losses in the  |Panic_of_1873|Panic_Of_1873| , Jefferson Davis decided the black men could never fulfill the land purchase contract, and filed suit against the other trustees on June 15, 1874.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 597–98; however accompanying notes only cite letters and Everett, Brierfield Chap. 10 and various pages of Hermanns Pursuit Jefferson Davis argued his late brother had an oral agreement with Ben Montgomery that allowed Jefferson Davis to rescind the deal and that an unassigned $70,000 from the land sale represented Brierfields value . The local Chancery Court dismissed Daviss lawsuit in January 1876, citing  |estoppel|Estoppel| , because Davis had been acting as executor for four years despite this claim based on alleged actions in the 1840s. 55 Miss. Rep. 671–814 according to Collins 2005, p. 604 and 729n.74 In April 1878 , the  |Mississippi_Supreme_Court|Mississippi_Supreme_Court|  overruled the  |Warren_County|Warren_County,_Mississippi|  chancery court, deciding that Jefferson Davis properly claimed the Brierfield land by adverse possession, since he had cleared and farmed it from the 1840s until the outbreak of the Civil War . By that time, two of the Republicans on that appellate court had been replaced by Democrats, both former Confederate officers,  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 628. To actually gain possession of Brierfield, Davis needed to convince the Warren County chancery court to foreclose the mortgage, which happened on June 1, 1880, and all appeals were rejected by December 1, 1881, allowing Jefferson Davis , to gain legal title.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 629; however the accompanying n.36 at p. 733 only cites Everett Brierfield Ch. 10.     While pursuing the Brierfield litigation, Davis took another business trip to Liverpool. This time he sought employment from the Royal Insurance Company which refused him, citing Northern animosity toward the former Confederate President. Other insurers also rejected him both directly and through intermediaries. He then visited former Confederate ambassador  |John_Slidell|John_Slidell|  in Paris, but was unable to associate with a land company, either to aid the southern people or encourage emigration to the South.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 599–600 Davis returned to the United States and blamed race as the heart of what he called the night of despotism enveloping the South, citing Republicans who gave political rights to blacks that made them more idle and ungovernable than before.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 603. Davis also investigated mine properties in Arkansas and backed an ice-making machine venture, which failed.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 604–5 He was invited to Texas, but turned down the opportunity to become the first president of the  |Agriculture_and_Mechanical_College_of_Texas|History_Of_Texas_A_&_M_Universityearly_Years|  in 1876, citing the financial sacrifice . Strode 1964, pp. 402–4. The Mississippi Valley Society, based in England, sought to spur European immigration and English investment, but Davis declined to accept that presidency until salary details had been settled, though he took a speaking tour of the area to drum up public support.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 605–6.       Joseph Davis had encouraged his brother to write his memoirs just after his release from prison, but Davis had responded that he was not capable of doing so, either physically nor emotionally. His wartime assistant Preston Johnston had also encouraged Davis three years later. As Davis began to seriously consider the memoir endeavor in 1869, his early working title became Our Cause, for he believed he could convert others to the rightness of the Confederacys actions.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 614. In 1875, unable to come to terms with Preston Johnston, Davis authorized William T. Walthall, a former Confederate officer and Carolina Life agent in  |Mobile,_Alabama|Mobile,_Alabama|  to look for a publisher for the proposed book. Walthall contacted  |D._Appleton_&_Company|D._Appleton_&_Company|  in New York City, and editor Joseph C. Derby agreed to pay Walthall $250/month as an advance until the manuscripts completion, with the final product not to exceed two volumes of 800 pages each. Davis made minor changes and Appleton agreed.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 616.     In 1877,  |Sarah_Anne_Ellis_Dorsey|Sarah_Anne_Ellis_Dorsey| , a wealthy widow and writer whom he and Varina had known from childhood and who supported the  |Lost_Cause|Lost_Cause_Of_The_Confederacy| , invited Davis to stay at her estate and plantation house,  |Beauvoir|Beauvoir|  , which faced the  |Gulf_of_Mexico|Gulf_Of_Mexico|  in  |Biloxi,_Mississippi|Biloxi,_Mississippi| . Her husband, Maryland-born  |Samuel_Dorsey|Samuel_Worthington_Dorsey|  had bought Beauvoir in 1873, and died there two years later.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 611 et seq. Mrs. Dorsey wanted to provide Davis with a refuge in which he could write his memoirs per the Appleton contract. She provided him a cabin for his own use as well as helped him with his writing through organization, dictation, editing and encouragement. Davis refused to accept overt charity, but agreed to purchase the property at a modest price .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 629. In January 1878 Dorsey, knowing she too was ill , made over her will with Walthalls assistance in order to leave her remaining three small Louisiana plantations and financial assets of $50,000  to Davis and if he predeceased her, to his beloved daughter, Winnie Davis.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 676–78.  Dorsey died in 1879, by which time both the Davises and Winnie were living at Beauvoir. Her relatives came to contest that last will, which excluded them and gave everything to Davis in fee simple. They argued Davis exerted undue influence over the widow. The court dismissed their lawsuit without comment in March 1880, and they filed no appeal.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 630 and n37 p. 735 lists the case title as Stephen Percy Ellis, et al v. Jefferson Davis, Equity Case No. 8934, RG21, U.S. District Court entry 121—general case files—Eastern District of New Orleans—Circuit Court, 21, NA, Fort Worth, Texas     Upon receiving the Appleton contract, Davis had sent letters to his former associates, seeking supporting documentation. When Walthall sent two proposed chapters to New York in 1878, Appleton returned them, cautioning that it did not want a long rehash of constitutional history, but rather an account of Daviss actions as the Confederacys president. The publisher then sent  |William_J._Tenney|William_J._Tenney| , a states-rights Democrat and staff member, to visit Beauvoir to get the problematic manuscript into publishable shape. When it still failed to arrive, Derby personally traveled to Mississippi in February 1880. By this time, Derby had advanced $8,000, but Davis confessed that he had seen few pages, asserting that Walthall had the rest. Since Davis did not want to give up on the book nor return the funds , he agreed that Tenney would take up residence in a cottage at Beauvoir. On May 1, 1880, Davis severed all connections with Walthall, who had made little progress in the preceding two years.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 617–619. Davis and Tenney then completed  The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government  , in two volumes of 700 and 800 pages respectively. Strode 1964, pp. 439–41, 448–49. Cooper, Collected Writings, p. 405.    Although the first volume still mainly highlighted secession as constitutionally legitimate and contained Daviss speeches among the lengthy appendices, the books restored Daviss reputation among ex-Confederates. Davis downplayed slavery as secessions cause, instead blaming the North for prosecuting a destructive and uncivilized war.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 618–619.     The  |Southern_Historical_Society|Southern_Historical_Society|  had been formed in 1876 by Rev.  |J._William_Jones|J._William_Jones|  and Gen.  |Jubal_A._Early|Jubal_A._Early| . Jones became the Societys paid secretary and editor of the Southern Historical Review; Early became President and head of its executive committee. They made Davis a life member and helped him gather material for his book. They had tried to enlist him for a speaking tour in 1882, but Davis declined, citing his health and a yellow fever epidemic near Beauvoir, and only made one address in New Orleans on its behalf before 1882. Early also began visiting Davis when the Virginian visited New Orleans as supervisor in the Louisiana State Lottery Company.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 622 and notes on p. 732. Like Judah Benjamin, Early repeatedly advised Davis not to participate publicly in personal vendettas and old battles, despite critical books and articles by former Confederate Generals  |Pierre_Beauregard|Pierre_Beauregard|  and  |Joseph_E._Johnston|Joseph_E._Johnston| . Nonetheless, when asked to speak at dedication of the Lee mausoleum in Lexington, Virginia, Davis declined when he learned Johnston would preside, and also vented in his personal correspondence. Davis also took issue with Gen.  |William_T._Sherman|William_T._Sherman|  in an address in St. Louis in 1884 and in a lengthy letter to the editor, and also criticized young New York politician  |Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt|  for comparing him to  |Benedict_Arnold|Benedict_Arnold| .  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 623–624.     When touring the South in 1886 and 1887, Davis attended many Lost Cause ceremonies, and large crowds showered him with affection as local leaders presented emotional speeches honoring his sacrifices to the would-be nation. According to the  Meriden Daily Journal , at a reception held in New Orleans in May 1887, Davis urged southerners to be loyal to the nation-- United you are now, and if the Union is ever to be broken, let the other side break it. He continued by lauding Confederate men who successfully fought for their own rights despite inferior numbers during the Civil War, and argued that northern historians ignored this view.  Davis firmly believed that Confederate secession was constitutional, and was optimistic concerning American prosperity and the next generation.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , p. 658.     In the summer of 1888, James Redpath, editor of the  |North_American_Review|North_American_Review|  and a former political enemy who became an admirer upon meeting Davis, convinced him to write a series of articles at $250 per article, as well as a book. Collins 2005, p. 49. Davis then completed his final book  A Short History of the Confederate States of America  in October 1889.            On November 6, 1889, Davis left Beauvoir to visit his Brierfield plantation. He embarked a steamboat in New Orleans during sleety rain and fell ill during the trip, so that he initially felt too sick to disembark at his stop, and spent the night upriver in  |Vicksburg|Vicksburg,_Mississippi|  before making his way to the plantation the next day. He refused to send for a doctor for four days before embarking on his return trip. Meanwhile, servants sent Varina a telegram, and she took a train to New Orleans, and then a steamboat upriver, finally reaching the vessel on which her husband was returning. Davis finally received medical care as two doctors came aboard further south and diagnosed acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. Strode 1964, p. 505–07. Collins 2005, pp. 50–51. Upon arriving in New Orleans three days later, Davis was taken to  |Garden_District|Garden_District,_New_Orleanslandmarks|  home of  |Charles_Erasmus_Fenner|Charles_Erasmus_Fenner| , a former Confederate officer who became an Associate Justice of the  |Louisiana_Supreme_Court|Louisiana_Supreme_Court| . Fenner was the son-in-law of Daviss old friend J. M. Payne. Daviss doctor Stanford E. Chaille pronounced him too ill to travel to Beauvoir; four medical students who were sons of Confederate veterans and a Catholic nun attended Davis in the Charity Hospital ambulance which took him to the Fenner home. Davis remained bedridden but stable for the next two weeks. He took a turn for the worse in early December. According to Fenner, just when Davis again appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45  a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, holding Varinas hand and in the presence of several friends.  |Cooper_2000|Cooper| , pp. 652–54.           His funeral was one of the largest in the South, and New Orleans draped itself in mourning as his body lay in state in the City Hall for several days. An Executive Committee decided to emphasize Daviss ties to the United States, so an American national flag was placed over the Confederate flag during the viewing, and many crossed American and Confederate flags nearby. Davis wore a new suit of Confederate grey fabric  |Jubal_Early|Jubal_Early|  had given him, and Varina placed a sword Davis had carried during the  |Black_Hawk_War|Black_Hawk_War|  on the bier. A common decoration during the initial funeral was a small American flag in mourning, with a portrait of Davis in the center. The  |Grand_Army_of_the_Republic|Grand_Army_Of_The_Republic|  had a prominent role, even though the Grand Marshall was John G. Glynn, head of the Louisiana National Guard, and Georgia Governor  |John_Gordon|John_Brown_Gordon|   was honorary Grand Marshall. While the federal government officially ignored Daviss death, many church bells rang in the south, Confederate veterans held many processions, and Senators and congressmen crossed the Potomac River to join former Confederate officials and generals in eulogizing Davis in Alexandria, Virginia. Collins 2005, p. 79.     Although initially laid to rest in New Orleans in the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery, in 1893 Davis was reinterred in  |Richmond,_Virginia|Richmond,_Virginia|  at  |Hollywood_Cemetery|Hollywood_Cemetery| , per his widows request.  Before his death, Davis left the location of his burial up to Varina, but within a day of his death  The New York Times  proclaimed Richmond wanted his body. Collins 2005, p. 88. Varina Davis had refused to accept direct charity, but let it be known that she would accept financial help through the Davis Land Company. Collins 2005, p. 80. Soon, many tourists in New Orleans visited the mausoleum. Several other locations in the South wanted Daviss remains.  |Louisville,_Kentucky|Louisville,_Kentucky|  offered a site in Cave Hill cemetery, noting that two years earlier Davis had dedicated a church built on the site of his birthplace and claiming that he several times said he wanted to be buried in his native state.  |Memphis,_Tennessee|Memphis,_Tennessee| ,  |Montgomery,_Alabama|Montgomery,_Alabama| ,  |Macon|Macon,_Georgia|  and  |Atlanta,_Georgia|Atlanta,_Georgia|  and both  |Jackson|Jackson,_Mississippi|  and  |Vicksburg,_Mississippi|Vicksburg,_Mississippi|  also petitioned for Daviss remains. Collins 2005, pp. 88–90. Richmond mayor and Confederate veteran  |J._Taylor_Ellyson|J._Taylor_Ellyson|  established the Jefferson Davis Monument Association, and on July 12, 1891 Varina revealed in a letter to Confederate Veterans and people of the Southern States that her first choice would be Daviss plantation in Mississippi, but that because she feared flooding, she had decided to urge Richmond as the proper place for his tomb. Collins 2005, pp. 91–93.     After Daviss remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay in state for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly organized  |Louisiana_Historical_Association|Louisiana_Historical_Association| .  Those paying final respects included  |Louisiana_Governor|Governor_Of_Louisiana| |Murphy_J._Foster,_Sr.|Murphy_J._Foster| . A continuous cortège, day and night, then accompanied Daviss remains from New Orleans to Richmond. Collins 2005. The  |Louisville_and_Nashville_Railroad|Louisville_And_Nashville_Railroad|  car traveled past Beauvoir, then proceeded northeastward toward Richmond, with ceremonies at stops in  |Mobile|Mobile,_Alabama|  and  |Montgomery,_Alabama|Montgomery,_Alabama| ,  |Atlanta,_Georgia|Atlanta,_Georgia| , then  |Charlotte|Charlotte,_North_Carolina|  and  |Greensboro,_North_Carolina|Greensboro,_North_Carolina| . The train also detoured to  |Raleigh,_North_Carolina|Raleigh,_North_Carolina|  for Daviss coffin to lie in state in that capital city, having been driven by James J. Jones, a free black man who had served Davis during the war and become a local businessman and politician. After a stop in  |Danville,_Virginia|Danville,_Virginia| , the Confederacys last capital, and another ceremony at the  |Virginia_State_Capital|Virginia_State_Capital| , Davis was then interred at  |Hollywood_Cemetery|Hollywood_Cemetery|  in Richmond. Per the associations agreement with Varina, their childrens remains were exhumed from Washington, D.C., Memphis and another plot at the Hollywood cemetery, to rest in the new family plot. Collins 2005, pp. 100–122.     A life sized statue of Davis was eventually erected as promised by the Jefferson Davis Monument Association, in cooperation with the Southern Press Davis Monument Association, the  |United_Confederate_Veterans|United_Confederate_Veterans|  and ultimately the  |United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy|United_Daughters_Of_The_Confederacy| . The monuments cornerstone was laid in an 1896 ceremony, and it was dedicated with great pomp and 125,000 spectators on June 3, 1907, the last day of a Confederate reunion. Collins 2005, p. 131–148. It continues to mark his tomb.             Jefferson Davis served in many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, he served as a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, although he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported  |slavery|Slavery_In_The_United_States| . As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Daviss performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.     Some portions of his legacy were created not as memorials, but as contemporary recognition of his service at the time.      |Fort_Davis_National_Historic_Site|Fort_Davis_National_Historic_Site|  began as a frontier military post in October 1854, in the mountains of western Texas. It was named after then-United States Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. That fort gave its name to the surrounding  |Davis_Mountains|Davis_Mountains|  range, and the town of  |Fort_Davis|Fort_Davis,_Texas| . The surrounding area was designated  |Jeff_Davis_County|Jeff_Davis_County,_Texas|  in 1887, with the town of Fort Davis as the county seat. Other states containing a Jefferson Davis County/Parish include  |Georgia|Georgia| ,  |Louisiana|Louisiana| , and  |Mississippi|Mississippi| .      |Jefferson_Davis_Hospital|Jefferson_Davis_Hospital|  began operations in 1924 and was the first centralized municipal hospital to treat indigent patients in  |Houston|Houston| ,  |Texas|Texas| .  The building was designated as a protected historic landmark on November 13, 2013, by the Houston City Council and is monitored by the Historic Preservation Office of the City of Houston Department of Planning and Development.  The hospital was named for Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederacy, in honor of the Confederate soldiers who had been buried in the cemetery and as a means to console the families of the deceased.      Numerous  |memorials_to_Jefferson_Davis|List_Of_Memorials_To_Jefferson_Davis|  were created. The largest is the  concrete  |obelisk|Obelisk|  located at the  |Jefferson_Davis_State_Historic_Site|Jefferson_Davis_State_Historic_Site|  in  |Fairview|Fairview,_Christian_County,_Kentucky| , marking his birthplace. Construction of the monument began in 1917 and finished in 1924 at a cost of about $200,000.          In 1913, the  |United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy|United_Daughters_Of_The_Confederacy|  conceived the  |Jefferson_Davis_Memorial_Highway|Jefferson_Davis_Highway| , a transcontinental highway to be built through the South.   Portions of the highways route in Virginia, Alabama and other states still bear the name of Jefferson Davis. However, in Alexandria, Virginia, the city council voted unanimously to rename the highway and has solicited public suggestions for a new name. ,  |WTOP-FM|Wtop-Fm|      Davis appeared on several  |postage_stamps_issued_by_the_Confederacy|Postage_Stamps_And_Postal_History_Of_The_Confederate_Statesconfederate_Postage| , including its first postage stamp . In 1995, his portrait appeared on a United States postage stamp, part of a series of 20 stamps commemorating the 130th anniversary of the end of the Civil War.   Davis was also celebrated on the 6-cent Stone Mountain Memorial Carving commemorative on September 19, 1970, at Stone Mountain, Georgia. The stamp portrayed Jefferson Davis,  |Robert_E._Lee|Robert_E._Lee|  and  |Thomas_J._Stonewall_Jackson|Stonewall_Jackson|  on horseback. It depicts a replica of the actual memorial, carved into the side of  |Stone_Mountain|Stone_Mountain|  at  above ground level, the largest high-relief sculpture in the world.           The  |Jefferson_Davis_Presidential_Library|Jefferson_Davis_Presidential_Library|  was established at Beauvoir in 1998. For some years, the white-columned Biloxi mansion that was Daviss final home had served as a Confederate Veterans Home. The house and library were damaged by  |Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane_Katrina|  in 2005; the house reopened in 2008.  Bertram Hayes-Davis, Daviss great-great grandson, is the executive director of Beauvoir, which is owned by the Mississippi Division of the  |Sons_of_Confederate_Veterans|Sons_Of_Confederate_Veterans| .      Based at  |Rice_University|Rice_University|  in  |Houston|Houston| , Texas, The Papers of Jefferson Davis is an editing project to publish documents related to Davis. Since the early 1960s, it has published 13 volumes, the first in 1971 and the most recent in 2012; two more volumes are planned. The project has roughly 100,000 documents in its archives.         The birthday of Jefferson Davis is commemorated in several states. His actual birthday, June 3, is celebrated in Florida,  Kentucky,  Louisiana  and  |Tennessee|Tennessee| ;  in Alabama, it is celebrated on the first Monday in June.  In Mississippi, the last Monday of May  is celebrated as National Memorial Day and Jefferson Daviss Birthday .  In Texas,  |Confederate_Heroes_Day|Confederate_Heroes_Day|  is celebrated on January 19, the birthday of Robert E. Lee; Jefferson Daviss birthday had been officially celebrated on June 3 but was combined with Lees birthday in 1973.      Robert E. Lees  |United_States_citizenship|United_States_Citizenship|  was posthumously restored in 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Daviss citizenship as well. This was accomplished with the passing of Senate  |Joint_Resolution|Joint_Resolution|  16 on October 17, 1978. In signing the law, President  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  referred to this as the last act of reconciliation in the Civil War.        In films and on television, Jefferson Davis has been portrayed by,    |Erville_Alderson|Erville_Alderson|  in    Hearts in Bondage     Santa Fe Trail     |Charles_Middleton|Charles_Middleton|  in  Virginia City     |Morris_Ankrum|Morris_Ankrum|  in  Tennessee Johnson     |Lloyd_Bridges|Lloyd_Bridges|  in  North and South    Brian Paulette in  C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America     |John_Rothman|John_Rothman|  in  Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter .
