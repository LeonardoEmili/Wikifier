   The history of Luxembourg consists of the history of the country of  |Luxembourg|Luxembourg|  and its geographical area.     Although its  |recorded_history|Recorded_History|  can be traced back to  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|  times, the history of Luxembourg proper is considered to begin in 963. Over the following five centuries, the powerful  |House_of_Luxembourg|House_Of_Luxembourg|  emerged, but its extinction put an end to the countrys independence. After a brief period of  |Burgundian|Duchy_Of_Burgundy|  rule, the country passed to the  |Habsburgs|Habsburg|  in 1477.     After the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War| , Luxembourg became a part of the  |Southern_Netherlands|Southern_Netherlands| , which passed to the Austrian line of the Habsburg dynasty in 1713. After occupation by  |Revolutionary_France|Revolutionary_France| , the 1815  |Treaty_of_Paris|Treaty_Of_Paris,_1815|  transformed Luxembourg into a  |Grand_Duchy|Grand_Duchy|  in  |personal_union|Personal_Union|  with the  |Netherlands|United_Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands| . The treaty also resulted in the second  |partitioning_of_Luxembourg|Partitions_Of_Luxembourg| , the first being in 1658 and a third in 1839. Although these treaties greatly reduced Luxembourgs territory, the latter established its formal independence, which was confirmed after the  |Luxembourg_Crisis|Luxembourg_Crisis|  of 1867.     In the following decades, Luxembourg fell further into Germanys  |sphere_of_influence|Sphere_Of_Influence| , particularly after the creation of a separate ruling house in 1890. It was occupied by Germany  |from_1914_until_1918|German_Occupation_Of_Luxembourg_In_World_War_I|  and again  |from_1940_until_1944|German_Occupation_Of_Luxembourg_In_World_War_Ii| . Since the end of the  |Second_World_War|World_War_Ii| , Luxembourg has become one of the worlds richest countries, buoyed by a booming  |financial_services|Financial_Services|  sector, political stability, and  |European_integration|European_Integration| .             In the territory now covered by the  |Grand_Duchy_of_Luxembourg|Grand_Duchy_Of_Luxembourg| , there is evidence of primitive inhabitants dating back to the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age over 35,000 years ago. The oldest artefacts from this period are decorated bones found at  |Oetrange|Oetrange| .     However, the first real evidence of civilisation is from the Neolithic or 5th millennium BC, from which evidence of houses has been found. Traces have been found in the south of Luxembourg at  |Grevenmacher|Grevenmacher| ,  |Diekirch|Diekirch| ,  |Aspelt|Aspelt|  and  |Weiler-la-Tour|Weiler-La-Tour| . The dwellings were made of a combination of tree trunks for the basic structure, mud-clad wickerwork walls, and roofs of thatched reeds or straw. Pottery from this period has been found near  |Remerschen|Remerschen| .     While there is not much evidence of communities in Luxembourg at the beginning of the Bronze Age, a number of sites dating back to the period between the 13th and the 8th century BC provide evidence of dwellings and reveal artefacts such as pottery, knives and jewellery. The sites include  |Nospelt|Nospelt| ,  |Dalheim|Dalheim| ,  |Mompach|Mompach|  and Remerschen.     What is present-day Luxembourg, was inhabited by  |Celts|Celts|  during the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  .   The  |Gaulish|Gauls|  tribe in what is present-day Luxembourg during and after the  |La_Tène_period|La_Tène_Period|  was known as the  |Treveri|Treveri| ; they reached the height of prosperity in the 1st century BC. The Treveri constructed a number of  |oppida|Oppida| ,  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  fortified settlements, near the  |Moselle_valley|Moselle_Valley|  in what is now southern Luxembourg, western Germany and eastern France. Most of the archaeological evidence from this period has been discovered in tombs, many closely associated with  |Titelberg|Titelberg| , a 50 ha site which reveals much about the dwellings and handicrafts of the period.     The  |Romans|Rome| , under  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| , completed their conquest and occupation in 53 BC. The first known reference to the territory of present-day Luxembourg was by Julius Caesar in his  Commentaries on the Gallic War .  The Treveri were more co-operative with the Romans than most  |Gallic_tribes|Tribes_Of_Gaul| , and adapted readily to Roman civilization. Two revolts in the 1st century AD did not permanently damage their cordial relations with Rome.   The land of the Treveri was at first part of  |Gallia_Celtica|Gallia_Celtica| , but with the reform of  |Domitian|Domitian|  in c. 90, was reassigned to  |Gallia_Belgica|Gallia_Belgica| .     Gallia Belgica was infiltrated by the Germanic  |Franks|Franks|  from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406.   The territory of what would become Luxembourg by the 480s, became part of  |Merovingia|Merovingian| |Austrasia|Austrasia|  and eventually part of the core territory of the  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire| .   With the  |Treaty_of_Verdun|Treaty_Of_Verdun|  , it fell to  |Middle_Francia|Middle_Francia| , and in 855, to  |Lotharingia|Lotharingia| . With the latters division in 959, it then fell to the  |Duchy_of_Upper_Lorraine|Duchy_Of_Upper_Lorraine|  within the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .            The history of Luxembourg properly began with the construction of Luxembourg Castle in the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages| . It was Siegfried I, count of  |Ardennes|Ardennes|  who traded some of his ancestral lands with the monks of the  |Abbey_of_St._Maximin|Abbey_Of_St._Maximin|  in  |Trier|Trier|  in 963 for an ancient, supposedly Roman, fort named Lucilinburhuc.  Modern historians link the etymology of the word with Letze,  meaning fortification, which may have referred to either the remains of a Roman watchtower or to a primitive refuge of the early Middle Ages.            From the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages|  to the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , Luxembourg bore multiple names, depending on the author. These include Lucilinburhuc, Lutzburg, Lützelburg, Luccelemburc, and Lichtburg, among others. The  |Luxembourgish_dynasty|House_Of_Luxembourg|  produced several  |Holy_Roman_Emperors|Holy_Roman_Emperor| , Kings of  |Bohemia|Bohemia| , and  |Archbishops|Archbishop|  of  |Trier|Trier|  and  |Mainz|Mainz| .     Around the fort of Luxembourg, a town gradually developed, which became the centre of a small but important state of great strategic value to France, Germany and the Netherlands. Luxembourgs fortress, located on a rocky outcrop known as the  |Bock|Bock| , was steadily enlarged and strengthened over the years by successive owners. Some of these included the  |Bourbons|Bourbons| ,  |Habsburgs|Habsburg|  and  |Hohenzollerns|Hohenzollern| , who made it one of the strongest fortresses on the European continent, the  |Fortress_of_Luxembourg|Fortress_Of_Luxembourg| . Its formidable defences and strategic location caused it to become known as the ‘ |Gibraltar|Gibraltar|  of the North’.          In the 17th and 18th centuries, the electors of Brandenburg, later kings of Prussia , advanced their claim to the Luxembourg patrimony as heirs-general to William of Thuringia and his wife Anna of Bohemia, the disputed dukes of Luxembourg in the 1460s. Anna was the eldest daughter of the last Luxembourg heiress. From 1609 onward, they had a territorial base in the vicinity, the  |Duchy_of_Cleves|Duchy_Of_Cleves| , the starting-point of the future  |Prussian_Rhineland|Prussian_Rhineland| . This Brandenburger claim ultimately produced some results when some districts of Luxembourg were united with Prussia in 1813.     The first Hohenzollern claimant to descend from both Anna and her younger sister Elisabeth, was  |John_George,_Elector_of_Brandenburg|John_George,_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  , his maternal grandmother having been  |Barbara_Jagiellon|Barbara_Jagiellon| . In the late 18th century, the younger line of  |Orange-Nassau|House_Of_Orange-Nassau|  also became related to the Brandenburgers.     In 1598, the then possessor,  |Philip_II_of_Spain|Philip_Ii_Of_Spain| , bequeathed Luxembourg and the other Low Countries to his daughter, the Infanta  |Isabella_Clara_Eugenia|Isabella_Clara_Eugenia|  and her husband  |Albert_VII,_Archduke_of_Austria|Albert_Vii,_Archduke_Of_Austria| . Albert was an heir and descendant of  |Elisabeth_of_Austria|Elisabeth_Of_Austria| , queen of Poland, the youngest granddaughter of  |Sigismund_of_Luxembourg|Sigismund_Of_Luxembourg| , the Holy Roman Emperor. Thus, Luxembourg returned to the heirs of the old Luxembourg dynasty of the line of Elisabeth. The Low Countries were a separate political entity during the couples reign. After Alberts childless death in 1621, Luxembourg passed to his great-nephew and heir  |Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip_Iv_Of_Spain| .           |Luxembourg_was_invaded|Siege_Of_Luxembourg|  by  |Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis_Xiv_Of_France|  in 1684, an action that caused alarm among Frances neighbors and resulted in the formation of the  |League_of_Augsburg|League_Of_Augsburg|  in 1686. In the ensuing  |War_of_the_Grand_Alliance|War_Of_The_Grand_Alliance| , France was forced to give up the duchy, which was returned to the Habsburgs by the  |Treaty_of_Ryswick|Treaty_Of_Ryswick|  in 1697.     During this period of French rule, the defences of the fortress were strengthened by the famous  |siege|Siege|  engineer  |Vauban|Vauban| . The French kings great-grandson Louis was, from 1712, the first heir-general of Albert VII. Albert VII was a descendant of Anna of Bohemia and William of Thuringia, having that blood through his mothers Danish great-great-grandmother, but was not the heir-general of that line. Louis was the first real claimant of Luxembourg to descend from both sisters, the daughters of  |Elisabeth_of_Bohemia|Elisabeth_Of_Bohemia| , the last Luxembourg empress.     Habsburg rule was confirmed in 1715 by the  |Treaty_of_Utrecht|Treaty_Of_Utrecht| , and Luxembourg was integrated into the  |Southern_Netherlands|Southern_Netherlands| . Emperor Joseph and his successor Emperor Charles VI were descendants of Spanish kings who were heirs of Albert VII. Joseph and Charles VI were also descendants of Anna of Bohemia and William of Thuringia, having that blood through their mother, although they were heirs-general of neither line. Charles was the first ruler of Luxembourg to descend from both sisters, daughters of Elisabeth of Bohemia.     Austrian rulers were ready to exchange Luxembourg and other territories in the Low Countries. Their purpose was to round out and enlarge their power base, which in geographical terms was centred around  |Vienna|Vienna| . Thus, Bavarian candidate emerged to take over the Duchy of Luxembourg, but this plan led to nothing permanent. Emperor  |Joseph_II|Joseph_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  however, made a preliminary pact to make a neighbour of Luxembourg,  |Charles_Theodore,_Elector_Palatine|Charles_Theodore,_Elector_Palatine| , as Duke of Luxembourg and king in the Low Countries, in exchange for his possessions in Bavaria and Franconia. However, this scheme was aborted by  |Prussias|Prussia|  opposition. Charles Theodore, who would have become Duke of Luxembourg, was genealogically a junior descendant of both Anna and Elisabeth, but the main heir of neither.     During the  |War_of_the_First_Coalition|War_Of_The_First_Coalition| , Luxembourg was conquered and annexed by  |Revolutionary_France|Revolutionary_France| , becoming part of the  département  of the  |Forêts|Forêts|  Literally woods, in reference to the  |Ardennes|Ardennes| . in 1795. The annexation was formalised at  |Campo_Formio|Treaty_Of_Campo_Formio|  in 1797. In 1798, Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion against the French but it was rapidly suppressed. This brief rebellion is called the  |Peasants_War|Peasants_War| .             Luxembourg remained more or less under French rule until the  |defeat|Treaty_Of_Paris|  of  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  in 1815. When the French departed, the Allies installed a provisional administration. Luxembourg initially came under the Generalgouvernement Mittelrhein in mid-1814, and then from June 1814 under the Generalgouvernement Nieder- und Mittelrhein .     The  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  of 1815, gave formal autonomy to Luxembourg. In 1813, the Prussians had already managed to wrest lands from Luxembourg, to strengthen the Prussian-possessed  |Duchy_of_Julich|Duchy_Of_Julich| . The Bourbons of France held a strong claim to Luxembourg, whereas the Emperor of Austria, on the other hand, had controlled the duchy until the revolutionary forces had joined it to the French republic .     Prussia and the Netherlands, both claiming Luxembourg, made an exchange deal: Prussia received the  |Principality_of_Orange-Nassau|Principality_Of_Orange-Nassau| , the ancestral Principality of the Prince of Orange in Central Germany and the Prince of Orange, in turn received Luxembourg.     Luxembourg, somewhat diminished in size , was augmented in another way through the elevation to the status of  |grand_duchy|Grand_Duchy|  and placed under the rule of William I of the Netherlands. This was the first time that the duchy had a monarch who had no claim to the inheritance of the medieval patrimony. However, Luxembourgs military value to  |Prussia|Prussia|  prevented it from becoming a full part of the Dutch kingdom. The fortress, ancestral seat of the medieval Luxembourgers, was garrisoned by Prussian forces, following Napoleons defeat, and Luxembourg became a member of the  |German_Confederation|German_Confederation|  with Prussia responsible for its defence, and a state under the suzerainty of the Netherlands at the same time.        In July 1819, a contemporary from Britain visited Luxembourg — his journal offers some insights.  |Norwich_Duff|Norwich_Duff| , writes of  |its_city|Luxembourg|  that Luxembourg is considered one of the strongest fortifications in Europe, and … it appears so. It is situated in  |Holland|Netherlands|  but by treaty is  |garrisoned|Fortified_Town|  by Prussians and 5,000 of their troops occupy it under a  |Prince_of_Hesse|William_I,_Elector_Of_Hesse| . The civil government is under the Dutch and the  |duties|Taxes|  collected by them. The town is not very large but the streets are broader than the French towns and clean and the houses are good.... got the cheapest of  |hot_baths|Public_Bathing|  here at the principal house I ever had in my life: one franc.     In 1820, Luxembourg made use of the  |metric_system|Metric_System|  of measurement compulsory.   Previously, the country had using local units such as the malter .     Much of the Luxembourgish population joined the  |Belgian_revolution|Belgian_Revolution|  against  |Dutch|United_Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands|  rule. Except for the fortress and its immediate vicinity, Luxembourg was considered a province of the new Belgian state from 1830 to 1839. By the  |Treaty_of_London|Treaty_Of_London,_1839|  in 1839, the status of the grand duchy became fully sovereign and in personal union to the king of the Netherlands. In turn, the predominantly  |Oil|Langues_Doïl| -speaking geographically larger western part of the duchy was ceded to Belgium as the  |province_de_Luxembourg|Luxembourg| .     This loss left the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg a predominantly German state, although French cultural influence remained strong. The loss of Belgian markets also caused painful economic problems for the state. Recognising this, the grand duke integrated it into the German  Zollverein  in 1842. Nevertheless, Luxembourg remained an underdeveloped agrarian country for most of the century. As a result of this, about one in five of the inhabitants  |emigrated|Luxembourg_American|  to the United States between 1841 and 1891.            In 1867, Luxembourgs independence was confirmed, after a turbulent period which even included a brief time of civil unrest against plans to annex Luxembourg to Belgium, Germany, or France. The  |crisis|Luxembourg_Crisis|  of 1867 almost resulted in war between France and Prussia over the status of Luxembourg, which had become free of German control when the German Confederation was abolished at the end of the  |Seven_Weeks_War|Seven_Weeks_War|  in 1866.     William III, king of the Netherlands, and sovereign of Luxembourg, was willing to sell the grand duchy to Frances Emperor  |Napoleon_III|Napoleon_Iii|  in order to retain  |Limbourg|Limbourg|  but backed out when Prussian chancellor,  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck| , expressed opposition. The growing tension brought about a conference in London from March to May 1867 in which the British served as mediators between the two rivals. Bismarck manipulated public opinion, resulting in the denial of sale to France. The issue was resolved by the second  |Treaty_of_London|Treaty_Of_London,_1867|  which guaranteed the perpetual independence and  |neutrality|Neutral_Country|  of the state. The fortress walls were pulled down and the Prussian garrison was withdrawn.

Famous visitors to Luxembourg in the 18th and 19th centuries included the German poet  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| , the French writers  |Émile_Zola|Émile_Zola|  and  |Victor_Hugo|Victor_Hugo| , the composer  |Franz_Liszt|Franz_Liszt| , and the English painter  |Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner|Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner| .       Luxembourg remained a possession of the kings of the Netherlands until the death of  |William_III|William_Iii_Of_The_Netherlands|  in 1890, when the grand duchy passed to the  |House_of_Nassau-Weilburg|House_Of_Nassau-Weilburg|  due to the 1783  |Nassau_Family_Pact|Nassau_Family_Pact| , under which those territories of the Nassau family in the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  at the time of the pact  were bound by semi- |Salic_law|Salic_Law| , which allowed  |inheritance|Inheritance|  by females or through the female line only upon extinction of male members of the  |dynasty|Dynasty| . When  |William_III|William_Iii_Of_The_Netherlands|  died leaving only his daughter  |Wilhelmina|Wilhelmina_Of_The_Netherlands|  as an heir, the crown of the Netherlands, not being bound by the family pact, passed to Wilhelmina. However, the crown of Luxembourg passed to a male of another branch of the House of Nassau:  |Adolphe|Adolphe,_Grand_Duke_Of_Luxembourg| , the dispossessed  |Duke_of_Nassau|House_Of_Nassau|  and head of the  |branch_of_Nassau-Weilburg|House_Of_Nassau-Weilburg| .          World War I affected Luxembourg at a time when the nation-building process was far from complete. The small grand duchy opted for an ambiguous policy between 1914 and 1918. With the country occupied by German troops, the government, led by Paul Eyschen, chose to remain neutral. This strategy had been elaborated with the approval of  |Marie-Adélaïde,_Grand_Duchess_of_Luxembourg|Marie-Adélaïde,_Grand_Duchess_Of_Luxembourg| . Although continuity prevailed on the political level, the war caused social upheaval, which laid the foundation for the first  |trades_union|Trades_Union|  in Luxembourg.       The end of the occupation in November 1918, squared with a time of uncertainty on the international and national levels. The victorious Allies disapproved of the choices made by the local élites, and some Belgian politicians even demanded the integration of the country into a greater Belgium. Within Luxembourg, a strong minority asked for the creation of a republic. In the end, the grand duchy remained a monarchy but was led by a new head of state,  |Charlotte|Charlotte,_Grand_Duchess_Of_Luxembourg| . In 1921, it entered into an economic and monetary union with Belgium, the Union Économique Belgo-Luxembourgeoise . During most of the 20th century, however, Germany remained its most important economic partner.     The introduction of  |universal_suffrage|Universal_Suffrage|  for men and women favored the Rechtspartei which played the dominant role in the government throughout the 20th century, with the exception of 1925–26 and 1974–79, when the two other important parties, the  |Liberal|Liberal_League|  and the  |Social-Democratic|Social_Democratic_Party|  parties, formed a coalition. The success of the resulting party was due partly to the support of the church — the population was more than 90 percent Catholic — and of its newspaper, the Luxemburger Wort.     On the international level, the interwar period was characterised by an attempt to put Luxembourg on the map. Especially under Joseph Bech, head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the country participated more actively in several international organisations, in order to ensure its autonomy. On December 16, 1920, Luxembourg became a member of the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations| . On the economic level in the 1920s and the 1930s, the agricultural sector declined in favour of industry, but even more so for the service sector. The proportion of the active population in this last sector rose from 18 percent in 1907 to 31 percent in 1935.     In the 1930s, the internal situation deteriorated, as Luxembourgish politics were influenced by European left- and right-wing politics. The government tried to counter  |communist|Communist| -led unrest in the industrial areas and continued friendly policies towards  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| , which led to much criticism. The attempts to quell unrest peaked with the  Maulkuerfgesetz , the muzzle Law, which was an attempt to outlaw the  |Communist_Party|Communist_Party_Of_Luxembourg| . The law was turned down in a 1937 referendum.          Upon the outbreak of the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  in September 1939, the government of Luxembourg observed its neutrality and issued an official proclamation to that effect on September 6, 1939. Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Luxembourg and the German Invasion: Before and After p. 32 On May 10, 1940, an invasion by German armed forces swept away the Luxembourgish government and monarchy into exile. The German troops made up of the  |1st|1St_Panzer_Division| ,  |2nd|2Nd_Panzer_Division| , and  |10th_Panzer_Divisions|10Th_Panzer_Division|  invaded at 04:35. They did not encounter any significant resistance save for some bridges destroyed and some land mines since the majority of the Luxembourgish Volunteer Corps stayed in their barracks. Luxembourgish police resisted the German troops, but to little avail and the capital city was occupied before noon. Total Luxembourgish casualties amounted to 75 police and soldiers captured, six police wounded, and one soldier wounded.  |Horne,_Alistair|Alistair_Horne| , To Lose a Battle, p.258-264     The Luxembourg royal family and their entourage received visas from  |Aristides_de_Sousa_Mendes|Aristides_De_Sousa_Mendes|  in Bordeaux. They crossed into Portugal and subsequently travelled to the United States in two groups: on the  from Lisbon to Baltimore in July 1940, and on the Pan American airliner Yankee Clipper in October 1940. Throughout the war,  |Grand_Duchess_Charlotte|Grand_Duchess_Charlotte|  broadcast via the  |BBC|Bbc|  to Luxembourg to give hope to the people.     Luxembourg remained  |under_German_military_occupation|German_Occupation_Of_Luxembourg_In_World_War_Ii|  until August 1942, when the  |Third_Reich|Third_Reich|  formally annexed it as part of the  Gau  Moselland. The German authorities declared Luxembourgers to be German citizens and called up 13,000 for military service. 2,848 Luxembourgers eventually died fighting in the German army.     Luxembourgish opposition to this annexation took the form of passive resistance at first, as in the  Spéngelskrich  , and in refusal to speak German. As French was forbidden, many Luxembourgers resorted to resuscitating old Luxembourgish words, which led to a renaissance of the language. The Germans met opposition with  |deportation|Deportation| ,  |forced_labour|Forced_Labour| ,  |forced_conscription|Forced_Conscription|  and, more drastically, with  |internment|Internment| , deportation to  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps|  and execution.     Executions took place after the so-called  |general_strike|Luxembourgian_General_Strike_Of_1942|  from September 1 to September 3, 1942, which paralysed the administration, agriculture, industry and education in response to the declaration of  |forced_conscription|Forced_Conscription|  by the German administration on August 30, 1942. The Germans suppressed the strike violently. They executed 21 strikers and deported hundreds more to  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps| . The then civilian administrator of Luxembourg,  |Gauleiter|Gauleiter| |Gustav_Simon|Gustav_Simon| , had declared conscription necessary to support the German war effort. The general strike in Luxembourg remained one of the few mass strikes against the German war machine in Western Europe.     U.S. forces liberated most of the country in September 1944. They entered the capital city on September 10, 1944. During the  |Ardennes_Offensive|Ardennes_Offensive|   German troops took back most of northern Luxembourg for a few weeks. Allied forces finally expelled the Germans in January 1945.     Between December 1944 and February 1945, the recently liberated city of  |Luxembourg|Luxembourg|  was designated by the  |OB_West|Ob_West|  as the target for  |V-3|V-3_Cannonluxembourg_Bombardment| |siege_guns|Siege_Gun| , which were originally intended to bombard  |London|London| . Two V-3 guns based at  |Lampaden|Lampaden|  fired a total of 183 rounds at Luxembourg. However, the V-3 was not very accurate. 142 rounds landed in Luxembourg, with 44 confirmed hits in the urban area, and the total casualties were 10 dead and 35 wounded. The bombardments ended with the American Army nearing Lampaden on February 22, 1945.     Altogether, of a pre-war population of 293,000, 5,259 Luxembourgers lost their lives during the hostilities.       After  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Luxembourg abandoned its politics of  |neutrality|Neutral_Country| , when it became a founding member of the  |North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|Nato|  and the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| . It is a signatory of the  |Treaty_of_Rome|Treaty_Of_Rome| , and constituted a monetary union with Belgium , and an economic union with Belgium and the Netherlands, the so-called  |BeNeLux|Benelux| .     Between 1945 and 2005, the economic structure of Luxembourg changed significantly. The crisis of the metallurgy sector, which began in the mid-1970s and lasted till the late 1980s, nearly pushed the country into economic recession, given the monolithic dominance of that sector. The Tripartite Coordination Committee, consisting of members of the government, management representatives, and trade union leaders, succeeded in preventing major social unrest during those years, thus creating the myth of a “Luxembourg model” characterised by social peace. Although in the early years of the 21st century Luxembourg enjoyed one of the highest GNP per capita in the world, this was mainly due to the strength of its financial sector, which gained importance at the end of the 1960s. Thirty-five years later, one-third of the tax proceeds originated from that sector. The harmonisation of the tax system across Europe could, however, seriously undermine the financial situation of the grand duchy.     Luxembourg has been one of the strongest advocates of the  |European_Union|European_Union|  in the tradition of  |Robert_Schuman|Robert_Schuman| . It was one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 and of the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community|  in 1957; in 1999 it joined the  |euro|Euro|  currency area.     Encouraged by the contacts established with the Dutch and Belgian governments in exile, Luxembourg pursued a policy of presence in international organisations. In the context of the Cold War, Luxembourg clearly opted for the West having joined NATO in 1949. Engagement in European reconstruction was rarely questioned subsequently, either by politicians or by the greater population.     Despite its small proportions, Luxembourg often played an intermediary role between larger countries. This role of mediator, especially between the two large and often bellicose nations of Germany and France, was considered one of the main characteristics of its national identity, allowing the Luxembourgers not to have to choose between one of these two neighbours. The country also hosted a large number of European institutions such as the  |European_Court_of_Justice|European_Court_Of_Justice| .     Luxembourg’s small size no longer seemed to be a challenge to the existence of the country, and the creation of the  |Banque_Centrale_du_Luxembourg|Banque_Centrale_Du_Luxembourg|  and of the  |University_of_Luxembourg|University_Of_Luxembourg|  was evidence of the continuing desire to become a “real” nation. The decision in 1985 to declare  |Lëtzebuergesch|Luxembourgish_Language|  the national language was also a step in the affirmation of the country’s independence.
