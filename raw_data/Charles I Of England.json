Only Parliament, however, could legally raise taxes, and without it Charless capacity to acquire funds for his treasury was limited to his customary rights and prerogatives.             A large fiscal deficit had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckinghams short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, there was little financial capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign Charles was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister, Elizabeth, and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the Distraint of Knighthood , in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the kings coronation to be knighted. Relying on this old statute, Charles fined individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626. ; .      The chief tax imposed by Charles was a feudal levy known as ": null
