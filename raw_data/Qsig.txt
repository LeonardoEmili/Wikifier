QSIG is an  |ISDN|Integrated_Services_Digital_Network|  based  |signaling_protocol|Signaling_Protocol|  for signaling between  |private_branch_exchanges|Private_Branch_Exchange|  in a  |private_integrated_services_network|Telephone_Exchange|  . It makes use of the connection-level  |Q_931|Q_931|  protocol and the application-level  |ROSE|Remote_Operations_Service_Element_Protocol|  protocol. ISDN proper functions as the physical link layer.     QSIG was originally developed by  |Ecma_International|Ecma_International| , adopted by  |ETSI|Etsi|  and is defined by a set of  |ISO|International_Organization_For_Standardization|  standard documents, so is not owned by any company. This allows interoperability between communications platforms provided by disparate vendors.     QSIG has two layers, called BC and GF . QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and government networks, such as  |line_identification|Line_Identification| ,  |call_intrusion|Call_Intrusion|  and  |call_forwarding|Call_Forwarding| . Thus for a large or very distributed company that requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.     QSIG will likely never rival each vendors private network protocols, but it does provide an option for a higher level of integration than that of the traditional choices.
