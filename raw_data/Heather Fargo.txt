In the September primary, she came in second place to businesswoman Kate Karpilow but beat future City Councilman Ray Tretheway who came in third place and incumbent David Shore who came in fourth place. However, Fargo came back to beat Karpilow in November.     Upon Grantland Johnsons resignation from the County Board of Supervisors in 1994, Fargo decided to run for the Board.

Thousand Oaks: Sage, 2007, p. 881. 9780761928843          Fargo did not face as stiff competition in her 2004 re-election. Her main opponent was Ross W. Relles, Jr., a businessman. Other candidates were Deputy Attorney General Mark Soble and Lorenzo Patino Law School President Leonard Padilla. Virtually unopposed against candidates far less funded, Fargo won solidly in the primary election, thus no runoff was necessary.          The primary election for Mayor took place on 3 June 2008. Fargo received 39% of the vote, while former  |NBA|Nba|  star and Sacramento native  |Kevin_Johnson|Kevin_Johnson|  received 46% of the vote.  Since neither received a majority of the votes, a run off election was scheduled for November 2008, where she was defeated by a margin of 58% to 42%.     During the primary election campaign, Fargo initially claimed that she had the support of all the city councilmembers. Yet, Councilman Robbie Waters, Steve Cohn, and Sandra Sheedy all ended up endorsing Johnson during the primary.  On September 4, 2008 only Councilman Kevin McCarty endorsed Heather Fargo.

Because Fargo received a majority of the votes in the primary election, no general election was necessary.          Johnson and Fargo proceeded to a runoff election on November 5.
