     Fornax  is a  |constellation|Constellation|  in the southern sky, partly ringed by the celestial river  |Eridanus|Eridanus| . Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for  |furnace|Furnace| . It was named by French astronomer  |Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille|Nicolas_Louis_De_Lacaille|  in 1756. Fornax is one of the 88 modern constellations.     The three brightest stars— |Alpha|Alpha_Fornacis| ,  |Beta|Beta_Fornacis|  and  |Nu_Fornacis|Nu_Fornacis| —form a flattened triangle facing south. With an apparent magnitude of 3.91, Alpha Fornacis is the brightest star in Fornax. Six star systems have been found to have exoplanets. The  |Fornax_Dwarf|Fornax_Dwarf|  galaxy is a small faint satellite galaxy of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| .  |NGC_1316|Ngc_1316|  is a relatively close  |radio_galaxy|Radio_Galaxy| .            The French astronomer  |Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille|Nicolas_Louis_De_Lacaille|  first described the  |constellation|Constellation|  in French as le Fourneau Chymique with an  |alembic|Alembic|  and receiver in his early catalogue, before abbreviating it to le Fourneau on his planisphere in 1752,   after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the  |Cape_of_Good_Hope|Cape_Of_Good_Hope| . He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the  |Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere|Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere|  not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the  |Age_of_Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment| . Lacaille Latinised the name to Fornax Chimiae on his 1763 chart.        The constellation Eridanus borders Fornax to the east, north and south, while Cetus, Sculptor and Phoenix gird it to the north, west and south respectively. Covering 397.5  square degrees and 0.964% of the night sky, it ranks 41st of the 88 constellations in size,  The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is For.  The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 8 segments . In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between −23.76° and −39.58°.  The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude  |50°N|50Th_Parallel_North| .                 Lacaille gave  |Bayer_designations|Bayer_Designation|  to 27 stars now named Alpha to Omega Fornacis, labelling two stars 3.5 degrees apart as Gamma, three stars Eta, two stars Iota, two Lambda and three Chi. Phi Fornacis was added by Gould, and Theta and Omicron were dropped by Gould and Baily respectively. Upsilon, too, was later found to be two stars and designated as such. Overall, there are 59 stars within the constellations borders brighter than or equal to  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  6.5. However, there are no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude.      The three brightest stars form a flattish triangle, with  |Alpha|Alpha_Fornacis|   and  |Nu_Fornacis|Nu_Fornacis|  marking its eastern and western points and  |Beta_Fornacis|Beta_Fornacis|  marking the shallow southern apex.  Originally designated 12 Eridani by John Flamsteed, Alpha Fornacis was named by Lacaille as the brightest star in the new constellation. It is a binary star that can be resolved by small amateur telescopes. With an apparent magnitude of 3.91, the primary is a yellow-white subgiant 1.21 times as massive as the Sun that has begun to cool and expand after exhausting its core hydrogen, having swollen to 1.9 times the Suns radius. Of magnitude 6.5, the secondary star is 0.78 times as massive as the Sun. It has been identified as a  |blue_straggler|Blue_Straggler| , and has either accumulated material from, or merged with, a third star in the past. It is a strong source of X-rays.  The pair is 46.4 ± 0.3 light-years distant from Earth.       |Beta_Fornacis|Beta_Fornacis|  is a yellow-hued  |giant_star|Giant_Star|  of spectral type G8IIIb of magnitude 4.5 that has cooled and swelled to 11 times the Suns diameter,  178 ± 2 light-years from Earth.  It is a  |red_clump|Red_Clump|  giant, which means it has undergone  |helium_flash|Helium_Flash|  and is currently generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core.       |Nu_Fornacis|Nu_Fornacis|  is 370 ± 10 light-years distant from Earth. It is a blue giant star of spectral type B9.5IIIspSi that is 3.65 ± 0.18 times as massive and around 245 times as luminous as the Sun, with 3.2 ± 0.4 times its diameter.  It varies in luminosity over a period of 1.89 days—the same as its rotational period. This is because of differences in abundances of metals in its atmosphere; it belongs to a class of star known as an  |Alpha_2_Canum_Venaticorum_variable|Alpha2_Canum_Venaticorum_Variable| .       Shining with an apparent magnitude of 5.89,  |Epsilon_Fornacis|Epsilon_Fornacis|  is a binary star system located 104.4 ± 0.3 light-years distant from Earth.  Its component stars orbit each other every 37 years.

Fornax Cluster     The Fornax Cluster is a  |cluster_of_galaxies|Galaxy_Cluster|  lying at a distance of 19 mega |parsecs|Parsec|  .  It is the second richest galaxy cluster within 100 million light-years, after the considerably larger  |Virgo_Cluster|Virgo_Cluster| , and may be associated with the nearby  |Eridanus_Group|Eridanus_Group| . It lies primarily in the constellation Fornax, with its southern boundaries partially crossing into the constellation of Eridanus, and covers an area of sky about 6° across or about 28 sq degrees. The Fornax cluster is a part of larger  |Fornax_Wall|Fornax_Wall| .  Down are some famous objects in this cluster:      |NGC_1365|Ngc_1365|  is another  |barred_spiral_galaxy|Barred_Spiral_Galaxy|  located at a distance of 56 million light-years from Earth.

One of the closer  |active_galaxies|Active_Galaxy|  to Earth at a distance of 62 million light-years, Fornax A appears in the  |optical_spectrum|Optical_Spectrum|  as a large  |elliptical_galaxy|Elliptical_Galaxy|  with  |dust_lanes|Dust_Lane|  near its core. These dust lanes have caused astronomers to discern that it recently  |merged|Galaxy_Merger|  with a small  |spiral_galaxy|Spiral_Galaxy| . Because it has a high rate of  |type_Ia_supernovae|Type_Ia_Supernova| , NGC 1316 has been used to determine the size of the universe. The  |jets|Astrophysical_Jet|  producing the radio lobes are not particularly powerful, giving the lobes a more diffuse, knotted structure due to interactions with the  |intergalactic_medium|Intergalactic_Medium| .  Associated with this  |peculiar_galaxy|Peculiar_Galaxy|  is an entire cluster of galaxies.      |NGC_1399|Ngc_1399|  is a large  |elliptical_galaxy|Elliptical_Galaxy|  in the Southern  |constellation|Constellation| |Fornax|Fornax| , the central galaxy in the  |Fornax_cluster|Fornax_Cluster| .
