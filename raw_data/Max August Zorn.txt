        Max August Zorn  was a  |German|Germany| |mathematician|Mathematician| . He was an  |algebraist|Abstract_Algebra| ,  |group_theorist|Group| , and  |numerical_analyst|Numerical_Analysis| . He is best known for  |Zorns_lemma|Zorns_Lemma| , a method used in  |set_theory|Set_Theory|  that is applicable to a wide range of mathematical constructs such as  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space| ,  |ordered_sets|Partially_Ordered_Set|  and the like. Zorns lemma was first postulated by  |Kazimierz_Kuratowski|Kazimierz_Kuratowski|  in 1922, and then independently by Zorn in 1935.       Zorn was born in  |Krefeld|Krefeld| ,  |Germany|German_Empire| . He attended the  |University_of_Hamburg|University_Of_Hamburg| . He received his  |Ph.D.|Ph.D.|  in April 1930 for a thesis on  |alternative_algebras|Alternative_Algebra| . He published his findings in  Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg . M. Zorn Theorie der alternativen Ringen ,  Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg  8: 123–47 M. Zorn Alternativekörper und quadratische Systeme , Abhandlungen aus dem mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg 9: 395–402 Zorn showed that  |split-octonions|Split-Octonion|  could be represented by a mixed-style of matrices called  |Zorns_vector-matrix_algebra|Split-Octonionzorn.27Svector-Matrixalgebra| .     Max Zorn was appointed as an assistant at the  |University_of_Halle|University_Of_Halle| . However, he did not have the opportunity to work there for long since he was forced to leave Germany in 1933 because of the Nazi policies. According to grandson Eric, spoke with a raspy, airy voice most of his life. Few people knew why, because he only told the story after significant prodding, but he talked that way because pro-Hitler thugs who objected to his politics, had battered his throat in a 1933 street fight.  |Eric_Zorn|Eric_Zorn|   from  |Chicago_Tribune|Chicago_Tribune|      Zorn emigrated to the  |U.S.|United_States|  and was appointed a  |Sterling_Fellow|Sterling_Fellow|  at  |Yale_University|Yale_University| . While at Yale, Zorn wrote his paper A Remark on Method in Transfinite Algebra  that stated his Maximum Principle, later called  |Zorns_lemma|Zorns_Lemma| . It requires a set that contains the union of any  |chain|Total_Orderchain|  of  |subsets|Subset|  to have one chain not contained in any other, called the  |maximal_element|Maximal_Element| . He illustrated the principle with applications in ring theory and field extensions. Zorn’s lemma is an alternative expression of the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| , and thus a subject of interest in  |axiomatic_set_theory|Axiomatic_Set_Theory| .     In 1936 he moved to  |UCLA|Ucla|  and remained until 1946. While at UCLA Zorn revisited his study of alternative rings and proved the existence of the  |nilradical|Nilradical_Of_A_Ring|  of certain  |alternative_rings|Alternative_Ring| . M. Zorn Alternative rings and related questions I: existence of the radical,  |Annals_of_Mathematics|Annals_Of_Mathematics|  42: 676–86  According to  |Angus_E._Taylor|Angus_E._Taylor| , Max was his most stimulating colleague at UCLA.  |Angus_E._Taylor|Angus_E._Taylor|  A Life in Mathematics Remembered,  |American_Mathematical_Monthly|American_Mathematical_Monthly|  91:613.     In 1946 Zorn became a professor at  |Indiana_University|Indiana_University|  where he taught until retiring in 1971. He was thesis advisor for  |Israel_Nathan_Herstein|Israel_Nathan_Herstein| .     Zorn died in  |Bloomington|Bloomington,_Indiana| ,  |Indiana|Indiana| ,  |United_States|United_States| , in March 1993, of congestive heart failure, according to his obituary in  The New York Times .        Max Zorn married Alice Schlottau and they had one son, Jens, and one daughter, Liz. Jens is an emeritus professor of physics at the  |University_of_Michigan|University_Of_Michigan|  and an accomplished sculptor. Max Zorns grandson  |Eric_Zorn|Eric_Zorn|  is a columnist for the  Chicago Tribune  .
