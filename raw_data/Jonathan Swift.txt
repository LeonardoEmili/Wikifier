              Jonathan Swift was an  |Anglo-Irish|Anglo-Irish| |satirist|Satire| , essayist, political  |pamphleteer|Pamphleteer|  , poet and cleric who became  |Dean|Dean|  of  |St_Patricks_Cathedral,_Dublin|St_Patricks_Cathedral,_Dublin| ,  hence his common sobriquet, Dean Swift .     Swift is remembered for works such as  A Tale of a Tub  ,  An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity  ,  Gullivers Travels  , and  A Modest Proposal  . He is regarded by the  Encyclopædia Britannica  as the foremost prose satirist in the English language, and is less well known for his poetry. He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms – such as  |Lemuel_Gulliver|Lemuel_Gulliver| ,  |Isaac_Bickerstaff|Isaac_Bickerstaff| ,  |M._B._Drapier|M._B._Drapier|  – or anonymously. He was a master of two styles of satire, the  |Horatian_and_Juvenalian|Satireclassifications|  styles.     His  |deadpan|Deadpan| ,  |ironic|Ironic|  writing style, particularly in  A Modest Proposal , has led to such  |satire|Satire|  being subsequently termed Swiftian .

Frank Boyle, Johnathan Swift , Ch 11 in A Companion to Satire: Ancient and Modern , edited by Ruben Quintero, John Wiley & Sons          Jonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in  |Dublin|Dublin| , Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift and his wife Abigail Erick of  |Frisby_on_the_Wreake|Frisby_On_The_Wreake| .  His father was a native of  |Goodrich,_Herefordshire|Goodrich,_Herefordshire| , but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their  |Royalist|Royalist|  fathers estate was brought to ruin during the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War| . His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of  |Thornton_in_Leicestershire|Thornton,_Leicestershire| . In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Some time thereafter, Ericke and his family, including his young daughter Abilgail, fled to Ireland.      Swifts father joined his elder brother, Godwin, in the practice of law in Ireland. Stubbs , p. 43. He died in Dublin about seven months before his namesake was born.   He died of  |syphilis|Syphilis| , which he said he got from dirty sheets when out of town. Stubbs , p. 54.     At the age of one, child Jonathan was taken by his  |wet_nurse|Wet_Nurse|  to her hometown of  |Whitehaven|Whitehaven| , Cumberland, England. He said that there he learned to read the Bible. His nurse returned him to his mother, still in Ireland, when he was three. Stubbs , pp. 58–63.     His mother returned to England after his birth, leaving him in the care of his uncle Godwin Swift , a close friend and confidant of Sir  |John_Temple|John_Temple| , whose son later employed Swift as his secretary. Stephen DNB, p. 205        Swifts family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth Swift was the niece of  |Sir_Erasmus_Dryden|Sir_Erasmus_Dryden,_1St_Baronet| , grandfather of poet  |John_Dryden|John_Dryden| . The same grandmothers aunt Katherine Dryden was a first cousin of  |Elizabeth|Elizabeth_Raleigh| , wife of Sir  |Walter_Raleigh|Walter_Raleigh| . His great-great grandmother Margaret Swift was the sister of  |Francis_Godwin|Francis_Godwin| , author of  The Man in the Moone  which influenced parts of Swifts  Gullivers Travels . His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir  |William_Davenant|William_Davenant| , a godson of  |William_Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare| .     Swifts benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift took primary responsibility for the young man, sending him with one of his cousins to  |Kilkenny_College|Kilkenny_College|  . He arrived there at the age of six, where he was expected to have already learned the basic declensions in Latin. He had not, and thus began his schooling in a lower form. Swift graduated in 1682, when he was 15. Stubbs , pp. 73–74.     He attended Dublin University  in 1682, Alumni Dublinenses Supplement p116: a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of Trinity College in the University of Dublin  |Burtchaell,_G.D|George_Dames_Burtchaell| / |Sadlier,_T.U|Thomas_Sadleir| |Glorious_Revolution|Glorious_Revolution|  forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir  |William_Temple|William_Temple|  at  |Moor_Park,_Farnham|Moor_Park,_Farnham| . Stephen DNB, p. 206 Temple was an English diplomat who arranged the  |Triple_Alliance_of_1668|Triple_Alliance_Of_1668| . He had retired from public service to his country estate, to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employers confidence, Swift was often trusted with matters of great importance . Stephen DNB, p. 207 Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple had introduced his secretary to  |William_III|William_Iii_Of_England|  and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.     Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met  |Esther_Johnson|Esther_Johnson| , then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temples sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname Stella , and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esthers life. Stephen DNB, p. 208     In 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health, but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness, now known to be  |Ménières_disease|Ménières_Disease| , and it continued to plague him throughout his life. Bewley, Thomas H., The health of Jonathan Swift , Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1998;91:602–605 During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M.A. from  |Hart_Hall|Hertford_College,_Oxford| ,  |Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| , in 1692. He then left Moor Park, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temples patronage, in order to become an ordained priest in the Established  |Church_of_Ireland|Church_Of_Ireland| . He was appointed to the  |prebend|Prebendary|  of Kilroot in the  |Diocese_of_Connor|Diocese_Of_Connor|  in 1694, Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 3  |Cotton,H.|Henry_Cotton|  p. 266: Dublin, Hodges & Smith, 1848–1878 with his parish located at  |Kilroot|Kilroot| , near  |Carrickfergus|Carrickfergus|  in  |County_Antrim|County_Antrim| .     Swift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot, however, he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called Varina , the sister of an old college friend. A letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temples service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temples death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temples memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time, Swift wrote  The Battle of the Books , a satire responding to critics of Temples Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning , though Battle was not published until 1704.     Temple died on 27 January 1699. Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple. He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temples memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. Unfortunately, his work made enemies among some of Temples family and friends, in particular Temples formidable sister Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs. Swifts next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the  |Earl_of_Berkeley|Baron_Berkeley| , one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However, when he reached Ireland, he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another. He soon obtained the living of Laracor,  |Agher|Agher| , and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 2  |Cotton,H.|Henry_Cotton|  p. 165: Dublin, Hodges & Smith, 1848-1878 in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Stephen DNB, p. 209     Swift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at  |Laracor|Laracor| , which was just over four and half miles from  |Summerhill,_County_Meath|Summerhill,_County_Meath| , and  from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park, planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701, he anonymously published the political pamphlet A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome.       Swift had residence in  |Trim,_County_Meath|Trim,_County_Meath| , after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this time period. In February 1702, Swift received his  |Doctor_of_Divinity|Doctor_Of_Divinity|  degree from  |Trinity_College,_Dublin|Trinity_College,_Dublin| . That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson—now 20—and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temples household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swifts relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed Stella . Many, notably his close friend  |Thomas_Sheridan|Thomas_Sheridan| , believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swifts housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley dismissed the story as absurd. Stephen DNB, pp. 215–217 Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend  |William_Tisdall|William_Tisdall|  informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an interloper , and they were estranged for many years.     During his visits to England in these years, Swift published  A Tale of a Tub  and  The Battle of the Books  and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close, lifelong friendships with  |Alexander_Pope|Alexander_Pope| ,  |John_Gay|John_Gay| , and  |John_Arbuthnot|John_Arbuthnot| , forming the core of the Martinus  |Scriblerus_Club|Scriblerus_Club|  .     Swift became increasingly active politically in these years. Stephen DNB, p. 212. Swift supported the  |Glorious_Revolution|Glorious_Revolution|  and early in his life belonged to the  |Whigs|Whigs| .   As a member of the Anglican Church, he feared a return of the Catholic monarchy and Papist absolutism. From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of  |Lord_Godolphin|Lord_Godolphin|  the claims of the Irish clergy to the  |First-Fruits_and_Twentieths|Queen_Annes_Bounty|  , which brought in about £2,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition  |Tory|Tory|  leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and, when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of  The Examiner . In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet  The Conduct of the Allies , attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret negotiations with France, resulting in the  |Treaty_of_Utrecht|Treaty_Of_Utrecht|  ending the  |War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War_Of_The_Spanish_Succession| .     Swift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government, Stephen DNB, pp. 212–215 and often acted as mediator between  |Henry_St_John|Henry_St_John,_1St_Viscount_Bolingbroke|  , the secretary of state for foreign affairs , and  |Robert_Harley|Robert_Harley,_1St_Earl_Of_Oxford_And_Mortimer|  , lord treasurer and prime minister . Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as  A Journal to Stella . The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of  |Queen_Anne|Anne,_Queen_Of_Great_Britain|  and accession of  |George_I|George_I_Of_Great_Britain|  that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France.     Swift has been described by scholars as a Whig in politics and Tory in religion and Swift related his own views in similar terms, stating that as a lover of liberty, I found myself to be what they called a Whig in politics...But, as to religion, I confessed myself to be an High-Churchman. In his Thoughts on Religion , fearing the intense partisan strife waged over religious belief in the seventeenth century England, Swift wrote that Every man, as a member of the commonwealth, ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private. However, it should be borne in mind that, during Swifts time period, terms like Whig and Tory both encompassed a wide array of opinions and factions, and neither term aligns with a modern political party or modern political alignments.     Also during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family and became involved with one of the daughters,  |Esther|Esther_Vanhomrigh| . Swift furnished Esther with the nickname  |Vanessa|Vanessa|  , and she features as one of the main characters in his poem  Cadenus and Vanessa . The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift, and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship. Stephen DNB, pp. 215–216 Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714, and settled at her old family home,  |Celbridge_Abbey|Celbridge_Abbey| . Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, having destroyed the will she had made in Swifts favour. Stephen DNB, p. 216 Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was  |Anne_Long|Anne_Long| , a toast of the  |Kit-Cat_Club|Kit-Cat_Club| .          Before the fall of the Tory government, Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to A Tale of a Tub, which she thought blasphemous, compounded by The Windsor Prophecy, where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust.  The best position his friends could secure for him was the  |Deanery_of_St_Patricks|Dean_Of_St._Patricks_Cathedral,_Dublin| ; Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 2  |Cotton,H.|Henry_Cotton|  pp. 104–105: Dublin, Hodges & Smith, 1848–1878 this was not in the Queens gift, and Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it. Gregg , p. 353 With the return of the Whigs, Swifts best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live like a rat in a hole . Stephen DNB p. 215     Once in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture ,  Drapiers Letters  , and A Modest Proposal , earning him the status of an Irish patriot. Stephen DNB pp. 217–218 This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of  |seditious_libel|Seditious_Libel|  in 1720, but four years later a  |grand_jury|Grand_Jury|  refused to find that the Drapiers Letters were seditious. Sir  |Walter_Scott|Walter_Scott| . Life of Jonathan Swift, vol. 1, Edinburgh 1814, pp. 281–282 Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the vile and profligate villain  |William_Whitshed|William_Whitshed| ,  |Lord_Chief_Justice_of_Ireland|Lord_Chief_Justice_Of_Ireland| . Ball, F. Elrington. The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921, London John Murray 1926, vol. 2 pp. 103–105     Also during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships, better known as  Gullivers Travels . Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories illegal peace treaty; having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London, Stephen DNB, p. 219 taking with him the manuscript of Gullivers Travels. During his visit he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope, John Arbuthnot and John Gay, who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book. First published in November 1726, it was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland.     Swift returned to England one more time in 1727, and stayed once again with Alexander Pope. The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying, and rushed back home to be with her. On 28 January 1728, Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his The Death of Mrs Johnson. He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patricks. Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Johnsons, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, Only a womans hair .        Death became a frequent feature of Swifts life from this point. In 1731 he wrote Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift, his own obituary, published in 1739. In 1732, his good friend and collaborator John Gay died. In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, died. In 1738 Swift began to show signs of illness, and in 1742 he may have suffered a stroke, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. Stephen DNB, p. 221 He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers on, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of unsound mind and memory . However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book  Literature and Western Man , author  |J._B._Priestley|J._B._Priestley|  even cites the final chapters of Gullivers Travels as proof of Swifts approaching insanity . Bewley attributes his decline to terminal dementia. Bewley, Thomas H., The health of Jonathan Swift, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1998;91:602–605     In part VIII of his series,  The Story of Civilization ,  |Will_Durant|Will_Durant|  describes the final years of Swifts life as such:     Definite symptoms of madness appeared in 1738. In 1741, guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence he should do himself harm. In 1742, he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of an egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He went a whole year without uttering a word. The Story of Civilization , V.8., 362.     In 1744, Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745, Swift, at nearly 80, died. Stephen DNB, p. 222 After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnsons side, in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patricks Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which  |still_exists|St_Patricks_University_Hospital|  as a psychiatric hospital.          :.     Jonathan Swift wrote his own  |epitaph|Epitaph| |W._B._Yeats|W._B._Yeats|  poetically translated it from the Latin as:     : Swift has sailed into his rest;   : Savage indignation there   : Cannot lacerate his breast.   : Imitate him if you dare,   : World-besotted traveller; he   : Served human liberty.       Swift was a prolific writer, notable for his satires. The most recent collection of his prose works comprises fourteen volumes. A recent edition of his complete poetry is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence fills three volumes.               Swifts first major prose work,  A Tale of a Tub , demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread, the Tale recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their fathers will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their fathers admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical digressions on various subjects.     In 1690, Sir  |William_Temple|Sir_William_Temple,_1St_Baronet| , Swifts patron, published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning a defence of classical writing , holding up the Epistles of Phalaris as an example.  |William_Wotton|William_Wotton|  responded to Temple with Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning , showing that the Epistles were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by  |Charles_Boyle|Charles_Boyle,_4Th_Earl_Of_Orrery|  . A further retort on the Modern side came from  |Richard_Bentley|Richard_Bentley| , one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris . The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his  Battle of the Books  in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients.        In 1708, a cobbler named  |John_Partridge|John_Partridge|  published a popular  |almanac|Almanac|  of  |astrological|Astrological|  predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in Predictions for the Ensuing Year by  |Isaac_Bickerstaff|Isaac_Bickerstaff| , a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridges statements to the contrary. According to other sources,  |Richard_Steele|Richard_Steele|  used the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff, and was the one who wrote about the death of John Partridge and published it in  The Spectator , not Jonathan Swift.     The Drapiers Letters was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to  |William_Wood|William_Wood|  to mint copper coinage for Ireland. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these letters Swift posed as a shop-keeper—a draper—to criticise the plan. Swifts writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher Harding. Elrington Ball. The Judges in Ireland, vol. 2 pp. 103–105 Thanks to the general outcry against the coinage, Woods patent was rescinded in September 1725 and the coins were kept out of circulation.  In Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements.      Gullivers Travels , a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726. It is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings, the Travels was published under a pseudonym, the fictional Lemuel Gulliver, a ships surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benj. Motte and Gullivers also-fictional cousin negotiating the books publication has survived. Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in  |bowdlerised|Bowdlerised|  form as a childrens book, it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swifts experience of his times. Gullivers Travels is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticised for its apparent misanthropy. It asks its readers to refute it, to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society. Each of the four books—recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands—has a different theme, but all are attempts to deflate human pride. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought.     In 1729, Swift published  A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick , a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Irelands poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food... Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:   Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients...taxing our absentees...using except what is of our own growth and manufacture...rejecting...foreign luxury...introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance...learning to love our country...quitting our animosities and factions...teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants....Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.
