              This timeline of the evolutionary history of life represents the current  |scientific_theory|Scientific_Theory|  outlining the major events during the development of  |life|Life|  on planet  |Earth|Earth| . In  |biology|Biology| ,  |evolution|Evolution|  is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of  |biological_organization|Biological_Organization| , from  |kingdoms|Kingdom|  to  |species|Species| , and individual  |organisms|Organism|  and  |molecules|Molecule| , such as  |DNA|Dna|  and  |proteins|Protein| . The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a  |common_ancestor|Common_Descent|  from which all known species, living and  |extinct|Extinction| , have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,  that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.   Estimates on the number of Earths current species range from 10 million to 14 million,  of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.  However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described.      While the dates given in this article are estimates based on  |scientific_evidence|Scientific_Evidence| , there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased  |biodiversity|Biodiversity|  through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on Earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times, such as the  |Cambrian_explosion|Cambrian_Explosion| , there was great diversity.   Four diagrams of evolutionary models             Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a  |mass_extinction|Mass_Extinction|  in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual.  A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.      The first known mass extinction in earths history was the  |Great_Oxygenation_Event|Great_Oxygenation_Event|  2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planets  |obligate_anaerobes|Obligate_Anaerobe| . Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earths history since:      End of the  |Ordovician|Ordovician| |graptolites|Graptolite|    Late  |Devonian|Devonian| |trilobites|Trilobite|    End of the  |Permian|Permian| , The Great Dying : 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including  |tabulate_corals|Tabulate_Coral| , and most extant trees and  |synapsids|Synapsid|    End of the  |Triassic|Triassic| |conodonts|Conodont|    End of the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous| |ammonites|Ammonite| ,  |mosasaurs|Mosasaur| ,  |ichthyosaurs|Ichthyosaur| ,  |plesiosaurs|Plesiosaur| ,  |pterosaurs|Pterosaur| , and nonavian  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|          Smaller extinction-events have occurred in the periods between these larger catastrophes, with some standing at the delineation points of the periods and epochs recognized by scientists in  |geologic_time|Geologic_Time_Scale| . The  |Holocene_extinction|Holocene_Extinction|  event is currently under way.          Factors in mass extinctions include  |continental_drift|Continental_Drift| , changes in atmospheric and marine  |chemistry|Chemistry| ,  |volcanism|Volcanism|  and other aspects of  |mountain_formation|Mountain_Formation| , changes in  |glaciation|Glaciation| , changes in  |sea_level|Sea_Level| , and  |impact_events|Impact_Event| .
