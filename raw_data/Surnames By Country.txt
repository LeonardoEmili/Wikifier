|Surname|Surname|  conventions and  |laws|Surname_Law|  vary around the world. This article gives an overview of surnames around the world.                                           In  |Argentina|Argentina| , normally only one family name, the fathers paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries. However, it is possible to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if Ana Laura Melachenko and Emanuel Darío Guerrero had a daughter named Adabel Anahí, her full name could be  Adabel Anahí Guerrero Melachenko . Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their  |birth_family_names|Maiden_And_Married_Names|  instead of their husbands family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining de and her husbands surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become Paula Segovia de Cossia or Paula Cossia.     There are some province offices where a married woman can use only her birth name, and some others where she has to use the complete name, for legal purposes. The Argentine Civilian Code states both uses are correct, but police offices and passports are issued with the complete name. Today most women prefer to maintain their birth name given that de can be interpreted as meaning they belong to their husbands.     When Eva Duarte married  |Juan_Domingo_Perón|Juan_Domingo_Perón| , she could be addressed as Eva Duarte de Perón, but the preferred style was  |Eva_Perón|Eva_Perón| , or the familiar and affectionate Evita .     Combined names come from old traditional families and are considered one last name, but are rare. Although Argentina is a  |Spanish|Spanish_Language| -speaking country, it is also composed of other  |varied_European_influences|Demographics_Of_Argentina| , such as Italian, French, Russian, German, etc.     Children typically use their fathers last names only. Some state offices have started to use both last names, in the traditional father then mother order, to reduce the risk of a person being mistaken for others using the same name combinations, e.g. if Eva Duarte and Juan Perón had a child named Juan, he might be misidentified if he were called Juan Perón, but not if he was known as Juan Perón Duarte.     In early 2008, some new legislation is under consideration that will place the mothers last name ahead the fathers last name, as it is done in  |Portuguese_speaking|Married_And_Maiden_Namesportuguese_Speaking_World|  countries and only optionally in Spain, despite Argentina being a Spanish-speaking country.       In  |Chile|Chile| , marriage has no effect at all on either of the spouses names, so people keep their birth names for all their life, no matter how many times marital status, theirs or that of their parents, may change. However, in some upper-class circles or in older couples, even though considered to be old-fashioned, it is still customary for a wife to use her husbands name as reference, as in Doña María Inés de Ramírez .     Children will always bear the surname of the father followed by that of the mother, but if there is no known father and the mother is single, the children can bear either both of her mothers surnames or the mothers first surname followed by any of the surnames of the mothers parents or grandparents, or the child may bear the mothers first surname twice in a row.            France    Belgium    Canadian             There are about 1,000,000 different family names in German. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. Hyphenations notwithstanding, they mostly consist of a single word; in those rare cases where the family name is linked to the given names by particles such as von or zu, they usually indicate  |noble|Nobility| |_ancestry|Ancestry| . Not all noble families used these names , while some farm families, particularly in  |Westphalia|Westphalia| , used the particle von or zu followed by their farm or former farms name as a family name .     Family names in German-speaking countries are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: in parts of Austria and Bavaria and the  |Alemannic_speaking|Alemannic_German|  areas, the family name is regularly put in front of the first given name. Also in many – especially  |rural|Rural|  – parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a  |possessive|Possession| Rüters Erich, for example, would be Erich of the Rüter family.     In Germany today, upon marriage, both partners can choose to keep their birth name or choose either partners name as the common name. In the latter case the partner whose name wasnt chosen can keep his birth name hyphenated to the new name , but any children will only get the single common name. In the case that both partners keep their birth name they must decide on one of the two family names for all their future children.      Changing ones family name for reasons other than marriage, divorce or adoption is possible only if the application is approved by the responsible government agency. Permission will usually be granted if:   the old name is very common and leads to confusion;   the old name is overly long or very difficult to spell or pronounce ; or   the old name has negative connotations or is easily ridiculed.     Otherwise, name changes will normally not be granted.                    The Netherlands and Belgium           In Scandinavia, family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is -sen, as in Karlsen. Names ending with dotter/datter , such as Olofsdotter, are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a persons father does not have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option.  Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlssøn or Annasøn and a daughter Karlsdatter or Annasdatter.     Before the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather  or to the familys  |coat_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms|  . In many surviving family noble names, such as Silfversparre  or Stiernhielm , the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged.      Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish Bergman , Holmberg , Lindgren , Sandström and Åkerlund were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.   Another common practice was to adopt ones place of origin as a middle or surname.     Even more important a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, to develop a system under which each individual had a stable name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. . The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your fathers name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name.  |Einar_Gerhardsen|Einar_Gerhardsen| , the Norwegian  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister| , used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen . Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many  |working_class|Working_Class|  families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.     These names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of last names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffixes like -bø, -rud, -heim/-um, -land or -set . In Denmark, the most common suffix is -gaard — the modern spelling is gård in Danish and can be either gård or gard in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably  Kierkegaard  , but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.      In many cases, names were taken from the nature around them. In Norway, for instance, there is an abundance of surnames based on coastal geography, with suffixes like -strand, -øy, -holm, -vik, -fjord or -nes. Like the names derived from farms, most of these family names reflected the familys place of residence at the time the family name was fixed , however. A family name such as Swedish Dahlgren is derived from dahl meaning valley and gren meaning branch; or similarly  Upvall  meaning upper-valley ; It depends on the Scandinavian country, language, and dialect.             In  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia|  family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames in a similar fashion to that of the  |gentry|Gentry| . Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish Bergman , Holmberg , Lindgren , Sandström and Åkerlund were quite frequent and remain common today.            Finland including  |Karelia|Karelia|  and  |Estonia|Estonia|  was the eastern part of The Kingdom of Sweden from its unification around 1100–1200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly  |Finnish|Finnish_People|  and  |Swedish|Finland_Swedish|  surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the Finnish in Finland: the  |West_Finnish|West_Finnish|  and the  |East_Finnish|East_Finnish| . The surname traditions of Swedish-speaking farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of  Sami  and  Romani people  have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.     Until the mid 20th Century, Finland was a predominantly  |agrarian|Agriculture|  society, and the names of West  |Finns|Finnish_People|  were based on their association with a particular area,  |farm|Farm| , or  |homestead|Smallholding| , e.g. Jaakko Jussila . On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the  |Savonians|Savonian_People|  pursued  |slash_and_burn|Slash_And_Burn|  agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a persons lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families, e.g. Ikävalko, Termonen, Pentikäinen. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the name of the former or current place of living  .
