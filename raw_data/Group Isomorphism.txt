In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , a group isomorphism is a  |function|Function|  between two  |groups|Group|  that sets up a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the groups in a way that respects the given group operations. If there exists an isomorphism between two groups, then the groups are called isomorphic. From the standpoint of group theory, isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished.         Given two groups and , a group isomorphism from to is a  |bijective|Bijection| |group_homomorphism|Group_Homomorphism|  from G to H . Spelled out, this means that a group isomorphism is a bijective function f : G   H such that for all u and v in G it holds that   : f f   f .     The two groups and are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other. This is written:   :       Often shorter and simpler notations can be used. When the relevant group operations are unambiguous they are omitted and one writes:   : G   H     Sometimes one can even simply write G H . Whether such a notation is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context. For example, the equals sign is not very suitable when the groups are both subgroups of the same group. See also the examples.     Conversely, given a group , a set H , and a  |bijection|Bijection|  f : G   H , we can make H a group by defining   : f   f f .     If H G and   âˆ— then the bijection is an automorphism .     Intuitively, group theorists view two isomorphic groups as follows: For every element g of a group G, there exists an element h of H such that h behaves in the same way as g . For instance, if g generates G, then so does h. This implies in particular that G and H are in bijective correspondence. Thus, the definition of an isomorphism is quite natural.     An isomorphism of groups may equivalently be defined as an  |invertible|Invertible| |morphism|Morphism|  in the  |category_of_groups|Category_Of_Groups| , where invertible here means has a two-sided inverse.       In this section some notable examples of isomorphic groups are listed.   The group of all  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  with addition, , is isomorphic to the group of  |positive_real_numbers|Positive_Real_Numbers|  with multiplication :   :   via the isomorphism   : f ex .   The group   of  |integers|Integer|  is a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of   , and the  |factor_group|Factor_Group|    is isomorphic to the group S1 of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number|  of  |absolute_value|Absolute_Value|  1 :   :     S1   The  |Klein_four-group|Klein_Four-Group|  is isomorphic to the  |direct_product|Direct_Product_Of_Groups|  of two copies of     , and can therefore be written       . Another notation is Dih 2 , because it is a  |dihedral_group|Dihedral_Group| .   Generalizing this, for all odd n, Dih 2n is isomorphic with the  |direct_product|Direct_Product_Of_Groups|  of Dih n and Z 2 .   If  is an  |infinite_cyclic_group|Infinite_Cyclic_Group| , then  is isomorphic to the integers . From an algebraic point of view, this means that the set of all integers is the only infinite cyclic group.     Some groups can be proven to be isomorphic, relying on the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| , but the proof does not indicate how to construct a concrete isomorphism. Examples:   The group is isomorphic to the group of all  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number|  with addition.    The group of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication as operation is isomorphic to the group S 1 mentioned above.         The  |kernel|Kernel|  of an isomorphism from  to , is always where e G is the identity of the group      If  is isomorphic to , and if G is  |abelian|Abelian_Group|  then so is H.     If  is a group that is isomorphic to  where f is the isomorphism, then if a belongs to G and has  |order|Order|  n, then so does f.     If  is a  |locally_finite_group|Locally_Finite_Group|  that is isomorphic to , then  is also locally finite.     The number of distinct groups of order n is given by sequence A000001 in  |OEIS|Oeis| . The first few numbers are 0, 1, 1, 1 and 2 meaning that 4 is the lowest order with more than one group.       All cyclic groups of a given order are isomorphic to .     Let G be a cyclic group and n be the order of G. G is then the group generated by   x  .   We will show that   : G       Define   :   : G     , so that   . Clearly,   is bijective.   Then   :     a+b     , which proves that G   .         From the definition, it follows that any isomorphism f : G   H will map the identity element of G to the identity element of H ,   : f eH   that it will map inverses to inverses,   : f     and more generally, nth powers to nth powers,   : f     for all u in G ,   and that the inverse map f : H   G is also a group isomorphism.     The relation being isomorphic satisfies all the axioms of an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation| . If f is an isomorphism between two groups G and H , then everything that is true about G that is only related to the group structure can be translated via f into a true ditto statement about H , and vice versa.          An isomorphism from a group to itself is called an  |automorphism|Automorphism|  of this group. Thus it is a bijection f : G   G such that   : f f f .     An automorphism always maps the identity to itself. The image under an automorphism of a  |conjugacy_class|Conjugacy_Class|  is always a conjugacy class . The image of an element has the same order as that element.     The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and with this operation the set of all automorphisms of a group G , denoted by Aut, forms itself a group, the automorphism group of G .     For all abelian groups there is at least the automorphism that replaces the group elements by their inverses. However, in groups where all elements are equal to their inverse this is the trivial automorphism, e.g. in the  |Klein_four-group|Klein_Four-Group| . For that group all permutations of the three non-identity elements are automorphisms, so the automorphism group is isomorphic to S 3 and Dih 3 .     In Z p for a prime number p , one non-identity element can be replaced by any other, with corresponding changes in the other elements. The automorphism group is isomorphic to . For example, for , multiplying all elements of Z 7 by 3, modulo 7, is an automorphism of order 6 in the automorphism group, because , while lower powers do not give 1. Thus this automorphism generates Z 6 . There is one more automorphism with this property: multiplying all elements of Z 7 by 5, modulo 7. Therefore, these two correspond to the elements 1 and 5 of Z 6 , in that order or conversely.     The automorphism group of Z 6 is isomorphic to Z 2 , because only each of the two elements 1 and 5 generate Z 6 , so apart from the identity we can only interchange these.     The automorphism group of  has order 168, as can be found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so we can choose which plays the role of . Any of the remaining 6 can be chosen to play the role of . This determines which corresponds to . For we can choose from 4, which determines the rest. Thus we have  automorphisms. They correspond to those of the  |Fano_plane|Fano_Plane| , of which the 7 points correspond to the 7 non-identity elements. The lines connecting three points correspond to the group operation: a, b, and c on one line means , , and .

For abelian groups all automorphisms except the trivial one are called  |outer_automorphisms|Outer_Automorphism| .     Non-abelian groups have a non-trivial  |inner_automorphism|Inner_Automorphism|.
