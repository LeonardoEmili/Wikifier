        Duke Nukem 3D is a  |first-person_shooter|First-Person_Shooter| |video_game|Video_Game|  developed by  |3D_Realms|3D_Realms| . It is a sequel to the  |platform_games|Platform_Game|   Duke Nukem  and  Duke Nukem II , published by 3D Realms.     Duke Nukem 3D features the adventures of the titular  |Duke_Nukem|Duke_Nukem| , voiced by  |Jon_St._John|Jon_St._John| , who fights against an  |alien_invasion|Alien_Invasion|  on Earth. Along with  Wolfenstein 3D  and  Doom , Duke Nukem 3D is considered to be responsible for popularizing first-person shooters, and was released to major acclaim. Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environments, gameplay, level design, and unique risqué humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes. The games violent nature,  |erotic_elements|Eroticism| , and  |portrayal_of_women|Gender_Representation_In_Video_Games|  incited controversy.     The shareware version of the game was originally released on January 29, 1996, while the full version was released on April 19, 1996 as version 1.3d. The Plutonium PAK, an expansion pack which updated the game to version 1.4 and added a fourth eleven-level episode, was released in November 1996. The Atomic Edition, a standalone version of the game that included the content from the Plutonium PAK and updated the game to version 1.5, was later released; the original version of Duke Nukem 3D has since been discontinued. An official fifth episode was released on October 11, 2016 with 20th Anniversary World Tour published by  |Gearbox_Software|Gearbox_Software| . After  |fifteen_years|Development_Of_Duke_Nukem_Forever|  in  |development_hell|Development_Hell| , a direct sequel was released in 2011 called  Duke Nukem Forever .          As a  |first-person_shooter|First-Person_Shooter|  whose gameplay is similar to  Doom , the gameplay of Duke Nukem 3D involves moving through levels presented from the protagonists point of view, shooting enemies on the way. The environments in Duke Nukem 3D are highly destructible and interactive; most props can be destroyed by the player.     Levels were designed in a fairly non-linear manner such that players can advantageously use  |air_ducts|Air_Duct| , back doors, and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden caches. These locations are also filled with objects with which the player can interact, that either benefit the player in some form, light switches make it easier to see, while  |water_fountains|Water_Fountain|  and broken  |hydrants|Hydrant|  provide some health points or simply diversion, and tipping  |strippers|Strippers|  provokes a quote from Duke, and a provocative reveal from the dancer.     Dukes arsenal consists of the Mighty Foot , a  |pistol|Pistol| , a  |shotgun|Shotgun| , a triple-barrelled  |chain_gun|Chain_Gun| , a  |rocket-propelled_grenade_launcher|Rocket-Propelled_Grenade| ,  |pipe_bombs|Pipe_Bomb| , freeze and  |shrink_rays|Shrink_Ray| , laser  |land_mines|Land_Mines| , and the rapid fire Devastator rocket launcher. There is also an extra weapon known as the Expander , the opposite of the shrink ray weapon, which is only available in the Atomic Edition version of the game.     Various items can be picked up during gameplay. The portable  |medkit|First-Aid_Kit|  allows players to heal Duke at will.  |Steroids|Steroid|  speed up Dukes movement, as well as instantly reversing the effects of the shrink ray weapon and increasing the strength of Dukes Mighty Foot for a short period.  |Night_vision|Night_Vision|  goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The HoloDuke device projects a  |hologram|Hologram|  of Duke which can be used to distract enemies. Protective boots allow Duke to cross dangerously hot or toxic terrain. In sections where progress requires more aquatic legwork, an  |aqua-lung|Aqua-Lung|  allows Duke to take longer trips underwater. Dukes  |jet_pack|Jet_Pack|  allows the player to move vertically and gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas.     The game features a wide variety of enemies; some of which are  |aliens|Extraterrestrial_Life_In_Culture|  and other  |mutated|Mutant|  humans. The  |LAPD|Los_Angeles_Police_Department|  have been turned into Pig Cops , a  |play|Play_On_Words|  on the derogatory term pig for police officers, with LARD emblazoned on their uniforms. As is usual for a first-person shooter, Duke Nukem encounters a large number of lesser foes, as well as  |bosses|Boss| , usually at the end of episodes. Like Duke, these enemies have access to a wide range of weapons and equipment, and some weaker enemies have jet packs.       Duke Nukem 3D features multiplayer. At the time of its release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning. Duke Nukem 3D did not support the  |TCP/IP|Tcp/Ip|  client/server model, instead based its network play on the  |IPX|Ipx| |LAN|Lan| , modem or serial cable. Duke Nukem 3D players often either battled modem-to-modem, using the IPX network utility  |Kali|Kali|  or the  |Total_Entertainment_Network|Total_Entertainment_Network|  online pay service. Kali allowed users to connect to a chat room to host and join games. Duke Nukem 3D was one of the more popular games on TEN prior to the closure of the network in 1999. The game was also supported by  |DWANGO|Dwango| .     Duke Nukem 3D levels were often used as the battlegrounds for these encounters, and users were even able to create their own  |levels|Level| , or maps, using the  |level_editor|Build_Engine|  bundled with the game, which was also used by the developers to design the initial levels. The game also features co-operative play which allows players to complete the story-based mode together. In Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition, a new gameplay mode was introduced: Duke-Tag, a  |capture_the_flag|Capture_The_Flag|  style mode.     Duke Nukem 3D has been ported to run on modern Microsoft Windows variants including Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This has been made possible since the games  |source_code|Source_Code|  was publicly released in 2003. Various  |source_ports|Source_Port|  have been made including EDuke32, JFDuke3D, nDuke, hDuke, and xDuke. All five offer the original visual appearance of the game, while EDuke32 also supports  |OpenGL|Opengl|  rendering including the capability to use fan-created modern graphics using the High Resolution Pack. nDuke, hDuke and xDuke can still be played online in multiplayer DukeMatch format using launchers such as Duke Matcher and YANG, both freely available. EDuke32 multiplayer is in a state of  |development_hell|Development_Hell|  following an attempt to rewrite the network functionality using a  |client–server_model|Client–Server_Model| .         Duke Nukem 3D is set on Earth sometime in the early 21st century . The levels of Duke Nukem 3D take players outdoors and indoors through rendered street scenes, military bases,  |deserts|Desert| , a flooded city,  |space_stations|Space_Station| , moon bases, and a  |Japanese|Japanese_Cuisine|  restaurant.     The game contains several humorous references to pop culture. Some of Dukes lines are drawn from movies such as  Aliens ,  Dirty Harry ,  Evil Dead II ,  Full Metal Jacket ,  Jaws ,  Pulp Fiction , and  They Live ; the captured women saying Kill me is a reference to Aliens. Players will encounter corpses of famous characters such as  |Luke_Skywalker|Luke_Skywalker| ,  |Indiana_Jones|Indiana_Jones| ,  |Snake_Plissken|Snake_Plissken| ,  |the_protagonist|Doomguy|  of  Doom , and a smashed  |T-800|Terminator| . In the first episode, players navigate a tunnel in the wall of a prison cell hidden behind a poster, just like in  The Shawshank Redemption . During the second episode, players can see  |The_Monolith|Monolith|   on the moon. In the bathroom of the first level,  |867-5309|867-5309|  is written on a wall.     The game cover itself is a parody of  Army of Darkness , with Duke posing as  |Ash_Williams|Ash_Williams| .       There is little narrative in the game, only a brief text prelude located under Help in the Main Menu, and a few  |cutscenes|Cutscene|  after the completion of an episode. The game picks up right after the events of  Duke Nukem II , with Duke returning to Earth in his space cruiser. As Duke descends on  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles|  in hopes of taking a vacation, his ship is shot down by unknown hostiles. While sending a distress signal, Duke learns that aliens are attacking Los Angeles and have mutated the  |LAPD|Lapd| . With his vacation plans now ruined, Duke hits the eject button, and vows to do whatever it takes to stop the alien invasion.     In Episode One: L.A. Meltdown , Duke fights his way through a  |dystopia|Dystopia| n Los Angeles. At a  |strip_club|Strip_Club| , he is captured by pig-cops, but escapes the alien-controlled penitentiary and tracks down the alien cruiser responsible for the invasion in the  |San_Andreas_Fault|San_Andreas_Fault| . Duke discovers that the aliens were capturing women, and detonates the ship. Levels in this episode include a movie theater, a Red Light District, a prison, and a nuclear-waste disposal facility.     In Episode Two: Lunar Apocalypse , Duke journeys to  |space|Outer_Space| , where he finds many of the captured women held in various  |incubators|Incubator|  throughout space stations that had been conquered by the aliens. Duke reaches the alien mothership on the Moon and kills an alien Overlord. As Duke inspects the ships computer, it is revealed that the plot to capture women was merely a ruse to distract him. The aliens have already begun their attack on Earth.     In Episode Three: Shrapnel City , Duke battles the massive alien resistance through Los Angeles once again, and kills the leader of the alien menace: the Cycloid Emperor. The game ends as Duke promises that after some  |R_&_R|R_&_R|  , he will be ...ready for more action! , as an anonymous woman calls him back to bed. Levels in this episode include a sushi bar, a movie set, a subway, and a hotel.     The story continues in the Atomic Edition. In Episode Four: The Birth , it is revealed that the aliens used a captured woman to give birth to the Alien Queen, a creature which can quickly spawn deadly alien protector drones. Duke is dispatched back to Los Angeles to fight hordes of aliens, including the protector drones. Eventually, Duke finds the lair of the Alien Queen, and kills her, thus thwarting the alien plot. Levels in this episode include a fast-food restaurant , a supermarket, a Disneyland parody called Babe Land, a police station, the  |Exxon_Valdez|Exxon_Valdez| , and  |Area_51|Area_51| .     With the release of 20th Anniversary World Tour, the story progresses further. In Episode Five: Alien World Order , Duke finds out that the aliens initiated a world-scale invasion, so he sets out to repel their attack on various countries. Duke proceeds to clear out aliens from  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam| ,  |Moscow|Moscow| ,  |London|London| ,  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco| ,  |Paris|Paris| ,  |the_Pyramids_at_Giza|The_Pyramids_At_Giza| , and  |Rome|Rome| , with the final showdown with the returning alien threat taking place in Los Angeles, taking the game full circle. There, he defeats the Cycloid Incinerator, the current alien leader, stopping their threat for good.       Duke Nukem 3D was developed on a budget of roughly $300,000. The development team consisted of eight people for most of the development cycle, increasing to 12 or 13 people near the end. At one point, the game was being programmed to allow the player to switch between first person view, third person view, and fixed camera angles.  |Scott_Miller|Scott_Miller|  of 3D Realms recalled that with Duke 3D, unlike every shooter that came before, we wanted to have sort of real life locations like a cinema theatre, you know, strip club, bookstores...     LameDuke is a  |beta_version|Beta_Version|  of Duke Nukem 3D, which was released by 3D Realms as a bonus one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support. LameDuke features four episodes: Mr. Caliber, Mission Cockroach, Suck Hole, and Hard Landing. Certain weapons were altered from the original versions and/or removed.      |Lee_Jacksons|Lee_Jackson|  theme song Grabbag has elicited many spin-offs and remixes over the years by both fans and professional musicians, including an officially sanctioned studio version by the popular  |thrash_metal|Thrash_Metal|  outfit  |Megadeth|Megadeth| . Another version of the song was recorded by  |Chris_Kline|Chris_Kline|  in August 2005.  |3D_Realms|3D_Realms|  featured it on the front page of their website and contracted with Kline to use it to promote their  |Xbox_Live|Xbox_Live|  release of Duke Nukem 3D.

It introduced two new enemies, the Protector Drone and the Pig Cop Tank, a new final boss, the Alien Queen, and a new weapon, the Expander. Changes to the script made the game easier to  |mod|Mod| , and players could set up a multiplayer session against CPU  |bots|Artificial_Intelligence| .

Duke - Its Zero HourDuke Nukem 3D was ported to many consoles of the time. All of the ports featured some sort of new content.     Duke Nukem 3D  was released in 1997 in the USA only. Unlike every other version of the game, Duke Nukem cannot turn; he can only move forward, backward, and strafe to the left or right. Due to the Game.coms monochrome screen, it is also the only version to lack color. It only includes four levels from each of the original three episodes for a total of 12 levels. These levels were modified to accommodate Duke Nukems inability to turn.   Duke Nukem 3D  was ported by  |Lobotomy_Software|Lobotomy_Software|  and published by  |Sega|Sega|  in 1997.

Duke Nukem 64 is a port released in 1997 for the  |Nintendo_64|Nintendo_64|  which features a  |split_screen|Split_Screen|  4-player mode.  In-game music was removed due to  |limited_storage_capacity|Nintendo_64_Game_Pak| , many items were renamed to avoid drug and sex references, and new lines of dialogue were recorded specifically for this version to remove profanity. Several levels were altered to include areas from the Atomic Edition, such as a Duke Burger outlet in the second level which was not in the original PC version. Levels are played sequentially instead of as separate episodes. Other changes include the addition of four new weapons, dual sub-machine guns, a grenade launcher, a missile launcher, and the Plasma Cannon, alternative ammo types for the pistol, shotgun, and missile launcher, and a fully 3D model for the Cycloid Emperor boss.

It also added a new control scheme which lets players control Duke by dragging their finger around the screen.   Duke Nukem 3D  was released on December 29, 2009. As shown in a MaemoWorlds video, Duke is controlled using the Qwerty keypad and touchscreen.   Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition  was released on January 6, 2015 in North America, and January 7, 2015 in Europe. It is a port of the Megaton Edition released on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

It features Cross-Buy and Cross-Play between both platforms. As of February 2016, the game is no longer available for download in North America due to publishing rights returning to Gearbox Software.   Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour Duke Nukem 3D was a commercial hit, selling about 3.5 million copies. In the United States alone, it was the 12th best-selling computer game from 1993 to 1999, with 950,000 units sold.  |NPD_Techworld|Npd_Techworld| , a firm that tracked sales in the United States,  reported 1.25 million units sold of Duke Nukem 3D by December 2002.           Following the release of the Doom  |source_code|Source_Code|  in 1997, gamers wanted a similar source code release from 3D Realms. The last major game to make use of the Duke Nukem 3D source code was TNT Teams  World War II GI  in 1999. Its programmer, Matthew Saettler, obtained permission from 3D Realms to expand the gameplay enhancements done on WWII GI to Duke Nukem 3D.     EDuke was a semi-official branch of Duke Nukem 3D that was released as a patch as Duke Nukem 3D v2.0 for Atomic Edition users on July 28, 2000. It included a demo mod made by several beta testers. It focused primarily on enhancing the CON scripting language in ways which allowed those modifying the game to do much more with the system than originally possible. Though a further version was planned, it never made it out of beta. It was eventually cancelled due to programmer time constraints. About a month after the release of the Duke Nukem 3D source code,  Blood  project manager Matt Saettler released the source code for both EDuke v2.0 and EDuke v2.1, the test version of which would have eventually become the next EDuke release, under the GPL.     The  |source_code|Source_Code|  to the Duke Nukem 3D v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as  |free_software|Free_Software|  under the  |GPL|Gnu_General_Public_License|  on April 1, 2003. The game content remains under a proprietary license. The game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems.     The first Duke Nukem 3D port was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on  |AmigaOS|Amigaos| ,  |AmigaOS_4|Amigaos_4| ,  |AROS|Aros| ,  |BeOS|Beos| ,  |FreeBSD|Freebsd| ,  |Linux|Linux| ,  |Mac_OS_X|Mac_Os_X| ,  |MorphOS|Morphos| ,  |Solaris|Solaris| , and  |Windows|Microsoft_Windows|  rather than MS-DOS. The icculus.org codebase would later be used as the base for several other ports, including Duke3d32.     Another popular early project was Jonathon Fowlers JFDuke3D, which, in December 2003, received backing from the original author of Build, programmer  |Ken_Silverman|Ken_Silverman| . Fowler, in cooperation with Silverman, released a new version of JFDuke3D using  |Polymost|Build_Enginepolymost| , an  |OpenGL|Opengl| -enhanced renderer for Build which allows hardware acceleration and 3D model support along with 32-bit color high resolution textures. Another project based on JFDuke3D called xDuke, unrelated to the xDuke project based on Duke3dw32, runs on the  |Xbox|Xbox| . Silverman has since helped Fowler with a large portion of other engine work, including updating the network code, and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine. Development appears to have stopped; as of January 2015, there have been no new versions since October 9, 2005.     While a few short-lived  |DOS|Dos| -based EDuke projects emerged, it was not until the release of EDuke32, an extended version of Duke3D incorporating variants of both Fowlers  |Microsoft_Windows|Microsoft_Windows|  JFDuke3D code, and Saettlers EDuke code, by one of 3D Realms forum moderators in late 2004, that EDukes scripting extensions received community focus. Among the various enhancements, support for advanced  |shader_model|Shader_Model|  3.0 based graphics was added to EDuke32 during late 2008-early 2009. In June 2008, thanks to significant porting contributions from the  |DOSBox|Dosbox|  team, EDuke32 became the only Duke Nukem 3D source port to compile and run natively on  |64-bit|64-Bit|  Linux systems without the use of a 32-bit compatibility environment.     On April 1, 2009, an  |OpenGL|Opengl|  Shader Model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for EDuke32, named Polymer to distinguish from Ken Silvermans Polymost. It allows for much more modern effects such as dynamic lighting and  |normal_mapping|Normal_Mapping| . Although Polymer is fully functional, it is technically incomplete and unoptimized, and is still in development. As of the fifth installment of the High Resolution Pack, released in 2011, the Polymer renderer is mandatory. In 2011, another significant development of EDuke32 was the introduction of true room over room , where sectors can be placed over other sectors, and can be seen at the same time. In practice, this allows for true three-dimensional level design that was previously impossible, although the base engine is still 2D.     On December 18, 2012, Chocolate Duke3D port was released. Inspired by  Chocolate Doom , the primary goal was to refactor the code so developers would easily read and learn from it.     In February 2013, a source  |code_review|Code_Review|  article was published that described the internal working of the code.            All versions of the game have earned a positive aggregate score on  |GameRankings|Gamerankings|  and  |Metacritic|Metacritic| . The original release on MS-DOS holds an aggregate score of 89% on GameRankings and a score of 89/100 on Metacritic. The version released on Nintendo 64 holds an aggregate score of 74% on GameRankings and a score of 73/100 on Metacritic. The version released on Xbox 360 holds an aggregate score of 81% on GameRankings while it holds a score of 80/100 on Metacritic. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 64% on GameRankings.     Daniel Jevons of Maximum gave it five out of five stars, calling it absolutely perfect in every respect. He particularly cited the games speed and fluidity even on low-end PCs, imaginative weapons, varied and identifiable environments, true 3D level designs, and strong multiplayer mode. A  Next Generation  critic summarized: Duke Nukem 3D has everything Doom doesnt, but it also doesnt leave out the stuff that made Doom a classic. He praised the imaginative weapons, long and complex single-player campaign, competitive multiplayer, built-in level editor, and parental lock.
