   Cuisine of Chinese Muslims  is the cuisine of the  |Hui|Hui_People|  and other Muslims living in China such as  |Dongxiang|Dongxiangs| ,  |Salar|Salar_People| , Uyghurs, and  |Bonan|Bonans|  as well as  |Dungans|Dungan_People|  of  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| .            Due to the large  |Muslim|Muslim|  population in western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to, or are run by, Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in  |China_proper|China_Proper| . It is heavily influenced by  |Beijing_cuisine|Beijing_Cuisine| , with nearly all cooking methods identical, and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.     During the  |Yuan_dynasty|Yuan_Dynasty| ,  |halal|Halal|  methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with  |Genghis_Khan|Genghis_Khan|  who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method.         Among all the alien peoples only the Hui-hui say “we do not eat Mongol food”. “By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?” He thereupon made them eat. “If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.” He issued a regulation to that effect ... In 1279/1280 under  |Qubilai|Kublai_Khan|  all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters we do not eat”. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman Huihui and Zhuhu Huihui, no matter who kills will eat and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision. .       Traditionally, there is a distinction between northern and southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using  |mutton|Mutton|  and lamb. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese, and shrimp are rare in comparison to southern China due to the arid climate of northern China.             A Chinese Islamic restaurant  can be similar to a  |Mandarin_restaurant|Mandarin_Cuisine|  with the exception that there is no  |pork|Pork|  on the menu and is primarily noodle/soup based.     In most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China . They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic  |rugs|Carpet|  and Arabic writing.     Another difference is that  |lamb|Domestic_Sheep|  and  |mutton|Lamb|  dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions.      Other Muslim ethnic minorities like the  |Salar|Salar_People| ,  |Dongxiang|Dongxiang_People| ,  |Bonan|Bonan_People| , and  |Tibetan_Muslims|Tibetan_Muslims|  have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.     Many cafeterias at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students , typically labeled qingzhen. Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the  |Eid|Eid_Ul_Fitr|  feast following  |Ramadan|Ramadan| .

The  |Thai|Thailand|  Department of Export Promotion claims that Chinas halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards to encourage Thai private sector halal producers to market their products in China.      A 1903 started franchise which serves Muslim food is Dong Lai Shun in  |Hankou|Hankou| .      400 meters have to be kept as a distance from each restaurant serving beef noodles to another of its type if they belong to Hui Muslims, since Hui have a pact between each other in Ningxia,  |Gansu|Gansu| , and  |Shaanxi|Shaanxi| .       Halal restaurants are checked up upon by clerics from mosques.      Halal food manufacture has been sanctioned by the government of the  |Ningxia|Ningxia|  Autonomous region.
