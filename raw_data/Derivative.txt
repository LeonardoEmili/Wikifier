              The derivative of a  |function_of_a_real_variable|Function_Of_A_Real_Variable|  measures the sensitivity to change of the function value with respect to a change in its argument . Derivatives are a fundamental tool of  |calculus|Calculus| . For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to  |time|Time|  is the objects  |velocity|Velocity| |slope|Slope|  of the  |tangent_line|Tangent|  to the  |graph_of_the_function|Graph_Of_A_Function|  at that point. The tangent line is the best  |linear_approximation|Linear_Approximation|  of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change , the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.     Derivatives may be generalized to  |functions_of_several_real_variables|Function_Of_Several_Real_Variables| . In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a  |linear_transformation|Linear_Transformation|  whose graph is the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The  |Jacobian_matrix|Jacobian_Matrix|  is the  |matrix|Matrix|  that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the  |partial_derivatives|Partial_Derivative|  with respect to the independent variables. For a  |real_valued_function|Real_Valued_Function|  of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the  |gradient_vector|Gradient_Vector| .     The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. The reverse process is called  antidifferentiation . The  |fundamental_theorem_of_calculus|Fundamental_Theorem_Of_Calculus|  relates antidifferentiation with  |integration|Integral| . Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.       Differentiation is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a  |function|Function|   of a variable  is a measure of the rate at which the value  of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable . It is called the derivative of  with respect to . If  and  are  |real_numbers|Real_Number| , and if the  |graph|Graph_Of_A_Function|  of  is plotted against , the derivative is the  |slope|Slope|  of this graph at each point.        The simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a  |constant_function|Constant_Function| , is when  is a  |linear_function|Linear_Function|  of , meaning that the graph of  is a line. In this case, , for real numbers  and , and the slope  is given by   : m      where the symbol   is an abbreviation for change in , and the combinations   x and   y refer to corresponding changes, i.e.:   y f- f . The above formula holds because   :     y +   y & f    & m  +b mx +m  x +b     & y + m  x.       Thus   :   ym  x.     This gives the value for the slope of a line.     If the function  is not linear , then the change in  divided by the change in  varies over the considered range: differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change, not across a certain range , but at any given value of .          The idea, illustrated by Figures 1 to 3, is to compute the rate of change as the  |limit_value|Limit_Of_A_Function|  of the  |ratio_of_the_differences|Difference_Quotient|   as  becomes infinitely small.          Two distinct notations are commonly used for the derivative, one deriving from  |Leibniz|Leibniz|  and the other from  |Joseph_Louis_Lagrange|Joseph_Louis_Lagrange| .     In  |Leibnizs_notation|Leibnizs_Notation| , an  |infinitesimal|Infinitesimal|  change in  is denoted by , and the derivative of  with respect to  is written   :     suggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.      In  |Lagranges_notation|Lagranges_Notation| , the derivative with respect to  of a function  is denoted  & emsp; or & emsp; f.   The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation f for the nth derivative of f – this notation is most useful when we wish to talk about the derivative as being a function itself, as in this case the Leibniz notation can become cumbersome.        |Newtons_notation|Newtons_Notation|  for differentiation, also called the dot notation, places a dot over the function name to represent a time derivative. If y f , then   :   & emsp; and & emsp;     denote, respectively, the first and second derivatives of y . This notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or  |arc_length|Arc_Length| . It is typically used in  |differential_equations|Differential_Equation|  in  |physics|Physics|  and  |differential_geometry|Differential_Geometry| .   The dot notation, however, becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives and cannot deal with multiple independent variables.        |Eulers|Leonhard_Euler|  notation uses a  |differential_operator|Differential_Operator|  D , which is applied to a function f to give the first derivative Df . The nth derivative is denoted Dnf .     If  is a dependent variable, then often the subscript x is attached to the D to clarify the independent variable x.   Eulers notation is then written   : Dx y & emsp; or & emsp; Dx f ,   although this subscript is often omitted when the variable x is understood, for instance when this is the only independent variable present in the expression.     Eulers notation is useful for stating and solving  |linear_differential_equations|Linear_Differential_Equation| .          The derivative of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.       Most derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions. The following incomplete list gives some of the most frequently used functions of a single real variable and their derivatives.      Derivatives of powers r is any  |real_number|Real_Number| , then     : f rx,     wherever this is defined. For example, if f x , then     : f x,     and the derivative function is defined only for positive x, not for . When , this rule implies that f′ is zero for , which is almost the constant rule .
