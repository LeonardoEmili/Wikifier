   The history of Spain dates back to the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . In 1516,  |Habsburg_Spain|Habsburg_Spain|  unified a number of disparate predecessor kingdoms; its modern form of a  |constitutional_monarchy|Spanish_Constitution_Of_1812|  was introduced in 1813, and the current  |democratic_constitution|Spanish_Transition_To_Democracy|  dates to 1978.     After the completion of the  |Reconquista|Reconquista| , the  |Crown_of_Castile|Crown_Of_Castile|  began to explore across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, expanding into the  |New_World|New_World|  and marking the beginning of the  |Golden_Age|Spanish_Golden_Age|  under the  |Spanish_Empire|Spanish_Empire| . The kingdoms of Spain were united under  |Habsburg_rule|Habsburg_Spain|  in 1516, that unified the Crown of Castile, the  |Crown_of_Aragon|Crown_Of_Aragon|  and smaller kingdoms under the same rule. Until the 1650s, Habsburg Spain was among the most powerful states in the world.     During this period,  |Spain|Spain|  was involved in all major European wars, including the  |Italian_Wars|Italian_Wars| , the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War| , the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , and the  |Franco_Spanish_War|Franco_Spanish_War| . In the later 17th century, however, Spanish power began to decline, and after the death of the last Habsburg ruler, the  |War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War_Of_The_Spanish_Succession|  ended with the relegation of  |Spain|Spain| , now under  |Bourbon_rule|Bourbon_Spain| , to the status of a second-rate power with a reduced influence in European affairs. The so-called  |Bourbon_Reforms|Bourbon_Reforms|  attempted the renewal of state institutions, with some success, but as the century ended, instability set in with the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  and the  |Peninsular_War|Peninsular_War| , so that Spain never regained its former strength.     Spain after 1814 was destabilised as different political parties representing liberal , reactionary , and moderate groups throughout the  |remainder_of_the_century|History_Of_Spain|  fought for and won short-lived control without any being sufficiently strong to bring about lasting stability. The former Spanish Empire overseas quickly disintegrated with the  |Latin_American_wars_of_independence|Latin_American_Wars_Of_Independence| . Only Cuba and the Philippines and some small islands were left; they revolted and the United States acquired ownership after the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War|  of 1898.     A tenuous balance between liberal and conservative forces was struck in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy during the Restoration period but brought no lasting solution, and ultimately the last governments of the monarchy changed into a dictatorial rule. Opposing the trend toward authoritarianism of regime changes during the  |interwar_period|Interwar_Period|  in Europe, a  |democratic_republic|Second_Spanish_Republic|  was proclaimed in Spain in 1931. However, six years later the country descended into the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War|  between the  |Republican|Republican_Faction|  and the  |Nationalist|Nationalist_Faction|  factions.     The rebel victory in the conflict installed a  |dictatorship|Francoist_Spain|  led by  |Francisco_Franco|Francisco_Franco| , that lasted until 1975. The first post-war decade was particularly violent, autocratic, and repressive both in a political, cultural, social, and economical sense. The country experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and early 1970s.     Only with the death of Franco in 1975 did Spain return to the monarchy, this time headed by  |Juan_Carlos_I|Juan_Carlos_I_Of_Spain| , and  |to_democracy|Spanish_Transition_To_Democracy| . With a fresh  |Constitution|1978_Spanish_Constitution|  voted in 1978, Spain entered the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community|  in 1986 , and the  |Eurozone|Eurozone|  in 1999. The  |financial_crisis_of_2007–08|Financial_Crisis_Of_2007–08|  ended a decade of  |economic_boom|Spanish_Property_Bubble|  and Spain entered  |a_recession|2008–14_Spanish_Financial_Crisis|  and  |debt_crisis|European_Sovereign_Debt_Crisisspain|  and remains plagued by very high unemployment and a weak economy.                  The  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  was first inhabited by  |anatomically_modern_humans|Anatomically_Modern_Humans|  about 32,000 years  |BP|Before_Present| .     The earliest record of  |hominids|Hominids|  living in Western Europe has been found in the Spanish cave of  |Atapuerca|Archaeological_Site_Of_Atapuerca| ; a flint tool found there dates from 1.4 million years ago, and early human  |fossils|Fossils|  date to roughly 1.2 million years ago.  Modern humans in the form of  |Cro_Magnons|Cro_Magnon|  began arriving in the Iberian Peninsula from north of the  |Pyrenees|Pyrenees|  some 35,000 years ago. The most conspicuous sign of prehistoric human settlements are the famous  |paintings|Cave_Painting|  in the northern Spanish cave of  |Altamira|Altamira| , which were done c. 15,000  |BC|Before_Christ|  and are regarded as paramount instances of  |cave_art|Cave_Art| .      Furthermore, archeological evidence in places like  |Los_Millares|Los_Millares|  and  |El_Argar|El_Argar| , both in the  |province_of_Almería|Province_Of_Almería| , and La Almoloya near Murcia suggests developed cultures existed in the eastern part of the Iberian Peninsula during the late  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  and the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| . Robert Chapman, Emerging Complexity: The Later Prehistory of South-East Spain, Iberia and the West Mediterranean     Spanish prehistory extends to the pre-Roman  |Iron_Age|European_Iron_Age|  cultures that controlled most of Iberia: those of the  |Iberians|Iberians| ,  |Celtiberians|Celtiberians| ,  |Tartessians|Tartessos| ,  |Lusitanians|Lusitanians| , and  |Vascones|Vascones|  and trading settlements of  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia| ns,  |Carthaginians|Carthaginians| , and  |Greeks|Greek_Colonies|  on the  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean_Sea|  coast.       Before the Roman conquest the major cultures along the Mediterranean coast were the  |Iberians|Iberians| , the  |Celts|Celtiberians|  in the interior and north-west, the  |Lusitanians|Lusitanians|  in the west, and the  |Tartessians|Tartessos|  in the southwest. The seafaring Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Greeks successively established trading settlements along the eastern and southern coast. The first  |Greek_colonies|Greek_Colonies| , such as Emporion , were founded along the northeast coast in the 9th century BC, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians.       The Greeks are responsible for the name Iberia, apparently after the river Iber . In the 6th century BC, the  |Carthaginians|Ancient_Carthage|  arrived in Iberia, struggling first with the Greeks, and shortly after, with the newly arriving Romans for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was  |Carthago_Nova|Carthago_Nova|  .     The peoples whom the  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  met at the time of their invasion in what is now known as Spain were the Iberians, inhabiting an area stretching from the northeast part of the Iberian Peninsula through the southeast. The Celts mostly inhabited the inner and north-west part of the peninsula. In the inner part of the peninsula, where both groups were in contact, a mixed culture arose, the  |Celtiberians|Celtiberians| . The  |Celtiberian_Wars|Celtiberian_Wars|  were fought between the advancing  |legions|Roman_Legion|  of the Roman Republic and the Celtiberian tribes of Hispania Citerior from 181 to 133 BC.   The Roman conquest of the peninsula was completed in 19 BC.                      Hispania  was the name used for the Iberian Peninsula under  |Roman_rule|Ancient_Rome|  from the 2nd century BC. The populations of the peninsula were gradually culturally  |Romanized|Romanization| , Great estates, the  Latifundia  , controlled by a land owning aristocracy, were superimposed on the existing Iberian landholding system. and local leaders were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.      The Romans improved existing cities, such as  |Tarragona|Tarragona|  , and established others like  |Zaragoza|Zaragoza|  ,  |Mérida|Mérida_Spain|  ,  |Valencia|Valencia|  ,  |León|León_Spain|  ,  |Badajoz|Badajoz|  , and  |Palencia|Palencia| . The Roman provinces of Hispania included Provincia Hispania Ulterior Baetica , whose capital was  |Corduba_presently_Córdoba|Córdoba_Spain| , Provincia Hispania Ulterior Lusitania , whose capital was Emerita Augusta , Provincia Hispania Citerior, whose capital was  |Tarraco|Tarraco|  , Provincia Hispania Nova, whose capital was  |Tingis|Tingis|  , Provincia Hispania Nova Citerior and Asturiae-Calleciae . The peninsulas economy expanded under Roman tutelage. Hispania supplied Rome with food, olive oil, wine and metal. The emperors  |Trajan|Trajan| ,  |Hadrian|Hadrian| , and  |Theodosius_I|Theodosius_I| , the philosopher  |Seneca|Seneca_The_Younger| , and the poets  |Martial|Martial| ,  |Quintilian|Quintilian| , and  |Lucan|Lucan|  were born in Hispania. Hispanic bishops held the  |Council_of_Elvira|Council_Of_Elvira|  around 306.     After the fall of the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire|  in the 5th century, parts of Hispania came under the control of the Germanic tribes of  |Vandals|Vandals| ,  |Suebi|Suebi| , and  |Visigoths|Visigoths| .     The collapse of the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire|  did not lead to the same wholesale destruction of Western classical society as happened in areas like  |Roman_Britain|Roman_Britain| ,  |Gaul|Gaul|  and  |Germania_Inferior|Germania_Inferior|  during the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| , although the institutions and infrastructure did decline. Spains present languages, its religion, and the basis of its laws originate from this period. The centuries of uninterrupted Roman rule and settlement left a deep and enduring imprint upon the culture of Spain.               The first  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples|  to invade Hispania arrived in the 5th  century, as the  |Roman_Empire_decayed|Decline_Of_The_Roman_Empire| .  The  |Visigoths|Visigoths| ,  |Suebi|Suebi| ,  |Vandals|Vandals|  and  |Alans|Alans|  arrived in Spain by crossing the Pyrenees mountain range, leading to the establishment of the  |Suebi_Kingdom|Suebikingdom_In_Gallaecia|  in  |Gallaecia|Gallaecia| , in the northwest, the  |Vandal_Kingdom|Vandalsin_Hispania|  of Vandalusia , and the  |Visigothic_Kingdom|Visigothskingdom_Of_Toledo|  in Toledo. The  |Romanized|Romanization|  Visigoths entered Hispania in 415. After the conversion of their monarchy to  |Roman_Catholicism|Roman_Catholicism|  and after conquering the disordered Suebic territories in the northwest and  |Byzantine|Byzantine_Empire|  territories in the southeast, the Visigothic Kingdom eventually encompassed a great part of the Iberian Peninsula. Roger Collins, Visigothic Spain 409–711     As the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  declined,  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Tribes|  invaded the former empire. Some were  foederati , tribes enlisted to serve in Roman armies, and given land within the empire as payment, while others, such as the  |Vandals|Vandals| , took advantage of the empires weakening defenses to seek plunder within its borders. Those tribes that survived took over existing Roman institutions, and created successor-kingdoms to the Romans in various parts of Europe.  |Iberia|Iberian_Peninsula|  was taken over by the  |Visigoths|Visigoths|  after 410. Karen Eva Carr, Vandals to Visigoths: Rural Settlement Patterns in Early Medieval Spain     At the same time, there was a process of Romanization of the Germanic and  |Hunnic|Hunsunified_Empire_Under_Attila|  tribes settled on both sides of the  limes  . The Visigoths, for example, were converted to  |Arian_Christianity|Arianism|  around 360, even before they were pushed into imperial territory by the expansion of the  |Huns|Huns| .      In the winter of 406, taking advantage of the frozen Rhine, refugees from   |Vandals|Vandals|  and  |Sueves|Sueves| , and the   |Alans|Alans| , fleeing the advancing Huns, invaded the empire in force. Three years later they crossed the  |Pyrenees|Pyrenees|  into  |Iberia|Iberian_Peninsula|  and divided the Western parts, roughly corresponding to modern Portugal and western Spain as far as  |Madrid|Madrid| , between them. p. 14     The Visigoths, having  |sacked_Rome|Sack_Of_Rome|  two years earlier, arrived in the region in 412, founding the Visigothic kingdom of  |Toulouse|Toulouse|  and gradually expanded their influence into the Iberian peninsula at the expense of the Vandals and Alans, who moved on into North Africa without leaving much permanent mark on Hispanic culture. The  |Visigothic_Kingdom|Visigothsvisigothic_Kingdom_In_Hispania|  shifted its capital to  |Toledo|Toledo_Spain|  and reached a high point during the reign of  |Leovigild|Leovigild| .          The  |Visigothic_Kingdom|Visigothic_Kingdom|  conquered all of Hispania and ruled it until the early 8th century, when the peninsula fell to the  |Muslim_conquests|Muslim_Conquests| . The Muslim state in Iberia came to be known as  |Al_Andalus|Al_Andalus| . After a period of Muslim dominance, the  |medieval_history_of_Spain|Medieval_History_Of_Spain|  is dominated by the long Christian  Reconquista  or reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule. The Reconquista gathered momentum during the 12th century, leading to the establishment of the Christian kingdoms of  |Portugal|Kingdom_Of_Portugal| ,  |Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon| ,  |Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile|  and  |Navarre|Kingdom_Of_Navarre|  and by 1250, had reduced Muslim control to the  |Emirate_of_Granada|Emirate_Of_Granada|  in the south-east of the peninsula. Muslim rule in Granada survived until 1492, when it fell to the  |Catholic_Monarchs|Catholic_Monarchs| .     Importantly, Spain never saw a decline in interest in classical culture to the degree observable in Britain, Gaul, Lombardy and Germany. The Visigoths, having assimilated Roman culture during their tenure as foederati, tended to maintain more of the old Roman institutions, and they had a unique respect for legal codes that resulted in continuous frameworks and historical records for most of the period between 415, when Visigothic rule in Spain began, and 711, when it is traditionally said to end. However, during the Visigothic dominion the cultural efforts made by the Franks and other Germanic tribes were not felt in the peninsula, nor achieved in the lesser kingdoms that emerged after the Muslim conquest.        The proximity of the Visigothic kingdoms to the Mediterranean and the continuity of western Mediterranean trade, though in reduced quantity, supported Visigothic culture. Arian Visigothic nobility kept apart from the local Catholic population. The Visigothic ruling class looked to  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  for style and technology while the rivals of Visigothic power and culture were the Catholic bishops – and a brief incursion of Byzantine power in Córdoba.     Spanish Catholic religion also coalesced during this time. The period of rule by the  |Visigothic_Kingdom|Visigothic_Kingdom|  saw the spread of  |Arianism|Arianism|  briefly in Spain. Rhea Marsh Smith, Spain: A Modern History, pp. 16–17. The  |Councils_of_Toledo|Councils_Of_Toledo|  debated creed and liturgy in orthodox  |Catholicism|Catholicism| , and the Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. In 587, the Visigothic king at Toledo,  |Reccared|Reccared| , converted to Catholicism and launched a movement in Spain to unify the various religious doctrines that existed in the land. This put an end to dissension on the question of Arianism.      The Visigoths inherited from Late Antiquity a sort of  |feudal|Feudal|  system in Spain, based in the south on the Roman  |villa|Villa|  system and in the north drawing on their vassals to supply troops in exchange for protection. The bulk of the Visigothic army was composed of slaves, raised from the countryside. The loose council of nobles that advised Spains Visigothic kings and legitimized their rule was responsible for raising the army, and only upon its consent was the king able to summon soldiers.     The impact of Visigothic rule was not widely felt on society at large, and certainly not compared to the vast bureaucracy of the Roman Empire; they tended to rule as barbarians of a mild sort, uninterested in the events of the nation and economy, working for personal benefit, and little literature remains to us from the period. They did not, until the period of Muslim rule, merge with the Spanish population, preferring to remain separate, and indeed the Visigothic language left only the faintest mark on the modern languages of Iberia. Collins, Visigothic Spain 409–711     The most visible effect was the depopulation of the cities as they moved to the countryside. Even while the country enjoyed a degree of prosperity when compared to the famines of France and Germany in this period, the Visigoths felt little reason to contribute to the welfare, permanency, and infrastructure of their people and state. This contributed to their downfall, as they could not count on the loyalty of their subjects when the Moors arrived in the 8th century.     al-Andalus and the Christian Reconquest         The  |Arab_Islamic_conquest|Arab_Islamic_Conquest|  dominated most of North Africa by 710 AD. In 711 an Islamic  |Berber|Berber_People|  conquering party, led by  |Tariq_ibn_Ziyad|Tariq_Ibn_Ziyad| , was sent to Iberia to intervene in a civil war in the  |Visigothic_Kingdom|Visigothic_Kingdom| . Tariqs army contained about 7,000 Berber horsemen, and  |Musa_bin_Nusayr|Musa_Bin_Nusayr|  is said to have sent an additional 5,000 reinforcements after the conquest.  Akhbār majmūa , p. 21 of Spanish translation, p. 6 of Arabic text. Crossing the  |Strait_of_Gibraltar|Strait_Of_Gibraltar| , they won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic King  |Roderic|Roderic|  was defeated and killed on July 19 at the  |Battle_of_Guadalete|Battle_Of_Guadalete| . Tariqs commander, Musa, quickly crossed with Arab reinforcements, and by 718 the  |Muslims|Muslim|  were in control of nearly the whole  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula| . The advance into  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe|  was only stopped in what is now north-central France by the  |West_Germanic|West_Germanic_Languages| |_Franks|Franks|  under  |Charles_Martel|Charles_Martel|  at the  |Battle_of_Tours|Battle_Of_Tours|  in 732.     A decisive victory for the Christians took place at Covadonga, in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, in the summer of 722. In a minor battle known as the  |Battle_of_Covadonga|Battle_Of_Covadonga| , a Muslim force sent to put down the Christian rebels in the northern mountains was defeated by  |Pelagius_of_Asturias|Pelagius_Of_Asturias| , who established the monarchy of the Christian  |Kingdom_of_Asturias|Kingdom_Of_Asturias| . In 739, a rebellion in Galicia, assisted by the Asturians, drove out Muslim forces and it joined the Asturian kingdom. The Kingdom of Asturias became the main base for Christian resistance to Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula for several centuries.      |Caliph|Caliph| |_Al_Walid_I|Al_Walid_I|  had paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the  |Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad_Caliphate|  era . It was this tactic that supported the ultimate expansion to Spain. Caliph Al-Walid Is reign is considered as the apex of Islamic power, though Islamic power in Spain specifically climaxed in the 10th century under  |Abd_ar_Rahman_III|Abd_Ar_Rahman_Iii| .  The rulers of  |Al_Andalus|Al_Andalus|  were granted the rank of  |Emir|Emir|  by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I in  |Damascus|Damascus| . When the  |Abbasids|Abbasid_Caliphate|  overthrew the Umayyad Caliphate,  |Abd_al_Rahman_I|Abd_Al_Rahman_I|  managed to escape to al-Andalus. Once arrived, he declared al-Andalus independent. It is not clear if Abd al-Rahman considered himself to be a rival caliph, perpetuating the Umayyad Caliphate, or merely an independent Emir. The state founded by him is known as the  |Emirate_of_Cordoba|Emirate_Of_Cordoba| . Al-Andalus was rife with internal conflict between the Islamic Umayyad rulers and people and the Christian Visigoth-Roman leaders and people.          The Vikings invaded Galicia in 844, but were heavily defeated by  |Ramiro_I|Ramiro_I_Of_Asturias|  at  |A_Coruña|A_Coruña| . Many of the Vikings casualties were caused by the Galicians  |ballistas|Ballista|  – powerful torsion-powered projectile weapons that looked rather like giant crossbows. 70 Viking ships were captured and burned.   Vikings returned to Galicia in 859, during the reign of  |Ordoño_I|Ordoño_I_Of_Asturias| . Ordoño was at the moment engaged against his constant enemies the Moors; but a count of the province, Don Pedro, attacked the Vikings and defeated them,  destroying 38 of their ships.     In the 10th century  |Abd_ar_Rahman_III|Abd_Ar_Rahman_Iii|  declared the  |Caliphate_of_Córdoba|Caliphate_Of_Córdoba| , effectively breaking all ties with the Egyptian and Syrian caliphs. The Caliphate was mostly concerned with maintaining its power base in North Africa, but these possessions eventually dwindled to the  |Ceuta|Ceuta|  province. The first navy of the Emir of Córdoba was built after the humiliating  |Viking|Viking|  ascent of the  |Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir|  in 844 when they  |sacked_Seville|Viking_Raid_On_Seville| .      In 942, pagan  |Magyars|Magyars| |_raided_northern_Spain|Hungarian_Raid_In_Spain| . Meanwhile, a slow but steady migration of Christian subjects to the northern kingdoms in Christian Hispania was slowly increasing the latters power. Even so, Al-Andalus remained vastly superior to all the northern kingdoms combined in population, economy and military might; and internal conflict between the Christian kingdoms contributed to keep them relatively harmless.     Al-Andalus coincided with  La Convivencia , an era of relative religious tolerance, and with the  |Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_the_Iberian_Peninsula|Golden_Age_Of_Jewish_Culture_In_The_Iberian_Peninsula| . .  by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling,  Jewish Encyclopedia . 1906 ed.     Muslim interest in the peninsula returned in force around the year 1000 when  |Al_Mansur|Almanzor|   sacked Barcelona in 985. Under his son, other Christian cities were subjected to numerous raids.  After his sons death, the caliphate plunged into a  |civil_war|Civil_War|  and splintered into the so-called  |Taifa|Taifa|  Kingdoms . The Taifa kings competed against each other not only in war but also in the protection of the arts, and culture enjoyed a brief upswing.     The Almohads, who had taken control of the Almoravids Maghribi and al-Andalus territories by 1147, surpassed the Almoravides in fundamentalist Islamic outlook, and they treated the non-believer  dhimmi s harshly. Faced with the choice of death, conversion, or emigration, many  |Jews|Jews|  and Christians left.       By the mid-13th century, the  |Emirate_of_Granada|Emirate_Of_Granada|  was the only independent Muslim realm in Spain, which survived  |until_1492|Granada_War|  by becoming a  |vassal_state|Vassal_State|  to Castile, to which it paid  |tribute|Parias| .     The Kings of Aragón ruled territories that consisted of not only the present administrative region of  |Aragon|Aragon|  but also  |Catalonia|Catalonia| , and later the  |Balearic_Islands|Balearic_Islands| ,  |Valencia|Valencia| ,  |Sicily|Sicily| ,  |Naples|Naples|  and  |Sardinia|Sardinia|  . Considered by most to have been the first  |mercenary|Mercenary|  company in Western Europe, the  |Catalan_Company|Catalan_Company|  proceeded to occupy the  |Frankish|Frankish_Greece| |_Duchy_of_Athens|Duchy_Of_Athens| , which they placed under the protection of a prince of the House of Aragon and ruled until 1379.            |Medieval_Spain|Spain_In_The_Middle_Ages|  was the scene of almost constant warfare between Muslims and Christians.     The Taifa kingdoms lost ground to the Christian realms in the north. After the loss of Toledo in 1085, the Muslim rulers reluctantly invited the  |Almoravides|Almoravides| , who invaded Al-Andalus from North Africa and established an empire. In the 12th century the Almoravid empire broke up again, only to be taken over by the  |Almohad|Almohad|  invasion, who were defeated by an alliance of the Christian kingdoms in the decisive  |Battle_of_Las_Navas_de_Tolosa|Battle_Of_Las_Navas_De_Tolosa|  in 1212. By 1250, nearly all of Iberia was back under Christian rule with the exception of the Muslim kingdom of Granada.          In the 13th century, many languages were spoken in the Christian kingdoms of Iberia. These were the Latin-based  |Romance_languages|Romance_Languages|  of  |Castilian|Spanish_Language| ,  |Aragonese|Aragonese_Language| ,  |Catalan|Catalan_Language| ,  |Galician|Galician_Language| ,  |Aranese|Aranese_Language| ,  |Asturian|Asturian_Language| ,  |Leonese|Leonese_Language| , and  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language| , and the ancient  |language_isolate|Language_Isolate|  of  |Basque|Basque_Language| . Throughout the century, Castilian gained a growing prominence in the Kingdom of Castile as the language of culture and communication, at the expense of Leonese and of other close dialects.     One example of this is the oldest preserved Castilian epic poem,  Cantar de Mio Cid , written about the military leader  El Cid . In the last years of the reign of  |Ferdinand_III_of_Castile|Ferdinand_Iii_Of_Castile| , Castilian began to be used for certain types of documents, and it was during the reign of  |Alfonso_X|Alfonso_X_Of_Castile|  that it became the official language. Henceforth all public documents were written in Castilian; likewise all translations were made into Castilian instead of Latin.     At the same time, Catalan and Galician became the standard languages in their respective territories, developing important literary traditions and being the normal languages in which public and private documents were issued: Galician from the 13th to the 16th century in Galicia and nearby regions of Asturias and Leon,  and Catalan from the 12th to the 18th century in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Valencia, where it was known as Valencian. Both languages were later substituted in its official status by Castilian Spanish, till the 20th century.     In the 13th century many universities were founded in León and in Castile. Some, such as the Leonese  |Salamanca|University_Of_Salamanca|  and the Castilian Palencia, were among the earliest universities in Europe.     In 1492, under the  |Catholic_Monarchs|Catholic_Monarchs| , the first edition of the  Grammar of the Castilian Language  by  |Antonio_de_Nebrija|Antonio_De_Nebrija|  was published.                 In the 15th century, the most important among all of the separate Christian kingdoms that made up the old  |Hispania|Hispania|  were the  |Kingdom_of_Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile|  , the  |Kingdom_of_Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon|  , and the  |Kingdom_of_Portugal|Kingdom_Of_Portugal|  occupying the far western Iberian Peninsula. The rulers of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were allied with dynastic families in Portugal, France, and other neighboring kingdoms.     The death of King  |Henry_IV_of_Castile|Henry_Iv_Of_Castile|  in 1474 set off a struggle for power called the  |War_of_the_Castilian_Succession|War_Of_The_Castilian_Succession|  . Contenders for the throne of Castile were Henrys one-time heir  |Joanna_la_Beltraneja|Joanna_La_Beltraneja| , supported by Portugal and France, and Henrys half-sister Queen  |Isabella_I_of_Castile|Isabella_I_Of_Castile| , supported by the Kingdom of Aragon and by the Castilian nobility.     Isabella retained the throne and ruled jointly with her husband,  |King_Ferdinand_II|Ferdinand_Ii_Of_Aragon| . Isabella and Ferdinand had married in 1469 Hugh Thomas, Rivers of Gold p. 18. in  |Valladolid|Valladolid| . Their marriage united both crowns and set the stage for the creation of the Kingdom of Spain, at the dawn of the modern era. That union, however, was a union in title only, as each region retained its own political and judicial structure. Pursuant to an agreement signed by Isabella and Ferdinand on January 15, 1474, Hugh Thomas, Rivers of Gold, p. 21. Isabella held more authority over the newly unified Spain than her husband, although their rule was shared. Together, Isabella of  |Castile|Crown_Of_Castile|  and Ferdinand of  |Aragon|Crown_Of_Aragon|  were known as the Catholic Monarchs , a title bestowed on them by  |Pope_Alexander_VI|Pope_Alexander_Vi| .          The monarchs oversaw the final stages of the  |Reconquista|Reconquista|  of  |Iberian|Iberian_Peninsula|  territory from the  |Moors|Moors|  with the conquest of  |Granada|Granada| , conquered the  |Canary_Islands|Canary_Islands| , and expelled the Jews from  |Spain|Spain|  under the  |Alhambra_Decree|Alhambra_Decree| .   Although until the 13th century religious minorities had enjoyed considerable tolerance in Castile and Aragon – the only Christian kingdoms where Jews were not restricted from any professional occupation – the situation of the Jews collapsed over the 14th century, reaching a climax in 1391 with large scale massacres in every major city except  |Ávila|Ávila_Spain| .     Over the next century, half of the estimated 80,000  |Spanish_Jews|Spanish_Jews|  converted to Christianity . The final step was taken by the Catholic Monarchs, who, in 1492, ordered the remaining Jews to convert or face expulsion from Spain. Depending on different sources, the number of Jews actually expelled, traditionally estimated at 120,000 people, is now believed to have numbered about 40,000. There would be more to follow as Spanish monarchs extended the expulsion decrees to their territories on the Italian peninsula, including  |Sicily|Sicily|  ,  |Naples|Naples|  , and  |Milan|Milan|  .      Over the following decades, Muslims faced the same fate; and about 60 years after the Jews, they were also compelled to convert  or be expelled. In the early 17th century, the converts were also expelled. Jews and Muslims were not the only people to be persecuted during this time period. All  |Roma_|Roma_In_Spain|  males between the ages of 18 and 26 were forced to serve in  |galleys|Galley|  – which was equivalent to a death sentence – but the majority managed to hide and avoid arrest.     Isabella ensured long-term political stability in Spain by arranging strategic marriages for each of her five children. Her firstborn, a daughter named  |Isabella|Isabella_Of_Asturias| , married  |Afonso_of_Portugal|Afonso_Prince_Of_Portugal| , forging important ties between these two neighboring countries and hopefully ensuring future alliance, but Isabella soon died before giving birth to an heir.  |Juana|Joanna_Of_Castile| , Isabellas second daughter, married into the  |Habsburg_dynasty|Habsburg_Dynasty|  when she wed  |Philip_the_Fair|Philip_The_Handsome| , the son of  |Maximilian_I|Maximilian_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , King of Bohemia and likely heir to the crown of the  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| .     This ensured an alliance with the Habsburgs and the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , a powerful, far-reaching territory that assured Spains future political security. Isabellas only son,  |Juan|Juan_Prince_Of_Asturias| , married  |Margaret_of_Austria|Margaret_Of_Austria_Duchess_Of_Savoy| , further strengthening ties with the Habsburg dynasty. Isabellas fourth child,  |Maria|Maria_Of_Aragon_Queen_Of_Portugal| , married  |Manuel_I_of_Portugal|Manuel_I_Of_Portugal| , strengthening the link forged by her older sisters marriage. Her fifth child,  |Catherine|Catherine_Of_Aragon| , married King  |Henry_VIII_of_England|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  and was mother to Queen  |Mary_I_of_England|Mary_I_Of_England| .                The Castilian conquest of the  |Canary_Islands|Canary_Islands| , inhabited by Guanche people, took place between 1402  and 1496 . Two periods can be distinguished in this process: the noble conquest, carried out by the nobility in exchange for a pact of vassalage, and the royal conquest, carried out directly by the Crown, during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs.  By 1520, European military technology combined with the devastating epidemics such as bubonic plague and pneumonia brought by the Castilians and enslavement and deportation of natives led to the extinction of the Guanches.   Isabella and  |Ferdinand|Ferdinand_Vii_Of_Spain|  authorized the 1492 expedition of  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| , who became the first known European to reach the  |New_World|New_World|  since  |Leif_Ericson|Leif_Ericson| . This and subsequent expeditions led to an influx of wealth into Spain, supplementing income from within Castile for the state that would prove to be a dominant power of Europe for the next two centuries.     Spain established colonies in North Africa that ranged from the Atlantic Moroccan coast to  |Tripoli|Tripoli|  in Libya.  |Melilla|Melilla|  was occupied in 1497,  |Oran|Oran|  in 1509,  |Larache|Larache|  in 1610, and  |Ceuta|Ceuta|  was annexed from the Portuguese in 1668. Today, both Ceuta and Melilla still remain under Spanish control, together with smaller islets known as the  presidio s menores .                The Spanish Empire was the first  |global_empire|Global_Empire| . It was also one of the  |largest_empires|List_Of_Largest_Empires|  in world history. In the 16th century, Spain and Portugal were in the vanguard of European global exploration and colonial expansion. The two kingdoms on the conquest and Iberian Peninsula competed with each other in opening of trade routes across the oceans. Spanish imperial conquest and colonization began with the  |Canary_Islands|Canary_Islands|  in 1312 and 1402. Hugh Thomas, Rivers of Gold, p. 58. which began the  |Castilian_conquest|Canary_Islandscastilian_Conquest|  of the Canary Islands, completed in 1495.      In the 15th and 16th centuries, trade flourished across the Atlantic between Spain and the Americas and across the Pacific between East Asia and Mexico via the Philippines. Spanish  |Conquistadors|Conquistador| , operating privately, deposed the  |Aztec|Aztec| ,  |Inca|Inca_Empire|  and  |Maya|Maya_Civilization|  governments with extensive help from local factions and took control of vast stretches of land. Henry Kamen, Empire: how Spain became a world power, 1492-1763 pp 95-96     This New World empire was at first a disappointment, as the natives had little to trade. Diseases such as smallpox and measles that arrived with the colonizers devastated the native populations, especially in the densely populated regions of the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations, and this reduced the economic potential of conquered areas. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas vary but possibly stood at 100 million—one fifth of humanity in 1492. Between 1500 and 1600 the population of the Americas was halved. In Mexico alone, it has been estimated that the pre-conquest population of around 25 million people was reduced within 80 years to about 1.3 million.     In the 1520s, large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexicos  |Guanajuato|Guanajuato|  began to be greatly augmented by the silver mines in Mexicos  |Zacatecas|Zacatecas|  and Bolivias  |Potosí|Potosí|  from 1546. These silver shipments re-oriented the Spanish economy, leading to the importation of luxuries and grain. The resource-rich colonies of Spain thus caused large cash inflows for the country.  They also became indispensable in financing the military capability of  |Habsburg_Spain|Habsburg_Spain|  in its long series of European and North African wars, though, with the exception of a few years in the 17th century, Taxes in Castile were the most important source of revenue.      Spain enjoyed a  |cultural_golden_age|Spanish_Golden_Age|  in the 16th and 17th centuries. For a time, the Spanish Empire dominated the oceans with its experienced  |navy|Spanish_Navy|  and ruled the European battlefield with its fearsome and well trained infantry, the famous .     The financial burden within the peninsula was on the backs of the peasant class while the nobility enjoyed an increasingly lavish lifestyle. From the time beginning with the incorporation of the  |Portuguese_Empire|Portuguese_Empire|  in 1580 until the loss of its American colonies in the 19th century, Spain maintained one of the largest empires in the world even though it suffered military and economic misfortunes from the 1640s.     Religion played a very strong role in the spread of the Spanish empire. The thought that Spain could bring Christianity to the New World and protect Catholicism in Europe certainly played a strong role in the expansion of Spains empire. Raymond Carr, ed., Spain: A History pp 116-72.            Spains world empire reached its greatest territorial extent in the late 18th century but it was under the  |Habsburg|Habsburg|  dynasty in the 16th and 17th centuries it reached the peak of its power and declined. The  |Iberian_Union|Iberian_Union|  with Portugal meant that the monarch of Castile was also the monarch of Portugal, but they were ruled as separate entities both on the peninsula and in Spanish America and Brazil. In 1640, the  |House_of_Braganza|House_Of_Braganza|  revolted against Spanish rule and reasserted Portugals independence. Lockhart, James and Stuart Schwartz, Early Latin America. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, p. 250     When Spains first Habsburg ruler  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_Spain|  became king of Spain in 1516, Spain became central to the dynastic struggles of Europe. After he became king of Spain, Charles also became  |Charles_V_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Charles_V_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and because of his widely scattered domains was not often in Spain.     In 1556 Charles abdicated from his positions, giving his Spanish empire to his only surviving son,  |Philip_II_of_Spain|Philip_Ii_Of_Spain| , and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother, Ferdinand. Philip treated Castile as the foundation of his empire, but the population of Castile was never large enough to provide the soldiers needed to support the Empire. His marriage to  |Mary_Tudor|Mary_I_Of_England|  allied England with Spain.            In the 1560s, plans to consolidate control of the Netherlands led to unrest, which gradually led to the  |Calvinist|Calvinism|  leadership of the revolt and the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War| . The Dutch armies waged a war of  |maneuver|Maneuver_Warfare|  and  |siege|Siege| , successfully avoiding  |set_piece_battles|Pitched_Battle| . This conflict consumed much Spanish expenditure during the later 16th century. Other extremely expensive failures included an attempt to invade Protestant England in 1588 that produced the worst military disaster in Spanish history when the  |Spanish_Armada|Spanish_Armada| —costing 10 million ducats—was scattered by a freak storm. Over 8,000 English sailors died from diseases such as dysentery and typhus while the Spanish Armada was at sea.     Economic and administrative problems multiplied in  |Castile|Castile| , and the weakness of the native economy became evident in the following century. Rising  |inflation|Price_Revolution| , financially draining wars in Europe, the ongoing aftermath of the  |expulsion_of_the_Jews|Expulsion_Of_Jews_From_Spain|  and Moors from Spain, and Spains growing dependency on the silver imports, combined to cause several bankruptcies that caused economic crisis in the country, especially in heavily burdened Castile. The  |great_plague|Great_Plague_Of_Seville|  of 1596–1602 killed 600,000 to 700,000 people, or about 10% of the population. Altogether more than 1,250,000 deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.  Economically, the plague destroyed the labor force as well as creating a psychological blow to an already problematic Spain.  |J_H_Elliott|J_H_Elliott| , Imperial Spain: 1469–1716 , Penguin Books, 1970, p.298          Siglo de Oroin Spanish,  Siglo de Oro now Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America |Philip_III|Philip_Iii_Of_Spain| ,  |Philip_IV|Philip_Iv_Of_Spain|  and  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_Spain| 20101557, 1560, 1576, 1596Nov. 197819811598–1621reigned 1621–651618–1648 |35–|35–| 1952 |35–|35–| 16591667–68royal fifth5th ed. 1978as Philip V19622001 |ropean_histo|Ropean_Histo| 19891973Sep., 19431733–351740–481746–591759–881756–631775–831788 to abdication in 1808 |ancisco_Bayeu_Museo_del_Pra|Ancisco_Bayeu_Museo_Del_Pra| 1676–1764197319701988they in turn believed Napoleon was the devilOsprey Men-at-Arms, 19751806 and 18071951Peninsular War1986informally named La Pepa2nd ed. 19861994and the United Statescalled peninsulares called creoles 2nd ed., 198220001820–23 |sbe|Sbe| 1833–391836 |a|A| |opp|Opp| 1833–68SpainProgressive Party |a|A| 1857–631861–62 |Laurentphotograph|Laurentphotograph| |a|A| 11 February 18731873–741873–741977 |a|A| 1979formally the Liberal-Conservativesthe mastermind behind the Restoration systemor liberal-fusionists turnismo materialized in the so-called  caciquismo 197919921999romanonistasprietistasin joint action with France1925–2619752006his government was known as the  dictablanda 2nd ed 19821974CEDA1974backed among other by traditionalist  |Carlists|Carlist| , Fascist  |falangists|Falangism|  and Far-right  |alfonsists|Alfonsism| with a variable support of Socialists, Liberals, Communists, Anarchists and Catalan and Basque nationaliststhe Nationalists the Nationalists Republicans 1970 |a|A| CNTFAIsuch as the Falange19821999 |a|A| |tonomous_communi|Tonomous_Communi| |inti|Inti| 2nd ed. 20072007 |_de_|De| executions and hunger or illness in prisonsFalange |ch|Ch| the  |Spanish_miracle|Spanish_Miracle| 200919971978 |Andalusia|Andalusia| ,  |Aragon|Aragon| ,  |Asturias|Asturias| ,  |Balearic_Islands|Balearic_Islands| ,  |Canary_Islands|Canary_Islands| ,  |Cantabria|Cantabria| ,  |Castile_and_León|Castile_And_León| ,  |Castile–La_Mancha|Castile–La_Mancha| ,  |Catalonia|Catalonia| ,  |Extremadura|Extremadura| ,  |Galicia|Galicia| ,  |La_Rioja|La_Rioja| ,  |Community_of_Madrid|Community_Of_Madrid| ,  |Region_of_Murcia|Region_Of_Murcia| ,  |Basque_Country|Basque_Country| ,  |Valencian_Community|Valencian_Community| , and  |Navarre|Navarre| |Ceuta|Ceuta|  and  |Melilla|Melilla| Spain |a|A| EEC, now  |European_Union|European_Union| |paratist_gro|Paratist_Gro| .
