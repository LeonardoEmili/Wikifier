              Hanyu Pinyin , often abbreviated to pinyin, is the official  |romanization|Romanization|  system for  |Standard_Chinese|Standard_Chinese|  in  |mainland_China|Mainland_China|  and to some extent in  |Taiwan|Taiwan| . It is often used to teach  |Standard_Mandarin_Chinese|Standard_Chinese| , which is normally written using  |Chinese_characters|Chinese_Characters| . The system includes four  |diacritics|Diacritic|  denoting  |tones|Tone| . Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell  |Chinese_names|Chinese_Name|  and words in languages written with the  |Latin_alphabet|Latin_Alphabet|  and also in certain computer  |input_methods|Input_Method|  to enter Chinese characters.     The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by many linguists, including  |Zhou_Youguang|Zhou_Youguang| ,  based on earlier forms of  |romanizations_of_Chinese|Romanization_Of_Chinese| . It was published by the  |Chinese_government|Government_Of_China|  in 1958 and revised several times.  The  |International_Organization_for_Standardization|International_Organization_For_Standardization|  adopted pinyin as an  |international_standard|International_Standard|  in 1982,  and was followed by the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  in 1986. The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009, where it is used for international events rather than for educational or computer-input purposes.   But some cities, businesses, and organizations, notably in the south of Taiwan, did not accept this, as it suggested that Taiwan is more closely tied to the  |PRC|Prc|  , so it remains one of several rival  |romanization_systems_in_use|Chinese_Language_Romanization_In_Taiwan| .
