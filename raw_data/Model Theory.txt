     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , model theory is the study of classes of mathematical  |structures|Structure|   from the perspective of  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic| . The objects of study are models of  |theories|Theory|  in a  |formal_language|Formal_Language| . A set of  |sentences|Sentence|  in a  |formal_language|Formal_Language|  is one of the components that form a theory. A model of a theory is a structure  that satisfies the sentences of that theory.     Model theory recognizes and is intimately concerned with a duality: it examines  |semantical|Semantics|  elements by means of  |syntactical|Syntax|  elements of a corresponding language: in a summary definition, dating from 1973,   : |universal_algebra|Universal_Algebra|  +  |logic|Logic|  model theory. Chang and Keisler,      Model theory developed rapidly during the 1990s, and a more modern definition is provided by  |Wilfrid_Hodges|Wilfrid_Hodges|  :     :model theory  |algebraic_geometry|Algebraic_Geometry|  −  |fields|Field| .     Other nearby areas of mathematics include  |combinatorics|Combinatorics| ,  |number_theory|Number_Theory| ,  |arithmetic_dynamics|Arithmetic_Dynamics| ,  |analytic_functions|Analytic_Functions| , and  |non_standard_analysis|Non_Standard_Analysis| .     In a similar way to  |proof_theory|Proof_Theory| , model theory is situated in an area of  |interdisciplinarity|Interdisciplinarity|  among  |mathematics|Mathematics| ,  |philosophy|Philosophy| , and  |computer_science|Computer_Science| . The most prominent professional organization in the field of model theory is the  |Association_for_Symbolic_Logic|Association_For_Symbolic_Logic| .         This article focuses on  |finitary|Finitary| |_first_order|First_Order_Logic|  model theory of infinite structures.  |Finite_model_theory|Finite_Model_Theory| , which concentrates on finite structures, diverges significantly from the study of infinite structures in both the problems studied and the techniques used. Model theory in  |higher_order_logics|Higher_Order_Logic|  or  |infinitary_logics|Infinitary_Logic|  is hampered by the fact that  |completeness|Gödels_Completeness_Theorem|  and  |compactness|Compactness_Theorem|  do not in general hold for these logics. However, a great deal of study has also been done in such logics.     Informally, model theory can be divided into classical model theory, model theory applied to groups and fields, and geometric model theory. A missing subdivision is  |computable_model_theory|Computable_Model_Theory| , but this can arguably be viewed as an independent subfield of logic.     Examples of early theorems from classical model theory include  |Gödels_completeness_theorem|Gödels_Completeness_Theorem| , the upward and downward  |Löwenheim–Skolem_theorems|Löwenheim–Skolem_Theorem| ,  |Vaughts|Robert_Lawson_Vaught|  two-cardinal theorem,  |Scotts|Dana_Scott|  isomorphism theorem, the  |omitting_types_theorem|Omitting_Types_Theorem| , and the  |Ryll_Nardzewski_theorem|Ryll_Nardzewski_Theorem| . Examples of early results from model theory applied to fields are  |Tarskis|Alfred_Tarski| |_elimination_of_quantifiers|Quantifier_Elimination|  for  |real_closed_fields|Real_Closed_Fields| ,  |Axs|James_Ax|  theorem on  |pseudo_finite_fields|Pseudo_Finite_Field| , and  |Robinsons|Abraham_Robinson|  development of  |non_standard_analysis|Non_Standard_Analysis| . An important step in the evolution of classical model theory occurred with the birth of  |stability_theory|Stable_Theory|  , which developed a calculus of independence and rank based on syntactical conditions satisfied by theories.     During the last several decades applied model theory has repeatedly merged with the more pure stability theory. The result of this synthesis is called geometric model theory in this article . An example of a proof from geometric model theory is  |Hrushovskis|Ehud_Hrushovski|  proof of the  |Mordell–Lang_conjecture|Mordell_Lang_Conjecture|  for function fields. The ambition of geometric model theory is to provide a geography of mathematics by embarking on a detailed study of definable sets in various mathematical structures, aided by the substantial tools developed in the study of pure model theory.            Fundamental concepts in universal algebra are  |signatures|Signature|  σ and σ-algebras. Since these concepts are formally defined in the article on  |structures|Structure| , the present article is an informal introduction which consists of examples of the way these terms are used.     :The standard signature of rings is σ ring , where × and + are  |binary|Binary_Operation| , − is  |unary|Unary_Operation| , and 0 and 1 are  |nullary|Nullary| .   :The standard signature of semirings is σ smr , where the arities are as above.   :The standard signature of groups is σ grp , where × is binary, −1 is unary and 1 is nullary.   :The standard signature of monoids is σ mnd .   :A  |ring|Ring|  is a σ ring -structure which satisfies the identities         and    :A  |group|Group|  is a σ grp -structure which satisfies the  |identities|Identity|      and    :A  |monoid|Monoid|  is a σ mnd -structure which satisfies the identities   and    :A  |semigroup|Semigroup|  is a -structure which satisfies the identity    :A  |magma|Magma|  is just a -structure.     This is a very efficient way to define most classes of  |algebraic_structures|Algebraic_Structure| , because there is also the concept of σ- |homomorphism|Structure_Homomorphisms_And_Embeddings| , which correctly specializes to the usual notions of homomorphism for groups, semigroups, magmas and rings. For this to work, the signature must be chosen well.     Terms such as the σ ring -term t given by  are used to define identities  but also to construct  |free_algebras|Free_Object| . An  |equational_class|Variety|  is a class of structures which, like the examples above and many others, is defined as the class of all σ-structures which satisfy a certain set of identities.  |Birkhoffs_theorem|Birkhoffs_Hsp_Theorem|  states:     :A class of σ-structures is an equational class if and only if it is not empty and closed under subalgebras, homomorphic images, and direct products.     An important non-trivial tool in universal algebra are  |ultraproducts|Ultraproduct|    , where I is an infinite set indexing a system of σ-structures A i , and U is an  |ultrafilter|Ultrafilter|  on I.     While model theory is generally considered a part of  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic| , universal algebra, which grew out of  |Alfred_North_Whiteheads|Alfred_North_Whitehead|  work on  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , is part of  |algebra|Algebra| . This is reflected by their respective  |MSC|Mathematics_Subject_Classification|  classifications. Nevertheless, model theory can be seen as an extension of universal algebra.              Finite model theory is the area of model theory which has the closest ties to  |universal_algebra|Universal_Algebra| . Like some parts of universal algebra, and in contrast with the other areas of model theory, it is mainly concerned with  |finite|Finite_Set|  algebras, or more generally, with finite σ- |structures|Structure|  for signatures σ which may contain relation symbols as in the following example:     :The standard signature for graphs is σ grph , where E is a binary relation symbol.   :A  |graph|Simple_Graph|  is a σ grph -structure satisfying the sentence   u   v .     A σ-homomorphism is a map that commutes with the operations and preserves the relations in σ. This definition gives rise to the usual notion of  |graph_homomorphism|Graph_Homomorphism| , which has the interesting property that a bijective homomorphism need not be invertible. Structures are also a part of universal algebra; after all, some  |algebraic_structures|Algebraic_Structure|  such as ordered groups have a binary relation  .
