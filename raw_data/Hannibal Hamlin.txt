      Hannibal Hamlin was an American attorney and politician from the state of  |Maine|Maine| . In a public service career that spanned over 50 years, he served as the 15th  |vice_president_of_the_United_States|Vice_President_Of_The_United_States| . The first  |Republican|Republican_Party|  to hold the office, Hamlin served from 1861 to 1865. He is considered among the most influential politicians to have come from Maine.     A native of  |Paris,_Maine|Paris,_Maine|  , Hamlin managed his fathers farm before becoming a newspaper editor. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1833, and began to practice in  |Hampden,_Maine|Hampden,_Maine| . Originally a  |Democrat|Democratic_Party| , Hamlin began his political career with election to the Maine House of Representatives in 1835 and an appointment to the military staff of the  |Governor_of_Maine|Governor_Of_Maine| . As an officer in the militia, he took part in the 1839 negotiations that helped end the  |Aroostook_War|Aroostook_War| . In the 1840s Hamlin was elected and served in the  |United_States_House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives| . In 1848 the state house elected him to the  |United_States_Senate|United_States_Senate| , where he served until January 1857. He served temporarily as governor for six weeks in the beginning of 1857, after which he returned to the Senate. Hamlin was an active opponent of slavery; he supported the  |Wilmot_Proviso|Wilmot_Proviso|  and opposed the  |Compromise_Measures_of_1850|Compromise_Measures_Of_1850| . In 1854, he strongly opposed passage of the  |Kansas–Nebraska_Act|Kansas–Nebraska_Act| . Hamlins increasingly anti-slavery views caused him to leave the Democratic Party for the newly formed Republican Party in 1856.     In 1860, Hamlin was the Republican nominee for Vice President; selected to run with  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln| , who was from Illinois, Hamlin was chosen in part to bring geographic balance to the ticket and in part because as a former Democrat, he could work to convince other anti-slavery Democrats that their future lay with the Republican Party. The Lincoln and Hamlin ticket was successful, and Hamlin served as Vice President from 1861 to 1865, which included all but the last month of the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War| . The first Republican Vice President, Hamlin held the office in an era when the office was considered more a part of the legislative branch than the executive; he was not personally close to Lincoln and did not play a major role in his administration. Even so, Hamlin supported the administrations legislative program in his role as presiding officer of the Senate, and he looked for other ways to demonstrate his support for the Union, including a term of service in a  |Maine_militia_unit|Maine_State_Guard|  during the war.     For the 1864 election, Hamlin was replaced as Vice Presidential nominee by  |Andrew_Johnson|Andrew_Johnson| , a  |Southern_Democrat|Southern_Democrat|  chosen for his appeal to  |Southern_Unionists|Southern_Unionists| . After leaving the vice presidency, Hamlin served as  |Collector|Boston_Custom_House|  of the  |Port_of_Boston|Port_Of_Boston| , a lucrative post to which he was appointed by Johnson after the latter succeeded to the presidency following Lincolns assassination. However, Hamlin later resigned as Collector because of his disagreement with Johnson over  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era|  of the former Confederacy.     In 1869, Hamlin was elected again to the U.S. Senate, and he served two terms. After leaving the Senate in 1881, he served briefly as  |United_States_Ambassador_to_Spain|United_States_Ambassador_To_Spain|  before returning to Maine in late 1882. In retirement, Hamlin was a resident of  |Bangor,_Maine|Bangor,_Maine| , where he died in 1891. He was buried at  |Mount_Hope_Cemetery|Mount_Hope_Cemetery|  in Bangor.            Hamlin was born to Cyrus Hamlin and his wife Anna, née Livermore, in  |Paris|Paris,_Maine|  . He was a descendant in the sixth generation of English colonist James Hamlin, who had settled in the  |Massachusetts_Bay_Colony|Massachusetts_Bay_Colony|  in 1639. He was a grandnephew of U.S. Senator  |Samuel_Livermore|Samuel_Livermore|  II  of New Hampshire.     Hamlin attended the district schools and  |Hebron_Academy|Hebron_Academy|  and later managed his fathers farm. From 1827 to 1830 he published the Oxford Jeffersonian newspaper in partnership with  |Horatio_King|Horatio_King| .      He studied law with the firm headed by  |Samuel_Fessenden|Samuel_Fessenden| ,  was admitted to the bar in 1833, and began practicing in  |Hampden,_Maine|Hampden,_Maine| , where he lived until 1848.          Hamlin married Sarah Jane Emery of Paris Hill in 1833. Her father was  |Stephen_Emery|Maine_Attorney_General| , who was appointed as Maines Attorney General in 1839–1840.  Hamlin and Sarah had four children together: George, Charles, Cyrus and Sarah.     His wife died in 1855. The next year, Hamlin married her half-sister,  |Ellen_Vesta_Emery|Ellen_Vesta_Emery|  in 1856. They had two children together: Hannibal E. and Frank. Ellen Hamlin died in 1925.        Hamlins political career began in 1835, when he was elected to the  |Maine_House_of_Representatives|Maine_House_Of_Representatives| . Appointed a  |Major|Major|  on the staff of Governor  |John_Fairfield|John_Fairfield| , he served with the militia in the bloodless  |Aroostook_War|Aroostook_War|  of 1839. He facilitated negotiations between Fairfield and Lieutenant Governor  |John_Harvey|John_Harvey|  of  |New_Brunswick|New_Brunswick| , which helped reduce tensions and make possible the  |Webster–Ashburton_Treaty|Webster–Ashburton_Treaty| , which ended the war.     Hamlin unsuccessfully ran for the  |United_States_House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives|  in 1840 and left the State House in 1841. He later was elected to two terms in the  |United_States_House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives| , serving from 1843 to 1847. He was elected by the state legislature to fill a  |U.S._Senate|U.S._Senate|  vacancy in 1848, and to a full term in 1851. A  |Democrat|Democratic_Party|  at the beginning of his career, Hamlin supported the candidacy of  |Franklin_Pierce|Franklin_Pierce|  in 1852.     From the very beginning of his service in Congress, Hamlin was prominent as an opponent of the extension of slavery. He was a conspicuous supporter of the  |Wilmot_Proviso|Wilmot_Proviso|  and spoke against the  |Compromise_Measures_of_1850|Compromise_Measures_Of_1850| . In 1854, Hamlin strongly opposed the passage of the  |Kansas–Nebraska_Act|Kansas–Nebraska_Act| , which repealed the  |Missouri_Compromise|Missouri_Compromise| . After the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  endorsed that repeal at the  |1856_Democratic_National_Convention|1856_Democratic_National_Convention| , on June 12, 1856, he withdrew from the Democratic Party and joined the newly organized  |Republican_Party|History_Of_The_United_States_Republican_Party| , causing a national sensation.     The Republicans nominated Hamlin for  |Governor_of_Maine|Governor_Of_Maine|  in the same year. He carried the election by a large majority and was inaugurated on January 8, 1857. In the latter part of February 1857, however, he resigned the governorship. He returned to the  |United_States_Senate|United_States_Senate| , serving from 1857 to January 1861.            Hamlin was nominated by the Republican Party to serve as  |Vice_President_of_the_United_States|Vice_President_Of_The_United_States|  in the  |1860_presidential_election|1860_United_States_Presidential_Election|  on a ticket with former Representative  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln| .  Given that Lincoln was from Illinois, a vice presidential nominee from  |Maine|Maine|  made sense in terms of regional balance. As a former Democrat, Hamlin could persuade other anti-slavery Democrats that joining the Republican Party was the only way to ensure slaverys demise.     Hamlin and Lincoln were not close personally but had a good working relationship. At the time, the Vice President was part of the legislative branch in his role as President of the Senate and did not attend cabinet meetings; Hamlin did not regularly visit the White House.  |Mary_Todd_Lincoln|Mary_Todd_Lincoln|  and Hamlin disliked each other. For his part, Hamlin complained, I am only a fifth wheel of a coach and can do little for my friends.      He had little influence in the Lincoln Administration, although he urged both the  |Emancipation_Proclamation|Emancipation_Proclamation|   and the arming of  |Black_Americans|Black_Americans| .  He strongly supported  |Joseph_Hookers|Joseph_Hooker|  appointment as commander of the  |Army_of_the_Potomac|Army_Of_The_Potomac| ,  which ended in failure at the  |Battle_of_Chancellorsville|Battle_Of_Chancellorsville| .      Beginning in 1860, Hamlin was a member of Company A of the  |Maine_State_Guard|Maine_State_Guard| , a  |militia|Militia|  unit.  When the company was called up in the summer of 1864, Hamlin was told that because of his position as Vice President, he did not have to take part in the muster. He opted to serve, arguing that he could set an example by doing the duty expected of any citizen, and the only concession made because of his office was that he was quartered with the officers. He reported to  |Fort_McClary|Fort_Mcclary|  in July, initially taking part in routine assignments including guard duty, and later taking over as the company cook. He was promoted to  |corporal|Corporalunited_States|  during his service, and mustered out with the rest of his unit in mid-September.       In June 1864, the Republicans and  |War_Democrats|War_Democrat|  joined to form the  |National_Union_Party|National_Union_Party| . Although Lincoln was renominated, War Democrat  |Andrew_Johnson|Andrew_Johnson|  of Tennessee was named to replace Hamlin as Lincolns running mate. Lincoln was seeking to broaden his base of support and was also looking ahead to Southern  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era_Of_The_United_States| , at which Johnson had proven himself adept as military governor of occupied Tennessee. Hamlin, by contrast, was an ally of the Northern  |Radical_Republicans|Radical_Republicans|  . Lincoln and Johnson were elected in November 1864, and Hamlins term expired on March 4, 1865.     After leaving the vice presidency Hamlin served briefly as  |Collector|Boston_Custom_House|  of the  |Port_of_Boston|Port_Of_Boston| . Appointed to the post by Johnson, Hamlin resigned in protest over Johnsons  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era|  policy and accompanying efforts to build a political following loyal to him after he had been repudiated by the Republicans. Republicans had supported Johnson as part of the National Union ticket during the war, but opposed him after he became President and his position on Reconstruction deviated from theirs.      Although Hamlin narrowly missed becoming President, his vice presidency would usher in a half-century of sustained national influence for the  |Maine_Republican_Party|Maine_Republican_Party| . In the period 1861–1911, Maine Republicans occupied the offices of Vice President,  |Secretary_of_the_Treasury|United_States_Secretary_Of_The_Treasury|  ,  |Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| ,  |President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate|President_Pro_Tempore_Of_The_United_States_Senate| ,  |Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives|Speaker_Of_The_United_States_House_Of_Representatives|  , and would field a presidential nominee in  |James_G._Blaine|James_G._Blaine| , a level of influence in national politics unmatched by subsequent Maine political delegations.       Not content with private life, Hamlin returned to the U.S. Senate in 1869 to serve two more 6-year terms before declining to run for re-election in 1880 because of an ailing heart. His last duty as a public servant came in 1881 when  |Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| |James_G._Blaine|James_G._Blaine|  convinced President  |James_A._Garfield|James_A._Garfield|  to name Hamlin as  |United_States_Ambassador_to_Spain|United_States_Ambassador_To_Spain| . Hamlin received the appointment on June 30, 1881, and held the post until October 17, 1882.     Upon returning from Spain, Hamlin retired from public life to his home in  |Bangor,_Maine|Bangor,_Maine| , which he had purchased in 1851. The  |Hannibal_Hamlin_House|Hannibal_Hamlin_House|  – as it is known today – is located in central Bangor at 15 5th Street; incorporating  |Victorian|Victorian_Architecture| ,  |Italianate|Italianate_Architecture| , and  |Mansard|Mansard_Roof| -style architecture, the mansion was posted to the  |National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National_Register_Of_Historic_Places|  in 1979.      Hamlin was elected as a Third Class Companion of the  |Military_Order_of_the_Loyal_Legion_of_the_United_States|Military_Order_Of_The_Loyal_Legion_Of_The_United_States| . Third Class was the MOLLUS division created to recognize civilians who had contributed outstanding service to the Union during the war.         On  |Independence_Day|Independence_Day| , July 4, 1891, Hamlin collapsed and fell unconscious while playing cards at the Tarratine Club he founded in downtown Bangor. He was then placed on one of the clubs couches and died a few hours later. He was 81. The couch is preserved at the  |Bangor_Public_Library|Bangor_Public_Library| .  Hannibal Hamlin was buried in the Hamlin family plot at  |Mount_Hope_Cemetery|Mount_Hope_Cemetery|  in  |Bangor,_Maine|Bangor,_Maine| .

Hamlin had four sons who grew to adulthood:  |Charles_Hamlin|Charles_Hamlin| ,  |Cyrus_Hamlin|Cyrus_Hamlin| ,  |Hannibal_Emery|Hannibal_E._Hamlin|  and Frank Hamlin. Charles and Cyrus served in the Union forces during the  |Civil_War|American_Civil_War| , both becoming generals, Charles by  |brevet|Brevet| . Cyrus was among the first Union officers to argue for the enlistment of black troops, and himself commanded a brigade of freedmen in the Mississippi River campaign.
