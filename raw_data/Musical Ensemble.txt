             A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform  |instrumental|Instrumental_Music|  or  |vocal_music|Vocal_Music| , with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the  |jazz_quartet|Jazz_Quartet|  or the  |orchestra|Orchestra| . Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as  |choirs|Choir|  and  |doo_wop|Doo_Wop|  groups. In both  |popular_music|Popular_Music|  and  |classical_music|Classical_Music| , there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the  |rock_band|Band|  or the Baroque chamber group for  |basso_continuo|Basso_Continuo|   and one or more singers. In  |classical_music|Classical_Music| , trios or quartets either blend the sounds of  |musical_instrument|Musical_Instrument|  families  or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles  or wind ensembles . Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the  |orchestra|Orchestra| , which uses a  |string_section|String_Section| ,  |brass_instruments|Brass_Instrument| ,  |woodwinds|Woodwind|  and  |percussion_instruments|Percussion_Instrument| , or the  |concert_band|Concert_Band| , which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.     In jazz ensembles or combos, the instruments typically include wind instruments , one or two chordal comping instruments , a  |bass_instrument|Bass_Instrument|  , and a drummer or percussionist. Jazz ensembles may be solely instrumental, or they may consist of a group of instruments accompanying one or more singers. In rock and pop ensembles, usually called  rock bands  or pop bands, there are usually guitars and keyboards , one or more singers, and a  |rhythm_section|Rhythm_Section|  made up of a  |bass_guitar|Bass_Guitar|  and  |drum_kit|Drum_Kit| .     Music ensembles typically have a leader. In jazz bands, rock and pop groups and similar ensembles, this is the  |band_leader|Band_Leader| . In classical music, orchestras, concert bands and choirs are led by a  |conductor|Conducting| . In orchestra, the  |concertmaster|Concertmaster|  is the instrumentalist leader of the orchestra. In orchestras, the individual sections also have leaders, typically called the principal of the section . Conductors are also used in  |jazz|Jazz| |big_bands|Big_Band|  and in some very large rock or pop ensembles .               In Western classical music, smaller ensembles are called  |chamber_music|Chamber_Music|  ensembles. The terms  |duet|Duet| ,  |trio|Trio| ,  |quartet|Quartet| ,  |quintet|Quintet| ,  |sextet|Sextet| ,  |septet|Septet| ,  |octet|Octet| ,  |nonet|Nonet|  and dectet describe groups of two up to ten musicians, respectively. A group of eleven musicians, such as found in  The Carnival of the Animals , is called either a hendectet or an undectet . A soloist playing unaccompanied  is not an ensemble because it only contains one musician.              A  |string_quartet|String_Quartet|  consists of two  |violins|Violin| , a  |viola|Viola|  and a  |cello|Cello| . There is a vast body of music written for string quartets, as it is seen as an important genre in  |classical_music|Classical_Music| .       A woodwind quartet usually features a  |flute|Flute| , an  |oboe|Oboe| , a  |clarinet|Clarinet|  and a  |bassoon|Bassoon| . A brass quartet features two  |trumpets|Trumpets| , a  |trombone|Trombone|  and a  |tuba|Tuba| . A saxophone quartet consists of a  |soprano_saxophone|Soprano_Saxophone| , an  |alto_saxophone|Alto_Saxophone| , a  |tenor_saxophone|Tenor_Saxophone| , and a  |baritone_saxophone|Baritone_Saxophone| .          The string quintet is a common type of group. It is similar to the string quartet, but with an additional viola, cello, or more rarely, the addition of a double bass. Terms such as  |piano_quintet|Piano_Quintet|  or clarinet quintet frequently refer to a string quartet plus a fifth instrument.  |Mozarts|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart| |Clarinet_Quintet|Clarinet_Quintet|  is similarly a piece written for an ensemble consisting of two violins, a viola, a cello and a clarinet, the last being the exceptional addition to a normal string quartet.     Some other quintets in classical music are the  |wind_quintet|Wind_Quintet| , usually consisting of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn; the  |brass_quintet|Brass_Quintet| , consisting of two trumpets, one horn, a trombone and a tuba; and the reed quintet, consisting of an oboe, a soprano clarinet, a saxophone, a bass clarinet, and a bassoon.                  Classical chamber ensembles of six , seven , or eight musicians are fairly common; use of latinate terms for larger groups is rare, except for the nonet . In most cases, a larger classical group is referred to as an orchestra of some type or a concert band. A small orchestra with fifteen to thirty members is called a  |chamber_orchestra|Chamber_Orchestra| . A  |sinfonietta|Sinfonietta|  usually denotes a somewhat smaller orchestra . Larger orchestras are called  |symphony|Symphony|  orchestras or philharmonic orchestras.      A  |pops_orchestra|Pops_Orchestra|  is an orchestra that mainly performs light classical music and orchestral  |arrangements|Arrangement|  and  |medleys|Medley|  of popular jazz, music theater, or pop music songs. A  |string_orchestra|String_Orchestra|  has only string instruments, i.e., violins, violas, cellos and double basses.     A  |symphony_orchestra|Symphony_Orchestra|  is an ensemble usually comprising at least thirty musicians; the number of players is typically between fifty and ninety-five and may exceed one hundred. A symphony orchestra is divided into families of instruments. In the string family, there are sections of violins , violas, cellos , and basses . The standard  |woodwind_section|Woodwind_Section|  consists of flutes , oboes , soprano clarinets , and bassoons . The standard  |brass_section|Brass_Section|  consists of horns, trumpets, trombones, and tuba. The  |percussion_section|Percussion_Section|  includes the  |timpani|Timpani| ,  |bass_drum|Bass_Drum| ,  |snare_drum|Snare_Drum| , and any other percussion instruments called for in a score . In  |Baroque_music|Baroque_Music|  and music from the early  |Classical_period_music|Classical_Period_Music|  , the percussion parts in orchestral works may only include timpani.     A  |concert_band|Concert_Band|  is a large classical ensemble generally made up of between 40 and 70 musicians from the woodwind, brass, and percussion families, along with the double bass. The concert band has a larger number and variety of wind instruments than the symphony orchestra, but does not have a string section . The woodwind section of a concert band consists of piccolo, flutes, oboes , bassoons , soprano clarinets , bass clarinets , alto saxophones , tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. The brass section consists of horns, trumpets or cornets, trombones, euphoniums, and tubas. The percussion section consists of the timpani, bass drum, snare drum, and any other percussion instruments called for in a score .     When orchestras perform  |baroque_music|Baroque_Music|  , they may also use a  |harpsichord|Harpsichord|  or  |pipe_organ|Pipe_Organ| , playing the  |continuo|Bass_Continuo|  part. When orchestras perform Romantic-era music , they may also use  |harps|Harp|  or unusual instruments such as the  |wind_machine|Wind_Machine|  or  |cannons|Cannon| . When orchestras perform music from the 20th century or the 21st century, occasionally instruments such as electric guitar,  |theremin|Theremin| , or even an electronic synthesizer may be used.                 In  |jazz|Jazz| , there are several types of trios. One type of  |jazz_trio|Jazz_Trio|  is formed with a piano player, a bass player and a drummer. Another type of jazz trio that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s is the  |organ_trio|Organ_Trio| , which is composed of a  |Hammond_organ|Hammond_Organ|  player, a drummer, and a third instrumentalist . In organ trios, the Hammond organ player performs the bass line on the organ bass pedals while simultaneously playing chords or lead lines on the keyboard manuals. Other types of trios include the drummer-less trio, which consists of a piano player, a double bassist, and a horn or guitar player; and the jazz trio with a horn player , double bass player, and a drummer. In the latter type of trio, the lack of a chordal instrument means that the horn player and the bassist have to imply the changing harmonies with their improvised lines.       Jazz quartets typically add a horn  to one of the jazz trios described above. Slightly larger jazz ensembles, such as quintets or sextets typically add other soloing instruments to the basic quartet formation, such as different types of saxophones or an additional chordal instrument.       The lineup of larger jazz ensembles can vary considerably, depending on the style of jazz being performed. In a 1920s-style  |dixieland|Dixieland|  jazz band, a larger ensemble would be formed by adding a banjo player, woodwind instruments, as with the clarinet, or additional horns to one of the smaller groups. In a 1930s-style Swing big band, a larger ensemble is formed by adding sections of like instruments, such as a saxophone section, a trumpet section and a trombone section, which perform arranged horn lines to accompany the ensemble. Some Swing bands also added a  |string_section|String_Section|  for a lush sound. In a 1970s-style  |jazz_fusion|Jazz_Fusion|  ensemble, a larger ensemble is often formed by adding additional percussionists or sometimes a saxophone player, who would double or triple . Larger jazz ensembles are also formed by the addition of other soloing instruments.                    Two-member  |rock|Rock_Music|  and  |pop|Pop_Music|  bands are relatively rare, because of the difficulty in providing all of the musical elements which are part of the rock or pop sound . Two-member rock and pop bands typically omit one of these musical elements. In many cases, two-member bands will omit a drummer, since guitars, bass guitars, and keyboards can all be used to provide a rhythmic pulse.     Examples of two-member bands are  |The_Carpenters|The_Carpenters| ,  |The_Summer_Obsession|The_Summer_Obsession| ,  |Japandroids|Japandroids| ,  |They_Might_Be_Giants|They_Might_Be_Giants| ,  |Local_H|Local_H| ,  |Pet_Shop_Boys|Pet_Shop_Boys| ,  |Hella|Hella| ,  |Flight_of_the_Conchords|Flight_Of_The_Conchords| ,  |Death_from_Above_1979|Death_From_Above_1979| ,  |Francis_Xavier|Francis_Xavier| ,  |I_Set_My_Friends_on_Fire|I_Set_My_Friends_On_Fire| ,  |Middle_Class_Rut|Middle_Class_Rut| ,  |The_Pity_Party|The_Pity_Party| ,  |Little_Fish|Little_Fish| ,  |The_White_Stripes|The_White_Stripes| ,  |Big_Business|Big_Business| ,  |Two_Gallants|Two_Gallants| ,  |Lightning_Bolt|Lightning_Bolt| ,  |The_Ting_Tings|The_Ting_Tings| ,  |The_Black_Box_Revelation|The_Black_Box_Revelation| ,  |Satyricon|Satyricon| ,  |The_Black_Keys|The_Black_Keys| ,  |Twenty_One_Pilots|Twenty_One_Pilots| ,  |Tenacious_D|Tenacious_D| ,  |Simon_and_Garfunkel|Simon_And_Garfunkel| ,  |Hall_&_Oates|Hall_&_Oates| ,  |Johnossi|Johnossi| ,  |The_Pack_A.D.|The_Pack_A.D.| ,  |Air_Supply|Air_Supply|  and  |Royal_Blood|Royal_Blood| .     When electronic  |sequencers|Music_Sequencer|  became widely available in the 1980s, this made it easier for two-member bands to add in musical elements that the two band members were not able to perform. Sequencers allowed bands to pre-program some elements of their performance, such as an electronic drum part and a synth-bass line. Two-member pop music bands such as  |Soft_Cell|Soft_Cell| ,  |Blancmange|Blancmange| ,  |Yazoo|Yazoo|  and  |Erasure|Erasure|  used pre-programmed sequencers.      |W.A.S.P.|W.A.S.P.|  guitarist  |Doug_Blair|Doug_Blair|  is also known for his work in the two-piece  |progressive_rock|Progressive_Rock|  band  |signal2noise|Signal2Noise| , where he acts as the lead guitarist and bassist at the same time, thanks to a special custom instrument he invented . Heisenflei of Los Angeles duo  |The_Pity_Party|The_Pity_Party|  plays drums, keyboards, and sings simultaneously. Providence-based  |Lightning_Bolt|Lightning_Bolt|  is a two-member band. Bassist Brian Gibson augments his playing with delay pedals, pitch shifters, looping devices and other pedals, occasionally creating harmony.  |Local_H|Local_H| ,  |Blood_Red_Shoes|Blood_Red_Shoes| ,  |PS_I_Love_You|Ps_I_Love_You| ,  |The_Redmond_Barrys|The_Redmond_Barrys|  and  |Warship|Warship|  are other prominent two-person experimental rock bands.          The smallest ensemble that is commonly used in rock music is the trio format. In a hard rock or blues-rock band, or heavy metal rock group, a  |power_trio|Power_Trio|  format is often used, which consists of an electric guitar player, an electric bass guitar player and a drummer, and typically one or more of these musicians also sing . Some well-known power trios with the guitarist on lead vocals are  |The_Jimi_Hendrix_Experience|The_Jimi_Hendrix_Experience| ,  |Stevie_Ray_Vaughan_and_Double_Trouble|Stevie_Ray_Vaughan_And_Double_Trouble| ,  |Nirvana|Nirvana| ,  |Violent_Femmes|Violent_Femmes| ,  |Govt_Mule|Govt_Mule| ,  |Green_Day|Green_Day| ,  |The_Minutemen|Minutemen| ,  |Triumph|Triumph| ,  |Shellac|Shellac| ,  |Sublime|Sublime| ,  |Chevelle|Chevelle| ,  |Muse|Muse| ,  |The_Jam|The_Jam| ,  |Short_Stack|Short_Stack| , and  |ZZ_Top|Zz_Top| .     A handful of others with the bassist on vocals include  |Primus|Primus| ,  |Motörhead|Motörhead| ,  |The_Police|The_Police| ,  |The_Melvins|The_Melvins| ,  |MxPx|Mxpx| ,  |Blue_Cheer|Blue_Cheer| ,  |Rush|Rush| ,  |The_Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America|The_Presidents_Of_The_United_States_Of_America| ,  |Venom|Venom| , and  |Cream|Cream| . Some power trios feature two lead vocalists. For example, in the band  |blink-182|Blink-182|  vocals are split between bassist  |Mark_Hoppus|Mark_Hoppus|  and guitarist  |Tom_DeLonge|Tom_Delonge| , or in the band  |Dinosaur_Jr.|Dinosaur_Jr.| , guitarist  |J._Mascis|J._Mascis|  is the primary songwriter and vocalist, but bassist  |Lou_Barlow|Lou_Barlow|  writes some songs and sings as well.     An alternative to the power trio are  |organ_trios|Organ_Trio|  formed with an electric guitarist, a drummer and a keyboardist. Although organ trios are most commonly associated with 1950s and 1960s jazz organ trio groups such as those led by organist  |Jimmy_Smith|Jimmy_Smith| , there are also organ trios in rock-oriented styles, such as  |jazz-rock_fusion|Jazz_Fusion|  and  |Grateful_Dead|Grateful_Dead| -influenced  |jam_bands|Jam_Bands|  such as  |Medeski_Martin_&_Wood|Medeski_Martin_&_Wood| . In organ trios, the keyboard player typically plays a  |Hammond_organ|Hammond_Organ|  or similar instrument, which permits the keyboard player to perform bass lines, chords, and lead lines, one example being hard rock band  |Zebra|Zebra| . A variant of the organ trio are trios formed with an electric bassist, a drummer and an electronic keyboardist such as the  |progressive_rock|Progressive_Rock|  band  |Emerson,_Lake_&_Palmer|Emerson,_Lake_&_Palmer| ,  |Triumvirat|Triumvirat| , and  |Atomic_Rooster|Atomic_Rooster| . Another variation is to have a vocalist, a guitarist and a drummer, an example being  |Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs|Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs| . Another variation is two guitars, a bassist, and a drum machine, examples including  |Magic_Wands|Magic_Wands|  and  |Big_Black|Big_Black| .     A power trio with the guitarist on lead vocals is a popular record company lineup, as the guitarist and singer will usually be the  |songwriter|Songwriter| . Therefore, the label only has to present one face  to the public. The  |backing_band|Backing_Band|  may or may not be featured in publicity. If the backup band is not marketed as an integral part of the group, this gives the record company more flexibility to replace band members or use substitute musicians. This lineup often leads to songs that are fairly simple and accessible, as the frontman will have to sing and play guitar at the same time.            The four-piece band is the most common configuration in rock and pop music.     Another common formation was a vocalist, electric guitarist, bass guitarist, and a drummer e.g.  |The_Who|The_Who| ,  |The_Monkees|The_Monkees| ,  |Led_Zeppelin|Led_Zeppelin| ,  |Queen|Queen| ,  |Ramones|Ramones| ,  |Sex_Pistols|Sex_Pistols| ,  |Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers|Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers| ,  |R.E.M.|R.E.M.| ,  |Blur|Blur| ,  |The_Smiths|The_Smiths| ,  |Echo_and_the_Bunnymen|Echo_And_The_Bunnymen| ,  |The_Stone_Roses|The_Stone_Roses| ,  |Creed|Creed| ,  |Black_Sabbath|Black_Sabbath| ,  |Van_Halen|Van_Halen| ,  |Rage_Against_the_Machine|Rage_Against_The_Machine| ,  |Gym_Class_Heroes|Gym_Class_Heroes| ,  |The_Stooges|The_Stooges| ,  |Joy_Division|Joy_Division| , and  |U2|U2| .e.g.  |The_Seeds|The_Seeds|  and  |The_Doors|The_Doors| for example,  |Talking_Heads|Talking_Heads| ,  |Gerry_and_the_Pacemakers|Gerry_And_The_Pacemakers| ,  |Small_Faces|Small_Faces| ,  |King_Crimson|King_Crimson| ,  |The_Guess_Who|The_Guess_Who| ,  |Pink_Floyd|Pink_Floyd| ,  |Queen|Queen| ,  |Coldplay|Coldplay| ,  |The_Killers|The_Killers|  and  |Blind_Faith|Blind_Faith| |tal_ba|Tal_Ba| .
