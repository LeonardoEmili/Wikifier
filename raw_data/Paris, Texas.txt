        Paris is a city and  |county_seat|County_Seat|  of  |Lamar_County,_Texas|Lamar_County,_Texas| , United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 25,171. It is situated in  |Northeast_Texas|Northeast_Texas|  at the western edge of the  |Piney_Woods|Piney_Woods| , and  northeast of the  |Dallas–Fort_Worth_Metroplex|Dallas–Fort_Worth_Metroplex| . Physiographically, these regions are part of the West Gulf Coastal Plain.     Following a tradition of American cities named Paris , the city commissioned a  replica of the  |Eiffel_Tower|Eiffel_Tower|  in 1993 and installed it on site of the Love Civic Center, southeast of the town square. In 1998, presumably as a response to the 1993 construction of a  tower in  |Paris,_Tennessee|Paris,_Tennessee| , the city placed a giant red cowboy hat atop its tower. The current Eiffel Tower replica is at least the second one; an earlier replica constructed of wood was later destroyed by a  |tornado|Tornado| .            Present-day Lamar County was part of  |Red_River_County|Red_River_County,_Texas|  during the  |Republic_of_Texas|Republic_Of_Texas| . By 1840, population growth necessitated the organization of a new county. George Washington Wright, who had served in the Third  |Congress_of_the_Republic_of_Texas|Congress_Of_The_Republic_Of_Texas|  as a representative from Red River County, was a major proponent of the new county. The Fifth Congress established the new county on December 17, 1840, and named it after  |Mirabeau_B._Lamar|Mirabeau_B._Lamar| ,  who was the first Vice President and the second President of the Republic of Texas.          Lamar County was one of the 18 Texas counties that voted against secession on February 23, 1861.      In 1877, 1896, and 1916, major fires in the city forced considerable rebuilding. The 1916 fire destroyed almost half the town and caused an estimated $11 million in property damage. The fire ruined most of the central business district and swept through a residential area. The burned structures included the Federal Building and Post Office, the Lamar County Courthouse and Jail, City Hall, most commercial buildings, and several churches.     In 1893, black teenager  |Henry_Smith|Henry_Smith|  was accused of murder, tortured, and then burned to death on a scaffold in front of thousands of spectators in Paris.  In 1920, two black brothers from the Arthur family were tied to a flagpole and burned to death at the Paris fairgrounds. The city has prominent memorials to the  |Confederacy|Confederate_States_Of_America| , but has no acknowledgement of these killings.     In 1943, the  |U.S._Supreme_Court|U.S._Supreme_Court|  in  Largent v. Texas  struck down a Paris ordinance that prohibited a person from selling or distributing religious publications without first obtaining a city-issued permit. The Court ruled that the ordinance abridged freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press in violation of the  |Fourteenth_Amendment|Fourteenth_Amendment_To_The_United_States_Constitution| .           Paris has long been a railroad center. The  |Texas_and_Pacific|Texas_And_Pacific|  reached town in 1876; the  |Gulf,_Colorado_and_Santa_Fe_Railway|Gulf,_Colorado_And_Santa_Fe_Railway|  and the Frisco in 1887; the Texas Midland Railroad  in 1894; and the Paris and Mount Pleasant in 1910. Paris Union Station, built 1912, served Frisco, Santa Fe, and Texas Midland passenger trains until 1956. Today, the station is used by the Lamar County Chamber of Commerce and serves as the research library for the Lamar County Genealogical Society.             The city is home to several late-19th to mid-20th century stately homes. Among these is the Rufus Fenner Scott Mansion, designed by German architect J.L. Wees and constructed in 1910. The structure is solid concrete and steel with four floors. Rufus Scott was a prominent businessman known for shipping, imports, and banking. He was well known by local farmers, who bought aging transport mules from him. The Scott Mansion narrowly survived the fire of 1916. After the fire, Scott brought the architect Wees back to Paris to redesign the historic downtown area.         Camp Maxey is maintained by a  |Texas_Army_National_Guard|Texas_Army_National_Guard|  unit.       Paris was named the Best Small Town in Texas by Kevin Heubusch in his book The New Rating Guide to Life in Americas Small Cities .              Since 1869,  The Paris News  has served as the newspaper in the city of Paris. It circulates daily in the city and throughout Lamar County, as well as in neighboring  |Delta|Delta_County,_Texas| ,  |Fannin|Fannin_County,_Texas| , and  |Red_River|Red_River_County|  Counties in Texas and  |Choctaw_County,_Oklahoma|Choctaw_County,_Oklahoma| .       Five radio stations are licensed in the city of Paris:  |KZHN|Kzhn| ,  |KPLT|Kplt| ,  |KOYN|Koyn| ,  |KBUS|Kbus| ,  |KITX|Kitx| , and  |KPLT-FM|Kplt-Fm| .

Paris is deeply segregated  and race relations in Paris have a bloody history  and are deeply polarized, turbulent,  and sometimes explosive.     In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, several  |lynchings|Lynching_In_The_United_States|  were staged at the Paris Fairgrounds as public spectacles, with thousands of white spectators cheering as the victims were tortured and then immolated, dismembered, or otherwise murdered. Among the victims was  |Henry_Smith|Henry_Smith| , a teenager lynched in 1893.        About 115 years later, in 2008, an African-American man,  |Brandon_McClelland|Death_Of_Brandon_Mcclelland| , was run over and dragged to death under a vehicle. Two white men were arrested, but the prosecutor cited lack of evidence and declined to press charges, and no serious subsequent attempt to find other perpetrators was made. This caused unrest in the Paris African-American community.     Following this incident, an attempt by the  |United_States_Department_of_Justice|United_States_Department_Of_Justice|  Justice Community Relations Service to initiate a dialog between the races in the town  ended in failure when African-American complaints were mostly met by silent glares.     A 2009 protest rally over the case led to  |Texas_State_Police|Texas_State_Police|  intervention to prevent groups shouting white power! and black power! from coming to blows.         In 2007, a 14-year-old African-American girl was sentenced by a local judge to up to 7 years in a youth prison for shoving a hall monitor at Paris High School. Three months earlier, the same judge had sentenced a 14-year-old white girl to probation for arson. This sentencing disparity occasioned nationwide controversy  and the African-American girl was released after serving one year on orders of a special conservator appointed by the State of Texas to investigate problems with the states juvenile-justice practices.     In 2009, some African-American workers at the Turner Industries plant in the city claimed that hangmans nooses, Confederate flags, and racist graffiti were regular features of plant culture.  At the same time, the  |United_States_Department_of_Education|United_States_Department_Of_Education|  was conducting an investigation into allegations that African-American students in Pariss schools are disciplined more harshly than white students for similar offenses.        In 2015, the United States  |Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission|Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission|  ruled after an investigation that African-American workers at the  |Sara_Lee_Corporation|Sara_Lee_Corporation|  plant in Paris  were deliberately disproportionately exposed to asbestos, black mold, and other toxins, and also were targets of racial slurs and racist graffiti.      Some Paris residents deny that the town has a race-relations problem.          Paris is located at  .
