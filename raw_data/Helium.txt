         Helium  is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  He and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic,  |inert|Inert_Gas| ,  |monatomic|Monatomic| |gas|Gas| , the first in the  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas|  group in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| . Its  |boiling_point|Boiling_Point|  is the lowest among all the  |elements|Chemical_Element| . Helium is the second lightest and second most  |abundant_element|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in the observable  |universe|Universe|  . It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the  |Sun|Sun|  and in  |Jupiter|Jupiter| . This is due to the very high  |nuclear_binding_energy|Nuclear_Binding_Energy|   of  |helium-4|Helium-4| , with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both  |nuclear_fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  and  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| . Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang| . Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in  |stars|Stars| .     Helium is named for the Greek  |Titan|Titan|  of the Sun,  |Helios|Helios| . It was first detected as an unknown, yellow  |spectral_line|Spectral_Line|  signature in sunlight, during a  |solar_eclipse_in_1868|Solar_Eclipse_Of_August_18,_1868|  by  |Georges_Rayet|Georges_Rayet| , Rayet, G.  , Comptes rendus ... , 67 : 757–759. From p. 758:  ... je vis immédiatement une série de neuf lignes brillantes qui ... me semblent devoir être assimilées aux lignes principales du spectre solaire, B, D, E, b, une ligne inconnue, F, et deux lignes du groupe G.  Captain C. T. Haig, Captain C. T. Haig  Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 17 : 74–80. From p. 74: I may state at once that I observed the spectra of two red flames close to each other, and in their spectra two broad bright bands quite sharply defined, one rose-madder and the other light golden.  |Norman_R._Pogson|N._R._Pogson| , Pogson filed his observations of the 1868 eclipse with the local Indian government, but his report wasnt published.  Nevertheless, Lockyer quoted from his report.   of Lockyer, J. Norman The story of helium. Prologue, Nature, 53 : 319–322 : Pogson, in referring to the eclipse of 1868, said that the yellow line was at D, or near D. and Lieutenant John Herschel, Lieutenant John Herschel  Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 17 : 104–120. From p. 113: As the moment of the total solar eclipse approached, … I recorded an increasing brilliancy in the spectrum in the neighborhood of D, so great in fact as to prevent any measurement of that line till an opportune cloud moderated the light. I am not prepared to offer any explanation of this. From p. 117: I also consider that there can be no question that the ORANGE LINE was identical with D, so far as the capacity of the instrument to establish any such identity is concerned. and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer,  |Jules_Janssen|Pierre_Janssen| . In his initial report to the French Academy of Sciences about the 1868 eclipse, Janssen made no mention of a yellow line in the solar spectrum. See:   Janssen  , Comptes rendus ... , 67 : 838–839.   Wheeler M. Sears, Helium: The Disappearing Element ,  The Astronomer Jules Janssen: A Globetrotter of Celestial Physics ,    However, subsequently, in an unpublished letter of 19 December 1868 to Charles Sainte-Claire Deville, Janssen asked Deville to inform the French Academy of Sciences that : Several observers have claimed the bright D line as forming part of the spectrum of the prominences on 18 August. The bright yellow line did indeed lie very close to D, but the light was more refrangible than those of the D lines. My subsequent studies of the Sun have shown the accuracy of what I state here. Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with  |Norman_Lockyer|Norman_Lockyer| . Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named. The formal  |discovery_of_the_element|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  was made in 1895 by two  |Swedish|Sweden|  chemists,  |Per_Teodor_Cleve|Per_Teodor_Cleve|  and  |Nils_Abraham_Langlet|Nils_Abraham_Langlet| , who found helium emanating from the  |uranium|Uranium| |ore|Ore| ,  cleveite . In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in  |natural_gas_fields|Natural_Gas_Field|  in parts of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas today.     Liquid helium is used in  |cryogenics|Helium_Cryogenics|  , particularly in the cooling of  |superconducting_magnets|Superconducting_Magnet| , with the main commercial application being in  |MRI|Mri|  scanners. Heliums other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for  |arc_welding|Arc_Welding|  and in processes such as growing crystals to make  |silicon_wafers|Silicon_Wafer| —account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a  |lifting_gas|Lifting_Gas|  in  |balloons|Balloon|  and  |airships|Airship| .  For a more authoritative but older 1996 pie chart showing U.S. helium use by sector, showing much the same result, see the chart reproduced in Applications section of this article. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the  |human_voice|Human_Voice| . In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 is important to researchers studying  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|   and to those looking at the phenomena, such as  |superconductivity|Superconductivity| , produced in  |matter|Matter|  near  |absolute_zero|Absolute_Zero| .     On Earth it is relatively rare—5.2  |ppm|Parts_Per_Million|  by volume in the  |atmosphere|Atmosphere| . Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay|  of heavy radioactive elements , as the  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  emitted by such decays consist of helium-4  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus| . This  |radiogenic|Radiogenic|  helium is trapped with  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas|  in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called  |fractional_distillation|Fractional_Distillation| . Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because, once released into the atmosphere it readily  |escapes_into_space|Atmospheric_Escape| —was thought to be in increasingly short supply.   However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities,  in some cases, having been released by volcanic activity.            The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a  |wavelength|Wavelength|  of 587.49 nanometers in the  |spectrum|Emission_Spectrum|  of the  |chromosphere|Chromosphere|  of the  |Sun|Sun| . The line was detected by French astronomer  |Jules_Janssen|Pierre_Janssen|  during  |a_total_solar_eclipse|Solar_Eclipse_Of_August_18,_1868|  in  |Guntur|Guntur| , India.  This line was initially assumed to be  |sodium|Sodium| . On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer,  |Norman_Lockyer|Norman_Lockyer| , observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which, he named the D 3 because it was near the known D 1 and D 2  |Fraunhofer_line|Fraunhofer_Line|  lines of sodium.   He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist  |Edward_Frankland|Edward_Frankland|  named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος .        In 1881, Italian physicist  |Luigi_Palmieri|Luigi_Palmieri|  detected helium on Earth for the first time through its D 3 spectral line, when he analyzed a material that had been  |sublimated|Sublimation|  during a recent eruption of  |Mount_Vesuvius|Mount_Vesuvius| .            On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist,  |Sir_William_Ramsay|William_Ramsay| , isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral  |cleveite|Cleveite|   with mineral  |acids|Acid| . Ramsay was looking for  |argon|Argon|  but, after separating  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  and  |oxygen|Oxygen|  from the gas, liberated by  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| , he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D 3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun.    These samples were identified as helium, by Lockyer, and British physicist  |William_Crookes|William_Crookes| .  See:   Crookes, William  Chemical News and Journal of Industrial Science, 71 : 151.   Crookes, William  Chemical News and Journal of Industrial Science, 72 : 87–89. It was independently isolated from cleveite, in the same year, by chemists,  |Per_Teodor_Cleve|Per_Teodor_Cleve|  and  |Abraham_Langlet|Abraham_Langlet| , in  |Uppsala|Uppsala| , Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Weight| .   Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist,  |William_Francis_Hillebrand|William_Francis_Hillebrand| , prior to Ramsays discovery, when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. Hillebrand On the occurrence of nitrogen in uraninite and on the composition of uraninite in general, Bulletin of the U.S. Geological Survey, no. 78, pp. 43–79. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery, and near-discovery, in science.      In 1907,  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford|  and  |Thomas_Royds|Thomas_Royds|  demonstrated that  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  are helium  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus| , by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin, glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube, to study the spectrum of the new gas inside.  In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist  |Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes|Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes|  by cooling the gas to less than five  |Kelvin|Kelvin| . Onnes, H. Kamerlingh  Communications from the Physical Laboratory at the University of Leiden, 9 : 1–23.  He tried to solidify it, by further reducing the temperature, but failed, because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes student  |Willem_Hendrik_Keesom|Willem_Hendrik_Keesom|  was eventually able to solidify 1  cm 3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure. See:   Preliminary notice: Keesom, W. H. Letters to the Editor: Solidification of helium, Nature, 118 : 81.   Preliminary notice: Keesom, W. H.   Comptes rendus ... , 183 : 26.   Keesom, W. H. Solid Helium, Communications from the Physical Laboratory at the University of Leiden, 17 .      In 1913,  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr|  published his trilogy   on atomic structure that included a reconsideration of the  |Pickering–Fowler_series|Pickering–Fowler_Series|  as central evidence in support of his  |model_of_the_atom|Bohr_Model| .     This series is named for  |Edward_Charles_Pickering|Edward_Charles_Pickering| , who in 1896 published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectrum of the star  |ζ_Puppis|Zeta_Puppis|   Also published as:  .  Pickering attributed the observation  to a new form of hydrogen with half-integer transition levels.   In 1912,  |Alfred_Fowler|Alfred_Fowler|   managed to produce similar lines from a hydrogen-helium mixture, and supported Pickerings conclusion as to their origin.  Bohrs model does not allow for half-integer transitions and Bohr concluded that Pickering and Fowler were wrong, and instead assigned these spectral lines to ionised helium, He + .  Fowler was initially skeptical  but was ultimately convinced  that Bohr was correct, and by 1915 spectroscopists had transferred definitively to helium.  Bohrs theoretical work on the Pickering series had demonstrated the need for a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.     In 1938, Russian physicist  |Pyotr_Leonidovich_Kapitsa|Pyotr_Leonidovich_Kapitsa|  discovered that  |helium-4|Helium-4|  has almost no  |viscosity|Viscosity|  at temperatures near  |absolute_zero|Absolute_Zero| , a phenomenon now called  |superfluidity|Superfluidity| .  This phenomenon is related to  |Bose–Einstein_condensation|Bose–Einstein_Condensation| . In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in  |helium-3|Helium-3| , but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists  |Douglas_D._Osheroff|Douglas_D._Osheroff| ,  |David_M._Lee|David_M._Lee| , and  |Robert_C._Richardson|Robert_Coleman_Richardson| . The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3  |fermions|Fermion|  to make  |bosons|Boson| , in analogy to  |Cooper_pairs|Cooper_Pairs|  of electrons producing  |superconductivity|Superconductivity| .           After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in  |Dexter,_Kansas|Dexter,_Kansas|  produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist  |Erasmus_Haworth|Erasmus_Haworth|  collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the  |University_of_Kansas|University_Of_Kansas|  at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists  |Hamilton_Cady|Hamilton_Cady|  and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15%  |methane|Methane|  , 1%  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| , and 12% an unidentifiable gas.  With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium.   This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the  |American_Great_Plains|American_Great_Plains| , available for extraction as a byproduct of  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas| .      This enabled the United States to become the worlds leading supplier of helium. Following a suggestion by Sir  |Richard_Threlfall|Richard_Threlfall| , the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply  |barrage_balloons|Barrage_Balloon|  with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of  of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained. Some of this gas was used in the worlds first helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navys  |C-class_blimp|C-Class_Blimp|  C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from  |Hampton_Roads,_Virginia|Hampton_Roads,_Virginia| , to  |Bolling_Field|Bolling_Field|  in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921,  nearly two years before the Navys first rigid helium-filled airship, the  |Naval_Aircraft_Factory|Naval_Aircraft_Factory| -built  |USS_Shenandoah|Uss_Shenandoah| , flew in September 1923.     Although the extraction process, using low-temperature  |gas_liquefaction|Gas_Liquefaction| , was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a  |lifting_gas|Lifting_Gas|  in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc  |welding|Welding| . The  |helium_mass_spectrometer|Helium_Mass_Spectrometer|  was also vital in the atomic bomb  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| .      The  |government_of_the_United_States|Government_Of_The_United_States|  set up the  |National_Helium_Reserve|National_Helium_Reserve|  in 1925 at  |Amarillo,_Texas|Amarillo,_Texas| , with the goal of supplying military  |airships|Airship|  in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the  |Helium_Act_of_1925|Helium_Act_Of_1925| , which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the  |Hindenburg|Lz_129_Hindenburg| , like all German  |Zeppelins|Zeppelin| , was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of  |liquid_helium|Liquid_Helium|  as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen  |rocket_fuel|Rocket_Fuel|  during the  |Space_Race|Space_Race|  and  |Cold_War|Cold_War| . Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.      After the Helium Acts Amendments of 1960 , the  |U.S._Bureau_of_Mines|United_States_Bureau_Of_Mines|  arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this helium conservation program, the Bureau built a  pipeline from  |Bushton,_Kansas|Bushton,_Kansas| , to connect those plants with the governments partially depleted Cliffside gas field near Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, at which time it was further purified.      By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was US$1.4  billion in debt, prompting the  |Congress_of_the_United_States|Congress_Of_The_United_States|  in 1996 to phase out the reserve. Stwertka, Albert . Guide to the Elements: Revised Edition. New York; Oxford University Press, p. 24.  The resulting  |Helium_Privatization_Act_of_1996|Helium_Privatization_Act_Of_1996|  Helium Privatization Act of 1996  directed the  |United_States_Department_of_the_Interior|United_States_Department_Of_The_Interior|  to empty the reserve, with sales starting by 2005.      Helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure , which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.      For many years, the United States produced more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in  |Arzew|Arzew| , Algeria, producing 17 million cubic meters began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europes demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year.  In 2004–2006, additional plants in  |Ras_Laffan|Ras_Laffan_Industrial_City| ,  |Qatar|Qatar| , and  |Skikda|Skikda| , Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium.  Through this time, both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased.  From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.      , the  |United_States_National_Helium_Reserve|National_Helium_Reserve|  accounted for 30 percent of the worlds helium.  The reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the  |United_States_Senate|United_States_Senate|  would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the  |Hugoton|Hugoton_Natural_Gas_Area|  in  |Kansas|Kansas| , United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the  |panhandles|Panhandles|  of  |Texas|Texas|  and  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma| . New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in  |Qatar|Qatar| , Russia, and the US state of  |Wyoming|Wyoming| , but they were not expected to ease the shortage.     In 2013, Qatar started up the worlds largest helium unit,  Air Liquide Press Release. although the  |2017_Qatar_diplomatic_crisis|2017_Qatar_Diplomatic_Crisis|  severely affected helium production there.  2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business, following years of renowned shortages.   Gasworld, 25 Dec 2014. Nasdaq reported that for  |Air_Products|Air_Products_&_Chemicals| , an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.                      In the perspective of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , helium is the second simplest  |atom|Atom|  to model, following the  |hydrogen_atom|Hydrogen_Atom| . Helium is composed of two electrons in  |atomic_orbitals|Atomic_Orbital|  surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach  and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such  |computational_chemistry|Computational_Chemistry|  methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within .
