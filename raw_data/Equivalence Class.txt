     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , when the elements of some  |set|Set|   have a notion of equivalence  defined on them, then one may naturally split the set  into equivalence classes. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements  and  belong to the same equivalence class if and only if they are equivalent.     Formally, given a set  and an equivalence relation  on , the equivalence class of an element  in  is the set     :       of elements which are equivalent to . It may be proven from the defining properties of equivalence relations that the equivalence classes form a  |partition|Partition_Of_A_Set|  of . This partition – the set of equivalence classes – is sometimes called the quotient set or the quotient space of  by  and is denoted by .     When the set  has some structure  and the equivalence relation  is compatible with this structure, the quotient set often inherits a similar structure from its parent set. Examples include  |quotient_spaces_in_linear_algebra|Quotient_Space| ,  |quotient_spaces_in_topology|Quotient_Space| ,  |quotient_groups|Quotient_Group| ,  |homogeneous_spaces|Homogeneous_Space| ,  |quotient_rings|Quotient_Ring| ,  |quotient_monoids|Quotient_Monoid| , and  |quotient_categories|Quotient_Category| .       If  is the set of all cars, and  is the  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation|  has the same color as , then one particular equivalence class consists of all green cars.  could be naturally identified with the set of all car colors.   Let  be the set of all rectangles in a plane, and  the equivalence relation has the same area as . For each positive real number A there will be an equivalence class of all the rectangles that have area A.    Consider the  |modulo|Modular_Arithmetic|  2 equivalence relation on the set  of  |integers|Integer| :  if and only if their difference  is an  |even_number|Even_Number| . This relation gives rise to exactly two equivalence classes: one class consisting of all even numbers, and the other consisting of all odd numbers. Under this relation , , and  all represent the same element of .    Let  be the set of ordered pairs of integers  with  not zero, and define an equivalence relation  on  according to which  if and only if . Then the equivalence class of the pair  can be identified with the  |rational_number|Rational_Number|  , and this equivalence relation and its equivalence classes can be used to give a formal definition of the set of rational numbers.  The same construction can be generalized to the  |field_of_fractions|Field_Of_Fractions|  of any  |integral_domain|Integral_Domain| .   If  consists of all the lines in, say the  |Euclidean_plane|Euclidean_Plane| , and L ~ M means that L and M are  |parallel_lines|Parallel_Lines| , then the set of lines that are parallel to each other form an equivalence class as long as a  |line_is_considered_parallel_to_itself|Parallel_Reflexive_Variant| . In this situation, each equivalence class determines a  |point_at_infinity|Point_At_Infinity| .       An  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation|  on a set  is a  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|   on  satisfying the three properties:     for all  in  ,    implies  for all  and  in  ,   if  and  then  for all , , and  in  .     The equivalence class of an element  is denoted  or , and is defined as the set   of elements that are related to  by  . The word class in the term equivalence class does not refer to  |classes|Class|  as defined in  |set_theory|Set_Theory| , however equivalence classes do often turn out to be  |proper_classes|Class| .     The set of all equivalence classes in  with respect to an equivalence relation  is denoted as  and called  modulo  .  The  |surjective_map|Surjective_Map|  x  from  onto , which maps each element to its equivalence class, is called the canonical surjection or the canonical projection map.     When an element is chosen in each equivalence class, this defines an  |injective_map|Injective_Map|  called a  section . If this section is denoted by , one has  for every equivalence class . The element  is called a representative of . Any element of a class may be chosen as a representative of the class, by choosing the section appropriately.     Sometimes, there is a section that is more natural than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called  canonical representatives. For example, in  |modular_arithmetic|Modular_Arithmetic| , consider the equivalence relation on the integers defined by  if  is a multiple of a given positive integer , called the modulus. Each class contains a unique non-negative integer smaller than , and these integers are the canonical representatives. The class and its representative are more or less identified, as is witnessed by the fact that the notation  may denote either the class or its canonical representative .       Every element  of  is a member of the equivalence class . Every two equivalence classes  and  are either equal or  |disjoint|Disjoint_Sets| . Therefore, the set of all equivalence classes of  forms a  |partition|Partition_Of_A_Set|  of  belongs to one and only one equivalence class.  Conversely every partition of  comes from an equivalence relation in this way, according to which  if and only if  and  belong to the same set of the partition.      It follows from the properties of an equivalence relation that   ::  if and only if .     In other words, if  is an equivalence relation on a set , and  and  are two elements of , then these statements are equivalent:     x   y                    An  |undirected_graph|Undirected_Graph|  may be associated to any  |symmetric_relation|Symmetric_Relation|  on a set , where the vertices are the elements of , and two vertices  and  are joined if and only if . Among these graphs are the graphs of equivalence relations; they are characterized as the graphs such that the  |connected_components|Connected_Component|  are  |cliques|Glossary_Of_Graph_Theory| .        If  is an equivalence relation on , and  is a property of elements of  such that whenever ,  is true if  is true, then the property  is said to be an  |invariant|Invariant|  of , or  |well_defined|Well_Defined|  under the relation .     A frequent particular case occurs when  is a function from  to another set ; if  whenever , then  is said to be class invariant under , or simply invariant under . This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. Some authors use compatible with  or just respects  instead of invariant under  .     Any  |function|Function|   itself defines an equivalence relation on  according to which  if and only if . The equivalence class of  is the set of all elements in  which get mapped to , i.e. the class  is the  |inverse_image|Inverse_Image|  of . This equivalence relation is known as the  |kernel|Kernel_Of_A_Function|  of .     More generally, a function may map equivalent arguments  to equivalent values . Such a function is a  |morphism|Morphism|  of sets equipped with an equivalence relation.         In  |topology|Topology| , a  |quotient_space|Quotient_Space|  is a  |topological_space|Topological_Space|  formed on the set of equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a topological space using the original spaces topology to create the topology on the set of equivalence classes.     In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| ,  |congruence_relations|Congruence_Relation|  on the underlying set of an algebra allow the algebra to induce an algebra on the equivalence classes of the relation, called a  |quotient_algebra|Quotient| . In  |linear_algebra|Linear_Algebra| , a  |quotient_space|Quotient_Space|  is a vector space formed by taking a  |quotient_group|Quotient_Group|  where the quotient homomorphism is a  |linear_map|Linear_Map| . By extension, in abstract algebra, the term quotient space may be used for  |quotient_modules|Quotient_Module| ,  |quotient_rings|Quotient_Ring| ,  |quotient_groups|Quotient_Group| , or any quotient algebra. However, the use of the term for the more general cases can as often be by analogy with the orbits of a group action.     The orbits of a  |group_action|Group_Action|  on a set may be called the quotient space of the action on the set, particularly when the orbits of the group action are the right  |cosets|Coset|  of a subgroup of a group, which arise from the action of the subgroup on the group by left translations, or respectively the left cosets as orbits under right translation.     A normal subgroup of a topological group, acting on the group by translation action, is a quotient space in the senses of topology, abstract algebra, and group actions simultaneously.     Although the term can be used for any equivalence relations set of equivalence classes, possibly with further structure, the intent of using the term is generally to compare that type of equivalence relation on a set  either to an equivalence relation that induces some structure on the set of equivalence classes from a structure of the same kind on , or to the orbits of a group action. Both the sense of a structure preserved by an equivalence relation and the study of  |invariants|Invariant|  under group actions lead to the definition of  |invariants|Invariants| .
