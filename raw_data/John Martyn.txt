        Iain David McGeachy  , known professionally as John Martyn, was a British singer-songwriter and guitarist. Over a 40-year career, he released 22 studio albums, and received frequent critical acclaim.  The Times  described him as an electrifying guitarist and singer whose music blurred the boundaries between folk, jazz, rock and blues . , The Times, 30 January 2009, pg. 75.     Martyn began his career at age 17 as a key member of the British  |folk_music|Folk_Music|  scene, drawing inspiration from American  |blues|Blues|  and  |English_traditional_music|Folk_Music_Of_England| , and signed with  |Island_Records|Island_Records| . By the 1970s he had begun incorporating  |jazz|Jazz|  and  |rock|Rock_Music|  into his sound on albums such as  Solid Air  and  One World  , as well as experimenting with  |guitar_effects|Guitar_Effects|  and  |tape_delay|Delay|  machines such as  |Echoplex|Echoplex| .  He struggled with substance abuse and domestic problems throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as  |Phil_Collins|Phil_Collins|  and  |Lee_Scratch_Perry|Lee_Scratch_Perry| . He remained active until his death in 2009.       Martyn was born in Beechcroft Avenue,  |New_Malden|New_Malden| , Surrey, England, to a  |Belgian|Belgian| |Jewish|Jewish|  mother and a Scottish father.  John Neil Munro, Some People Are Crazy  — the John Martyn Story; , Polygon, 2007 p.125 His parents, both  |opera_singers|Opera_Singers| , divorced when he was five and he spent his childhood alternating between Scotland and England. Much of this time was spent in the care of his grandmother, as well as on his mothers houseboat. He attended  |Shawlands_Academy|Shawlands_Academy|  in Glasgow. At school, he was a keen rugby player. On leaving school he attended  |Glasgow_School_of_Art|Glasgow_School_Of_Art| , but left to pursue his musical aspirations.        Mentored by  |Hamish_Imlach|Hamish_Imlach| , Martyn began his professional musical career when he was 17, playing a fusion of blues and folk resulting in a distinctive style which made him a key figure in the British folk scene during the mid-1960s. He signed to  |Chris_Blackwells|Chris_Blackwell| |Island_Records|Island_Records|  in 1967 and released his first album,  London Conversation , the same year  .     This first album was soon followed by  The Tumbler , which was moving towards  |jazz|Jazz| . By 1970 Martyn had developed a wholly original and idiosyncratic sound: acoustic guitar run through a  |fuzzbox|Distortion| , phase shifter and  |Echoplex|Echoplex| . This sound was first apparent on  Stormbringer!  in 1970, which was written and performed by Martyn and his then-wife Beverley, who had previously recorded solo as  |Beverley_Kutner|Beverley_Martyn| . Her second album with Martyn was  The Road to Ruin , also released in 1970. Island Records felt that it would be more successful to market Martyn as a solo act and this was how subsequent albums were produced, although Beverley continued to make appearances as a backing singer as well as continuing as a solo artist herself.          In 1973, Martyn released one of the defining British albums of the 1970s,  Solid Air , the title song a tribute to the singer-songwriter  |Nick_Drake|Nick_Drake| , a close friend and label-mate who died in 1974 from an overdose of  |antidepressants|Antidepressants| . In 2009, a double CD Deluxe edition of Solid Air was released featuring unreleased songs and out-takes, and sleeve notes by Record Collectors Daryl Easlea. On Solid Air, as with the one that preceded it,  Bless the Weather , Martyn collaborated with  |jazz|Jazz|  bassist  |Danny_Thompson|Danny_Thompson| , with whom he proceeded to have a musical partnership which continued until his death.     Following the commercial success of Solid Air, Martyn quickly recorded and released the experimental  Inside Out , an album with emphasis placed on feel and improvisation rather than song structure. In 1975, he followed this with  Sundays Child , a more song-based collection My Baby Girl , Spencer the Rover , with several references to his young family. Martyn subsequently described this period as very happy. In September 1975 he released a live album,  Live at Leeds  — Martyn had been unable to persuade Island to release the record, and resorted to selling individually signed copies by mail from home. Live at Leeds features Danny Thompson and drummer  |John_Stevens|John_Stevens| . In 2010 a 2CD Deluxe version of Live at Leeds was released, and it was discovered that not all of the songs on the original album were from the Leeds concert. After releasing Live at Leeds, Martyn took a sabbatical, including a visit to  |Jamaica|Jamaica| , spending time with reggae producer  |Lee_Scratch_Perry|Lee_Scratch_Perry| .     In 1977, he released  One World , which led some commentators to describe Martyn as the Father of  |Trip-Hop|Trip-Hop|  . His obituary in The Times states that The records dubby, echoing soundscapes have been claimed as the forerunner of the trip-hop style that emerged in the 1990s. It included tracks such as Small Hours and Big Muff , a collaboration with Lee Scratch Perry. Small Hours was recorded outside; the microphones picked up ambient sounds, such as geese from a nearby lake. In 1978 he played guitar on the album Harmony of the Spheres by  |Neil_Ardley|Neil_Ardley| .       Martyns marriage broke down at the end of the 1970s and John hit the self destruct button  . In her autobiography, Beverley also alleges protracted domestic violence. Beverley Martyn, Jacki Dacosta, Sweet Honesty - The Beverley Martyn Story; , Grosvenor, 2011 Out of this period, described by Martyn as a very dark period in my life ,  came the album  Grace and Danger . Released in October 1980, the album had been held up for a year by Chris Blackwell. He was a close friend of John and Beverley, and found the album too openly disturbing to release. Only after intense and sustained pressure from Martyn did Blackwell agree to release the album. Commenting on that period, Martyn said, I was in a dreadful emotional state over that record. I was hardly in control of my own actions. The reason they finally released it was because I freaked: Please get it out! I dont give a damn about how sad it makes you feel—its what Im about: the direct communication of emotion. Grace and Danger was very cathartic, and it really hurt.     In the late 1980s Martyn cited Grace and Danger as his favourite album, and said that it was probably the most specific piece of autobiography Ive written. Some people keep diaries, I make records. The album has since become one of his highest-regarded, prompting a deluxe double-disc issue in 2007, containing the original album remastered.      |Phil_Collins|Phil_Collins|  played drums and sang backing vocals on Grace and Danger and subsequently played drums on and produced Martyns next album,  Glorious Fool , in 1981. Martyn left Island records in 1981, and recorded Glorious Fool and  Well Kept Secret  for  |WEA|Warner_Music_Group|  achieving his first Top 30 album. Martyn released a live album,  Philentropy , in 1983. Returning to Island records, he recorded  Sapphire  ,  Piece by Piece  and the live  Foundations  before leaving the label in 1988.          Martyn released  The Apprentice  in 1990 and  Cooltide  in 1991 for Permanent Records, and reunited with Phil Collins for  No Little Boy  which featured rerecorded versions of some of his classic tracks. The similar 1992 release  Couldnt Love You More  was unauthorised by and disowned by Martyn. Material from these recordings and his two Permanent albums has been recycled on many releases. Permanent Records also released a live 2-CD set called Live in 1994. And came out on Go!Discs and saw Martyn draw heavily on trip-hop textures, a direction which saw more complete expression on 2000s  Glasgow Walker ;  The Church with One Bell  is a covers album which draws on songs by  |Portishead|Portishead|  and  |Ben_Harper|Ben_Harper| . In 2001, Martyn appeared on the track Deliver Me by  |Faithless|Faithless|  keyboard player and DJ  |Sister_Bliss|Sister_Bliss| .       In July 2006 the documentary Johnny Too Bad was screened by the  |BBC|Bbc| .  The programme documented the period surrounding the operation to amputate Martyns right leg below the knee  and the writing and recording of  On the Cobbles  , an album described by Peter Marsh on the BBC Music website as the strongest, most consistent set hes come up with in years. Much of Cobbles was a revisiting of his acoustic-based sound.   Martyns last concerts were in November 2008 reprising Grace and Danger.      In collaboration with his keyboard player Spenser Cozens, Martyn wrote and performed the score for Strangebrew winning the Fortean Times Award at the London Short Film Festival in the same year. The film concept being a strong influence of the album design of Martyns Heaven and Earth . On 4 February 2008, Martyn received the lifetime achievement award at the  |BBC_Radio_2_Folk_Awards|Bbc_Radio_2_Folk_Awards| . The award was presented by his friend  |Phil_Collins|Phil_Collins| . The BBC website says of Martyn, his heartfelt performances have either suggested or fully demonstrated an idiosyncratic genius.  |Eric_Clapton|Eric_Clapton|  was quoted as saying that Martyn was, so far ahead of everything, its almost inconceivable.      To mark Martyns 60th birthday, Island released a 4CD boxed set,  Aint No Saint  on 1 September 2008. The set includes unreleased studio material and rare live recordings.     Martyn was appointed  |OBE|Order_Of_The_British_Empire|  in the 2009 New Year Honours.        Martyn died on 29 January 2009, in hospital in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland,  due to  |acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome|Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome| . Martyns health was affected by his life-long abuse of drugs and alcohol.   He was survived by his partner, Teresa Walsh, and his children, Mhairi and Spencer McGeachy.      Following Martyns death,  Rolling Stone  lauded his  |progressive_folk|Progressive_Folk|  invention and improvising sorcery .  Friend and collaborator  |Phil_Collins|Phil_Collins|  paid tribute to him, saying, Johns passing is terribly, terribly sad. I had worked with and known him since the late 1970s and he was a great friend. He was uncompromising, which made him infuriating to some people, but he was unique and well never see the likes of him again. I loved him dearly and will miss him very much.       |Mike_Harding|Mike_Harding|  introduced an hour-long tribute to Martyn in his Radio 2 programme on 25 February 2009. A tribute album, Johnny Boy Would Love This, was released on 15 August 2011, comprising cover versions of his songs by various artists.
