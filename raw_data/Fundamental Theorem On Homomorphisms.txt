In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , the  fundamental theorem on homomorphisms, also known as the fundamental homomorphism theorem, relates the structure of two objects between which a  |homomorphism|Homomorphism|  is given, and of the  |kernel|Kernel|  and image of the homomorphism.     The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the  |isomorphism_theorems|Isomorphism_Theorem| .         Given two  |groups|Group|  G and H and a  |group_homomorphism|Group_Homomorphism|  f : G→H, let K be a  |normal_subgroup|Normal_Subgroup|  in G and φ the natural  |surjective|Surjective|  homomorphism G→G/K . If K is a subset of  |ker|Kernel|  then there exists a unique homomorphism hG/K→H such that f h φ.     In other words, the natural projection φ is  |universal|Universal_Property|  among homomorphisms on G that map K to the identity element.     The situation is described by the following  |commutative_diagram|Commutative_Diagram|      By setting K ker we immediately get the  |first_isomorphism_theorem|First_Isomorphism_Theorem| .       Similar theorems are valid for  |monoids|Monoid| ,  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space| ,  |modules|Module| , and  |rings|Ring| .
