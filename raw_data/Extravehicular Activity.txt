         Extravehicular activity  is any activity done by an  |astronaut_or_cosmonaut|Astronaut|  outside a  |spacecraft|Spacecraft|  beyond the  |Earths_appreciable_atmosphere|Kármán_Line| . The term most commonly applies to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting Earth . On March 18, 1965,  |Alexei_Leonov|Alexei_Leonov|  became the first human to perform a spacewalk, exiting the capsule during the  |Voskhod_2|Voskhod_2|  mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds. The term also applied to  |lunar|Moon|  surface exploration  performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the  |Apollo_program|Apollo_Program|  from 1969 to 1972. On July 21, 1969,  |Neil_Armstrong|Neil_Armstrong|  became the first human to perform a moonwalk, outside his lunar lander on  |Apollo_11|Apollo_11|  for 2 hours and 31 minutes. On the last three Moon missions astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. Astronauts  |Pete_Conrad|Pete_Conrad| ,  |Joseph_Kerwin|Joseph_Kerwin| , and  |Paul_Weitz|Paul_J._Weitz|  also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to  |Skylab|Skylab| , the United States first space station.     A Stand-up EVA is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft, but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support.  Its name derives from the astronaut standing up in the open hatch, usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut.     EVAs may be either tethered , or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the  |Manned_Maneuvering_Unit|Manned_Maneuvering_Unit|  , and on a flight test in 1994 of the  |Simplified_Aid_For_EVA_Rescue|Simplified_Aid_For_Eva_Rescue|  , a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.     The Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, and China have conducted EVAs.        |NASA|Nasa|  planners invented the term extravehicular activity in the early 1960s for the  |Apollo_program|Apollo_Program|  to land men on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect  |lunar_material_samples|Moon_Rock|  and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the  |Gemini_program|Project_Gemini|  was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in manned spaceflight, so the  |Soviet_Communist_Party|Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , led by  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev| , ordered the conversion of its single-pilot  |Vostok|Vostok|  capsule into a two- or three-person craft named  |Voskhod|Voskhod_Spacecraft| , in order to compete with Gemini and  |Apollo|Apollo| .  The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first manned Gemini.     The Voskhods  |avionics|Avionics|  required cooling by cabin air to prevent overheating, therefore an  |airlock|Airlock|  was required for the spacewalking  |cosmonaut|Cosmonaut|  to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. By contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the  |American|United_States|  and  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet  definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in  |vacuum|Vacuum| . An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft. Walking to Olympus, p. ix. The USA has changed its EVA definition since.          The first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut  |Alexei_Leonov|Alexei_Leonov| , who spent 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the  |Voskhod_2|Voskhod_2|  spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his  tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his  |space_suit|Space_Suit|  ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.     At the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock,  in diameter and  long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking  |the_bends|Decompression_Sickness|  . This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by  from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in  |weightlessness|Weightlessness|  and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| .            The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by  |Ed_White|Ed_White|  from the second manned  |Gemini|Project_Gemini|  flight,  |Gemini_IV|Gemini_Iv| , for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a   |umbilical|Umbilical_Cable| , which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a  |Hand-Held_Maneuvering_Unit|Hand-Held_Maneuvering_Unit| , which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonovs claim. However, a defect in the capsules hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive. Oral History Transcript /  / Interviewed by Doug Ward / Elk Lake, Michigan – June 29, 1999.     No EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by  |David_Scott|David_Scott|  on  |Gemini_VIII|Gemini_Viii| , but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights , performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force  |Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit|Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit|  which included a self-contained oxygen system.     On November 13, 1966,  |Edwin_Buzz_Aldrin|Edwin_Buzz_Aldrin|  became the first to successfully work in space without tiring during  |Gemini_XII|Gemini_Xii| , the last Gemini mission. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrins interest in  |scuba_diving|Scuba_Diving|  inspired the use of  |underwater_EVA_training|Neutral_Buoyancy_Simulation_As_A_Training_Aid|  to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.       On January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts  |Aleksei_Yeliseyev|Aleksei_Yeliseyev|  and  |Yevgeny_Khrunov|Yevgeny_Khrunov|  transferred from  |Soyuz_5|Soyuz_5|  to  |Soyuz_4|Soyuz_4| , which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.          American astronauts  |Neil_Armstrong|Neil_Armstrong|  and  |Buzz_Aldrin|Buzz_Aldrin|  performed the first EVA on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969 , after landing their  |Apollo_11|Apollo_11| |Lunar_Module|Apollo_Lunar_Module|  spacecraft. This first Moon walk, using self-contained  |portable_life_support_systems|Portable_Life_Support_System| , lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed among six Apollo crews, including  |Charles_Pete_Conrad|Pete_Conrad| ,  |Alan_Bean|Alan_Bean| ,  |Alan_Shepard|Alan_Shepard| ,  |Edgar_Mitchell|Edgar_Mitchell| ,  |David_Scott|David_Scott| ,  |James_Irwin|James_Irwin| ,  |John_Young|John_Young| ,  |Charles_Duke|Charles_Duke| ,  |Eugene_Cernan|Eugene_Cernan| , and  |Harrison_Jack_Schmitt|Harrison_Schmitt| . Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.         |Apollo_15|Apollo_15| |command_module|Apollo_Command_And_Service_Module|  pilot  |Al_Worden|Al_Worden|  made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the service module. He was assisted by Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin standing up in the Command Module hatch. This procedure was repeated by  |Ken_Mattingly|Ken_Mattingly|  and Charles Duke on  |Apollo_16|Apollo_16| , and by  |Ronald_Evans|Ronald_Evans|  and Harrison Schmitt on  |Apollo_17|Apollo_17| .       The first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by  |Charles_Pete_Conrad|Pete_Conrad| ,  |Joseph_Kerwin|Joseph_Kerwin| , and  |Paul_J._Weitz|Paul_J._Weitz|  on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the  |Skylab_2|Skylab_2|  mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged  |Skylab|Skylab| |space_station|Space_Station|  by freeing a stuck  |solar_panel|Solar_Panels_On_Spacecraft| , deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews. They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2½ times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered  |spacesickness|Spacesickness|  early in their flights. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/197900758171979075817.pdf Skylab Reuse Study, p. 3-53. Martin Marietta and Bendix for NASA, September 1978.     After Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the  |Space_Shuttle|Space_Shuttle|  program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the  |Salyut_6|Salyut_6|  and  |Salyut_7|Salyut_7|  space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.     When the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an  |Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit|Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit|  for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.       China became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008 during the  |Shenzhou_7|Shenzhou_7|  mission. Chinese astronaut  |Zhai_Zhigang|Zhai_Zhigang|  completed a spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed  |Feitian_space_suit|Feitian_Space_Suit| , with astronaut  |Liu_Boming|Liu_Boming|  wearing the Russian-derived  |Orlan_space_suit|Orlan_Space_Suit|  to help him. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal.           The first untethered spacewalk was made by American  |Bruce_McCandless_II|Bruce_Mccandless_Ii|  on February 7, 1984, during the  |Space_Shuttle_Challenger|Space_Shuttle_Challenger|  mission  |STS-41-B|Sts-41-B| , using the  |Manned_Maneuvering_Unit|Manned_Maneuvering_Unit| . He was subsequently joined by  |Robert_L._Stewart|Robert_L._Stewart|  during the 5-hour, 55-minute spacewalk. A self-contained spacewalk was first attempted by  |Eugene_Cernan|Eugene_Cernan|  in 1966 on  |Gemini_9A|Gemini_9A| , but Cernan could not reach the maneuvering unit without tiring.   The first metalwork in open space, consisting of welding, brazing and metal spraying, was conducted by Soviet cosmonauts  |Svetlana_Savitskaya|Svetlana_Savitskaya|  and  |Vladimir_Dzhanibekov|Vladimir_Dzhanibekov|  on July 25, 1984. A specially designed multipurpose tool was used to perform these activities during a 3-hour, 30-minute EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station.      The first three-person EVA was performed on May 13, 1992, as the third EVA of  |STS-49|Sts-49| , the maiden flight of  Endeavour .   |Pierre_Thuot|Pierre_J._Thuot| ,  |Richard_Hieb|Richard_Hieb| , and  |Thomas_Akers|Thomas_Akers|  conducted the EVA to hand-capture and repair a non-functional  |Intelsat|Intelsat|  VI-F3  |satellite|Satellite| .  it was the only three-person EVA.     The first EVA to perform an  in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle  was by American  |Steve_Robinson|Stephen_Robinson|  on August 3, 2005, during Return to Flight mission  |STS-114|Sts-114| . Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers from  |Discoverys|Space_Shuttle_Discovery|  heat shield, after engineers determined there was a small chance they could affect the shuttle upon re-entry. Robinson successfully removed the loose material while Discovery was docked to the  |International_Space_Station|International_Space_Station| .   The longest EVA as of 2007, was 8 hours and 56 minutes, performed by  |Susan_Helms|Susan_Helms|  and  |James_S._Voss|James_S._Voss|  on March 11, 2001 .         |Anatoly_Solovyev|Anatoly_Solovyev|  holds both the  record for most EVAs and for the greatest cumulative duration spent in EVA  .    |Michael_Lopez-Alegria|Michael_Lopez-Alegria|  holds the American record .    |Christer_Fuglesang|Christer_Fuglesang|  holds the European record .    |Peggy_Whitson|Peggy_Whitson|  holds the record for most EVAs and most cumulative duration spent for a woman .       The first woman to perform an EVA was Soviet  |Svetlana_Savitskaya|Svetlana_Savitskaya|  on July 25, 1984, while aboard the  |Salyut_7|Salyut_7|  space station. Her EVA lasted 3 hours and 35 minutes.   The first American woman to perform an EVA was  |Kathryn_D._Sullivan|Kathryn_D._Sullivan|  on October 11, 1984, during  |Space_Shuttle|Space_Shuttle|   Challenger  mission  |STS-41-G|Sts-41-G| .   The first two women to perform an EVA togther and the first all-female EVA team were  |Christina_Koch|Christina_Koch|  and  |Jessica_Meir|Jessica_Meir|  on October 18, 2019, during  |Expedition_61|Expedition_61|  on the  |International_Space_Station|International_Space_Station| .      The first EVA by a non-Soviet, non-American was made on December 9, 1988, by  |Jean-Loup_Chrétien|Jean-Loup_Chrétien|  of  |France|France|  during a three-week stay on the  |Mir|Mir|  space station.   The first EVA by a black African-American was on February 9, 1995, by  |Bernard_A._Harris_Jr.|Bernard_A._Harris_Jr.| .   The first EVA by a Japanese astronaut was made on November 25, 1997, by  |Takao_Doi|Takao_Doi|  during  |STS-87|Sts-87| .   The first EVA by an Australian-born person was on March 13, 2001, by  |Andy_Thomas|Andy_Thomas|  .   The first EVA by a Canadian astronaut was made on April 22, 2001, by  |Chris_Hadfield|Chris_Hadfield|  along with NASA astronaut  |Scott_Parazynski|Scott_E._Parazynski|  during mission  |STS-100|Sts-100|  to install  |Canadarm2|Canadarm2|  on the  |International_Space_Station|International_Space_Station| .    The first EVA by a Scandinavian astronaut was made on December 12, 2006, by  |Christer_Fuglesang|Christer_Fuglesang| .   The first EVA by a Chinese astronaut was made on September 27, 2008, by  |Zhai_Zhigang|Zhai_Zhigang|  during  |Shenzhou_7|Shenzhou_7|  mission. The spacewalk, using a  |Feitian_space_suit|Feitian_Space_Suit| , made China the third country to independently carry out an EVA.   The first EVA by an Italian astronaut was made on July 9, 2013, by  |Luca_Parmitano|Luca_Parmitano|  along with NASA Astronaut  |Chris_Cassidy|Chris_Cassidy|  during  |Expedition_36|Expedition_36|  on the  |International_Space_Station|International_Space_Station| .   The first EVA by a British astronaut was on January 15, 2016, by  |Tim_Peake|Tim_Peake| .    Although British-American  |Michael_Foale|Michael_Foale|  carried out an EVA on February 9, 1995, he flew as an American astronaut in NASAs program.                  The first spacewalk, made by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, was commemorated in 1965 with several Eastern Bloc stamps . Since the Soviet Union did not publish details of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.     The  |U.S._Post_Office|U.S._Post_Office|  issued a postage stamp in 1967 commemorating  |Ed_Whites|Ed_White|  first American spacewalk. The engraved image has an accurate depiction of the  |Gemini_IV|Gemini_Iv|  spacecraft and Whites  |space_suit|Space_Suit| . Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Postage Stamps            NASA spacewalkers during the Space Shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 .         For EVAs from the International Space Station, NASA employed a  |camp-out_procedure|Quest_Joint_Airlockcamp-Out_Procedure|  to reduce the risk of decompression sickness.  This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp out, astronauts sleep overnight in the  |airlock|Quest_Joint_Airlock|  prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to , compared to the normal station pressure of . Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing  |the_bends|Decompression_Sickness|  .     More recently astronauts have been using the In-Suit Light Exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.
