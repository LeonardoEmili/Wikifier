In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of p, q, r, and s that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the Zero Factor Property states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if  or . Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.     For most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed.   If one is given a quadratic equation in the form , the sought factorization has the form , and one has to find two numbers  and  that add up to  and whose product is  . As an example,  factors as . The more general case where  does not equal  can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.     Except for special cases such as where  or , factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.

Subtract the constant term  from both sides.   Add the square of one-half of , the coefficient of , to both sides. This completes the square , converting the left side into a perfect square.   Write the left side as a square and simplify the right side if necessary.   Produce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.   Solve the two linear equations.
