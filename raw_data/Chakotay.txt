     Chakotay  is a  |fictional_character|Fictional_Character|  who appears in each of the seven seasons of the American  |science_fiction_television_series|Science_Fiction_On_Television|   Star Trek: Voyager . Portrayed by  |Robert_Beltran|Robert_Beltran| , he is  |First_Officer|Executive_Officer|  aboard the  |Starfleet|Starfleet|  starship  |USS_Voyager|Uss_Voyager| . The character was suggested at an early stage of the development of the series. He is the first  |Native_American|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  main character in the  Star Trek  franchise. This was a deliberate move by the producers of the series, who sought to provide an inspiration as with  |Uhura|Uhura|  in  Star Trek: The Original Series  for  |African_Americans|African_American| . To develop the character, the producers sought the assistance of  |Jamake_Highwater|Jamake_Highwater| . Despite first being named as a  |Sioux|Sioux| , and later a  |Hopi|Hopi_People| , Chakotay was given no tribal affiliation at the start of the series, something that was later resolved in the episode  |Tattoo|Tattoo|  .     The character first appeared in the pilot episode of the series,  |Caretaker|Caretaker|  . The character continued to appear throughout the series in a main cast role, with his final appearance in the finale,  |Endgame|Endgame|  . He was featured in an ongoing storyline throughout the  |first|Star_Trek:_Voyager|  and  |second|Star_Trek:_Voyager|  seasons which featured the betrayal of his lover  |Seska|Seska|   until her death in  |Basics|Basics|  . Following his experience with disconnected  |Borg|Borg|  in  |Unity|Unity|  , Chakotay was against an alliance with the Borg in  |Scorpion|Scorpion|  , nearly leading to the death of  |Seven_of_Nine|Seven_Of_Nine|  . Despite this, by the end of the series, the two characters were in a romantic relationship. In the  |Voyager_relaunch_novels|Star_Trek:_Voyagerbook_Relaunch|  set after the vessels return to the  |Alpha_Quadrant|Alpha_Quadrant| , Chakotay is promoted to Captain of the ship but the relationship with Seven is ended.     Reviewers of Chakotay were critical of the stereotypical nature of Chakotays Native American heritage. This led to comparisons with  |Tonto|Tonto|  from  The Lone Ranger , and that the inclusion of Hollywood versions of  |vision_quests|Vision_Quest|  and  |meditation|Meditation|  techniques were contrary to the characters in-universe tribal background. However, he was praised as a role model for Native American science fiction and called ground-breaking , as well as the most prominent example of a Native American character within this genre.           The inclusion of a  |Native_American|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  character in Star Trek: Voyager was suggested at an early stage in the development of the series. The  |producers|Television_Producer|  were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise. It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of  |Uhura|Nyota_Uhura|  in  Star Trek: The Original Series  later inspired  |Whoopi_Goldberg|Whoopi_Goldberg|  and other  |African_Americans|African_American| .  |Poe|Poe1998| |Executive_producer|Executive_Producer| |Jeri_Taylor|Jeri_Taylor|  said, It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost  ... the future looks good, you have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on. Taylors notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as First Officer – a human native American male, a  |Queequeg|Queequeg|  person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained.  |Poe|Poe1998| |Starfleet|Starfleet| .  |Poe|Poe1998| |The_Paradise_Syndrome|The_Paradise_Syndrome|  in the  |third_season|Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series|  of Star Trek: The Original Series showing a group of displaced humans following a Native-American-like culture.  |Wagnar_&_Lundeen|Wagnarlundeen1998| |Bajoran|Bajoran|  / Starfleet relationship seen in  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine , but wanted the characters to share the same ideals. To do this, the  |Maquis|Maquis|  were created – a group of  |Federation|Federation|  colonists from the  |Cardassian|Cardassian|  border in a disputed territory who were joined by some Starfleet officers who joined them to fight for their rights.  |Poe|Poe1998| Star Trek series before Voyager in four episodes; two in  Star Trek: The Next Generation  and two in Deep Space Nine. It was a deliberate reference to the political situation in the  |West_Bank|West_Bank| .  |Poe|Poe1998|    In developing Chakotay, the producers sought the assistance of  |Jamake_Highwater|Jamake_Highwater| ,  |Poe|Poe1998|  Highwater was a controversial choice of advisor, having been exposed by  |Hank_Adams|Hank_Adams|  and  |Vine_Deloria,_Jr.|Vine_Deloria,_Jr.|  as taking a fake Native American ancestry to sell books.  |Vizenor|Vizenor1994| |Poe|Poe1998| |Michael_Piller|Michael_Piller|  drafted the first version of the  |writers_bible|Writers_Bible|  for the series in which the character was named Chakotoy .  |Poe|Poe1998| Voyager pilot  |Caretaker|Caretaker|  , the character was known as Chakotay and been made a  |Sioux|Sioux| . By the third draft of the story, submitted at the start of November, he had become a  |Hopi|Hopi_People| , but by the following February, he once again had no tribal affiliation.  |Poe|Poe1998| |Winrich_Kolbe|Winrich_Kolbe| , the director of Caretaker , was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of  |Native_Americans|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  who were in the  |Screen_Actors_Guild|Screen_Actors_Guild| .  The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on  |Robert_Beltran|Robert_Beltran| , who until then was best known for appearing in the  |soap_opera|Soap_Opera|   Models Inc.  and was of  |Mexican|Mexicans|  heritage.  |Treviño|Trevino| Star Trek before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the Caretaker script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the  |Delta_quadrant|Delta_Quadrant| .   |Booker|Booker2004| |Poe|Poe1998| |spirit_guide|Spirit_Guide| ,  |Berman;_Piller;_Taylor|Bermanpillertaylor1995|  TV Guide .  Beltran wore a facial tattoo whilst playing Chakotay, which was applied with make-up. The design was created by  |Michael_Westmore|Michael_Westmore| , who deliberately created it so it did not represent any particular tribal culture.  |Poe|Poe1998| |Tattoo|Tattoo|  .  |Wagnar_&_Lundeen|Wagnarlundeen1998|   Following the  |first_season|Star_Trek:_Voyager|  and during a group interview with  The Washington Times , Beltran joked that he was asked to perform in  Hamlet  during the summer in  |Albuquerque|Albuquerque| , but had been asked to wear Chakotays facial tattoo.   During that time he worked on the  |Oliver_Stone|Oliver_Stone|  film  Nixon  .   During the period when Voyager was run by Taylor and Piller as the executive producers, Beltran gave feedback on the character which was taken into account. He later explained that this ended following the introduction of  |Jeri_Ryan|Jeri_Ryan|  as  |Seven_of_Nine|Seven_Of_Nine|  onto the cast and  |Brannon_Braga|Brannon_Braga|  taking over from Taylor and Piller. Beltran felt that Chakotay was one of the characters alongside  |Harry_Kim|Harry_Kim| ,  |Tuvok|Tuvok| , and  |Neelix|Neelix|  who were left behind by the new writers, who tended to concentrate on Janeway, Seven, and  |The_Doctor|Doctor| .     Beltran said that he was not aware of the effects of the interactions this was having with the crew, and described the situation, saying, for me it was like, OK, you can fire me if you want to. Go ahead, and Ill leave. He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity.  Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors, and in the end, he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make very much difference, except to a very, very small percentage of fans who maybe didnt like what I said.     In an interview to publicise the final episode of Voyager, Endgame , Beltran said, We all had a great relationship with each other and weve all said how much we enjoy our crew. We have a terrific crew. But at the same time, Im looking forward to whats next. Its exciting to know that something unknown is next.   The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay. Ryan found this confusing for the characters, as although it had been suggested in the episode  |Human_Error|Human_Error|  , the producers told the pair to forget about the relationship in the in-between episodes until the finale.            Chakotays backstory was explained during the course of Star Trek: Voyager. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he was looked after by his grandfather.  At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribes ancestral home in  |Central_America|Central_America|  and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this,  and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering  |astronaut|Astronaut|  in the early 21st century.  He chose to enter  |Starfleet_Academy|Starfleet_Academy|  against his fathers wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu.  |[A|Endnote_A|  He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII,  and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.      He was assigned as an instructor in Starfleets Advanced Tactical Training and achieved the rank of lieutenant commander. Following the death of his father in 2368 while defending his colony from the Cardassians, Chakotay resigned his Starfleet commission and joined the Maquis.  At the time of his resignation, one of his students was  |Ro_Laren|Ro_Laren| .   After he joined the Maquis, he became captain of a vessel named the Val Jean, with a crew which among others included his lover  |Seska|Seska|  ,  |BElanna_Torres|Belanna_Torres|  , and Tuvok , who was actually Captain Janeways Chief of Security, on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Maquis.      Star Trek: Voyager The Kazon and SeskaVoyager, while the crew on the Val Jean seek to evade a Cardassian vessel captained by  |Gul_Evek|Gul_Evek|   in the  |Badlands|Badlands| , the vessel is transported some 70,000 light years across the galaxy into the  |Delta_Quadrant|Delta_Quadrant|  by the creature known as the Caretaker. After the Federation starship  |USS_Voyager|Uss_Voyager|  is also trapped in the Delta Quadrant and Tuvok was revealed to be a Starfleet agent, Chakotay agrees with Captain  |Kathryn_Janeway|Kathryn_Janeway|   to work together to find two of their missing crew. Following an attack by the  |Kazon|Kazon| , Chakotay destroyed the Val Jean to save Voyager and the Maquis crew joined the Federation ship. Chakotay was given a provisional rank of commander and named executive officer, the second-in-command of the vessel and the crew seeks to return home to the  |Alpha_Quadrant|Alpha_Quadrant| .     The Kazon continue to be a hindrance during Voyager initial period in the Delta Quadrant, with Chakotay dismayed in  |State_of_Flux|State_Of_Flux|  when Seska is revealed as a Cardassian spy who has been providing technology to the Kazon to seek an alliance. She escapes Voyager and sides with the Kazon-Nistrim, one of the factions within that species.  Chakotay is rendered brain dead, but is made into a disembodied spirit able to possess other crewmembers in  |Cathexis|Cathexis|  . The incident occurs while Tuvok and he were investigating a  |dark_matter|Dark_Matter| |nebula|Nebula| , and he sought to prevent the ship from returning there, as an alien species wants to feed on the crews neural energy. After Voyager enters the nebula, Chakotay possesses Neelix  and guides the ship out using a  |medicine_wheel|Medicine_Wheel|  as a map. Shortly afterwards, The Doctor  is able to restore Chakotays mind into his body.  At the end of the first season, Chakotay supported Tuvoks aim of helping the former Maquis crew adapt better to life on Voyager in  |Learning_Curve|Learning_Curve|  , by showing them the enforcement techniques of the Maquis.      In the  |second_season|Star_Trek:_Voyager|  episode Tattoo , Chakotay meets with an alien race who influenced the ancestors of his tribe. They perceived Voyager as a threat because they had thought his people had been wiped out. He was able to resolve the problem using the teachings of his father. The Kazon returned and attacked Voyager in  |Maneuvers|Maneuvers|  , where they stole a transporter control module. Chakotay took it upon himself to retrieve the device, recognising that Seska was behind it. He managed to destroy it, but was captured and tortured by the Kazon in the process. He was rescued by Voyager, and shortly afterwards, he was contacted by Seska, who informed him that she had impregnated herself with his  |DNA|Dna| .  In  |Resolutions|Resolutions|  , Chakotay and Janeway are infected with a virus which requires them to quarantine themselves on a nearby planet. The two began to show signs of affection for each other, but their stay is short-lived after Voyager under the captaincy of Tuvok agrees a deal with the  |Vidiians|Vidiian|  for a cure. The pair agree to return to the status quo on Voyager, but remain good friends.      Chakotay was contacted by Seska in  |Basics|Basics|  to say that his son had been born, and the Kazon were threatening to condemn her to the life of a slave. Voyager attempted to extract Seska and the child, but it was a trap and resulted in the Kazon boarding the vessel and stranding the Federation/Maquis crew on a nearby planet. While  |Tom_Paris|Tom_Paris|  , The Doctor, and  |Lon_Suder|Lon_Suder|  , along with allied  |Talaxian|Talaxian|  forces, sought to retake Voyager, Chakotay was instrumental in the crews survival on the planet. He saved  |Kes|Kes|   from a local tribe, and built an alliance with them. The crew retook Voyager, and in the process Seska was killed. The child was discovered not to be Chakotays, but instead a Cardassian/Kazon hybrid and the son of the Kazon-Nistrim leader First Maje Culluh .         The first indication that Voyager was approaching  |Borg|Borg|  space was shown in the episode  |Unity|Unity|  . While investigating a Federation  |distress_call|Distress_Call|  in a  |shuttlecraft|Shuttlecraft| , Chakotay was injured by the natives of a planet. Another group saves him, and Chakotay discovers that the colonists are former Borg whose access to the main  |hive-mind|Group_Mind|  was disrupted. He is linked to a local hive-mind to help him to heal, and after being returned to Voyager, he is forced against his will to reactivate the colonists former  |Borg_Cube|Borg_Cube| . Chakotay is released from the new cooperative after the Cube self-destructs, leaving the planet with a hive-mind separate from the main collective.  Chakotay is captured by the Voth scientist Gegen  in  |Distant_Origin|Distant_Origin|  , who is seeking to prove his hypothesis that the Voth came from Earth. When Gegen is placed on trial by his people, Chakotay seeks to argue in his defense. Ultimately, Gegen is forced to back down to save Voyager after the Voth threaten to destroy the vessel. Before they depart, Chakotay gives a model globe of the Earth to Gegen as a present.       His experience with the disconnected Borg resulted in Chakotay being against a plan to ally with the Borg against  |Species_8472|Species_8472|  in  |Scorpion|Scorpion|  , causing conflict between Captain Janeway and him. The alliance results in Seven of Nine and a number of other Borg drones being placed on Voyager and Janeway injured. Although he was ordered to continue with the alliance, Chakotay seeks to renegotiate the alliance, but Seven refuses any changes. When she opens a rift to  |Fluidic_Space|Fluidic_Space| , Chakotay decompresses the  |cargo_bay|Cargo_Bay| , sending all the Borg drones out into space with the exception of Seven. Later, when the Borg attempt to double-cross Voyager, Chakotay activates his localised neural link, confusing Seven and allowing Torres to disable her link to the Collective permanently.       During the  |Year_of_Hell|Year_Of_Hell|  , Chakotay is captured by the  |Krenim|Krenim|  scientist Annorax  on a Time Ship. The two first attempt to work together as Annorax agrees to restore the now damaged Voyager if Chakotay complies with his demands. After Annorax wipes out a species, though, he helps to disable the ship, allowing Captain Janeway to destroy it by ramming Voyager into it. This results in the timeline being reset, and the events of the episode were undone.  In  |Unforgettable|Unforgettable|  , he falls in love with Kellin , a member of a  |xenophobic|Xenophobic|  race who have developed a technology to prevent others from forming long-term memories of them. As such, he is informed that they were previously in love when she was on Voyager a month earlier, and rekindle their relationship despite Chakotay not remembering the earlier encounter. Another member of her race removes Kellins memories of Chakotay and installs a virus to remove all records of their race. Chakotay takes to writing out his memories of Kellin on paper so that he will not forget them.      He was placed in command of Voyager after Seven was captured by the Borg in  |Dark_Frontier|Dark_Frontier|  and destroyed a  |transwarp|Transwarp|  conduit.  Chakotay is later one of the members of the crew who were captured by Borg children in  |Collective|Collective|  and was saved after Sevens intervention.  Initially, Chakotay and Seven did not get along, but he would come to realise that he was mistaken in that opinion.  Towards the end of the  |seventh_season|Star_Trek:_Voyager|  in Human Error , Seven simulates a relationship with Chakotay on the  |holodeck|Holodeck| . A Borg implant was preventing her from feeling strong emotions without any physical ill effects, which prevented her from seeking a romantic relationship with the real Chakotay.  By the time of the series finale, Endgame , The Doctor had managed to remove the implant, allowing Seven to pursue a relationship with Chakotay. The alternative future seen at the start of the episode showed that Seven and Chakotay were eventually married, but she died while Voyager was still travelling home. Chakotay died in 2394, following Voyager return, and Admiral Janeway visits his grave marker in that episode. This future was undone by the future Janeway travelling back in time to Voyager to return it to Earth sooner.      Voyager relaunch novels |Voyager_relaunch_novels|Star_Trek:_Voyagerbook_Relaunch| , written by  |Christie_Golden|Christie_Golden| , Chakotay is promoted after the ship returns to Federation space, and becomes Captain of Voyager. He and Seven of Nine break off their relationship. In Old Wounds, the first of the Spirit Walk two-book series, the crew goes on their maiden cruise under Captain Chakotay and is joined by his sister, Sekaya, whos become a spiritual leader in their tribe.  |Ayers|Ayers2006| Enemy of my Enemy, Chakotay is replaced by a  |Founder|Founder|  who was previously pretending to be his first officer. Meanwhile, the real Chakotay and his sister are being held by a deranged Cardassian doctor, forcing Chakotay to undergo a spirit walk to save them both.  |Ayers|Ayers2006|  and following her death after her assimilation by the Borg in the  Star Trek: The Next Generation  novel Before Dishonor,  |David|David2007| Voyager.  |David|David2007| |Kirsten_Beyer|Kirsten_Beyer| , Unworthy, Eden is promoted to fleet commander and Chakotay is restored as captain of Voyager.        Some criticism was directed at Chakotays character development during the series. James Lileks for the  Star Tribune  said that Chakotay, the rock-solid First Officer, remained rock-solid ,   but also suggested that l of the characters ended the series as they began.     Critics commented on the relationship between Janeway and Chakotay, with  |psychologist|Psychologist|  Richard Borofskys views published in  The Boston Herald . He suggesting that by several seasons into Voyager, Chakotay had come to terms with his feelings for his Captain, but she was hesitant about entering into a relationship with a member of her crew. For the relationship to work in the future, it was said that Chakotay should not try to lead the relationship and Janeway needed to be more vulnerable.   Following the end of  Star Trek: Enterprise , the romance between Chakotay and Janeway was described in  The Chicago Tribune  as the one most wanted to be seen on screen in any of the Star Trek series, but that it never panned out. Dang!  Chakotays relationship with Seven was also commented on, and both  |UGO|Ugo|  and  |io9|Io9|  complained that the relationship appeared at random.       In 2018,  |CBR|Comic_Book_Resources|  ranked Chakotay the 20th best  |Starfleet|Starfleet|  character of Star Trek.  In July 2019,  |Screen_Rant|Screen_Rant|  ranked The Fight as one of the top five worst of the series, singling out Chakotay as a major problem in the show noting how he did not really fit in, and had poor development.        Chakotays inclusion in the main cast of Voyager was seen by critics as one of several who were used to highlight the diversity within the series. This was highlighted during the episode  |Faces|Faces|  , in which one scene showed Janeway, Tuvok, Harry Kim, and Chakotay in a single  |camera_pan|Camera_Pan| .  |Leonard|Leonard1997| |Geraghty|Geraghty2009| |Geraghty|Geraghty2009| |indigenous_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples|  descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media. Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was rhaps the most well-known .   Of Chakotays origin, he said, They never actually say what nation he is, but I do believe its some Central American tribe. Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the  Twilight  film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction.   Chakotay was also described as the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting in the 2005 book,  Indian Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction: First Nations Voices Speak Out,  |Adare|Adare2005| |Tonto|Tonto|  in outer space .  |Adare|Adare2005| Medicine Bags and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War , which called Chakotay a creature of white fantasies and suggested that he was far more stereotypical than Tonto as at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in awhile .  |Caroll|Caroll2008| Star Trek: The Original Series episode  |Who_Mourns_for_Adonais?|Who_Mourns_For_Adonais?|  ,  |Wagnar_&_Lundeen|Wagnarlundeen1998|  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  exploring the Bajorans beliefs and Voyager concentrating on those of Chakotay.  |Wagnar_&_Lundeen|Wagnarlundeen1998| |vision_quests|Vision_Quest| , and other interpretations of Native American culture which were described by critics as showing a very Hollywood version of Plains-culture religion .     The appearance of a medicine wheel in the episode Cathexis was described by Sierra S. Adare as showing Chakotay as a good Indian in the classic  |Pocahontas|Pocahontas|  sense . Chakotay is seen attempting to introduce rituals and meditation techniques to other crew members, something they failed to understand.  |Relke|Relke2006| |Mayan|Maya_Civilization|  culture in Central America. Adare attributed this to Euro-American/European writers writing inaccurate information into scripts.  |Adare|Adare2005| |Adare|Adare2005|    The reference to Captain Sulu in the episode Tattoo did not make it clear whether it was  |Hikaru_Sulu|Hikaru_Sulu|  or  |Demora_Sulu|Demora_Sulu|  to whom Chakotay referred, however he stated that the Captain was a he . The noncanon novels by  |Pocket_Books|Pocket_Books|  have disagreed on which Captain Sulu to whom Chakotay referred. In a short story in the anthology Tales From The Captain Table, it is said to be Demora Sulu,  but in Pathways by Jeri Taylor it is stated that it was Hiromi Sulu, the son of Demora.
