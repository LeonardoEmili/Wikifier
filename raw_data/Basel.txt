The  |University_of_Basel|University_Of_Basel| , Switzerlands oldest university , and the citys centuries-long commitment to  |humanism|Humanism| , have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as  |Erasmus_of_Rotterdam|Erasmus_Of_Rotterdam| , the  |Holbein|Hans_Holbein_The_Younger|  family,  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche| , and in the 20th century also  |Hermann_Hesse|Hermann_Hesse|  and  |Karl_Jaspers|Karl_Jaspers| .     The city of Basel is Switzerlands second-largest economic centre after the city of Zürich and has the highest  |GDP_per_capita|Gdp_Per_Capita|  in the country, ahead of the cantons of  |Zug|Zug|  and  |Geneva|Geneva| .  In terms of value, over 94% of Basel Citys goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighboring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one third of the  |national_product|Gross_National_Income| .      Basel has been the seat of a  |Prince-Bishopric|Prince-Bishopric_Of_Basel|  since the  |11th_century|11Th_Century| , and joined the  |Swiss_Confederacy|Old_Swiss_Confederacy|  in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , and has emerged as a centre for the  |chemical|Chemical_Industry|  and  |pharmaceutical_industries|Pharmaceutical_Industry|  in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by  |Theodor_Herzl|Theodor_Herzl|  as the location for the first  |World_Zionist_Congress|World_Zionist_Congress| , and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the  |Bank_for_International_Settlements|Bank_For_International_Settlements| . The name of the city is internationally well-known through institutions like the  |Basel_Accords|Basel_Accords| ,  |Art_Basel|Art_Basel|  and  |FC_Basel|Fc_Basel| .     In 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by  |Mercer|Mercer|  together with  |Zürich|Zürich|  and  |Geneva|Geneva| .                  There are traces of a settlement at the  |Rhine_knee|Rhine_Knee|  from the early  |La_Tène_period|La_Tène_Period|  . In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the  |Raurici|Raurici|  at the site of Basel-Gasfabrik, to the northwest of the Old City, likely identical with the town of Arialbinnum mentioned on the  Tabula Peutingeriana . René Teuteberg: Basler Geschichte, p. 49. The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an  oppidum  on the site of  |Basel_Minster|Basel_Minster| , probably in reaction to the  |Roman_invasion_of_Gaul|Gallic_War| .     In  |Roman_Gaul|Roman_Gaul| ,  |Augusta_Raurica|Augusta_Raurica|  was established some  from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a  castra  was built on the site of the Celtic oppidum. The city of Basel eventually grew around the castra. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the  |Roman_province|Roman_Province|  of  |Germania_Superior|Germania_Superior| . Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the  Provincia Maxima Sequanorum  formed by  |Diocletian|Diocletian| .     The Germanic confederation of the  |Alemanni|Alemanni|  attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the  |Battle_of_Solicinium|Battle_Of_Solicinium|  . However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today  |Alsace|Alsace|  and a large part of the  |Swiss_Plateau|Swiss_Plateau| . From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.     The  |Duchy_of_Alemannia|Duchy_Of_Alemannia|  fell under  |Frankish|Francia|  rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the  |Bishopric_of_Basel|Bishopric_Of_Basel| . Based on the evidence of a third solidus with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century.  Under bishop  |Haito|Haito| , the first cathedral was built on the site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire| , Basel was first given to  |West_Francia|West_Francia| , but it passed to  |East_Francia|East_Francia|  with the  |treaty_of_Meerssen|Treaty_Of_Meerssen|  of 870.     The city was plundered and destroyed by a  |Magyar_invasion|Magyar_Invasion|  in 917. The rebuilt city became part of  |Upper_Burgundy|Upper_Burgundy| , and as such was incorporated into the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  in 1032.               From the donation by  |Rudolph_III_of_Burgundy|Rudolph_Iii_Of_Burgundy|  of the  |Moutier-Grandval_Abbey|Moutier-Grandval_Abbey|  and all its possessions to Bishop  |Adalbero_II_of_Metz|Adalbero_Ii_Of_Metz|  in 999 until the  |Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , Basel was ruled by  |prince-bishops|Prince-Bishop|  .     In 1019, the construction of the  |cathedral_of_Basel|Basel_Minster|   began under  |Henry_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Henry_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| . Franz Kugler,  Kleine Schriften und Studien zur Kunstgeschichte, 1853, p. 486 In 1225–1226, a bridge, now known as the  |Middle_Bridge|Middle_Bridge,_Basel| , was constructed by Bishop  |Heinrich_von_Thun|Heinrich_Von_Thun|  and Lesser Basel  founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basels Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier. Habicht, Peter, Basel - A Center at the Fringe  pp. 43, 55, 70, 79. For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river between  |Lake_Constance|Lake_Constance|  and the sea .     The Bishop also allowed the  |furriers|Furriers|  to establish a  |guild|Guild|  in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the towns, and hence the bishops, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basels expanding market.      |The_plague_came_to_Europe|Black_Death|  in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible—several had been tortured and confessed—demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace. During the  |Basel_massacre|Basel_Massacre| , 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors - young orphans - were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the  |Basel_earthquake_of_1356|1356_Basel_Earthquake|  which destroyed much of the city along with a  |number_of_castles|Rötteln_Castle|  in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles military protection of the city.        In 1412 , the well-known  |Gasthof_zum_Goldenen_Sternen|Gasthof_Zum_Goldenen_Sternen|  was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century  |Council_of_Basel|Council_Of_Basel|  , including the 1439 election of  |antipope_Felix_V|Antipope_Felix_V| .

In 1500 the construction of the  |Basel_Münster|Basel_Münster|  was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop. The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.             The city had remained neutral through the  |Swabian_War|Swabian_War|  of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The  |Treaty_of_Basel|Treaty_Of_Basel|  ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillians taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland de facto from the Holy Roman Empire. Rappard, William,  Collective Security in Swiss Experience 1291–1948 p. 85 ff     On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its  |eleventh_canton|Canton_Of_Basel| . Karl Strupp, Wörterbuch Des Völkerrechts, De Gruyter 1960, p.225 It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with  |Strasbourg|Strasbourg|  and  |Mulhouse|Mulhouse| , and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.
