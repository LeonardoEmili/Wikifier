     In several forms of  |football|Football|  a forward pass is a throwing of the ball in the direction that the offensive team is trying to move, towards the defensive teams goal line. The forward pass is one of the main distinguishers between  |gridiron_football|Gridiron_Football|   in which the play is legal and widespread, and  |rugby_football|Rugby_Football|   from which the North American games evolved, in which the play is illegal.     In some football codes, such as  |association_football|Association_Football|  , the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all. In these sports, the concept of  |offside|Offside|  is used to regulate who can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal. However, this has not always been the case. Some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited forward passing, while others had strict offside rules similar to rugby.     The development of the forward pass in American football shows how the game has evolved from its rugby roots into the distinctive game it is today. Illegal and experimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876, but the first legal forward pass in  |American_football|American_Football|  took place in 1906, after a change in rules. Another change in rules occurred on January 18, 1951, which established that no center, tackle, or guard could receive a forward pass . Today, the only linemen who can receive a forward pass are the ends . Current rules regulate who may throw and who may receive a forward pass, and under what circumstances, as well as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed. The primary pass thrower is the  |quarterback|Quarterback| , and statistical analysis is used to determine a quarterbacks success rate at passing in various situations, as well as a teams overall success at the passing game.          In  |gridiron_football|Gridiron_Football| , a forward pass is usually referred to simply as a pass, and consists of a player throwing the football towards the opponents goal line. This is permitted only once during a  |scrimmage|Line_Of_Scrimmage| |down|Down|  by the offensive team before team possession has changed, provided the pass is thrown from in or behind the  |neutral_zone|Neutral_Zone| . An illegal forward pass can incur a yardage penalty and the loss of a down, although it may be legally intercepted by the opponents and advanced.     If an  |eligible_receiver|Eligible_Receiver|  on the passing team legally catches the ball, the pass is completed and the receiver may attempt to advance the ball. If an opposing player legally catches the ball it is an  |interception|Interception| . That players team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponents goal. If no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an  |incomplete_pass|Incomplete_Pass|  and the ball becomes  |dead|Dead_Ball|  the moment it touches the ground. It will then be returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next  |down|Down| . If any player interferes with an eligible receivers ability to catch the ball it is  |pass_interference|Pass_Interference|  which draws a penalty of varying degree .     The person passing the ball must be a member of the  |offensive_team|Offensive_Team| , and the recipient of the forward pass must be an  |eligible_receiver|Eligible_Receiver|  and must touch the passed ball before any ineligible player.        The moment that a forward pass begins is important to the game. The pass begins the moment the passers arm begins to move forward. If the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a  |fumble|Fumble|  and therefore a  |loose_ball|Glossary_Of_American_Footballl| . In this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground. If the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is a forward pass, regardless of where the ball lands or is first touched.          The quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few paces after the ball is snapped. This places him in an area called the pocket , which is a protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side. A quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling. Under NFL and NCAA rules, once the quarterback moves out of the pocket the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack. NFHS rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an incomplete forward pass to save loss of yardage or conserve time, except for a spike to conserve time after a hand-to-hand snap. If he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called intentional grounding is assessed. In  |Canadian_football|Canadian_Football|  the passer must simply throw the ball across the line of scrimmage—whether he is inside or outside of the pocket —to avoid the foul of intentionally grounding .     If a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is a complete pass only if a receiver catches the ball in bounds. For a pass to be ruled complete in-bounds, depending on the rules either one or two feet must touch the ground within the field boundaries, after the ball is first grasped. In the  |NFL|National_Football_League|  the receiver must touch the ground with both feet, but in most other codes— |CFL|Canadian_Football_League| ,  |NCAA|National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|  and high school—one foot in bounds is enough.     Common to all  |gridiron|Gridiron_Football|  codes is the notion of control—a receiver must demonstrate control of the ball in order to be ruled in possession of it, while still in bounds, as defined by his code. If the receiver handles the ball but the official determines that he was still bobbling it prior to the end of the play, then the pass will be ruled incomplete.       The forward pass had been attempted at least 30 years before the play was actually made legal. Passes had been carried out successfully but illegally several times, including the 1876  |Yale|Yale| – |Princeton|Princeton_University|  game in which Yales  |Walter_Camp|Walter_Camp|  threw forward to teammate Oliver Thompson as he was being tackled. Princetons protest, one account said, went for naught when the referee tossed a coin to make his decision and allowed the touchdown to stand   . Gregorian, Vahe,   St. Louis Post-Dispatch, September 4, 2006     The  |University_of_North_Carolina|North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_Football|  used the forward pass in an 1895 game against the  |University_of_Georgia|Georgia_Bulldogs_Football| . However, the play was still illegal at the time. Bob Quincy stakes Carolinas claim in his 1973 book They Made the Bell Tower Chime |John_Heisman|John_Heisman| , namesake of the  |Heisman_Trophy|Heisman_Trophy| , wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs . It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6–0 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by  |George_Stephens|George_Stephens| , who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.       In a  |1905_experimental_game|1905_Fairmount_Vs._Washburn_Football_Game|  at  |Wichita,_Kansas|Wichita,_Kansas| ,  |Washburn_University|Washburn_Ichabods|  and Fairmount College  used the pass before new rules allowing the play were approved in early 1906.   ,  Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmounts Bill Davis, who completed a pass to Art Solter.         1905 had been a bloody year on the gridiron; the  Chicago Tribune  reported 18 players had been killed and 159 seriously injured that season.  There were moves to outlaw the game, but United States President  |Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt|  personally intervened and demanded that the rules of the game be reformed. In a meeting of more than 60 schools in late 1905, the commitment was made to make the game safer. This meeting was the first step toward the establishment of what would become the  |NCAA|National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|  and was followed by several sessions to work out the new rules.      The final meeting of the Rules Committee tasked with reshaping the game was held on April 6, 1906, at which time the forward pass officially became a legal play. The New York Times reported in September 1906 on the rationale for the changes: The main efforts of the football reformers have been to open up the game—that is to provide for the natural elimination of the so-called mass plays and bring about a game in which speed and real skill shall supersede so far as possible mere brute strength and force of weight.  However, the Times also reflected widespread skepticism as to whether the forward pass could be effectively integrated into the game: There has been no team that has proved that the forward pass is anything but a doubtful, dangerous play to be used only in the last extremity.   |John_Heisman|John_Heisman|  was instrumental in the rules acceptance.     In Canadian football, the first exhibition game using a forward pass was held on November 5, 1921, at  |McGill_University|Mcgill_University|  in  |Montreal,_Quebec,_Canada|Montreal|  between the  |McGill_Redmen|Mcgill_Redmen_Football|  football team and visiting American college football team the  |Syracuse_Orangemen|1921_Syracuse_Orangemen_Football_Team|  from  |Syracuse_University|Syracuse_University| . The game was organized by  |Frank_Shaughnessy|Frank_Shaughnessy| , the head coach of McGill   . McGill player Robert Boo Anderson is credited with the first forward pass attempt in Canadian football history.      The forward pass was not officially allowed in Canadian football until 1929.           Most sources credit  |St._Louis_Universitys|Saint_Louis_Billikens| |Bradbury_Robinson|Bradbury_Robinson|  from  |Bellevue,_Ohio|Bellevue,_Ohio|  with throwing the first legal forward pass. On September 5, 1906, in a game against  |Carroll_College|Carroll_University| , Robinsons first attempt at a forward pass fell incomplete and resulted in a turnover under the 1906 rules.  In the same game, Robinson later completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to  |Jack_Schneider|Jack_Schneider| . The 1906 St. Louis team, coached by  |Eddie_Cochems|Eddie_Cochems| , was undefeated at 11–0 and featured the most potent offense in the country, outscoring their opponents 407–11. Football authority and  |College_Football_Hall_of_Fame|College_Football_Hall_Of_Fame|  coach  |David_M._Nelson|David_M._Nelson|  wrote that E. B. Cochems is to forward passing what the  |Wright_brothers|Wright_Brothers|  are to aviation and  |Thomas_Edison|Thomas_Edison|  is to the electric light.     While St. Louis University completed the first legal forward pass in the first half of September, this accomplishment was in part because most schools did not begin their football schedule until early October.     In 1952, football coach  |Amos_Alonzo_Stagg|Amos_Alonzo_Stagg|  discounted accounts crediting any particular coach with being the innovator of the forward pass. Stagg noted that he had  |Walter_Eckersall|Walter_Eckersall|  working on pass plays and saw Pomeroy Sinnock of Illinois throw many passes in 1906. Stagg summed up his view as follows: I have seen statements giving credit to certain people originating the forward pass. The fact is that all coaches were working on it. The first season, 1906, I personally had sixty-four different forward pass patterns.  In 1954, Stagg disputed Cochems claim to have invented the forward pass: Eddie Cochems, who coached at St. Louis University in 1906, also claimed to have invented the pass as we know it today ... It isnt so, because after the forward pass was legalized in 1906, most of the schools commenced experimenting with it and nearly all used.    Stagg asserted that, as far back as 1894, before the rules committee even considered the forward pass, one of his players used to throw the ball like a baseball pitcher.     On the other hand,  |Hall_of_Fame|College_Football_Hall_Of_Fame|  coach  |Gus_Dorais|Gus_Dorais|  told the  |United_Press|United_Press|  that Eddie Cochems of the St. Louis University team of 1906–07–08 deserves the full credit. Casserly, Hank, Hank Casserly Says , The Capital Times, page 1, September 17, 1952 Writing in  Colliers  more than 20 years earlier, Dorais Notre Dame teammate  |Knute_Rockne|Knute_Rockne|  acknowledged Cochems as the early leader in the use of the pass, observing, One would have thought that so effective a play would have been instantly copied and become the vogue. The East, however, had not learned much or cared much about Midwest and Western football. Indeed, the East scarcely realized that football existed beyond the Alleghanies ... Rockne, Knute K. Beginning at End ,  Colliers , October 25, 1930        Once the 1906 season got underway, many programs began experimenting with the forward pass. On September 26, 1906, Villanovas game against the Carlisle Indians was billed as the first real game of football under the new rules. In the first play from scrimmage after the opening kicks, Villanova completed a pass that succeeded in gaining ten yards.  Following the Villanova-Carlisle game, The New York Times described the new passing game this way: The passing was more of the character of that familiar in basket ball than that which has hitherto characterized football. Apparently it is the intention of football coaches to try repeatedly these frequent long and risky passes. Well executed they are undoubtedly highly spectacular, but the risk of dropping the ball is so great as to make the practice extremely hazardous and its desirability doubtful.     Another coach sometimes credited with popularizing the overhead  |spiral|Spiral|  pass in 1906 is former  |Princeton|Princeton_University|  All-American  |Bosey_Reiter|Howard_R._Reiter| . Reiter claimed to have invented the overhead spiral pass while playing professional football as a player-coach for  |Connie_Macks|Connie_Mack| |Philadelphia_Athletics|Philadelphia_Athletics|  of the original  |National_Football_League|National_Football_League| .   While playing for the Athletics, Reiter was a teammate of Hawley Pierce, a former star for the  |Carlisle_Indian_School|Carlisle_Indian_School| . Pierce, a  |Native_American|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas| , taught Reiter to throw an underhand spiral pass, but Reiter had short arms and was unable to throw for distance from an underhand delivery. Accordingly, Reiter began working on an overhand spiral pass. Reiter recalled trying to imitate the motion of a baseball catcher throwing to second base. After practice and experimentation, Reiter discovered he could get greater distance and accuracy throwing that way. In 1906, Reiter was the head coach at  |Wesleyan_University|Wesleyan_University| . In the opening game of the 1906 season against  |Yale|Yale_University| , Reiters quarterback Sammy Moore completed a forward pass to Irvin van Tassell for a thirty-yard gain. The New York Times called it the prettiest play of the day , as Wesleyans quarterback deftly passed the ball past the whole Yale team to his mate Van Tassel.  Van Tassel later described the historic play to the  |United_Press|United_Press|       The football season opened for most schools during the first week of October, and the impact of the forward pass was immediate:   On October 3, 1906, the  Des Moines Daily News  reported probably the first use of the long forward pass in the  |University_of_Missouris|Missouri_Tigers_Football|  23–4 win over  |Kirksville_Normal_School|Truman_Bulldogs_Football| .    On October 4, 1906,  |Princeton|1906_Princeton_Tigers_Football_Team|  opened its season with a 22–0 win over  |Stevens|Stevens_Institute_Of_Technology| . Press accounts indicate that Princeton put the forward pass to good use, as old-time football gave way to the new game.    On October 4, 1906, the  |Carlisle_Indians|1906_Carlisle_Indians_Football_Team|  beat  |Susquehanna_University|Susquehanna_University|  40–0, as the forward pass was used for a number of good gains.    On October 4, 1906,  |Harvard|1906_Harvard_Crimson_Football_Team|  defeated  |Bowdoin|Bowdoin_College|  10–0 in a hard-fought contest that was featured by a newfangled and daring forward pass that Crimson worked in the closing minutes of play.    On October 4, 1906,  |Williams_College|Williams_Ephs_Football|  defeated the  |Massachusetts_Agricultural_College|Umass_Minutemen_Football| , scoring the games only touchdown on a forward pass by Waters.      Some publications credit  |Yale|Yale_Bulldogs_Football|  All-American  |Paul_Veeder|Paul_Veeder|  with the first forward pass in a major game. Veeder threw a 20- to 30-yard completion in leading  |Yale|1906_Yale_Bulldogs_Football_Team|  past  |Harvard|1906_Harvard_Crimson_Football_Team|  6–0 before 32,000 fans in  |New_Haven|New_Haven,_Connecticut|  on November 24, 1906.    However, that Yale/Harvard game was played three weeks after St. Louis completed 45- and 48-yard passes against  |Kansas|Kansas_Jayhawks_Football|  before a crowd of 7,000 at  |Sportsmans_Park|Sportsmans_Park| . St. Louis U. Scores 12 Points in First Half of Great Game with Kansas , St. Louis Star-Chronicle, November 3, 1906 Nelson, The Anatomy of a Game, p. 129          The forward pass was a central feature of Cochems offensive scheme in 1906 as his St. Louis University team compiled an undefeated 11–0 season in which they outscored opponents by a combined score 407 to 11. The highlight of the campaign was St. Louis 39–0 win over  |Iowa|1906_Iowa_Hawkeyes_Football_Team| . Cochems team reportedly completed eight passes in ten attempts for four touchdowns. The average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards. Nelson continues, the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. St. Louis was on Iowas thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown.     The 1906 Iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country,  |West_Points|United_States_Military_Academy|  Lt.  |Horatio_B._Stuffy_Hackett|Horatio_B._Hackett| . McCormick, Bart E. , The Wisconsin alumni magazine, Volume 28, Number 3, pages 108–109, January 1927 He had officiated games involving the top Eastern powers that year. Hackett, who would become a member of the football rules committee in December 1907 American Gymnasia and Athletic Record, Volume IV, No. 5, Whole Number 41, Page 62, January 1908 and officiated games into the 1930s, Cornell Alumni News, Volume 36, No. 4, page 44, October 19, 1933 was quoted the next day in Ed Wrays  Globe-Democrat article: It was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. St. Louis style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect. Interview with Lt. Hackett, St. Louis Globe-Democrat, November 30, 1906     Hackett is the only known expert witness to the passing offenses of both Cochems 1906 squads and that of Stagg, who dismissed any special role for the St. Louis coach in the development of the pass. Hackett was an official in games involving both teams. As Wray recalled almost 40 years later: Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it. Wrays Column, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 9, 1946     Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass , Nelson writes. Iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes.   ,      During the 1906 season threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... Schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder. Considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes.     In 1907, after the first season of the forward pass, one football writer noted that, with the single exception of Cochems, football teachers were groping in the dark.      Because St. Louis was geographically isolated from both the dominant teams and the major sports media of the era, all centered in and focused on the East, Cochems groundbreaking offensive strategy was not picked up by the major teams. Pass-oriented offenses would not be adopted by the Eastern football powers until the next decade.     But that does not mean that other teams in the Midwest did not pick it up.  |Arthur_Schabinger|Arthur_Schabinger| , quarterback for the  |College_of_Emporia|College_Of_Emporia_Football|  in  |Kansas|Kansas| , was reported to have regularly used the forward pass in 1910. Coach  |H._W._Bill_Hargiss|Homer_Woodson_Hargiss|  Presbies are said to have featured the play in a 17–0 victory over  |Washburn_University|Washburn_Ichabods_Football|   , Arthur Schabinger and in a 107–0 destruction of  |Pittsburg_State_University|Pittsburg_State_Gorillas_Football| .

That year,  |Jesse_Harper|Jesse_Harper| ,  |Notre_Dame|Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_Football|  head coach, also showed how the pass could be used by a smaller team to beat a bigger one, first utilizing it to defeat rival  |Army|Army_Black_Knights_Football| . After it was used against a major school on a national stage in this game, the forward pass rapidly gained popularity.  The New York Times, November 1, 2004     The  |1919|1919_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_Football_Team|  and  |1920|1920_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_Football_Team|  Notre Dame teams had  |George_Gipp|George_Gipp| , an ideal handler of the forward pass,   who threw for 1,789 yards.       |John_Mohardt|John_Mohardt|  led the  |1921_Notre_Dame_team|1921_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_Football_Team|  to a 10-1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.   |Grantland_Rice|Grantland_Rice|  wrote that Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space and noted that the 1921 team was the first at Notre Dame to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.  Mohardt had both  |Eddie_Anderson|Eddie_Anderson|  and  |Roger_Kiley|Roger_Kiley|  at  |end|End|  to receive his passes.          From 1915–1916,  |Pudge_Wyman|Pudge_Wyman|  and  |end|End| |Bert_Baston|Bert_Baston|  of Minnesota were one of the greatest forward-passing combinations in the history of the gridiron.       In the  |1921_Rose_Bowl|1921_Rose_Bowl| ,  |Californias|1920_California_Golden_Bears_Football_Team| |Brick_Muller|Harold_Muller|  completed a touchdown against  |Washington_&_Jefferson|1921_Washington_&_Jefferson_Presidents_Football_Team|  which went 53 yards in the air, a feat previously thought impossible.      In a 1925, 62–13 victory over  |Cornell|Cornell_Big_Red_Football| , Dartmouths  |Andy_Oberlander|Andy_Oberlander|  had 477 yards in total offense, including six touchdown passes,  a Dartmouth record which still stands.     The  |1925_Michigan_team|1925_Michigan_Wolverines_Football_Team|  was coach  |Fielding_H._Yosts|Fielding_H._Yost|  favorite and featured the passing tandem of  |Benny_Friedman|Benny_Friedman|  and  |Bennie_Oosterbaan|Bennie_Oosterbaan| .     Yost disciple  |Dan_McGugin|Dan_Mcgugin|  coached  |Vanderbilt|Vanderbilt_Commodores_Football|  and was one of the first emphasize the forward pass.

McGugins  |1927_team|1927_Vanderbilt_Commodores_Football_Team|  was piloted by  |Bill_Spears|Bill_Spears| , who threw for over a thousand yards. According to one writer, Vanderbilt produced almost certainly the legit top Heisman candidate in Spears, if there had been a  |Heisman_Trophy|Heisman_Trophy|  to award in 1927.  McGugin disciple and former quarterback  |Ray_Morrison|Ray_Morrison|  brought the pass to the southwest when he coached  |Gerald_Mann|Gerald_Mann|  at  |Southern_Methodist|Smu_Mustangs_Football| .       The first forward pass in a professional football game may have been thrown in an  |Ohio_League|Ohio_League|  game played on October 25, 1906. The Ohio League, which traced its history to the 1890s, was a direct predecessor of todays  |NFL|National_Football_League| . According to Robert W. Peterson in his book Pigskin The Early Years of Pro Football, the passer was  |George_W._Parratt|Peggy_Parratt| , probably the best quarterback of the era , who played for the  |Massillon,_Ohio_Tigers|Massillon_Tigers| , one of pro footballs first franchises.   Citing the  |Professional_Football_Researchers_Association|Professional_Football_Researchers_Association|  as his source, Peterson writes that Parratt completed a short pass to end Dan Riley  in a game played at  |Massillon|Massillon,_Ohio|  against a team from West Virginia. Since the Tigers ran up a 61 to 0 score on the hapless Mountain Staters, the pass played no important part in the result. Peterson, Robert W., Pigskin The Early Years of Pro Football, pages 52–53, 1997     According to National Football League history,  it legalized the forward pass from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage on February 25, 1933. Before that rule change, a forward pass had to be made from 5 or more yards behind the line of scrimmage.     Forward passes were first permitted in Canadian football in 1929,   but the tactic remained a minor part of the game for several years.  |Jack_Jacobs|Jack_Jacobs|  of the  |Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers|Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers|  is recognized, not for inventing the forward pass, but for popularizing it in the  |Western_Interprovincial_Football_Union|Canadian_Football_League_West_Division|   in the early 1950s, thus changing the Canadian game from a more run-dominated game to the passing game as seen today.            Specification of the size of the  |ball|Ball|  for the American game came in 1912, but it was still essentially a  |rugby_ball|Football_Rugby_Football| . Increased use of the forward pass encouraged adoption of a narrower ball, starting with changes in the 1920s which enhanced rifled throwing and also spiral punting. See   on the College Football Encyclopedia web site. This had the consequence of all but eliminating the  |drop_kick|Drop_Kick|  from the American game.        In the two codes of rugby , a forward pass is against the rules. Normally this results in a  |scrum|Scrum|  to the opposing team, but on rare occasions a penalty may be awarded if the referee is of the belief that the ball was deliberately thrown forward.     In both codes of rugby the direction of the pass is relative to the player making the pass and not to the actual path relative to the ground. A forward pass occurs when the player passes the ball forward in relation to himself.  Retrieved 28 April 2015.
