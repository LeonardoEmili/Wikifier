               The traditional China calendar , or Former Calendar , Traditional Calendar  or Lunar Calendar , is a  |lunisolar_calendar|Lunisolar_Calendar|  which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. It is defined by  |GB/T|Gb/T|  33661-2017, Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar , issued by the Standardisation Administration of China on 12 May 2017.     Although modern-day China uses the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , the traditional Chinese calendar governs holidays—such as the  |Lantern_Festival|Chinese_New_Year| —in both China and in  |overseas_Chinese|Overseas_Chinese|  communities. It also gives the traditional Chinese nomenclature of dates within a year, which people use for selecting auspicious days for  |weddings|Auspicious_Wedding_Dates| , funerals, moving, or starting a business.     Like  |Chinese_characters|Chinese_Characters| , variants of this calendar are used in different parts of the  |Chinese_cultural_sphere|East_Asian_Cultural_Sphere| . Korea, Vietnam, and the Ryukyu Islands adopted the calendar, and it evolved into  |Korean|Korean_Calendar| ,  |Vietnamese|Vietnamese_Calendar| , and  |Ryukyuan_calendars|Ryukyuan_Religionreligious_Calendar| . The main difference from the traditional Chinese calendar is the use of different  |meridians|Meridian| , which leads to some astronomical events—and calendar events based on them—falling on different dates. The traditional  |Japanese_calendar|Japanese_Calendar|  also derived from the Chinese calendar , but its official use in Japan was abolished in 1873 as part of reforms after the  |Meiji_Restoration|Meiji_Restoration| . Calendars in  |Mongolia|Mongolian_Calendar|  and  |Tibet|Tibetan_Calendar|  have absorbed elements of the traditional Chinese calendar, but are not direct descendants of it.      Days begin and end at midnight, and months begin on the day of the  |new_moon|New_Moon| . Years begin on the second new moon after the  |winter_solstice|Winter_Solstice| .  |Solar_terms|Solar_Term|  govern the beginning and end of each month. Written versions in ancient China included  |stems_and_branches|Sexagenary_Cycle|  of the year and the names of each month, including  |leap_months|Intercalation|  as needed. Characters indicated whether a month was long  or short ; stem branches for the first, eleventh, and 21st days, and the date, stem branch and time of the solar terms.            Solar calendars   The traditional Chinese calendar was developed between 771 and 476 BC, during the  |Spring_and_Autumn_period|Spring_And_Autumn_Period|  of the  |Eastern_Zhou|Eastern_Zhou|  dynasty. Before the  |Zhou_dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty| , solar calendars were used.     One version of the solar calendar is the five-elements calendar , which derives from the  |Wu_Xing|Wu_Xing| . A 365-day year was divided into five phases of 73 days, with each phase corresponding to a Day 1 Wu Xing element. A phase began with a governing-element day , followed by six 12-day weeks. Each phase consisted of two three-week months, making each year ten months long. Years began on a jiǎzǐ  day , followed by a bǐngzǐ day  and a 72-day fire phase; a wùzǐ  day and a 72-day earth phase; a gēngzǐ  day and a 72-day metal phase, and a rénzǐ day  followed by a water phase.  Other days were tracked using the  |Yellow_River_Map|Yellow_River_Map|  .     Another version is a four-quarters calendar . Weeks were ten days long, with one month consisting of three weeks. A year had 12 months, with a ten-day week  |intercalated|Intercalation|  in summer as needed to keep up with the tropical year. The 10  |Heavenly_Stems|Heavenly_Stems|  and 12  |Earthly_Branches|Earthly_Branches|  were used to mark days.      A third version is the balanced calendar . A year was 365.25 days, and a month was 29.5 days. After every 16th month, a half-month was intercalated. According to  |oracle_bone|Oracle_Bone|  records, the  |Shang_dynasty|Shang_Dynasty|  calendar  was a balanced calendar with 12 to 14 months in a year; the month after the winter solstice was Zhēngyuè.        The first lunisolar calendar was the Zhou calendar , introduced under the  |Zhou_dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty| . This calendar set the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice. It also set the shàngyuán as the winter solstice of a dīngsì year, making the year it was introduced around 2,758,130.     Several competing lunisolar calendars were also introduced, especially by states fighting Zhou control during the  |Warring_States_period|Warring_States_Period| . The state of  |Lu|Lu|  issued its own Lu calendar.  |Jin|Jin|  issued the  |Xia|Xia_Dynasty|  calendar  in AD 102,  with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the  |March_equinox|March_Equinox| .  |Qin|Qin|  issued the  |Zhuanxu|Zhuanxu|  calendar , with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the  |winter_solstice|Winter_Solstice| .  |Songs|Song| |Yin|Shang_Dynasty|  calendar  began its year on the day of the new moon after the winter solstice.     These calendars are known as the six ancient calendars , or quarter-remainder calendars, , since all calculate a year as  days long. Months begin on the day of the new moon, and a year has 12 or 13 months. Intercalary months are added to the end of the year. The Qiang and Dai calendars are modern versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, used by mountain peoples.     Qin and early Han dynasties |Qin_Shi_Huang|Qin_Shi_Huang|  unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the Qin calendar  was introduced. It followed most of the rules governing the Zhuanxu calendar, but the month order was that of the Xia calendar; the year began with month 10 and ended with month 9, analogous to a Gregorian calendar beginning in October and ending in September. The intercalary month, known as the second Jiǔyuè , was placed at the end of the year. The Qin calendar was used into the Han dynasty.     Han-Ming dynasties and Taichu calendar |Emperor_Wu_of_Han|Emperor_Wu_Of_Han|   introduced reforms halfway through his reign. His Taichu Calendar  defined a solar year as  days, and the lunar month was  days. This calendar introduced the 24  |solar_terms|Solar_Term| , dividing the year into 24 equal parts. Solar terms were paired, with the 12 combined periods known as climate terms.      The Taichu calendar established a framework for traditional calendars, with later calendars adding to the basic formula. The Dàmíng Calendar , created in the  |Liang_dynasty|Liang_Dynasty|  by  |Zu_Chongzhi|Zu_Chongzhi| , introduced the equinoxes. The use of a  |syzygy|Syzygy|  to determine the lunar month was first described in the  |Tang_dynasty|Tang_Dynasty|  Wùyín Yuán Calendar . The  |Yuan_dynasty|Yuan_Dynasty|  Shòushí calendar  used  |spherical_trigonometry|Spherical_Trigonometry|  to find the length of the  |tropical_year|Tropical_Year| .    The calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| .      Modern calendars  its use has continued. The Republic of China adopted  |UTC+08:00|Utc+08:00|  in 1928, but changed to a single  |time_zone|Time_Zone| ; some calendars followed the last calendar of the Qing dynasty, published in 1908. This caused confusion about the date of the 1978  |Mid-Autumn_Festival|Mid-Autumn_Festival| , and those areas then switched to the UTC+8-based calendar.          During the late  |Ming_dynasty|Ming_Dynasty| ,  |Xu_Guangqi|Xu_Guangqi|  and his colleagues worked out a new calendar based on Western astronomical arithmetic; however, the new calendar was not released before the end of the dynasty. In the early  |Qing_dynasty|Qing_Dynasty| ,  |Johann_Adam_Schall_von_Bell|Johann_Adam_Schall_Von_Bell|  submitted the calendar to the  |Shunzhi_Emperor|Shunzhi_Emperor| . The Qing government issued it as the Shíxiàn calendar.     In this calendar, the  |solar_terms|Solar_Term|  are 15° each along the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic|  and it can be used as a  |solar_calendar|Solar_Calendar| . However, the length of the climate term near  |perihelion|Apsis|  is less than 30 days and there may be two mid-climate terms. The Shíxiàn calendar changed the mid-climate-term rule to decides the month in sequence, except the intercalary month.  The present traditional calendar follows the Shíxiàn calendar, except:   The baseline is Chinese Standard Time, rather than Beijing local time.   Astronomical data is used, rather than mathematical calculations.

The Jesuits dates provoked interest in Europe, where they were used for comparison with Biblical chronology. Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martinis dates, except that it usually places the reign of the Yellow Emperor at 2698 BC and omits his predecessors Fuxi and  |Shennong|Shennong|  as too legendary to include .     Publications began using the estimated birth date of the  |Yellow_Emperor|Yellow_Emperor|  as the first year of the Han calendar in 1903, with newspapers and magazines proposing different dates. The province of  |Jiangsu|Jiangsu|  counted 1905 as the year 4396 , and the newspaper  Ming Pao   reckoned 1905 as 4603 .  |Liu_Shipei|Liu_Shipei|   created the Yellow Emperor Calendar, with year 0 as the birth of the emperor . There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century. Liu calculated that the 1900 international expedition sent by the  |Eight-Nation_Alliance|Eight-Nation_Alliance|  to suppress the  |Boxer_Rebellion|Boxer_Rebellion|  entered  |Beijing|Beijing|  in the 4611th year of the Yellow Emperor.          The date of the Chinese New Year accords with the patterns of the solar calendar and hence is variable from year to year. However, there are two general rules that govern the date. Firstly, Chinese New Year transpires on the second new moon following the December solstice. If there is a leap month after the eleventh or twelfth month, then Chinese New Year falls on the third new moon after the December solstice. Alternatively, Chinese New Year will fall on the new moon that is closest to lì chūn, or the solar term that begins spring . However, this rule is not as reliable since it can be difficult to determine which new moon is the closest in the case of an early or late Chinese New Year.     It has been found that Chinese New Year moves back by either 10, 11, or 12 days in some years. If it falls before January 21, then it moves forward in the next year by either 18, 19, or 20 days.     Phenology |plum-rains_season|East_Asian_Rainy_Season|  , the rainy season in late spring and early summer, begins on the first bǐng day after  Mangzhong   and ends on the first wèi day after  |Xiaoshu|Xiaoshu|  . The  |Three_Fu|Dog_Days|   are three periods of hot weather, counted from the first gēng day after the summer solstice. The first fu  is 10 days long. The mid-fu  is 10 or 20 days long. The last fu  is 10 days from the first gēng day after the beginning of autumn. The Shujiu cold days  are the 81 days after the winter solstice , and are considered the coldest days of the year. Each nine-day unit is known by its order in the set, followed by nine .
