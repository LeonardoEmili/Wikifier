      Eulers formula, named after  |Leonhard_Euler|Leonhard_Euler| , is a  |mathematical|Mathematics| |formula|Formula|  in  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis|  that establishes the fundamental relationship between the  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Functions|  and the  |complex|Complex_Number| |exponential_function|Exponential_Function| . Eulers formula states that for any  |real_number|Real_Number|    is the  |base_of_the_natural_logarithm|E| ,  is the  |imaginary_unit|Imaginary_Unit| , and  and  are the  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Functions| |cosine|Cosine|  and  |sine|Sine|  respectively, with the argument  given in  |radians|Radian| . This complex exponential function is sometimes denoted  . The formula is still valid if  is a  |complex_number|Complex_Number| , and so some authors refer to the more general complex version as Eulers formula.      Eulers formula is ubiquitous in mathematics, physics, and engineering. The physicist  |Richard_Feynman|Richard_Feynman|  called the equation our jewel and the most remarkable formula in mathematics .      When x   , Eulers formula evaluates to e + 1 0 , which is known as  |Eulers_identity|Eulers_Identity| .        |Johann_Bernoulli|Johann_Bernoulli|  noted that      :           And since     :         + C,     the above equation tells us something about  |complex_logarithms|Complex_Logarithm|  by relating natural logarithms to imaginary numbers. Bernoulli, however, did not evaluate the integral.     Bernoullis correspondence with Euler shows that Bernoulli did not fully understand  |complex_logarithms|Complex_Logarithm| . Euler also suggested that the complex logarithms can have infinitely many values.     Meanwhile,  |Roger_Cotes|Roger_Cotes|  in 1714 discovered that      : ix       Cotes missed the fact that a complex logarithm can have infinitely many values, differing by multiples of , due to the periodicity of the trigonometric functions.     Around 1740 Euler turned his attention to the exponential function instead of logarithms and obtained the formula used today that is named after him. It was published in 1748, obtained by comparing the series expansions of the exponential and trigonometric expressions.  |Leonard_Euler|Leonard_Euler|   of  |Introduction_to_the_Analysis_of_the_Infinite|Introduction_To_The_Analysis_Of_The_Infinite| , page 214, section 138 .     The view of complex numbers as points in the  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane|  was described about 50 years later by  |Caspar_Wessel|Caspar_Wessel| .             ;Interpretation of the formula     This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function  is a  |unit_complex_number|Unit_Complex_Number| , i.e., it traces out the  |unit_circle|Unit_Circle|  in the  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane|  as  ranges through the real numbers. Here  is the  |angle|Angle|  that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the  |positive_real_axis|Positive_Real_Axis| , measured counterclockwise and in  |radians|Radian| .     The original proof is based on the  |Taylor_series|Taylor_Series|  expansions of the  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function|    and of  and  for real numbers  . In fact, the same proof shows that Eulers formula is even valid for all complex numbers  .     A point in the  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane|  can be represented by a complex number written in  |cartesian_coordinates|Coordinates_Cartesian_Coordinates| . Eulers formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and  |polar_coordinates|Polar_Coordinate_System| . The polar form simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers. Any complex number , and its complex conjugate, , can be written as     :     z & x + iy  z  r e,       & x - iy  z  r e,         where   : is the real part,   : is the imaginary part,   : is the  |magnitude|Magnitude|  of    :.      is the  |argument|Arg|  of , i.e., the angle between the x axis and the vector z measured counterclockwise in  |radians|Radian| , which is defined  |up_to|Up_To|  addition of . Many texts write  instead of , but the first equation needs adjustment when . This is because for any real  and  not both zero the angles of the vectors  and  differ by  radians, but have the identical value of .     ;Use of the formula to define the logarithm of complex numbers     Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Eulers formula to define the  |logarithm|Logarithm|  of a complex number. To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm :     : a e,     and that     : ea eb e,     both valid for any complex numbers  and .     Therefore, one can write:     : z  z  e e e e     for any . Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that     :   z   + i       and in fact this can be used as the definition for the  |complex_logarithm|Complex_Logarithm| . The logarithm of a complex number is thus a  |multi-valued_function|Multi-Valued_Function| , because  is multi-valued.     Finally, the other exponential law     :   e,     which can be seen to hold for all integers , together with Eulers formula, implies several  |trigonometric_identities|Trigonometric_Identity| , as well as  |de_Moivres_formula|De_Moivres_Formula| .          Eulers formula provides a powerful connection between  |analysis|Mathematical_Analysis|  and  |trigonometry|Trigonometry| , and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as  |weighted_sums|Weighted_Sum|  of the exponential function:     :       x &             x &               The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Eulers formulas:     :     e &   x + i   x,     e &   + i     x - i   x         and solving for either cosine or sine.     These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments . For example, letting , we have:     :       &           &   i   i          Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components. One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials. After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued. For example:     :       x    y &           &         &               Another technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the  |real_part|Real_Part|  of a complex expression and perform the manipulations on the complex expression. For example:     :       &         &         &         &         &     -           This formula is used for recursive generation of  for integer values of  and arbitrary  .     See also  |Phasor_arithmetic|Phasorphasor_Arithmetic| .       In the language of  |topology|Topology| , Eulers formula states that the imaginary exponential function  is a  |morphism|Morphism|  of  |topological_groups|Topological_Group|  from the real line  to the unit circle . In fact, this exhibits  as a  |covering_space|Covering_Space|  of   S1 . Similarly,  |Eulers_identity|Eulers_Identity|  says that the  |kernel|Kernel|  of this map is , where . These observations may be combined and summarized in the  |commutative_diagram|Commutative_Diagram|  below:                 In  |differential_equations|Differential_Equations| , the function  is often used to simplify solutions, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine. The reason for this is that the exponential function is the  |eigenfunction|Eigenfunction|  of the operation of  |differentiation|Differentiation| .     In  |electrical_engineering|Electrical_Engineering| ,  |signal_processing|Signal_Processing| , and similar fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sinusoidal functions , and these are more conveniently expressed as the sum of exponential functions with  |imaginary|Imaginary_Number|  exponents, using Eulers formula. Also,  |phasor_analysis|Phasor_Analysis|  of circuits can include Eulers formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor.     In the  |four-dimensional_space|Four-Dimensional_Space|  of  |quaternions|Quaternion| , there is a  |sphere|Sphere|  of  |imaginary_units|Imaginary_Unit| . For any point r on this sphere, and x a real number, Eulers formula applies:   :     x + r   x,   and the element is called a  |versor|Versor|  in quaternions. The set of all versors forms a  |3-sphere|3-Sphere|  in the 4-space.            The exponential function  for real values of  may be defined in a few different equivalent ways . Several of these methods may be directly extended to give definitions of  for complex values of  simply by substituting  in place of  and using the complex algebraic operations. In particular we may use either of the three following definitions, which are equivalent. From a more advanced perspective, each of these definitions may be interpreted as giving the unique  |analytic_continuation|Analytic_Continuation|  of  to the complex plane.         The exponential function z  ez is the unique  |differentiable_function|Differentiable_Function|  of a  |complex_variable|Complex_Variable|  such that   :   ez   and   : e01.       For complex      : ez 1 +   +   +   +           Using the  |ratio_test|Ratio_Test| , it is possible to show that this  |power_series|Power_Series|  has an infinite  |radius_of_convergence|Radius_Of_Convergence|  and so defines  for all complex .       For complex      : ez         Here, n is restricted to  |positive_integers|Positive_Integer| , so there is no question about what the power with exponent n means.       Various proofs of the formula are possible.       Here is a proof of Eulers formula using  |power-series_expansions|Taylor_Series| , as well as basic facts about the powers of      :     i0 & 1, & i1 & i, & i2 & -1, & i3 & -i,     i4 & 1, & i5 & i, & i6 & -1, & i7 & -i     &   & &   & &   & &           Using now the power-series definition from above, we see that for real values of      :     e & 1 + ix +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +       & 1 + ix -   -   +   +   -   -   +   +       &   + i      &   x + i  x .         In the last step we have simply recognized the  |Maclaurin_series|Taylor_Series|  for  and . The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is  |absolutely_convergent|Absolute_Convergence| .       Another proof  Second proof on page. is based on the fact that all complex numbers can be expressed in polar coordinates. Therefore, for some  and  depending on ,   : e r .   No assumptions are being made about  and ; they will be determined in the course of the proof. From any of the definitions of the exponential function it can be shown that the derivative of  is . Therefore, differentiating both sides gives   : i e   + r     Substituting  for  and equating real and imaginary parts in this formula gives  and . Thus,  is a constant, and  is  for some constant . The initial values  and  come from , giving  and . This proves the formula   : e 1   x + i   x.       Another proof is based on  |differential_equations|Differential_Equation|  satisfied by exponential and trigonometric functions. See  .
