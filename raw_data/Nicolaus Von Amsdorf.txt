Like  |Andreas_Karlstadt|Andreas_Karlstadt| , he was at first a leading exponent of the older type of  |scholastic|Scholasticism|  theology, but under the influence of  |Luther|Martin_Luther|  abandoned his  |Aristotelian|Aristotle|  positions for a theology based on the  |Augustinian|St._Augustine_Of_Hippo|  doctrine of  |grace|Divine_Grace| . Throughout his life he remained one of Luthers most determined supporters; he was with him at the  |Leipzig|Leipzig|  conference , and the  |Diet_of_Worms|Diet_Of_Worms|  ; and was privy to the secret of his  |Wartburg|Wartburg|  seclusion.
