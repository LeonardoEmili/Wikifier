   Cryptonomicon is a 1999 novel by American author  |Neal_Stephenson|Neal_Stephenson| , set in two different time periods. One group of characters are World War II-era  |Allied|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii| |codebreakers|Cryptographer|  and  |tactical-deception|London_Controlling_Section|  operatives affiliated with the  |Government_Code_and_Cypher_School|Government_Code_And_Cypher_School|  at  |Bletchley_Park|Bletchley_Park|  , and disillusioned  |Axis|Axis_Power|  military and intelligence figures. The second narrative is set in the late 1990s, with characters that are descendants of those of the earlier time period, who employ cryptologic, telecom, and computer technology to build an underground  |data_haven|Data_Haven|  in the fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Their goal is to facilitate anonymous Internet banking using  |electronic_money|Electronic_Money|  and  |digital_gold_currency|Digital_Gold_Currency| , with a long-term objective to distribute Holocaust Education and Avoidance Pod media for instructing  |genocide-target_populations|Genocides_In_History1951_To_2000|  on defensive warfare.       Cryptonomicon is closer to the  |genres|Genre|  of  |historical_fiction|Historical_Fiction|  and contemporary  |techno-thriller|Techno-Thriller|  than to the science fiction of Stephensons two previous novels,  Snow Crash  and  The Diamond Age . It features fictionalized characterizations of such historical figures as  |Alan_Turing|Alan_Turing| ,  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein| ,  |Douglas_MacArthur|Douglas_Macarthur| ,  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| ,  |Isoroku_Yamamoto|Isoroku_Yamamoto| ,  |Karl_Dönitz|Karl_Dönitz| ,  |Hermann_Göring|Hermann_Göring| , and  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan| , as well as some highly technical and detailed descriptions of modern cryptography and information security, with discussions of  |prime_numbers|Prime_Numbers| ,  |modular_arithmetic|Modular_Arithmetic| , and  |Van_Eck_phreaking|Van_Eck_Phreaking| .       According to Stephenson:   The title is a play on  Necronomicon , the title of a book mentioned in the stories of horror writer  |H._P._Lovecraft|H._P._Lovecraft|      The novels Cryptonomicon, described as a cryptographers bible , is a  |fictional_book|Fictional_Book|  summarizing Americas knowledge of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Begun by  |John_Wilkins|John_Wilkins|   and amended over time by  |William_Friedman|William_Friedman| , Lawrence Waterhouse, and others, the Cryptonomicon is described by Katherine Hayles as a kind of  |Kabala|Wiktionary:Kabala|  created by a Brotherhood of Code that stretches across centuries. To know its contents is to qualify as a  |Morlock|Morlock|  among the  |Eloi|Eloi| , and the elite among the elite are those gifted enough actually to contribute to it.        The action takes place in two periods—World War II and the late 1990s, during the  |Internet_boom|Dot-Com_Bubble|  and  |Asian_financial_crisis|Asian_Financial_Crisis| .     In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, a young  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  code breaker and mathematical genius, is assigned to the newly formed joint British and American Detachment 2702. This ultra-secret units role is to hide the fact that Allied intelligence has cracked the German  |Enigma|Enigma_Machine|  code. The detachment stages events, often behind enemy lines, that provide alternative explanations for the Allied intelligence successes.  |United_States_Marine|United_States_Marine|  sergeant Bobby Shaftoe, a veteran of  |China|China_Marine|  and  |Guadalcanal|Battle_Of_Guadalcanal| , serves in unit 2702, carrying out Waterhouses plans. At the same time, Japanese soldiers, including mining engineer Goto Dengo, a friendly enemy of Shaftoes, are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the  |Philippines|Philippines|  as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission.     Circa 1997, Randy Waterhouse joins his old  |role-playing_game|Role-Playing_Game|  companion Avi Halaby in a new  |startup|Startup_Company| , providing  |Pinoy|Pinoy| -grams to migrant  |Filipinos|Filipino_People|  via new fiber-optic cables. The  |Epiphyte|Epiphyte|  Corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a  |data_haven|Data_Haven|  in the nearby fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Vietnam veteran Doug Shaftoe, the son of Bobby Shaftoe, and his daughter Amy, do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven, which is overseen by Goto Furudenendu, heir-apparent to Goto Engineering. Complications arise as figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge.               Sgt. Robert Bobby Shaftoe, a  |gung-ho|Gung-Ho| ,  |haiku|Haiku| -writing  |United_States_Marine|United_States_Marine_Corps| |Raider|Marine_Raiders| .   Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, an American cryptographer/mathematician serving as an officer in the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy| , although he is known to wear an Army uniform if the situation calls for it.   Günter Bischoff, a  |Kapitänleutnant|Kapitänleutnant|  in the  |Kriegsmarine|Kriegsmarine| , who commands a  |U-Boat|U-Boat|  for much of the story, and later takes command of a new, advanced submarine  |fueled_with_hydrogen_peroxide|Air-Independent_Propulsion| .   Rudolf Rudy von Hacklheber, a non-Nazi German mathematician and cryptographer, who spent time attending  |Princeton_University|Princeton_University| , where he had a romantic relationship with Alan Turing and befriended Waterhouse. He seems to know more about the mysterious  |Societas_Eruditorum|Societas_Eruditorum|  than any non-member.   Earl Comstock, a former  |Electrical_Till_Corp.|History_Of_Ibm1925–1949:_Ibms_Early_Growth|  executive and  |US_Army|United_States_Army|  officer, who eventually founds the  |NSA|National_Security_Agency|  and becomes a key policy maker for  |US_involvement|Mcnamara_Taylor_Mission|  in the  |Second_Indochina_War|Second_Indochina_War| .   Julieta Kivistik, a Finnish woman who assists some of the World War II characters when they find themselves stranded in Sweden, and who later gives birth to a baby boy whose paternity is uncertain.   “Uncle” Otto Kivistik, Julietas uncle, who runs a successful smuggling ring between neutral Sweden, Finland, and the USSR during World War II.   Mary cCmndhd , a member of a Qwghlmian immigrant community living in Australia, who catches the attention of Lawrence Waterhouse while he is stationed in  |Brisbane|Brisbane| .   Glory Altamira, a nursing student and Bobby Shaftoes Filipina lover. She becomes a member of the Philippine resistance movement during the Japanese occupation. Mother of Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe.       Fictionalized versions of several historical figures appear in the World War II storyline:    |Alan_Turing|Alan_Turing| , the cryptographer and computer scientist, is a colleague and friend of Lawrence Waterhouse and sometime lover of Rudy von Hacklheber.    |Douglas_MacArthur|Douglas_Macarthur| , the famed U.S. Army general, who takes a central role toward the end of the World War II timeline.    |Karl_Dönitz|Karl_Dönitz| ,  |Großadmiral|Grand_Admiral|  of the Kriegsmarine, is never actually seen as a character but issues orders to his U-Boats, including the one captained by Bischoff. Bischoff threatens to reveal information about  |hidden_war_gold|Nazi_Gold|  unless Dönitz rescinds an order to sink his submarine.    |Hermann_Göring|Hermann_Göring| , who appears extensively in the recollections of Rudy von Hacklheber as Rudy recounts how Göring tried recruiting him as a cryptographer for the Nazis: Rudy delivers an intentionally weakened system, reserving the full system for the use of the conspiracy among the characters to locate hidden gold.   Future United States President  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reaganmilitary_Service|  is depicted during his wartime service as an officer in the  |U.S._Army_Air_Corps|United_States_Army_Air_Corps|  Public Relations branchs 1st Motion Picture Unit. He attempts to film an interview with the recuperating and morphine-addled Bobby Shaftoe, who spoils the production with his account of a giant lizard attack and his harsh criticism of General MacArthur.   Admiral  |Isoroku_Yamamotos|Isoroku_Yamamoto|  1943 death at the hands of U.S. Army fighter aircraft during  |Operation_Vengeance|Operation_Vengeance|  over Bougainville Island fills an entire chapter. During his fateful flight, the Commander-in-Chief of the  |Japanese_Imperial_Navys|Imperial_Japanese_Navy| |Combined_Fleet|Combined_Fleet|  reflects upon the failures and hubris of his  |Imperial_Army|Imperial_Japanese_Army|  counterparts, who persistently underestimate the cunning and ferocity of their Allied opponents in the  |Pacific_Theatre_of_Operations|Pacific_War| . As his damaged transport plane completes its terminal descent, Yamamoto realizes that all of the Japanese military codes have been broken, which explains why he is on fire and hurtling through the jungle at a hundred miles per hour in a chair, closely pursued by tons of flaming junk.    |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein|  brushes off a young Lawrence Waterhouses request for advice. During his year of undergraduate study at Princeton, Waterhouse periodically wanders the halls of the  |Institute_for_Advanced_Study|Institute_For_Advanced_Study| , randomly asking mathematicians for advice on how to make intricate calculations for his sprocket question, which is how he eventually meets Turing.    |Harvest|Ibm_7950_Harvest| , an early  |supercomputer|Supercomputer|  built by  |IBM|Ibm|  for the National Security Agency for cryptanalysis. The fictionalized Harvest became operational in the early 1950s, under the supervision of Earl Comstock, while the actual system was installed in 1962.       The precise date of this storyline is not established, but the ages of characters, the technologies described, and certain date-specific references suggest that it is set in the late 1990s, at the time of the internet boom and the  |Asian_financial_crisis|Asian_Financial_Crisis| .     Randall Randy Lawrence Waterhouse, eldest grandson of Lawrence and Mary Waterhouse and an expert  |systems|System_Administrator|  and  |network_administrator|Network_Administrator|  with the  |Epiphyte|Epiphyte|  corporation. He is mentioned in Stephensons 2019 novel Fall, in which he has amassed a fortune that led to the creation of a charitable Foundation bearing his name.   Avi Halaby, Randys business partner in Epiphyte, of which he is the CEO. He is descended on his mothers side from  |New_Mexican_Crypto-Jews|Who_Is_A_Jewnew_Mexico.27S_Crypto-Jews| , which detail, while seemingly included as a pun, is explored further in  The Baroque Cycle . Avi is obsessed with using technology to prevent future genocides, namely by creating a handbook of basic technology and defense practices.   America Amy Shaftoe, Doug Shaftoes daughter who has moved from the U.S. to live with Doug in the Philippines, and who becomes Randys love interest.   Dr. Hubert Kepler, a.k.a. The Dentist, predatory billionaire investment fund manager, Randy and Avis business rival.   Eberhard Föhr, a member of Epiphyte and an expert in  |biometrics|Biometrics| .   John Cantrell, a member of Epiphyte, a  |libertarian|Libertarianism|  who is an expert in cryptography and who wrote the fictional cryptography program Ordo.   Tom Howard, a member of Epiphyte, a libertarian and  |firearms|Firearm|  enthusiast who is an expert in large computer installations.   Beryl Hagen,  |Chief_Financial_Officer|Chief_Financial_Officer|  of Epiphyte and veteran of a dozen startups.   Charlene, a liberal arts academic and Randys girlfriend at the beginning of the novel, who later moves to New Haven, Connecticut, to live and work with Dr. G.E.B. Kivistik.   Andrew Loeb, a former friend and now Randys enemy, a  |survivalist|Survivalist|  and  |neo-Luddite|Neo-Luddite|  whose lawsuits destroyed Randy and Avis first start-up, and who at the time of the novel works as a lawyer for Hubert Kepler. He is referred to by Randy as  |Gollum|Gollum| , comparing him to that character in the novels of  |J._R._R._Tolkien|J._R._R._Tolkien| .       Goto Dengo, a lieutenant in the  |Imperial_Japanese_Army|Imperial_Japanese_Army|  and a mining engineer involved in an Axis project to  |bury_looted_gold|Yamashitas_Gold|  in the Philippines. In the present-day storyline, he is a semi-retired chief executive of a large Japanese construction company, Goto Engineering.   Enoch Root, a mysterious, seemingly ageless former Catholic priest and physician, serving as a coast-watcher with the  |ANZACs|Anzac|  during World War II, later a chaplain in the top-secret British-American Unit 2702, and an important figure in the equally mysterious  Societas Eruditorum . He first appears on a  |Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal|  beach to save a badly injured Bobby Shaftoe. Hints about his longevity emerge when Root is critically injured in Norrsbruk, Sweden, and is wed to Julieta Kivistik on his death bed so that she and her unborn child can obtain British citizenship. Root is officially pronounced dead, but is slipped away, rapidly recovering after a mysterious therapeutic agent is obtained from his antique cigar box. He turns up in Manila later in 1944 and goes on to spend part of the 1950s with the National Security Agency and, by the 1990s, has been based mostly in the Philippines as a Catholic lay-worker while gadding about trying to bring Internet stuff to China. Root also appears in Stephensons  The Baroque Cycle , which is set between 1655 and 1714, and in his 2019 novel  Fall; or, Dodge in Hell , including a chapter set in late 21st-century Seattle.   Mr. Wing, a wartime northern Chinese slave of the Japanese in the Philippines, who went on to become a general in the  |Chinese_army|Peoples_Liberation_Army|  and later a senior official in the  |State_Grid_Corporation_of_China|State_Grid_Corporation_Of_China| . Described by Enoch Root as a wily survivor of many  |purges|History_Of_The_Peoples_Liberation_Armypeople.27S_Liberation_Army_In_The_Cultural_Revolution| , Wing is one of only two other survivors of the Japanese gold burial project, and he competes with Goto and Epiphyte to recover the buried treasure. Although Root and Wing do not meet during the action of the novel, Randy reflects that it is hard not to get the idea that Enoch Root and General Wing may have other reasons to be pissed off at each other.   Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe, son of Bobby Shaftoe and Glory Altamira, is introduced near the end of the World War II storyline as a toddler during the  |Liberation_of_Manila|Battle_Of_Manila| , when he first meets his father, who tries to explain Shaftoe family heritage, including their enthusiasm for displaying adaptability. In the modern-day story line, Doug is a retired U.S. Navy  |SEAL|Seal|  officer and  |Annapolis|U.S._Naval_Academy|  graduate, who lives in the Philippines and operates Semper Marine Services, an underwater survey business with his daughter, Amy, conducting treasure hunts as a sideline.   Dr. Günter Enoch Bobby G.E.B. Kivistik is introduced in the modern storyline as a smug, Oxford-educated liberal-arts professor from Yale who recruits, and later seduces, Randy Waterhouses girlfriend, Charlene. In the World War II storyline he is the unborn son of Julieta Kivistik and one of three possible fathers including Günter Bischoff, Enoch Root and Bobby Shaftoe. He is a minor character in Cryptonomicon, but both his birth and his participation in Charlenes War as Text conference catalyze major plot developments.   Mary cCmndhd Waterhouse, Randys Australian-born, Qwghlmian grandmother and Lawrences wife.       Portions of Cryptonomicon are notably complex and may be considered somewhat difficult by the non-technical reader. Several pages are spent explaining in detail some of the concepts behind cryptography and data storage security, including a description of  |Van_Eck_phreaking|Van_Eck_Phreaking| .         Stephenson also includes a precise description of  the  |Solitaire_cipher|Solitaire| , a  |cryptographic_algorithm|Cipher|  developed by  |Bruce_Schneier|Bruce_Schneier|  for use with a deck of  |playing_cards|Playing_Cards| , as part of the plot. The perl script was written by well known  |cryptographer|Cryptographer|  and  |cypherpunk|Cypherpunk| ,  |Ian_Goldberg|Ian_Goldberg| .       !/usr/bin/perl -s   $f$d?-1:1;$Dpack;$pshift;   $p~y/a-z/A-Z/;$U$D~s/U$/U$1/;   $D~s/U/$1U/;;~s/U/V/g;   $p~s/ $kord-64, & e/eg;$k0;   while$o.X   while length %5 & & !$d;   $o~s/./chr/eg;   $o~s/X$// if $d;$o~s/./$ & /g;   print $o  ;sub v  .
