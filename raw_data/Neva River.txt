              The Neva  is a  |river|River|  in northwestern  |Russia|Russia|  flowing from  |Lake_Ladoga|Lake_Ladoga|  through the western part of  |Leningrad_Oblast|Leningrad_Oblast|   to the  |Neva_Bay|Neva_Bay|  of the  |Gulf_of_Finland|Gulf_Of_Finland| . Despite its modest length of , it is the fourth largest river in  |Europe|Europe|  in terms of average  |discharge|Discharge|  .     The Neva is the only river flowing from Lake Ladoga. It flows through the city of  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| , three smaller towns of  |Shlisselburg|Shlisselburg| ,  |Kirovsk|Kirovsk_Leningrad_Oblast|  and  |Otradnoye|Otradnoye_Kirovsky_District_Leningrad_Oblast| , and dozens of settlements. The river is navigable throughout and is part of the  |Volga–Baltic_Waterway|Volga–Baltic_Waterway|  and  |White_Sea_–_Baltic_Canal|White_Sea_–_Baltic_Canal| . It is a site of numerous major historical events, including the  |Battle_of_the_Neva|Battle_Of_The_Neva|  in 1240 which gave  |Alexander_Nevsky|Alexander_Nevsky|  his name, the founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703, and the  |Siege_of_Leningrad|Siege_Of_Leningrad|  by the German army during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . The Neva river played a vital role in trade between  |Byzantium|Byzantium|  and  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| .       The area of the Neva river was originally inhabited by  |Finnic_people|Baltic_Finns| . The word neva is widely spread in  |Finnic_languages|Finnic_Languages|  with similar meanings. In  |Finnish|Finnish_Language|   it means  |poor_fen|Poor_Fen| , in  |Karelian|Karelian_Language|   watercourse and in  |Estonian|Estonian_Language|   waterway.      It has also been argued that the name derives from the  |Indo_European|Indo_European_Languages|  adjective newā which means new. The river began to flow around 1350 BC. However, the place names of the area dont support any Indo-European influence in the area before Scandinavian traders and Slavs started to enter the region in the 8th Century CE.           In the  |Paleozoic|Paleozoic| , 300–400 million years ago, the entire territory of the modern delta of the Neva River was covered by a sea. Modern relief was formed as a result of glacier activity. Its retreat formed the  |Littorina_Sea|Littorina_Sea| , the water level of which was some  higher than the present level of the Baltic Sea. Then, the  |Tosna_River|Tosna_River|  was flowing in the modern bed of the Neva, from east to west into the Litorinal Sea. In the north of the  |Karelian_Isthmus|Karelian_Isthmus| , the Littorina Sea united by a wide strait with  |Lake_Ladoga|Lake_Ladoga| . The  |Mga_River|Mga_River|  then flowed to the east, into Lake Ladoga, near the modern source of the Neva River; the Mga then was separated from the basin of the Tosna.      Near the modern Lake Ladoga, land rose faster, and a closed reservoir was formed. Its water level began to rise, eventually flooded the valley of Mga and broke into the valley of the river Tosna. The Ivanovo  |rapids|Rapid|  of the modern Neva were created in the breakthrough area. So about 2000 BC the Neva was created with its tributaries Tosna and Mga. According to some newer data, it happened at 1410–1250 BC making the Neva a rather young river.  The valley of Neva is formed by glacial and post-glacial sediments and it did not change much over the past 2500 years.  The delta of Neva was formed at that time, which is actually pseudodelta, as it was formed not by accumulation of river material but by plunging into the past sediments. St. Petersburg: Encyclopedia. – Moscow: Russian Political Encyclopedia. 2006        The Neva flows out of Lake Ladoga near  |Shlisselburg|Shlisselburg| , flows through the  |Neva_Lowland|Neva_Lowland|  and discharges into the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  in the  |Gulf_of_Finland|Gulf_Of_Finland| . It has a length of , and the shortest distance from the source to the mouth is . The river banks are low and steep, on average about  and  at the mouth. There are three sharp turns: the  |Ivanovskye_rapids|Ivanovskye_Rapids| , at Nevsky Forest Park of the Ust-Slavyanka region and near the  |Smolny_Institute|Smolny_Institute| , below the mouth of the river  |Ohta|Okhta_River| . The river declines  in elevation between source and mouth. At one point the river crosses a  |moraine|Moraine|  ridge and forms the Ivanovskye rapids. There, at the beginning of the rapids, is the narrowest part of the river: . The average flow rate in the rapids is about . The average width along the river is . The widest places, at , are in the delta, near the gates of the marine trading port, at the end of the Ivanovskye rapids near the confluence of the river Tosna, and near the island Fabrinchny near the source. The average depth is ; the maximum of  is reached above the  |Liteyny_Bridge|Liteyny_Bridge| , and the minimum of  is in Ivanovskye rapids.      In the area of Neva basin, rainfall greatly exceeds evaporation; the latter accounts for only 37.7  percent of the water consumption from Neva and the remaining 62.3  percent is water runoff.  Since 1859, the largest volume of  was observed in 1924 and the lowest in 1900 at . The average annual discharge is  or  on average.  Because of the uniform water-flow from Lake Ladoga to the Neva over the whole year, there are almost no floods and corresponding water rise in the spring. The Neva freezes throughout from early December to early April. The ice thickness is  within Saint Petersburg and  in other areas. Ice congestion may form in winter in the upper reaches of the river, this sometimes causes upstream floods. Of the total ice volume of Lake Ladoga, , less than 5  percent enters the Neva. The average summer water temperature is , and the swimming season lasts only about 1.5 months. The water is fresh, with medium turbidity; the average salinity is 61.3  mg/L and the  |calcium_bicarbonate|Calcium_Bicarbonate|  content is 7  mg/L.                 The basin area of Neva is 5,000  km²,  including the pools of Lake Ladoga and Onega . The basin contains 26,300 lakes and has a complex hydrological network of more than 48,300 rivers, however only 26 flow directly into Neva. The main tributaries are Mga, Tosna,  |Izhora|Izhora_River| ,  |Slavyanka|Slavyanka_River|  and Murzinka on the left, and  |Okhta|Okhta_River_Neva_Basin|  and  |Chernaya_River|Chernaya_River|  on the right side of Neva.     The hydrological network had been altered by the development of St. Petersburg through its entire history. When it was founded in 1703, the area was low and swampy and required construction of canals and ponds for drainage. The earth excavated during their construction was used to raise the city. At the end of the 19th century, the delta of Neva consisted of 48 rivers and canals and 101 islands. The most significant distributaries of the delta are listed in the table. Before construction of the  |Obvodny_Canal|Obvodny_Canal| , the left tributary of that area was Volkovka River; its part at the confluence is now called Monastyrka River. The  |Ladoga_Canal|Ladoga_Canal|  starts at the root of Neva and connects it along the southern coast of Lake Ladoga with  |Volkhov_River|Volkhov_River| .     Some canals of the delta were filled over time, so that only 42 islands remained by 1972, all within the city limits of St. Petersburg. The largest islands are  |Vasilievsky|Vasilievsky_Island|  at ,  |Petrogradsky|Petrogradsky_Island|  at ,  |Krestovsky|Krestovsky_Island|  at , and  |Dekabristov|Dekabristov_Island|  at ; others include  |Zayachy|Zayachy_Island| , Yelagin and  |Kamenny_Islands|Kamenny_Island| . At the source of the Neva, near Shlisselburg, there are the two small islands of Orekhovy and Fabrichny. Island Glavryba lies up the river, above the town of  |Otradnoye|Otradnoye_Kirovsky_District_Leningrad_Oblast| .                 There is almost no aquatic vegetation in Neva. The river banks mostly consist of sand,  |podsol|Podsol| ,  |gleysols|Gleysols| ,  |peat|Peat|  and boggy peat soils.  Several centuries ago, the whole territory of the Neva lowland was covered by  |pine|Pine|  and  |spruce|Norway_Spruce| |_moss|Moss| y forests. They were gradually reduced by the fires and cutting for technical needs. Extensive damage was caused during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .

Cleaning of wastewater in St. Petersburg started in 1979; by 1997 about 74% of wastewater was purified. This proportion rose to 85% in 2005, to 91.7% by 2008, and Feliks Karamzinov expected it to reach almost 100% by 2011 with the completion of the expansion of the main sewerage plant.

On 16 May 1703, the city of St. Petersburg was founded in the mouth of Neva and became capital of Russia in 1712. Neva became the central part of the city.

In 1858, a Joint-stock company St. Petersburg water supply was established, which built the first water supply network in the city. A two-stage water purification station was constructed in 1911.
