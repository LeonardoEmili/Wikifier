        A go-fast boat is a small, fast  |boat|Boat|  designed with a long narrow platform and a  |planing|Planing|  hull to enable it to reach high speeds.     During the era of  |Prohibition_in_the_United_States|Prohibition_In_The_United_States| , these boats joined the ranks of  |rum-runners|Rum-Running|  transferring illegal liquor from larger vessels waiting outside U.S.  |territorial_waters|Territorial_Waters|  to the mainland. The high speed of such craft enabled them to avoid interception by the  |Coast_Guard|United_States_Coast_Guard| . More recently the term cigarette boat has replaced the term rum-runner . The present era of cigarette boats, dating from the 1960s, owes much of their design to boats designed for  |offshore_powerboat_racing|Offshore_Powerboat_Racing| , particularly by designer and builder  |Donald_Aronow|Donald_Aronow| . During this period, these boats were used by drug smugglers to transfer drugs across the  |Caribbean|Caribbean|  to the United States.          A typical go-fast is  |laid-up|Fiberglassconstruction_Methods|  using a combination of  |fiberglass|Fiberglass| ,  |kevlar|Kevlar|  and  |carbon_fiber|Carbon_Fiber| , using a deep V style offshore racing hull ranging from 20 to 50 feet long, narrow in beam, and equipped with two or more powerful engines, often with more than 1000 combined  |horsepower|Horsepower| . The boats can typically travel at speeds over 80  |knots|Knot|  in calm waters, over 50 knots in choppy waters, and maintain 25 knots in the average five to seven foot  |Caribbean|Caribbean|  seas. They are heavy enough to cut through higher waves, although slower.       Reflecting their racing heritage, accommodations on these five-passengers-or-fewer boats are minimal. A small low cabin under the foredeck is typical, much smaller than a typical motor yacht of similar size. In addition to racing, most buyers buy these boats for their mystique, immense power, high top speeds, and sleek shape.          These boats are difficult to detect by  |radar|Radar|  except on flat calm seas or at close range. The United States Coast Guard and the DEA found them to be  |stealthy|Stealth_Technology| , fast, seaworthy, and very difficult to intercept using conventional craft. Because of this, Coast Guards have developed their own high-speed craft and use  |helicopters|Helicopter|  equipped with  |anti-materiel_rifles|Anti-Materiel_Rifle|  used to disable engines of fleeing boats. The U.S. Coast Guard go-fast boat is a  |rigid-hulled_inflatable_boat|Rigid-Hulled_Inflatable_Boat|  equipped with radar and powerful engines. The RHIB is armed with several types of  |non-lethal_weapons|Non-Lethal_Weapon|  and an  |M240|M240_Machine_Gun| |GPMG|General_Purpose_Machine_Gun| .
