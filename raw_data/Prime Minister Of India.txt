                          The prime minister of India  is the leader of the executive of the  |Government_of_India|Government_Of_India| . The prime minister is also the chief adviser to the  |President_of_India|President_Of_India|  and head of the  |Council_of_Ministers|Union_Council_Of_Ministers| . They can be a member of any of the two houses of the  |Parliament_of_India|Parliament_Of_India| —the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha|  and the  |Rajya_Sabha|Rajya_Sabha|  —but has to be a member of the political party or coalition, having a majority in the Lok Sabha.     The prime minister is the senior-most member of cabinet in the executive of government in a  |parliamentary_system|Westminster_System| . The prime minister selects and can dismiss members of the cabinet; allocates posts to members within the government; and is the presiding member and chairperson of the cabinet.     The  |Union_Cabinet|Union_Council_Of_Ministers|  headed by the prime minister is appointed by the  |president_of_India|President_Of_India|  to assist the latter in the administration of the affairs of the executive. Union cabinet is collectively responsible to the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha|  as per  |article_75|S_Constitution_Of_India_Part_V|  of the  |Constitution_of_India|Constitution_Of_India| . The prime minister has to enjoy the confidence of a majority in the Lok Sabha and shall resign if they are unable to prove majority when instructed by the president.       India follows a  |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System|  in which the prime minister is the presiding  |head_of_the_government|Head_Of_The_Government|  and chief of the executive of the government. In such systems, the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| , or, the head of states official representative  usually holds a purely ceremonial position and acts—on most matters—only on the advice of the prime minister.     The prime minister—if they are not already—shall become a  |member_of_parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  within six months of beginning his/her tenure. A prime minister is expected to work with other central ministers to ensure the passage of bills by the parliament.           Since 1947, there have been 14 different prime ministers. The first few decades after 1947 saw the  |Indian_National_Congress|Indian_National_Congress|  almost complete domination over the political map of India. Indias first prime minister— |Jawaharlal_Nehru|Jawaharlal_Nehru| —took oath on 15 August 1947. Nehru went on to serve as Prime Minister for 17 consecutive years, winning four  |general_elections|Elections_In_India|  in the process. His tenure ended in May 1964, on his death.   After the death of Nehru,  |Lal_Bahadur_Shastri|Lal_Bahadur_Shastri| —a former  |home_minister|Minister_Of_Home_Affairs|  and a leader of the Congress party—ascended to the position of Prime Minister. Shastris tenure saw the  |Indo_Pakistani_War_of_1965|Indo_Pakistani_War_Of_1965| . Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in  |Tashkent|Tashkent| , after signing the  |Tashkent_Declaration|Tashkent_Declaration| .      After Shastri,  |Indira_Gandhi|Indira_Gandhi| —Nehrus daughter—was elected as the countrys first woman prime minister. Indiras first term in office lasted 11 years, in which she took steps such as  |nationalisation_of_banks|Banking_In_Indianationalisation_In_The_1960S| ;  end of  |allowances|Privy_Purse_In_India|  and political posts, which were received by members of the royal families of the erstwhile  |princely_states|Princely_State|  of  |British_India|Presidencies_And_Provinces_Of_British_India| .  In addition, events such as the  |Indo_Pakistani_War_of_1971|Indo_Pakistani_War_Of_1971| ;  the establishment of a sovereign  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| ;  accession of  |Sikkim|Sikkim|  to India, through a  |referendum|1975_Sikkimese_Monarchy_Referendum|  in 1975;  and Indias  |first_nuclear_test|Smiling_Buddha|  in  |Pokhran|Pokhran|  occurred during Indiras first term. In 1975, President  |Fakhruddin_Ali_Ahmed|Fakhruddin_Ali_Ahmed| —on Indiras advice—imposed a  |state_of_emergency|The_Emergency| , therefore, bestowing the government with the power to  |rule_by_decree|Rule_By_Decree| , the period is known for human right violations.       After widespread protests, the emergency was lifted in 1977, and a  |general_election|Elections_In_India|  was to be held. All of the political parties of the opposition—after the conclusion of the emergency—fought together against the Congress, under the umbrella of the  |Janata_Party|Janata_Party| , in the  |general_election_of_1977|1977_Indian_General_Election| , and were successful in defeating the Congress. Subsequently,  |Morarji_Desai|Morarji_Desai| —a former  |deputy_prime_minister|Deputy_Prime_Minister_Of_India| —became the first non-Congress prime minister of the country. The government of Prime Minister Desai was composed of groups with opposite ideologies, in which unity and co-ordination were difficult to maintain. Ultimately, after two and a half years as PM; on 28 July 1979, Morarji tendered his resignation to the president; and his government fell. Thereafter,  |Charan_Singh|Charan_Singh| —a deputy prime minister in Desais cabinet—with outside, conditional support from Congress, proved a majority in  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha|  and took oath as Prime Minister.   However, Congress pulled its support shortly after, and Singh had to resign; he had a tenure of 5 months, the shortest in the history of the office.     In  |1980|1980_Indian_General_Election| , after a three-year absence, the Congress returned to power with an absolute majority. Indira Gandhi was elected Prime Minister a second time.  During her second tenure,  |Operation_Blue_Star|Operation_Blue_Star| —an  |Indian_Army|Indian_Army|  operation inside the  |Golden_Temple|Golden_Temple| , the most sacred site in  |Sikhism|Sikhism| —was conducted, resulting in reportedly thousands of deaths.  Subsequently, on 31 October 1984, Gandhi was shot dead by  |Satwant_Singh|Satwant_Singh|  and  |Beant_Singh|Beant_Singh| —two of her bodyguards—in the garden of her residence at 1,  |Safdarjung_Road|Safdarjung_Road| , New Delhi.        After Indira,  |Rajiv|Rajiv_Gandhi| —her eldest son and 40 years old at the time—was sworn in on the evening of 31 October 1984, becoming the youngest person ever to hold the office of Prime Minister. Rajiv immediately called for a general election. In the subsequent  |general_election|1984_Indian_General_Election| , the Congress secured an  |absolute_majority|Absolute_Majority| , winning 401 of 552 seats in the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha| , the maximum number received by any party in the history of India.    |Vishwanath_Pratap_Singh|V_P_Singh| —first  |finance_minister|Minister_Of_Finance|  and then later  |defence_minister|Minister_Of_Defence|  in Gandhis cabinet—uncovered irregularities, in what became to be known as the  |Bofors_scandal|Bofors_Scandal| , during his stint at the  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence| ; Singh was subsequently expelled from Congress and formed the  |Janata_Dal|Janata_Dal|  and—with the help of several anti-Congress parties—also formed the  |National_Front|National_Front| , a coalition of many political parties.      In the  |general_election_of_1989|1989_Indian_General_Election| , the National Front—with outside support from the  |Bharatiya_Janata_Party|Bharatiya_Janata_Party|  and the  |Left_Front|Left_Front| —came to power.   |V_P_Singh|V_P_Singh|  was elected Prime Minister. During a tenure of less than a year, Singh and his government accepted the  |Mandal_Commissions|Mandal_Commission|  recommendations.  Singhs tenure came to an end after he ordered the arrest of BJP member  |Lal_Krishna_Advani|L_K_Advani| ,  as a result, BJP withdrew its outside support to the government, V. P. Singh lost the subsequent  |vote_of_no_confidence|Motion_Of_No_Confidence|  146–320 and had to resign.  After V. P. Singhs resignation,  |Chandra_Shekhar|Chandra_Shekhar| —home minister in Singhs cabinet—along with 64  |members_of_parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  floated the  |Samajwadi_Janata_Party_|Samajwadi_Janata_Party| ,  and proved a majority in the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha|  with support from Congress.  But Shekhars premiership did not last long, Congress proceeded to withdraw its support; Shekhars government fell as a result, and  |new_elections|1991_Indian_General_Election|  were announced.      In the  |general_election_of_1991|1991_Indian_General_Election| , Congress—under the leadership of  |P_V_Narasimha_Rao|P_V_Narasimha_Rao| —formed a  |minority_government|Minority_Government| ; Rao became the first PM of  |South_India|South_India| n origin.  After the  |dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|Dissolution_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , India was on the brink of  |bankruptcy|Sovereign_Bankruptcy| , so, Rao took steps to  |liberalise|Liberalise|  the economy, and appointed  |Manmohan_Singh|Manmohan_Singh| —an economist and a former  |governor_of_the_Reserve_Bank_of_India|List_Of_Governors_Of_Reserve_Bank_Of_India| —as finance minister. Rao and Singh then took various steps to liberalise the economy, these resulted in an unprecedented economic growth in India.  His premiership, however, was also a witness to the  |demolition_of_the_Babri_Masjid|Demolition_Of_The_Babri_Masjid| , which resulted in the death of about 2,000 people.  Rao, however, did complete five continuous years in office, becoming the first prime minister outside of the  |Nehru—Gandhi_family|Nehru–Gandhi_Family|  to do so.     After the end of Raos tenure in May 1996, the nation saw four prime ministers in a span of three years, , two tenures of  |Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee|Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee| ; one tenure of  |H_D_Deve_Gowda|H_D_Deve_Gowda|  from 1 June 1996 to 21 April 1997; and one tenure of  |I_K_Gujral|I_K_Gujral|  from 21 April 1997 to 19 March 1998. The government of Prime Minister Vajpayee—elected in  |1998|1998_Indian_General_Election| —took some concrete steps. In May 1998—after a month in power—the government announced the  |conduct_of_five_underground_nuclear_explosions|Pokhran_Ii|  in  |Pokhran|Pokhran| .  In response to these tests, many  |western_countries|Western_World| , including the United States, imposed  |economic_sanctions|Economic_Sanctions|  on India,  but, due to the support received from Russia, France, the  |Gulf_countries|Arab_States_Of_The_Persian_Gulf|  and some other nations, the sanctions—were largely—not considered successful.   A few months later in response to the Indian nuclear tests, Pakistan also  |conducted_nuclear_tests|Chagai_I| .  Given the deteriorating situation between the two countries, the governments tried to improve bilateral relations. In February 1999, the India and Pakistan signed the  |Lahore_Declaration|Lahore_Declaration| , in which the two countries announced their intention to annul mutual enmity, increase trade and use their nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes.  In May 1999,  |All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam|All_India_Anna_Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam|  withdrew from the ruling  |National_Democratic_Alliance|National_Democratic_Alliance|  coalition;  Vajpayees government, hence, became a  |caretaker|Caretaker_Government|  one after losing a motion-of-no-confidence 269–270, this coincided with the  |Kargil_War|Kargil_War|  with Pakistan.  In the subsequent  |October_1999_general_election|1999_Indian_General_Election| , the BJP-led NDA and its affiliated parties secured a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha, winning 299 of 543 seats in the  |lower_house|Lower_House| .           Vajpayee continued the process of economic liberalisation during his reign, resulting in economic growth.  In addition to the development of infrastructure and basic facilities, the government took several steps to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as, the  |National_Highways_Development_Project|National_Highways_Development_Project|  and the  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana  ,  for the development of roads. But during his reign, the  |2002_Gujarat_communal_riots|2002_Gujarat_Riots|  in the state of Gujarat took place; resulting in about 2,000 deaths.  Vajpayees tenure as Prime Minister came to an end in May 2004, making him the first non-Congress PM to complete a full five-year tenure.     In the  |2004_election|2004_Indian_General_Election| , the Congress emerged as the largest party in a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament| ; Congress-led  |United_Progressive_Alliance|United_Progressive_Alliance|  —with outside support from the Left Front, the  |Samajwadi_Party|Samajwadi_Party|  and  |Bahujan_Samaj_Party|Bahujan_Samaj_Party|  among others—proved a majority in the Lok Sabha,  and Manmohan Singh was elected Prime Minister; becoming the first Sikh prime minister of the nation. During his tenure, the country retained the economic momentum gained during Prime Minister Vajpayees tenure.  Apart from this, the government succeeded in getting the  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 , and the  Right to Information Act, 2005  passed in the parliament.   Further, the government strengthened Indias relations with nations like  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| ;   Russia;  the  |Gulf_states|Arab_States_Of_The_Persian_Gulf| ; and the United States, culminating with the ratification of  |India–United_States_Civil_Nuclear_Agreement|India–United_States_Civil_Nuclear_Agreement|  near the end of Singhs first term.    At the same time, the  |November_2008_Mumbai_terrorist_attacks|2008_Mumbai_Attacks|  also happened during Singhs first term in office.   In the  |general_election_of_2009|2009_Indian_General_Election| , the mandate of UPA increased.   Prime Minister Singhs second term, however, was surrounded by accusations of high-level scandals and corruption.   Singh resigned as Prime Minister on 17 May 2014, after Congress defeat in the  |2014_general_election|2014_Indian_General_Election| .        In the  |general_election_of_2014|2014_Indian_General_Election| , the BJP-led NDA got an absolute majority, winning 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats; the BJP itself became the first party since 1984 to get a majority in the Lok Sabha.  |Narendra_Modi|Narendra_Modi| —the  |Chief_Minister_of_Gujarat|List_Of_Chief_Ministers_Of_Gujarat| —was elected Prime Minister, becoming the first prime minister to have been born in an independent India.       |Narendra_Modi|Narendra_Modi|  was re-elected as prime minister in 2019 with a bigger mandate than that of 2014. The BJP-led  |NDA|National_Democratic_Alliance|  winning 354 seats out of which  |BJP|Bjp|  secured 303 seats.             The  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_India|  envisions a scheme of affairs in which the  |president_of_India|President_Of_India|  is the head of state; in terms of Article 53 with office of the prime minister being the head of  |Council_of_Ministers|Council_Of_Ministers_Of_The_Republic_Of_India|  to assist and advise the president in the discharge of his/her constitutional functions. To quote, Article 53,  |74|Wikisource_Constitution_Of_India_Part_V|  and 75 provide as under;            Like most  |parliamentary_democracies|Parliamentary_System| , the  |presidents|Head_Of_State|  duties are mostly  |ceremonial|Titular_Ruler|  as long as the  |constitution|Constitution_Of_India|  and the  |rule_of_law|Rule_Of_Law|  is obeyed by the cabinet and the legislature. The prime minister of India is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power. The presidents constitutional duty is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law per  |article_60|S_Constitution_Of_India_Part_V| . In the constitution of India, the prime minister is mentioned in only four of its articles , however he/she plays a crucial role in the  |government_of_India|Government_Of_India|  by enjoying majority in the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha| .         According to Article 84 of the Constitution of India, which sets the principle qualification for member of Parliament, and Article 75 of the Constitution of India, which sets the qualifications for the minister in the Union Council of Ministers, and the argument that the position of Prime Minister has been described as  primus inter pares  ,  A prime minister must:     be a  |citizen_of_India|Indian_Nationality_Law| .   be a member of the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha|  or the  |Rajya_Sabha|Rajya_Sabha| . If the person chosen as the prime minister is neither a member of the Lok Sabha nor the Rajya Sabha at the time of selection, they must become a member of either of the houses within six months.   be above 25 years of age if they are a  |member_of_the_Lok_Sabha|Member_Of_Parliament_Lok_Sabha| , or, above 30 years of age if they are a  |member_of_the_Rajya_Sabha|Member_Of_Parliament_Rajya_Sabha| .   not hold any office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said governments.     If however a candidate is elected as the prime minister they must vacate their post from any private or government company and may take up the post only on completion of their term.       The prime minister is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the  |President_of_India|President_Of_India|  before entering office, the oath of office and secrecy, as per the Third Schedule of the Constitution of India.     Oath of office:        Oath of secrecy:          The prime minister serves on the pleasure of the president, hence, a prime minister may remain in office indefinitely, so long as the president has confidence in him/her. However, a prime minister must have the confidence of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the  |Parliament_of_India|Parliament_Of_India| .     However, the term of a prime minister can end before the end of a Lok Sabhas term, if a  |simple_majority|Majority|  of its members no longer have confidence in him/her, this is called a  |vote_of_no_confidence|Motion_Of_No_Confidence| .  Three prime ministers,  |I_K_Gujral|I_K_Gujral|  ,  |H_D_Deve_Gowda|H_D_Deve_Gowda|  and  |Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee|Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee|  have been voted out from office this way. In addition, a prime minister can also resign from office;  |Morarji_Desai|Morarji_Desai|  was the first prime minister to resign while in office.     Upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be a member of Parliament subject to the  Representation of the People Act, 1951 .               The prime minister leads the functioning and exercise of authority of the government of India. The president of India—subject to eligibility—invites a person who is commanding support of majority members of Lok Sabha to form the  |government_of_India|Government_Of_India| —also known as the central government or Union government—at the national level and exercise its powers.  In practice the prime minister nominates the members of their  |council_of_ministers|Union_Council_Of_Ministers|  to the president.    They also work upon to decide a core group of ministers , as in charge of the important functions and ministries of the  |government_of_India|Government_Of_India| .     The prime minister is responsible for aiding and advising the president in distribution of work of the government to various ministries and offices and in terms of the Government of India Rules, 1961.  The co-ordinating work is generally allocated to the  |Cabinet_Secretariat|Cabinet_Secretariat| .  While the work of the government is generally divided into various Ministries, the prime minister may retain certain portfolios if they are not allocated to any member of the cabinet.     The prime minister—in consultation with the cabinet—schedules and attends the sessions of the houses of parliament and is required to answer the question from the Members of Parliament to them as the in-charge of the portfolios in the capacity as Prime Minister of India.      Some specific ministries/department are not allocated to anyone in the cabinet but the prime minister themself. The prime minister is usually always in charge/head of:    |Ministry_of_Personnel_Public_Grievances_and_Pensions|Ministry_Of_Personnel_Public_Grievances_And_Pensions| |_Cabinet_Secretariat|Cabinet_Secretariat| |_Appointments_Committee_of_the_Cabinet|Appointments_Committee_Of_The_Cabinet| |_Cabinet_Committee_on_Security|Cabinet_Committee_On_Security| |_Cabinet_Committee_on_Economic_Affairs|Cabinet_Committee_On_Economic_Affairs| |_NITI_Aayog|Niti_Aayog| |_Department_of_Atomic_Energy|Department_Of_Atomic_Energy| |_Department_of_Space|Department_Of_Space| |_Nuclear_Command_Authority|Nuclear_Command_Authority|      The prime minister represents the country in various delegations, high level meetings and international organisations that require the attendance of the highest government office,  and also addresses to the nation on various issues of national or other importance.      Per  |Article_78|Wikisource_Constitution_Of_India_Part_V|  of the constitution, the official communication between the union cabinet and the president are through the prime minister. Other wise constitution recognises the prime minister as a member of the union cabinet only outside the sphere of union cabinet.       The prime minister recommends to the president—among others—names for the appointment of:      |Chief_Election_Commissioner_of_India|Chief_Election_Commissioner_Of_India|  and other  |Election_Commissioners_of_India|Election_Commissioners_Of_India| |_Comptroller_and_Auditor_General_of_India|Comptroller_And_Auditor_General_Of_India|    Chairperson and members of the  |Union_Public_Service_Commission|Union_Public_Service_Commission| |_Chief_Information_Commissioner_of_India|Chief_Information_Commissioner_Of_India|  and  |Information_Commissioners_of_India|Information_Commissioner_Of_India| |_finance_commission|Finance_Commission| |_Attorney_General_of_India|Attorney_General_Of_India|  and  |Solicitor_General_of_India|Solicitor_General_Of_India|      As the chairperson of  |Appointments_Committee_of_the_Cabinet|Appointments_Committee_Of_The_Cabinet|  , the prime minister—on the non-binding advice of the  |Cabinet_Secretary_of_India|Cabinet_Secretary_Of_India|  led-Senior Selection Board —decides the postings of top civil servants, such as,  |secretaries|Secretary_To_Government_Of_India| ,  |additional_secretaries|Additional_Secretary_To_Government_Of_India|  and  |joint_secretaries|Joint_Secretary_To_Government_Of_India|  in the government of India.    Further, in the same capacity, the PM decides the assignments of top military personnel such as the  |Chief_of_the_Army_Staff|Chief_Of_The_Army_Staff| ,  |Chief_of_the_Air_Staff|Chief_Of_The_Air_Staff| ,  |Chief_of_the_Naval_Staff|Chief_Of_The_Naval_Staff|  and commanders of operational and training commands.  In addition, the ACC also decides the posting of  |Indian_Police_Service|Indian_Police_Service|  officers—the  |All_India_Service|All_India_Services|  for policing, which staffs most of the higher level law enforcement positions at federal and state level—in the  |government_of_India|Government_Of_India| .     Also, as the  |Minister_of_Personnel_Public_Grievances_and_Pensions|Minister_Of_Personnel_Public_Grievances_And_Pensions| , the PM also exercises control over the  |Indian_Administrative_Service|Indian_Administrative_Service|  ,  the countrys premier civil service,   which staffs most of the senior civil service positions; the Public Enterprises Selection Board ;   and the  |Central_Bureau_of_Investigation|Central_Bureau_Of_Investigation|  , except for the selection of its director, who is chosen by a committee of: the prime minister, as chairperson; the  |leader_of_the_opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition|  in Lok Sabha; and the  |chief_justice|Chief_Justice_Of_India| .      Unlike most other countries, the prime minister does not have much influence over the selection of judges, that is done by a collegium of judges consisting of the  |Chief_Justice_of_India|Chief_Justice_Of_India| , four  |senior_most_judges|List_Of_Justices_Of_The_Supreme_Court_Of_Indiana|  of the  |Supreme_Court_of_India|Supreme_Court_Of_India|  and the  |chief_justice|List_Of_Current_Indian_Chief_Justices| —or the senior-most judge—of the concerned  |state_high_court|List_Of_High_Courts_In_India| .   The executive as a whole, however, has the right to send back a recommended name to the collegium for reconsideration,  this, however, is not a full Veto power, and the collegium can still put forward rejected name.         The prime minister acts as the leader of the house of the chamber of parliament—generally the  |Lok_Sabha|Lok_Sabha| —he/she belongs to. In this role, the prime minister is tasked with representing the executive in the legislature, he/she is also expected to announce important legislation, and is further expected to respond to the  |oppositions|Official_Opposition|  concerns.  Article 85 of the  |Indian_constitution|Constitution_Of_India|  confers the president with the power to convene and end extraordinary sessions of the parliament, this power, however, is exercised only on the advise of the prime minister and his/her council, so, in practice, the prime minister does exercise some control over affairs of the parliament.       Article 75 of the Constitution of India confers the parliament with the power to decide the remuneration and other benefits of the prime minister and other ministers are to be decided by the Parliament. The Constitution of India, Article 75-6 and is renewed from time to time. The original remuneration for the prime minister and other ministers were specified in the Part B of the second schedule of the constitution, which was later removed by an amendment.     In 2010, the prime ministers office reported that he/she does not receive a formal salary, but was only entitled to monthly allowances.  That same year  The Economist  reported that, on a  |purchasing_power_parity|Purchasing_Power_Parity|  basis, the prime minister received an equivalent of $4106 per year. As a percentage of the countrys per-capita GDP , this is the lowest of all countries The Economist surveyed.           The  |7_Lok_Kalyan_Marg|7_Lok_Kalyan_Marg| —previously called the 7, Race Course Road—in New Delhi, serves as the official place of residence for the prime minister of India. For ground travel, the prime minister uses a highly modified, armoured version of a  |Range_Rover|Range_Rover| ,  while for air travel,  |Boeing_777_300ERs|Boeing_777_300Er| —designated by the call sign  |Air_India_One|Air_India_One|  , and maintained by the  |Indian_Air_Force|Indian_Air_Force| —are used.   The  |Special_Protection_Group|Special_Protection_Group|  is charged with protecting the sitting prime minister and his/her family.            The  |prime_ministers_Office|Prime_Ministers_Office|  acts as the principal workplace of the prime minister. The office is located at  |South_Block|South_Block| , and is a 20-room complex, and has the  |Cabinet_Secretariat|Cabinet_Secretariat| , the  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence|  and the  |Ministry_of_External_Affairs|Ministry_Of_External_Affairs|  adjacent to it. The office is headed by the  |principal_secretary_to_the_prime_minister_of_India|Principal_Secretary_To_The_Prime_Minister_Of_India| , generally a former civil servant, mostly from the  |Indian_Administrative_Service|Indian_Administrative_Service|  and rarely from the  |Indian_Foreign_Service|Indian_Foreign_Service|  .       Former prime ministers are entitled to a bungalow,   former prime ministers are also entitled the same facilities as those given to a serving cabinet minister, this includes a fourteen-member secretarial staff, for a period of five years; reimbursement of office expenses; six domestic  |executive_class|Business_Class|  air tickets each year; and security cover from the  |Special_Protection_Group|Special_Protection_Group| .
