   A file manager or file browser is a  |computer_program|Computer_Program|  that provides a  |user_interface|User_Interface|  to manage  |files|Computer_Files|  and  |folders|Folder| . The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening , renaming,  |moving_or_copying|File_Copying| ,  |deleting|File_Deletion|  and searching for files, as well as modifying  |file_attributes|File_Attribute| , properties and  |file_permissions|File_Permissions| .  |Folders|Folder|  and files may be displayed in a  |hierarchical_tree|Tree_Structure|  based on their  |directory_structure|Directory_Structure| . Some file managers contain features inspired by  |web_browsers|Web_Browser| , including forward and back navigational buttons.     Some file managers provide  |network|Computer_Network|  connectivity via  |protocols|Communications_Protocol| , such as  |FTP|File_Transfer_Protocol| ,  |HTTP|Hypertexttransferprotocol| ,  |NFS|Network_File_System| ,  |SMB|Server_Message_Block|  or  |WebDAV|Webdav| . This is achieved by allowing the user to browse for a  |file_server|File_Server|  or by providing its own full client implementations for file server protocols.       A term that predates the usage of file manager is directory editor. An early directory editor,  |DIRED|Dired| , was developed circa 1974 at the  |Stanford_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory|Stanford_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory|  by  |Stan_Kugell|Stan_Kugell| .        A directory editor was written for  |EXEC_8|Exec_8|  at the University of Maryland, and was available to other users at that time. The term was used by other developers, including  |Jay_Lepreau|Jay_Lepreau| , who wrote the dired program in 1980,  which ran on  |BSD|Bsd| . This was in turn inspired by an older program with the same name running on  |TOPS_20|Tops_20| . Dired inspired other programs, including  |dired|Dired| , the editor script , and ded.          File-list file managers are lesser known and older than orthodox file managers.     One such file manager is flist, which was introduced sometime before 1980 on the  |Conversational_Monitor_System|Conversational_Monitor_System| .
