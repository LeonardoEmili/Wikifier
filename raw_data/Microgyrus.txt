A microgyrus is an area of the  |cerebral_cortex|Cerebral_Cortex|  that includes only four  |cortical_layers|Cortical_Layers|  instead of six.     Microgyria are believed by some to be part of the genetic lack of prenatal development which is a cause of, or one of the causes of,  |dyslexia|Dyslexia| .      |Albert_Galaburda|Albert_Galaburda|  of  |Harvard_Medical_School|Harvard_Medical_School|  noticed that  |language_centers|Language_Center|  in dyslexic brains showed microscopic flaws known as  |ectopias|Neuronal_Ectopia|  and microgyria . Both affect the normal six-layer structure of the  |cortex|Cerebral_Cortex| . These flaws affect connectivity and functionality of the cortex in critical areas related to sound and  |visual_processing|Visual_Processing| . These and similar structural abnormalities may be the basis of the inevitable and hard to overcome difficulty in reading.
