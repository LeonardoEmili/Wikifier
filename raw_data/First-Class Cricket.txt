           First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest-standard international or domestic matches in the sport of  |cricket|Cricket| . A first-class match is of three or more days scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams. Matches must allow for the teams to play two  |innings|Innings|  each although, in practice, a team might play only one innings or none at all.     First-class cricket , along with historical  |single-wicket|Single_Wicket_Cricket|  and the modern  |limited-overs_forms|Limited_Overs_Cricket|  of  |List_A|List_A_Cricket|  and  |Twenty20|Twenty20| , is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket. The origin of the term first-class cricket is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status, effective in 1895, following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894. Subsequently, at a meeting of the  |Imperial_Cricket_Conference|International_Cricket_Council|  in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively. This has left historians, and especially statisticians, with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches, especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain. The solution put forward by the  |Association_of_Cricket_Statisticians_and_Historians|Association_Of_Cricket_Statisticians_And_Historians|  is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as important matches.      |Test_cricket|Test_Cricket| , the highest standard of cricket, is statistically a form of first-class cricket, though the term first-class is mainly used to refer to domestic competition. A players first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches.       Before 1894 first-class cricket was a common term used loosely to suggest that a match had a high standard; adjectives like great , important and major were also loosely applied to such matches. There was at the time no concept of what became  |Test_cricket|Test_Cricket|  and so an international match would be called a first-class one, as would any match involving two senior county clubs. At the beginning of the 1890s, there were only four formally constituted county clubs:  |Sussex|Sussex_County_Cricket_Club|  is the oldest, formed in 1839, and it had been followed by  |Kent|Kent_County_Cricket_Club| ,  |Nottinghamshire|Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club|  and  |Surrey|Surrey_County_Cricket_Club| . In the early 1860s, several more clubs were founded and questions began to be raised in the sporting press about which should be categorised as first-class, but there was considerable disagreement in the answers. In 1880, the  |Cricket_Reporting_Agency|Cricket_Reporting_Agency|  was founded. It acquired influence through the decade especially by association with  Wisden Cricketers Almanack   and the press came to generally rely on its information and opinions. ACS, First-class Match Guide, p. 4.     The term acquired official status, though limited to matches in Great Britain, following a meeting at  |Lords|Lords|  in May 1894 between the  |Marylebone_Cricket_Club|Marylebone_Cricket_Club|  committee and the secretaries of the clubs involved in the official  |County_Championship|County_Championship| , which had begun in 1890. As a result, those clubs became first-class from 1895 along with MCC,  |Cambridge_University|Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club| ,  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University_Cricket_Club| , senior cricket touring teams  and other teams designated as such by MCC . ACS, First-class Match Guide, pp. 4–5. Officially, therefore, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1895 season between MCC and  |Nottinghamshire|Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club|  at Lords on 1 and 2 May, MCC winning by 37 runs.          The term first-class cricket was formally defined by the then  |Imperial_Cricket_Conference|International_Cricket_Council|  on 19 May 1947. It was made clear that the definition will not have retrospective effect . The definition is as follows: Wisden 1948, p. 813.     A match of three or more days duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, shall be regarded as a first-class fixture. Matches in which either team have more than eleven players or which are scheduled for less than three days shall not be regarded as first-class. The Governing body in each country shall decide the status of teams.     For example, MCC was authorised to determine the status of matches played in Great Britain. For all intents and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.     Hence, official judgment of status is the responsibility of the governing body in each country that is a full member of the  |International_Cricket_Council|International_Cricket_Council|  . The governing body grants first-class status to international teams and to domestic teams that are representative of the countrys highest playing standard. Later ICC rulings make it possible for international teams from associate members of the ICC to achieve first-class status but it is dependent on the status of their opponents in a given match.        According to the ICC definition, a match may be adjudged first-class if:   it is of three or more days scheduled duration   each side playing the match has eleven players   each side may have two innings   the match is played on natural, and not artificial, turf   the match is played at a venue which meets certain standard criteria regarding venues   the match conforms to the  |Laws_of_Cricket|Laws_Of_Cricket| , except for only minor amendments   the sports governing body in the appropriate nation, or the ICC itself, recognises the match as first-class.     A Test match is a first-class match played between two ICC full member countries subject to their current status at the ICC and the application of ICC conditions when the match is played.       In 2010, the ICC published its Classification of Official Cricket which includes the criteria with which a match must comply to achieve a desired categorisation. In the section on first-class cricket, there is a list of the types of match that should qualify. It is important to note, given the differences in opinion about what constitutes a first-class match, that the ICC clearly stipulates that its match type list is not exhaustive and is merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the first-class definition . For example, the list includes matches of recognised first-class teams versus international touring teams; and the leading domestic championships such as the  |County_Championship|County_Championship| ,  |Sheffield_Shield|Sheffield_Shield| ,  |Ranji_Trophy|Ranji_Trophy| , etc.        The absence of any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 is problematic for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way. They have responded by compiling their own match lists and allocating a strictly unofficial first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are  |variations_in_published_cricket_statistics|Variations_In_Published_Cricket_Statistics| .       A key issue for the statisticians is when first-class cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951,  |Roy_Webber|Roy_Webber|  argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864  cannot be regarded as first-class and their records are used for their historical associations . Webber, pp. 9–10. This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 cricket matches, first-class is essentially a statistical concept while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webbers rationale was that cricket was generally weak before 1864 and match details were largely incomplete, especially  |bowling|Bowling|  analyses, which hindered compilation of records. According to Webbers view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1864 season between  |Cambridge_University|Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club|  and MCC at  |Fenners|Fenners|  on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets.        When the  |Association_of_Cricket_Statisticians_and_Historians|Association_Of_Cricket_Statisticians_And_Historians|  published its Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles in 1982, it tentatively agreed with Webbers 1864 start date by saying that the line between first-class and other matches becomes more easily discernible about that date . ACS, First-class Match Guide, p. 3. A year earlier, the ACS had published its Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863 in which it listed all the known matches during that period which it considered to have historical importance. Therefore, pre-1895 matches of a high standard are termed important matches and are the equivalent of first-class matches played since 1895. The ACS did stipulate that they had taken a more lenient view of importance regarding matches played in the 18th century than they did of matches played in the 19th century. As they explained, surviving details of 18th century matches are typically incomplete while there is a fairly comprehensive store of data about 19th century matches, certainly since 1825. ACS, Important Match Guide, p. 4.       Subsequently, Webbers view has been challenged by those who suggest earlier dates for the commencement of first-class statistics .  |Bill_Frindall|Bill_Frindall|  believed that 1815 should be the start to encompass the entire  |roundarm_bowling|Roundarm_Bowling|  phase of crickets history. However, roundarm did not begin in earnest until 1827. In Frindalls view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1815 season between MCC and  |Middlesex|Middlesex_County_Cricket_Teams|  at Lords on 31 May and 1 June, Middlesex winning by 16 runs.  The most significant internet-based views are those of CricketArchive and  ESPNcricinfo  , both of which hold that the earliest first-class match was  |Hampshire|Hampshire_County_Cricket_Teams|  versus  |All-England|Non-International_England_Cricket_Teams|  at  |Broadhalfpenny_Down|Broadhalfpenny_Down|  on 24 and 25 June 1772. CA has numbered this match f1 and CI as First-Class 1 .         However commendable these views may be, they are not only unofficial but also entirely statistical. The 1772 match left a scorecard that is complete apart from the bowling analyses and so the data is sufficient for a statistical study, especially as the scorecard was itself the start of a trend and there are surviving scorecards from every season commencing 1772. The historical view centres on the historical significance of a match and its known contemporary importance measured by, as is often the case with early matches, the amount of money at stake. Other factors are the size of the crowd, if known, and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press. The earliest match known to have been accorded superior status in a contemporary report and to have been played for a large sum of money was one in  |Sussex|Sussex|  between two unnamed eleven-a-side teams contesting fifty  |guineas|Guinea| .
