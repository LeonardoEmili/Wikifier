   A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for  |social_change|Social_Change|  and hence part of the broader category of topical songs . It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre.     Among social movements that have an associated body of songs are the  |abolition|Abolitionism_In_The_United_States|  movement, womens  |suffrage|Suffrage| , the  |labour_movement|Labour_Movement| , the  |human_rights_movement|Human_Rights_Movement| ,  |civil_rights|Civil_Rights| , the  |anti-war|Anti-War|  movement and 1960s  |counterculture|Counterculture_Of_The_1960S| , the  |feminist|Feminism|  movement, the  |sexual_revolution|Sexual_Revolution| , the  |gay_rights|Lgbt_Social_Movements|  movement,  |animal_rights|Animal_Rights|  movement,  |vegetarianism|Vegetarianism|  and  |veganism|Veganism| ,  |guns_controle|Guns_Controle| , and  |environmentalism|Environmentalism| .     Protest songs are often situational, having been associated with a through context.  |Goodnight_Irene|Goodnight_Irene|  , for example, acquired the aura of a protest song because it was written by  |Lead_Belly|Lead_Belly| , a black convict and social outcast, although on its face it is a love song. Or they may be abstract, expressing, in more general terms, opposition to injustice and support for peace, or  |free_thought|Free_Thought| , but audiences usually know what is being referred to.  |Ludwig_van_Beethovens|Ludwig_Van_Beethoven| |Ode_to_Joy|Ode_To_Joy|  , a song in support of universal brotherhood, is a song of this kind. It is a setting of a poem by  |Friedrich_Schiller|Friedrich_Schiller|  celebrating the continuum of living beings , to which Beethoven himself added the lines that all men are brothers. Songs which support the status quo do not qualify as protest songs. To protest is to verbalize a dissatisfaction with the status quo, Elizabeth J. Kizer, Protest Song Lyrics as Rhetoric, Popular Music and Society IX, No. 1 : 3.     Protest song texts may have significant cognitive content. The labour movement musical  Pins and Needles  summed up the definition of a protest song in a number called Sing Me a Song of Social Significance.  |Phil_Ochs|Phil_Ochs|  once explained, A protest song is a song thats so specific that you cannot mistake it for BS.      An 18th-century example of a topical song intended as a feminist protest song is Rights of Woman , sung to the tune of  |God_Save_the_King|God_Save_The_King|  , written anonymously by A Lady and published in the Philadelphia Minerva, October 17, 1795. There is no evidence that it was ever sung as a movement song, however.  The song contains such lines as God save each females right , Woman is free , and Let woman have a share . A more recent song advocating sexual liberation is  |Sexo|Sexo|  by  |Los_Prisioneros|Los_Prisioneros| .         The sociologist R. Serge Denisoff saw protest songs rather narrowly in terms of their function, as forms of persuasion or  |propaganda|Propaganda| . R. Serge Denisoff, Songs of Persuasion: A Sociological Analysis of Urban Propaganda Songs , The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 79, No. 314 , pp. 581–589. Denisoff saw the protest song tradition as originating in the psalms or songs of grassroots  |Protestant|Protestantism|  religious revival movements, terming these hymns protest-propaganda , as well.     Denisoff subdivided protest songs as either magnetic or rhetorical . Magnetic protest songs were aimed at attracting people to the movement and promoting group solidarity and commitment – for example,  |Keep_Your_Eyes_on_the_Prize|Keep_Your_Eyes_On_The_Prize|  and  |We_Shall_Overcome|We_Shall_Overcome|  . Rhetorical protest songs, on the other hand, are often characterized by individual indignation and offer a straightforward political message designed to change political opinion. Denisoff argued that although rhetorical songs often are not overtly connected to building a larger movement, they should nevertheless be considered as protest-propaganda .  Examples include  |Bob_Dylans|Bob_Dylan| |Masters_of_War|Masters_Of_War|  and  |Whats_Going_On|Whats_Going_On|  by  |Marvin_Gaye|Marvin_Gaye| .     Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, in Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century , take issue with what they consider Denisoffs reductive approach to the history and function of song in social movements. They point out that Denisoff had paid little attention to the song tunes of protest music, considered them strictly subordinate to the texts, a means to the message. It is true that in the highly text-oriented western European song tradition, tunes can be subordinate, interchangeable, and even limited in number , nevertheless, Eyerman and Jamison point out that some of the most effective protest songs gain power through their appropriation of tunes that are bearers of strong cultural traditions. Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century , p. 43. They also note that: There is more to music and movements than can be captured within a functional perspective, such as Denisoffs, which focuses on the use made of music within already-existing movements. Music, and song, we suggest, can maintain a movement even when it no longer has a visible presence in the form of organizations, leaders, and demonstrations, and can be a vital force in preparing the emergence of a new movement. Here the role and place of music needs to be interpreted through a broader framework in which tradition and ritual are understood as processes of identity and identification, as encoded and embodied forms of collective meaning and memory. Eyerman and Jamison, Music and Social Movements, pp. 43–44.      |Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|  described the freedom songs this way: They invigorate the movement in a most significant way  ... these freedom songs serve to give unity to a movement.

Its origins date back to the 1920s and has been primarily evolved by the women referred to as , who performed in cafes, bars or bordellos, often for men.  A typical performance included the cheikhas accompanied by two to four male instrumentalists playing a gasba and gallal . Rai was considered a rejection of the traditional Algerian music of the time, and the cheikhas . . . used lewd lyrics focusing on the hardships of life facing peasant women in a big city, the pain of love, the lure of alcohol, immigration, and mourning.     By the 1950s, and through the 1960s, male musicians began performing rai music and incorporated the use of what was considered to be modern musical instruments of that time, such as the violin, the accordion, the lute, and the trumpet. As the genre evolved over time, it continued to have associations with political movements and organizations, such as the Algerian Freedom Fighters who rallied against the French occupation. Even after Algeria achieved independence in 1962, Rai continued to have an adverse relationship with the Algerian government, which exerted a tight grip upon its culture. In fact, Raï had been banned from broadcast media, though it thrived in underground spaces, such as cabarets. It was forbidden to the point of one popular singer,  |Cheb_Hasni|Cheb_Hasni| , being assassinated. However, since the government lifted its restrictions on rai in the 1980s, it has enjoyed some considerable success.     The song Parisien Du Nord by  |Cheb_Mami|Cheb_Mami|  is a recent example of how the genre has been used as a form of protest, as the song was written as a protest against the racial tensions that sparked the  |2005_French_riots|2005_Civil_Unrest_In_France| . According to Memi: It is a song against racism, so I wanted to sing it with a North African who was born in France  ... Because of that and because of his talent, I chose  |K-Mel|K-Mel| . In the song, we say, In your eyes, I feel like foreigner. Its like the kids who were born in France but they have Arab faces. They are French, and they should be considered French.  Rai continues to be regarded, as Al-Neen states, music of rebellion and the symbol of cynicism. Rai has emerged as an outlet for voicing the frustrations of youths and placing greater emphasis on freedom and liberty.       Indigenous issues feature prominently in politically inspired Australian music and include the topics of  |land_rights|Land_Rights| , and aboriginal  |deaths_in_custody|Deaths_In_Custody| . One of the most prominent Australian bands to confront these issues is  |Yothu_Yindi|Yothu_Yindi| . Other Australian bands to have confronted indigenous issues include  |Tiddas|Tiddas| ,  |Kev_Carmody|Kev_Carmody| ,  |Archie_Roach|Archie_Roach| ,  |Christine_Anu|Christine_Anu| ,  |The_Herd|The_Herd| ,  |Neil_Murray|Neil_Murray| ,  |Blue_King_Brown|Blue_King_Brown| , the  |John_Butler_Trio|John_Butler_Trio| ,  |Midnight_Oil|Midnight_Oil| ,  |Warumpi_Band|Warumpi_Band| ,  |Paul_Kelly|Paul_Kelly| ,  |Powderfinger|Powderfinger|  and  |Xavier_Rudd|Xavier_Rudd| .     In addition to Indigenous issues, many Australian protest singers have sung about the futility of war. Notable anti-war songs include  |And_The_Band_Played_Waltzing_Matilda|And_The_Band_Played_Waltzing_Matilda|  by  |Eric_Bogle|Eric_Bogle| , and  |A_Walk_in_the_Light_Green|A_Walk_In_The_Light_Green|  by  |Redgum|Redgum| , most often remembered by its chorus I was only nineteen .         The first famous Belorussian protest songs were created at the beginning of the 20th century during the rise of Belorussian Peoples Republic and war for independence from Russian Empire and Soviet Russia. This period includes such protest songs as Advieku My Spali and Vajaćki Marš , which was an anthem of Belorussian Peoples Republic.   The next period of protest songs was in the 1990s, with many created by such bands as NRM, Novaje Nieba and others, which led to unspoken prohibition of these musicians. As an example, Lavon Volski, frontman of NRM, Mroja and Krambambulia, had issues with officials at the majority of his concert due to the criticism of the Belorussian political system. One of the most famous bands of Belarus,  |Lyapis_Trubetskoy|Lyapis_Trubetskoy| , was forbidden from performing in the country due to being critical of  |Aleksandr_Lukashenka|Aleksandr_Lukashenka|  in his lyrics. These prohibitions lead most forbidden bands to organize concerts in Vilnius, which, though situated in modern Lithuania, is considered to be a Belorussian historical capital because less than a hundred years ago most dwellers of Vilnius were Belorussians. But in the middle of the 2010s, the situation began to change a bit and many protest bands started to organize concerts in Belarus.           English folk songs from the late medieval and early modern period reflect the social upheavals of their day. In 1944 the Marxist scholar  |A._L._Lloyd|A._L._Lloyd|  claimed that  |The_Cutty_Wren|The_Cutty_Wren|  song constituted a coded anthem against feudal oppression and actually dated back to the  |English_peasants_revolt_of_1381|English_Peasants_Revolt_Of_1381| , making it the oldest extant European protest song.  and  He offered no evidence for his assertion, however and no trace of the song has been found before the 18th century. When pressed, Lloyd was said to have admitted later that he made it all up. See the discussion at . Cutty means small and the wren was a bird traditionally hunted in winter: The Cutty Wren , in fact, has been reliably associated with the widespread 18th-century British folk Christmas alms-seeking rituals of mumming and  |wassailing|Wassailing| , which did involve a sanctioned reversal of social roles, and which, moreover, were sometimes accompanied by an air of suppressed menace, or led to open disorders, causing them to be regulated or even banned at various times, as under Cromwell. Despite Lloyds dubious claim about its origins, however, the Cutty Wren was revived and used as a protest song in the 1950s folk revival, an example of the importance of context in determining what may be considered a protest song. In contrast, the rhyme, When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman? , is attested as authentically originating in the 1381 Peasant Revolt, though no tune associated with it has survived. P. H. Freedman, Images of the Medieval Peasant , p. 60. Ballads celebrating social bandits like  |Robin_Hood|Robin_Hood| , from the 14th century onwards, can be seen as expressions of a desire for social justice, though although social criticism is implied and there is no overt questioning of the status quo. G. Seal, The Outlaw Legend: A Cultural Tradition in Britain, America and Australia , pp. 19–31.     The era of civil and religious wars of the 17th century in Britain gave rise to the radical communistic millenarian  |Levellers|Levellers|  and  |Diggers|Diggers|  movements and their associated ballads and hymns, as, for example, the  |Diggers_Song|Diggers_Song|  . Noted by German Marxist theoretician  |Eduard_Bernstein|Eduard_Bernstein|  , in Cromwell & Communism: Socialism and Democracy in the Great English Revolution, originally published in 1895, translated by  |H._J._Stenning|H._J._Stenning|  , pp. 111-2. with the incendiary verse:     But the Gentry must come down,   and the poor shall wear the crown.   Stand up now, Diggers all!     The Digger movement was violently crushed, and so it is not surprising if few overt protest songs associated with it have survived. From roughly the same period, however, songs protesting wars and the human suffering they inflict abound, though such song do not generally explicitly condemn the wars or the leaders who wage them. For example, The Maunding Souldier or The Fruits of Warre is Beggery , framed as a begging appeal from a crippled soldier of the Thirty Years War . V. de Sola Pinto and Allan Edwin Rodway, The Common Muse: An Anthology of Popular British Ballad Poetry, XVth-XXth Century , pp. 148–50. Such songs have been known, strictly speaking, as songs of complaint rather than of protest, since they offered no solution or hint of rebellion against the status quo. For the distinction between songs of complaint and protest songs, see for example, Dick Weisman, Which Side Are You On: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America , pp. 36–37.     The advent of industrialization in the 18th and early 19th centuries was accompanied by a series of protest movements and a corresponding increase in the number of topical social protest songs and ballads. An important example is The Triumph of General Ludd , which built a fictional persona for the alleged leader of the early 19th century anti-technological Luddite movement in the cloth industry of the north midlands, and which made explicit reference to the Robin Hood tradition. K. Binfield, ed., The Writings of the Luddites , pp. 98–100. A surprising English folk hero immortalized in song is Napoleon Bonaparte , the military figure most often the subject of popular ballads, many of them treating him as the champion of the common working man in songs such as the Bonny Bunch of Roses and Napoleons Dream . V. Gammon, The Grand Conversation: Napoleon and British Popular Balladry Musical Traditions, http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/boney.htm, retrieved 19 February 2009. As labour became more organized songs were used as anthems and propaganda, for miners with songs such as The Black Leg Miner , and for factory workers with songs such as The Factory Bell . J. Raven, The Urban & Industrial Songs of the Black Country and Birmingham , pp. 52 and 61, and M. Vicinus, The Industrial Muse: A Study of Nineteenth Century British Working-class Literature , p. 46.     These industrial protest songs were largely ignored during the first English folk revival of the later 19th and early 20th century, which had focused on songs that had been collected in rural areas where they were still being sung and on music education. They were revived in the 1960s and performed by figures such as A. L. Lloyd on his album The Iron Muse . B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music , pp. 32–3. In the 1980s the anarchist rock band Chumbawamba recorded several versions of traditional English protest songs as  |English_Rebel_Songs_1381–1914|English_Rebel_Songs_1381–1914| .
