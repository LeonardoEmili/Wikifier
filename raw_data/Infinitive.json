The form without to is called the bare infinitive, and the form with to is called the full infinitive or to-infinitive.     In many other languages the infinitive is a single word, often with a characteristic inflective ending, like morir in Spanish , manger in French , portare in Latin , lieben in German , etc. However, some languages have no infinitive forms. Many Native American languages , and some languages in Africa and Australia do not have direct equivalents to infinitives or verbal noun s. Instead, they use finite verb forms in ordinary clauses or various special constructions.     Being a verb, an infinitive may take object s and other complements and modifiers to form a verb phrase . Like other non-finite verb forms , infinitives do not generally have an expressed subject ; thus an infinitive verb phrase also constitutes a complete non-finite clause , called an infinitive clause. Such phrases or clauses may play a variety of roles within sentences, often being noun s , and sometimes being adverb s or other types of modifier. Many verb forms known as infinitives differ from gerund s in that they do not inflect for case or occur in adpositional phrase s. Instead, infinitives often originate in earlier inflectional forms of verbal nouns. Unlike finite verbs, infinitives are not usually inflected for tense , person , etc. either, although some degree of inflection sometimes occurs; for example Latin has distinct active and passive infinitives.       An infinitive phrase is a verb phrase constructed with the verb in infinitive form. This consists of the verb together with its object s and other complement s and modifier s. Some examples of infinitive phrases in English are given below – these may be based on either the full infinitive or the bare infinitive .   sleep   write ten letters   go to the store for a pound of sugar     Infinitive phrases often have an implied grammatical subject making them effectively clause s rather than phrases. Such infinitive clauses or infinitival clauses, are one of several kinds of non-finite clause . They can play various grammatical roles like a constituent of a larger clause or sentence; for example it may form a noun phrase or adverb . Infinitival clauses may be embedded within each other in complex ways, like in the sentence:   I want to tell you that Brett Favre is going to get married.   Here the infinitival clause to get married is contained within the finite dependent clause that Brett Favre is going to get married; this in turn is contained within another infinitival clause, which is contained in the finite independent clause .     The grammatical structure of an infinitival clause may differ from that of a corresponding finite clause. For example, in German , the infinitive form of the verb usually goes to the end of its clause, whereas a finite verb typically comes in second position .       Following certain verbs or prepositions, infinitives commonly do have an expressed subject, e.g.,   I want them to eat their dinner.   For him to fail now would be a disappointment.   As these examples illustrate, the subject of the infinitive is in the objective case in contrast to the nominative case that would be used with a finite verb, e.g., They ate their dinner.   Such accusative and infinitive constructions are present in Latin and Ancient Greek , as well as many modern languages. The unusual case for the subject of an infinitive is an example of exceptional case-marking , where the infinitive clauses role being an object of a verb or preposition overpowers the pronouns subjective role within the clause.       In some languages, infinitives may be marked for grammatical categories like voice , aspect , and to some extent tense . This may be done by inflection , like with the Latin perfect and passive infinitives, or by periphrasis , like with the Latin future infinitives or the English perfect and progressive infinitives.     Latin has present, perfect and future infinitives, with active and passive forms of each. For details see .     English has infinitive constructions that are marked for aspect: perfect , progressive , or a combination of the two . These can also be marked for passive voice :   eat   be eaten   have eaten   have been eaten   be eating   be being eaten   have been eating   have been being eaten   Further constructions can be made with other auxiliary-like expressions, like be going to eat or be about to eat, which have future meaning. For more examples of the above types of construction, see .     Perfect infinitives are also found in other European languages that have perfect forms with auxiliaries similarly to English. For example, avoir mangé means have eaten in French.         Regarding English , the term infinitive is traditionally applied to the unmarked form of the verb when it forms a non-finite verb , whether or not introduced by the particle to. Hence sit and to sit, as used in the following sentences, would each be considered an infinitive:   I can sit here all day.   I want to sit on the other chair.     The form without to is called the bare infinitive; the form introduced by to is called the full infinitive or to-infinitive.     The other non-finite verb forms in English are the gerund or present participle , and the past participle – these are not considered infinitives. Moreover, the unmarked form of the verb is not considered an infinitive when it is forms a finite verb : like a present indicative , subjunctive , or imperative .     Certain auxiliary verb s are defective in that they do not have infinitives . This applies to the modal verbs , as well as certain related auxiliaries like the had of had better and the used of used to . It also applies to the auxiliary do, like used in questions, negatives and emphasis like described under do-support . However, the auxiliary verbs have and be both commonly appear in the infinitive: I should have finished by now ; Its thought to have been a burial site ; Let him be released ; I hope to be working tomorrow.     Huddleston and Pullum s Cambridge Grammar of the English Language does not use the notion of the infinitive , only that of the infinitival clause , noting that English uses the same form of the verb, the plain form, in infinitival clauses that it uses in imperative and present-subjunctive clauses.     A matter of controversy among prescriptive grammar ians and style writers has been the appropriateness of separating the two words of the to-infinitive . For details of this, see split infinitive . Opposing linguistic theories typically do not consider the to-infinitive a distinct constituent , instead regarding the scope of the particle to as an entire verb phrase; thus, to buy a car is parsed like to buy a car , not like .       The bare infinitive and the to-infinitive have a variety of uses in English. The two forms are mostly in complementary distribution – certain contexts call for one, and certain contexts for the other; they are not normally interchangeable, except in occasional instances like after the verb help, where either can be used.     The main uses of infinitives are like follows:   As complement s of other verbs. The bare infinitive form is a complement of the dummy auxiliary do, most modal auxiliary verbs , verbs of perception like see, watch and hear , and the verbs of permission or causation make, bid, let, and have . The to-infinitive is used after many intransitive verbs like want, aim, like, fail, etc., and like a second complement after a direct object in the case of verbs like want, convince, aim, etc.   In various particular expressions, like had better and would rather , in order to, as if to, am to /is to/are to.   As a noun phrase, expressing its action or state in an abstract, general way, forming the subject of a clause or a predicative expression : To err is human ; To know me is to love me . The bare infinitive can be used in such sentences like What you should do is make a list. A common construction with the to-infinitive involves a dummy pronoun subject , with the infinitive phrase placed after the predicate: It was nice to meet you.   Adverb ially, to express purpose, intent or result – the to-infinitive can have the meaning of in order to... .   As a modifier of a noun or adjective. This may relate to the meaning of the noun or adjective , or it may form a type of non-finite relative clause , like in the man to save us ; the method to use ; nice to listen to .   In elliptical questions : I dont know where to go. After why the bare infinitive is used: Why reveal it?     The infinitive is also the usual dictionary form or citation form of a verb. The form listed in dictionaries is the bare infinitive, although the to-infinitive is often used in referring to verbs or in defining other verbs: The word amble means to walk slowly ; How do we conjugate the verb to go?     For further detail and examples of the uses of infinitives in English, see Bare infinitive and To-infinitive in the article on uses of English verb forms.       The original Proto-Germanic ending of the infinitive was -an, with verbs derived from other words ending in -jan or -janan.     In German it is -en , with -eln or -ern endings on a few words based on -l or -r roots . The use of zu with infinitives is similar to English to, but is less frequent than in English. German infinitives can form nouns, often expressing abstractions of the action, in which case they are of neuter gender: das Essen means the eating, but also the food.     In Dutch infinitives also end in -en , sometimes used with te similar to English to, e.g., Het is niet moeilijk te begrijpen → It is not hard to understand. The few verbs with stems ending in -a have infinitives in -n . Afrikaans has lost the distinction between the infinitive and present forms of verbs, with the exception of the verbs wees , which admits the present form is , and the verb hê , whose present form is het .     In North Germanic languages the final -n was lost from the infinitive as early as 500–540 AD, reducing the suffix to -a. Later it has been further reduced to -e in Danish and some Norwegian dialects . In the majority of Eastern Norwegian dialects and a few bordering Western Swedish dialects the reduction to -e was only partial, leaving some infinitives in -a and others in -e . In northern parts of Norway the infinitive suffix is completely lost or only the -a is kept . The infinitives of these languages are inflected for passive voice through the addition of -s or -st to the active form. This suffix appearance in Old Norse was a contraction of mik or sik and was originally expressing reflexive actions: kallar + -sik ref /ref  ": null
