           Owain ab Gruffydd, lord of Glyndyfrdwy , or simply Owain Glyndŵr or Glyn Dŵr , was a  |Welsh|Welsh_People|  leader who instigated a fierce and long-running yet ultimately unsuccessful  |war_of_independence|Glyndŵr_Rising|  with the aim of ending  |English|Kingdom_Of_England|  rule in  |Wales|Wales_In_The_Late_Middle_Ages|  during the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| . He was the last native Welshman to hold the title  |Prince_of_Wales|Prince_Of_Wales|  .     Glyndŵr was a descendant of the Princes of  |Powys|Kingdom_Of_Powys|  through his father  |Gruffudd_Fychan_II|Gruffudd_Fychan_Ii| , hereditary  Tywysog  of  |Powys_Fadog|Powys_Fadog|  and Lord of  |Glyndyfrdwy|Glyndyfrdwy| , and of those of  |Deheubarth|Deheubarth|  through his mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn ab Owen.  On 16 September 1400, Glyndŵr instigated the  |Welsh_Revolt|Glyndŵr_Rising|  against the rule of  |Henry_IV_of_England|Henry_Iv_Of_England| . The uprising was initially very successful and rapidly gained control of large areas of Wales, but it suffered from key weaknesses – particularly a lack of artillery, which made capturing defended fortresses difficult, and of ships, which made rebel-controlled coastlands vulnerable. The uprising was eventually suppressed by the superior resources of the English. Glyndŵr was driven from his last remaining strongholds in 1409, but he avoided capture; the last documented sighting of him was in 1412. He twice ignored offers of a pardon from his military nemesis, the new king  |Henry_V_of_England|Henry_V_Of_England| , and despite the large rewards offered, Glyndŵr was never betrayed to the English. His death was recorded by a former follower in the year 1415.     With his death Owain acquired a mythical status along with  |Cadwaladr|Cadwaladr| , Cynan and  |Arthur|King_Arthur|  as a folk hero awaiting the call to return and liberate his people. In  |William_Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|  play  Henry IV, Part 1 , the character of Owen Glendower is a wild and exotic king ruled by magic and emotion.  In the late 19th century, the  |Cymru_Fydd|Cymru_Fydd|  movement recreated him as the father of  |Welsh_nationalism|Welsh_Nationalism| .            Glyndŵr was born around 1349 or 1359 to a prosperous  |landed_family|Landed_Gentry| , part of the Anglo-Welsh  |gentry|Gentry|  of the  |Welsh_Marches|Welsh_Marches|  in northeast Wales.  This group moved easily between Welsh and English societies and languages, occupying important offices for the  |Marcher_Lords|Marcher_Lords|  while maintaining their position as uchelwyr — nobles descended from the pre-conquest Welsh royal dynasties — in traditional Welsh society. His father,  |Gruffydd_Fychan_II|Gruffydd_Fychan_Ii| , hereditary  |Tywysog|Tywysog|  of  |Powys_Fadog|Powys_Fadog|  and Lord of  |Glyndyfrdwy|Glyndyfrdwy| , died some time before 1370, leaving Glyndŵrs mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn of  |Deheubarth|Deheubarth|  a widow and Owain a young man of 16 years at most.     The young Owain ap Gruffydd was possibly fostered at the home of  |David_Hanmer|David_Hanmer| , a rising lawyer shortly to be a justice of the Kings Bench, or at the home of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. Owain is then thought to have been sent to London to study law at the  |Inns_of_Court|Inns_Of_Court| .  He probably studied as a legal  |apprentice|Apprentice|  for seven years. He was possibly in London during the  |Peasants_Revolt|Peasants_Revolt|  of 1381. By 1383, he had returned to Wales, where he married David Hanmers daughter,  |Margaret|Margaret_Hanmer| , started his large family and established himself as the Squire of  |Sycharth|Sycharth|  and Glyndyfrdwy, with all the responsibilities that entailed.     Glyndŵr entered the English kings military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison duty under the renowned Welshman Sir Gregory Sais, or Sir Degory Sais, on the English–Scottish border at  |Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick-Upon-Tweed| .  In August 1385, he served King  |Richard_II|Richard_Ii|  under the command of  |John_of_Gaunt|John_Of_Gaunt| , again in  |Scotland|Scotland| . On 3 September 1386, he was called to give evidence in the  Scrope v Grosvenor  trial at  |Chester|Chester| .  In March 1387, Owain was in southeast England under  |Richard_FitzAlan,_11th_Earl_of_Arundel|Richard_Fitzalan,_11Th_Earl_Of_Arundel| , in the English Channel at the defeat of a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off the coast of  |Kent|Kent| . Upon the death in late 1387 of his father-in-law, Sir David Hanmer, knighted earlier that same year by Richard II, Glyndŵr returned to Wales as executor of his estate. He possibly served as a squire to Henry Bolingbroke , son of John of Gaunt, at the short, sharp  |Battle_of_Radcot_Bridge|Battle_Of_Radcot_Bridge|  in December 1387. He had gained three years concentrated military experience in different theatres and seen at first hand some key events and people.     King Richard was distracted by a growing conflict with the  |Lords_Appellant|Lords_Appellant|  from this time on. Glyndŵrs opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of Richard FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, and he probably returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The  |bard|Bard| |Iolo_Goch|Iolo_Goch|  , himself a Welsh lord, visited Glyndŵr in the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising Owains liberality, and writing of  |Sycharth|Sycharth| , Rare was it there / to see a latch or a lock.       The names and number of Owain Glyndŵrs siblings cannot be certainly known. The following are given by the  |Jacob_Youde_William_Lloyd|Jacob_Youde_William_Lloyd|    Brother  |Tudur|Tudur_Ap_Gruffudd| , Lord of Gwyddelwern, born about 1362, died 11 March 1405 at a battle in Brecknockshire in the wars of his brother.   Brother Gruffudd who had a daughter and heiress, Eva.   Sister Lowri, also spelled Lowry, married  |Robert_Puleston|Robert_Puleston|  of Emral.   Sister Isabel married Adda ap Iorwerth Ddu of Llys Pengwern.   Sister Morfudd married Sir Richard Croft of  |Croft_Castle|Croft_Castle| , in Herefordshire and, secondly, David ab Ednyfed Gam of Llys Pengwern.   Sister Gwenllian.     Tudur, Isabel and Lowri are given as his siblings by the more cautious R. R. Davies. That Owain Glyndŵr had another brother Gruffudd is likely; that he possibly had a third, Maredudd, is suggested by one reference.                In the late 1390s, a series of events began to push Owain towards rebellion, in what was later to be called the Welsh Revolt, the Glyndŵr Rising or the Last War of Independence. His neighbour,  |Baron_Grey_de_Ruthyn|Reginald_Grey,_3Rd_Baron_Grey_De_Ruthyn| , had seized control of some land, for which Glyndŵr appealed to the English Parliament. Owains petition for redress was ignored. Later, in 1400, Lord Grey informed Glyndŵr too late of a royal command to levy feudal troops for Scottish border service, thus enabling him to call the Welshman a traitor in London court circles.  Lord Grey was a personal friend of King Henry IV. Glyndŵr lost the legal case and was under personal threat. However, an alternative source states that Glyndŵr was under threat because he had written an angry letter to Lord Grey, boasting that he had stolen some of Lord Greys horses, and believing Lord Grey had threatened to burn and slay within his lands, he threatened retaliation in the same manner. Lord Grey then denied making the initial threat to burn and slay, and replied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IVs council, and that Glyndŵr would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained within the letter.  The deposed king, Richard II, had support in Wales, and in January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester after the public execution of an officer of Richard II.      These events led to Owain formally assuming his ancestral title of Prince of Powys on 16 September 1400 at his  |Glyndyfrdwy|Glyndyfrdwy|  estate. With a small band of followers which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the  |Bishop_of_St_Asaph|Bishop_Of_St_Asaph|  in the town of  |Corwen|Corwen| , possibly in the church of SS Mael & Sulien, he launched an assault on Lord Greys territories. After a number of initial confrontations between King Henry IV and Owains followers in September and October 1400, the revolt began to spread. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Owain. Henry IV appointed  |Henry_Percy|Henry_Hotspur_Percy|  – the famous Hotspur – to bring the country to order. Hotspur issued an amnesty in March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins,  |Rhys_ap_Tudur|Rhys_Ap_Tudur|  and Gwilym ap Tudur, sons of Tudur ap Gronw . Both the Tudurs were pardoned after their capture of  |Edward_I|Edward_I_Of_England| ’s great castle at  |Conwy|Conwy| . In June, Owain scored his first major victory in the field at  |Mynydd_Hyddgen|Mynydd_Hyddgen|  on  |Pumlumon|Pumlumon| . Retaliation by Henry IV on the  |Strata_Florida_Abbey|Strata_Florida_Abbey|  followed, but eventually led to Henrys retreat.        In 1402, the English Parliament issued the  |Penal_Laws_against_Wales|Penal_Laws_Against_Wales_1402| , designed to establish English dominance in Wales, but actually pushing many Welshmen into the rebellion. In the same year, Owain captured his archenemy, Baron Grey de Ruthyn. He held him for almost a year until he received a substantial ransom from Henry. In June 1402, Owain defeated an English force led by Sir  |Edmund_Mortimer|Edmund_Mortimer,_Son_Of_The_3Rd_Earl|  at the  |Battle_of_Bryn_Glas|Battle_Of_Bryn_Glas| , where Mortimer was captured. Glyndŵr offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to de Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimers nephew could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than Henry himself, so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Mortimer negotiated an alliance with Owain and married one of Owains daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the French and  |Bretons|Brittany|  helping Owain was first heard. The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland: as a base from which to fight the English.     In 1403 the revolt became truly national in Wales. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University|  were leaving their studies to join Owain, and Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales. Owain could also draw on Welsh troops seasoned by the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh  |archers|Archery|  and experienced  |men-at-arms|Men-At-Arms|  left English service to join the rebellion.        In 1404, Owain held court at  |Harlech|Harlech|  and appointed  |Gruffydd_Young|Gruffydd_Young|  as his  |Chancellor|Chancellor| . Soon afterwards, he called his first Parliament  of all Wales at  |Machynlleth|Machynlleth| , where he was crowned  |Prince_of_Wales|Prince_Of_Wales|  and announced his national programme. He declared his vision of an independent Welsh state with a parliament and separate Welsh church. There would be two national universities and a return to the  |traditional_law|Cyfraith_Hywel|  of  |Hywel_Dda|Hywel_Dda| . Senior churchmen and important members of society flocked to his banner. English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns and  |fortified_manor_houses|Fortified_Manor_House| .            In February 1405, Owain negotiated the  |Tripartite_Indenture|Tripartite_Indenture|  with Edmund Mortimer and  |Henry_Percy,_Earl_of_Northumberland|Henry_Percy,_1St_Earl_Of_Northumberland| . The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales among the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers  |Severn|River_Severn|  and  |Mersey|River_Mersey| , including most of  |Cheshire|Cheshire| ,  |Shropshire|Shropshire|  and  |Herefordshire|Herefordshire| . The  |Mortimer|Mortimer|  Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and the  |Percys|House_Of_Percy|  would take the north of England.  R. R. Davies noted that certain internal features underscore the roots of Glyndŵrs political philosophy in Welsh mythology: in it, the three men invoke prophecy, and the boundaries of Wales are defined according to Merlinic literature.     Although negotiations with the lords of Ireland were unsuccessful, Owain had reason to hope that the French and  |Bretons|Bretons|  might be more welcoming. He dispatched  |Gruffydd_Young|Gruffydd_Young|  and his brother-in-law , John Hanmer, to negotiate with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Owain and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to  |Kidwelly_Castle|Kidwelly_Castle| . The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow Celts in the then independent  |Brittany|Brittany|  and Scotland. Scots and French  |privateers|Privateer|  were operating around Wales throughout Owains war. Scottish ships had raided English settlements on the  |Llŷn_Peninsula|Lleyn_Peninsula|  in 1400 and 1401. In 1403, a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated  |Jersey|Jersey| ,  |Guernsey|Guernsey|  and  |Plymouth|Plymouth| , while the French made a landing on the  |Isle_of_Wight|Isle_Of_Wight| . By 1404, they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to  |Dartmouth|Dartmouth,_Devon|  and devastating the coast of  |Devon|Devon| .     1405 was the Year of the French in Wales. A formal treaty between Wales and France was negotiated. On the continent the French pressed the English as the French army invaded English Plantagenet  |Aquitaine|Aquitaine| . Simultaneously, the French landed in force at  |Milford_Haven|Milford_Haven|  in  |west_Wales|West_Wales| . They marched through Herefordshire and on into  |Worcestershire|Worcestershire| . They met the English army just ten miles from  |Worcester|Worcester| . The armies took up battle positions daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days. Then, for reasons that have never become clear, the Welsh retreated, and so did the French shortly afterwards.          By 1405, most French forces had withdrawn after politics in  |Paris|Paris|  shifted toward the peace party. Early in the year, the Welsh forces, who had until then won several easy victories, suffered a series of defeats. English forces landed in  |Anglesey|Anglesey|  from Ireland and would over time push the Welsh back, until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.     At the same time, the English changed their strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions as favoured by his father, the young Prince Henry adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control, he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit, even though by this time Owains rebel soldiers had achieved victories over the Kings men as far as  |Birmingham|Birmingham| , where the English were in retreat. In the autumn, Owains  |Aberystwyth_Castle|Aberystwyth_Castle|  surrendered while he was away fighting. In 1409, it was the turn of  |Harlech_Castle|Harlech_Castle| . Edmund Mortimer died in the final battle, and Owains wife Margaret along with two of his daughters and three of Mortimers granddaughters were imprisoned in the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London| . They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.     Owain remained free, but he had lost his ancestral home and was a hunted prince. He continued the rebellion, particularly wanting to avenge his wife. In 1410, after a suicide raid into rebel-controlled  |Shropshire|Shropshire| , which took many English lives, some of the leading rebels are thought to have been captured.     In 1412, Owain led one of the final successful raiding parties with his most faithful soldiers and cut through the Kings men; and in an ambush in  |Brecon|Brecon|  he captured, and later ransomed, a leading Welsh supporter of King Henrys,  |Dafydd_Gam|Dafydd_Gam|  . This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the  |Herefordshire|Herefordshire| -based  |Lollard|Lollard|  leader Sir  |John_Oldcastle|John_Oldcastle|  was communicating with Owain, and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south.     But by then things were changing. Henry IV died in 1413 and his son  |King_Henry_V|Henry_V_Of_England|  began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to the Welsh. Royal pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his fathers regime.       Nothing certain is known of Owain after 1412. Despite enormous rewards being offered, he was neither captured nor betrayed. He ignored royal pardons. Tradition has it that he died and was buried possibly in the church of Saints Mael and Sulien at  |Corwen|Corwen|  close to his home, or possibly on his estate in  |Sycharth|Sycharth|  or on the estates of his daughters husbands. —  |Kentchurch|Kentchurch|  in south  |Herefordshire|Herefordshire|  or  |Monnington|Monnington_On_Wye|  in west Herefordshire.        In his book The Mystery of Jack of Kent and the Fate of Owain Glyndŵr, Alex Gibbon argues that the folk hero  |Jack_of_Kent|Jack_O_Kent| , also known as  |Siôn_Cent|Siôn_Cent|  – the family  |chaplain|Chaplain|  of the Scudamore family – was in fact Owain Glyndŵr himself. Gibbon points out a number of similarities between Siôn Cent and Glyndŵr and claims that Owain spent his last years living with his daughter Alys, passing himself off as an aging  |Franciscan_friar|Franciscan_Friar|  and family tutor.  There are many folk tales of Glyndŵr donning disguises to gain advantage over opponents during the rebellion.       |Adam_of_Usk|Adam_Of_Usk| , a one-time supporter of Glyndŵr, made the following entry in his Chronicle under the year 1415: After four years in hiding, from the king and the realm, Owain Glyndŵr died, and was buried by his followers in the darkness of night. His grave was discovered by his enemies, however, so he had to be re-buried, though it is impossible to discover where he was laid.     In 1875, the Rev.  |Francis_Kilvert|Francis_Kilvert|  wrote in his diary that he saw the grave of Owen Glendower in the churchyard at  |Monnington|Monnington_On_Wye|  rd by the church porch and on the western side of it ... It is a flat stone of whitish grey shaped like a rude obelisk figure, sunk deep into the ground in the middle of an oblong patch of earth from which the turf has been pared away, and, alas, smashed into several fragments.  6 April 1875     In 2006, Adrien Jones, the president of the Owain Glyndŵr Society, said, Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at  |Kentchurch_Court|Kentchurch_Court| , near  |Abergavenny|Abergavenny| . He took us to Mornington Straddle, in  |Herefordshire|Herefordshire| , where one of Glyndŵrs daughters, Alice, lived. Mr Skidmore told us that he spent his last days there and eventually died there.... It was a family secret for 600 years and even Mr. Skidmores mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. Theres even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle.            Owain married  |Margaret_Hanmer|Margaret_Hanmer| , also known by her  |Welsh|Wales|  name Marred ferch Dafydd, daughter of Sir  |David_Hanmer|David_Hanmer|  of Hanmer, early in his life.      Owains daughter  |Alys|Alys_Ferch_Owain_Glyndŵr|  had secretly married  |Sir_John_Scudamore|John_Scudamore| , the Kings appointed Sheriff of Herefordshire. Somehow he had weathered the rebellion and remained in office. It was rumoured that Owain finally retreated to their home at Kentchurch.   A grandchild of the Scudamores was  |Sir_John_Donne|Sir_John_Donne|  of  |Kidwelly|Kidwelly| , a successful  |Yorkist|Yorkist|  courtier, diplomat and soldier, who after 1485 made an accommodation with his fellow Welshman,  |Henry_VII|Henry_Vii_Of_England| . Through the Donne family, many prominent English families are descended from Owain, including the De Vere family, successive holders of the title  |Earl_of_Oxford|Earl_Of_Oxford| , and the  |Cavendish|House_Of_Cavendish|  family .     According to Lloyd, Owain and Margaret had five sons and four or five daughters:    |Gruffudd|Gruffudd_Ab_Owain_Glyndŵr| , born about 1375, was captured by the English, confined in Nottingham Castle, and taken to the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London|  in 1410. He died in prison of  |bubonic_plague|Bubonic_Plague|  about 1412.   Madog    |Maredudd|Maredudd_Ab_Owain_Glyndŵr| , whose date of birth is unknown, was still living in 1421 when he accepted a  |pardon|Pardon| .   Thomas   John    |Alys|Alys_Ferch_Owain_Glyndŵr|  married  |Sir_John_Scudamore|John_Scudamore| .  She was lady of Glyndyfrdwy and Cynllaith, and heiress of the Principalities of Powys, South Wales, and Gwynedd.   Jane, who married Lord Grey de Ruthin.  |Croft_Castle|Croft_Castle| , in Herefordshire.   Margaret, who married Sir Richard Monnington of Monnington, in Herefordshire.     Although not named by Lloyd, a fifth daughter,  |Catrin|Catrin_Ferch_Owain_Glyndŵr| , is recorded elsewhere. She married  |Sir_Edmund_Mortimer|Edmund_Mortimer| , son of  |Edmund_Mortimer,_3rd_Earl_of_March|Edmund_Mortimer,_3Rd_Earl_Of_March| , and died in 1413.     Owains sons were either taken prisoner or died in battle and had no issue. Owain had additional illegitimate children: David, Gwenllian,  |Ieuan|Ieuan_Ab_Owain_Glyndŵr| , and Myfanwy.                     After Owains death, there was little resistance to English rule. The  |Tudor_dynasty|Tudor_Dynasty|  saw Welshmen become more prominent in English society. In  Henry IV, Part 1 ,  |Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare|  portrays him as Owen Glendower,  wild and exotic; a man who claims to be able to call spirits from the vasty deep, ruled by magic and tradition in sharp contrast to the more logical but highly emotional Hotspur. Shakespeare further notes Glyndŵr as being not in the roll of common men and a worthy gentleman,/Exceedingly well read, and profited/ In strange concealments, valiant as a lion/And as wondrous affable and as bountiful/As mines of India. .       With his death Owain acquired a mythical status along with  |Cadwaladr|Cadwaladr| , Cynan and  |Arthur|King_Arthur|  as the hero awaiting the call to return and liberate his people.   |Thomas_Pennant|Thomas_Pennant| , in his Tours in Wales , searched out and published many of the legends and places associated with his memory.  Previously,  |George_Owen|George_Owen_Of_Henllys| , in his A Dialogue of the present Government of Wales had written against the Cruell lawes against Welshmen made by Henrie the ffourth in his attempts to quell the revolt.  But it was not until the late 19th century that Owains reputation was revived. The  |Young_Wales|Cymru_Fydd|  movement recreated him as the father of Welsh nationalism. The discovery of Owains Great Seal and his letters to the French in the  |Bibliothèque_Nationale|Bibliothèque_Nationale_De_France|  helped revise historical images of him as a purely local leader. In the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , the  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister| ,  |David_Lloyd_George|David_Lloyd_George| , unveiled a statue to him in  |Cardiff_City_Hall|City_Hall,_Cardiff|  and a postcard showing Owain at the  |Battle_of_Mynydd_Hyddgen|Battle_Of_Mynydd_Hyddgen|  Owen GlendowerIn 1808, the Royal Navy launched a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate, which it named .

Between 1822 and 1824, she served in the West Africa Squadron chasing down slave ship s, capturing at least two.     thu in a late night vision. This is one of a number of such sketches known collectively as the Visionary Heads .     He is now remembered as a national hero and numerous small groups have adopted his symbolism to advocate independence or nationalism for Wales. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling themselves Meibion Glyndŵr claimed responsibility for the burning of English holiday homes in Wales.     The creation of the National Assembly for Wales brought him back into the spotlight and in 2000 celebrations were held all over Wales to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Glyndŵrs revolt, including an historic reenactment at the Millennium National Eisteddfod of Wales, Llanelli 2000. Stamps were issued with his likeness in 1974 and 2008 and streets, parks, and public squares were named after him throughout Wales. Owains personal standard — the quartered arms of Powys and Deheubarth rampant — began to be seen all over Wales, especially at rugby union matches against the English. A campaign exists to make 16 September, the date Owain raised his standard, a public holiday in Wales. An annual award for achievement in the arts and literature, the Glyndŵr Award , is named after him. In 2007, popular Welsh musicians the Manic Street Preachers wrote a song entitled 1404 based on Owain Glyndŵr. The song can be found on the CD single for Autumnsong . A statue of Owain Glyndŵr on horseback was installed in 2007 in The Square in Corwen , Denbighshire , to commemorate his life and his lasting influence on Wales. Also located on the Square in Corwen is the Owain Glyndwr Hotel . The waymarked long distance footpath Glyndŵrs Way runs through Mid Wales near to his homelands.     Owain Glyndŵr came 2nd in the 100 Welsh Heroes poll of 2003/4.   thu by Colin Spofforth.   In 2008, Glyndŵr University was established in Wrexham , Wales. Originally established as the Wrexham School of Science and Art in 1887, it was until the name change known as the North East Wales Institute or NEWI . Glyndŵr was born and lived much of his life around Wrexham and the Welsh Marches.     Glendower Residence, at the University of Cape Town in South Africa was named after Owain Glyndŵr. The residence was opened in 1993 having previously been the Glendower Hotel. It now houses 139 male and female undergraduate students.     RGC 1404 rugby union team is named in honour of the year Owain Glyndŵr was crowned Prince of Wales .       Glyndŵr has been featured in a number of works of modern fiction, including   John Cowper Powys :  |Owen_Glendower|Owen_Glendower|    Edith Pargeter : A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury   Martha Rofheart : Glendower Country http://openlibrary.org/books/ia:glendowercountry00rofh/Glendowercountryanovel   Rosemary Hawley Jarman : Crown in Candlelight   Roger Zelazny :  |A_Night_in_the_Lonesome_October|A_Night_In_The_Lonesome_October|    Malcolm Pryce: A Dragon to Agincourt – Y Lolfa   Rhiannon Ifans: Owain Glyndŵr: Prince of Wales   Rowland Williams: Owen Glendower: A Dramatic Biography and Other Poems   T.I.

Glyndŵr appeared briefly as a past Knight of the Word and a ghost who serves the Lady in Terry Brooks s  |Word/Void|Shannara|  trilogy. In the books, he is John Ross s ancestor.     Glyndŵr appeared as an agent of the Light in Susan Cooper s novel Silver on the Tree, part of  |The_Dark_is_Rising_Sequence|The_Dark_Is_Rising_Sequence| .
