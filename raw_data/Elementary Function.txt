In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an elementary function is a  |function|Function|  of one  |variable|Variable|  which is a finite sum, product, and/or composition of the  |rational_functions|Rational_Function|  ,  |sin|Sine| ,  |cos|Trigonometric_Functions| ,  |exp|Exponential_Function| , and their  |inverse_functions|Inverse_Function|  .      Elementary functions were introduced by  |Joseph_Liouville|Joseph_Liouville|  in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841. . . . An algebraic treatment of elementary functions was started by  |Joseph_Fels_Ritt|Joseph_Fels_Ritt|  in the 1930s. .           The elementary functions  include:    |Constant_functions|Constant_Function| : 2,    e, etc.   Powers of x  x,  x2,  x3, etc.   Roots of x      etc.    |Exponential_functions|Exponential_Function| : ex    |Logarithms|Logarithm| :   x    |Trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Function| :   x,    x,    x, etc.    |Inverse_trigonometric_functions|Inverse_Trigonometric_Function| :   x,    x, etc.    |Hyperbolic_functions|Hyperbolic_Function| :   x,    x, etc.    |Inverse_hyperbolic_functions|Inverse_Hyperbolic_Function| :   x,    x, etc.   All functions obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing any of the previous functions    All functions obtained by  |composing|Function_Composition|  previously listed functions     Some elementary functions, such as roots, logarithms, or  |inverse_trigonometric_functions|Inverse_Trigonometric_Function| , are not  |entire_functions|Entire_Function|  and may be  |multivalued|Multivalued_Function| .       Examples of elementary functions include:     Addition, e.g.    Multiplication, e.g.     |Polynomial|Polynomial|  functions       -i      The last function is equal to   x , the  |inverse_cosine|Inversetrigonometricfunctionslogarithmicforms| , in the entire  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane| . Hence, it is an elementary function.     All  |monomials|Monomial| ,  |polynomials|Polynomial|  and  |rational_functions|Rational_Function|  are elementary. Also, the  |absolute_value_function|Absolute_Value| , for real x , is also elementary as it can be expressed as the composition of a power and root of x :  x   .       An example of a function that is not elementary is the  |error_function|Error_Function| |_Risch_algorithm|Risch_Algorithm| .     See also the examples in  |Liouvillian_function|Liouvillianfunctionexamples|  and  |Nonelementary_integral|Nonelementary_Integral| .       It follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is  |closed|Closure|  under arithmetic operations and composition. The elementary functions are closed under  |differentiation|Derivative| . They are not closed under  |limits_and_infinite_sums|Series| . Importantly, the elementary functions are  closed under  |integration|Antiderivative| , as shown by  |Liouvilles_theorem|Liouvilles_Theorem| , see  |Nonelementary_integral|Nonelementary_Integral| . The  |Liouvillian_functions|Liouvillian_Function|  are defined as the elementary functions and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.         The mathematical definition of an elementary function, or a function in elementary form, is considered in the context of  |differential_algebra|Differential_Algebra| . A differential algebra is an algebra with the extra operation of derivation . Using the derivation operation new equations can be written and their solutions used in  |extensions|Field_Extension|  of the algebra. By starting with the  |field|Field|  of  |rational_functions|Rational_Function| , two special types of transcendental extensions can be added to the field building a tower containing elementary functions.     A differential field F is a field F 0  together with a derivation map u  →  ∂u.  The derivation captures the properties of differentiation, so that for any two elements of the base field, the derivation is linear     :     u +   v     and satisfies the  |Leibniz_product_rule|Product_Rule|      :   u  v+u  v      An element h is a constant if ∂h    0. If the base field is over the rationals, care must be taken when extending the field to add the needed transcendental constants.     A function u of a differential extension Fu of a differential field F is an elementary function over F if the function u  |algebraic|Algebraic_Function|  over F, or   is an exponential, that is, ∂u u ∂a for a ∈ F, or   is a logarithm, that is, ∂u ∂a  /  a for a ∈ F.
