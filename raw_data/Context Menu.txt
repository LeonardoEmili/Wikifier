                 A context menu  is a  |menu|Menu|  in a  |graphical_user_interface|Graphical_User_Interface|  that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click  |mouse_operation|Mouse_Operation| . A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs. Usually the available choices are actions related to the  |selected_object|Selection| . From a technical point of view, such a context menu is a  |graphical_control_element|Graphical_Control_Element| .       Context menus first appeared in the  |Smalltalk|Smalltalk|  environment on the  |Xerox_Alto|Xerox_Alto|  computer, where they were called pop-up menus; they were invented by  |Dan_Ingalls|Dan_Ingalls|  in the mid-1970s.        |Microsoft_Office|Microsoft_Office|  v3.0 introduced the context menu for copy and paste functionality in 1990. Borland demonstrated extensive use of the context menu in 1991 at the Second Paradox Conference in Phoenix Arizona.  |Lotus_1-2-3|Lotus_1-2-3| /G for  |OS/2|Os/2|  v1.0 added additional formatting options in 1991. Borland  |Quattro_Pro|Quattro_Pro|  for Windows v1.0 introduced the Properties context menu option in 1992.       Context menus are opened via various forms of user interaction that target a region of the GUI that supports context menus. The specific form of user interaction and the means by which a region is targeted vary:     On a computer running  |Microsoft_Windows|Microsoft_Windows| ,  |macOS|Macos| , or  |Unix|Unix|  running the  |X_Window_System|X_Window_System| , clicking the secondary mouse button opens a context menu for the region that is under the mouse pointer.   On systems that support one-button mice, context menus are typically opened by pressing and holding the primary mouse button  or by pressing a keyboard/mouse button combination . A keyboard alternative for macOS is to enable  |Mouse_keys|Mouse_Keys|  in  |Universal_Access|Universal_Access| . Then, depending on whether a laptop or compact or extended keyboard type is used, the shortcut is ++5 or +5 or ++i .   On systems with a  |multi-touch|Multi-Touch|  interface such as MacBook or Surface, the context menu can be opened by pressing or tapping with two fingers instead of just one.     Windows mouse click behavior is such that the context menu doesnt open while the mouse button is pressed, but only opens the menu when the button is released, so the user has to click again to select a context menu item. This behavior differs from that of macOS and most free software GUIs.   In Microsoft Windows, pressing the  |Application_key|Menu_Key|  or Shift+F10 opens a context menu for the region that has  |focus|Focus| .     Context menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. The implementations differ:  |Microsoft_Word|Microsoft_Word|  was one of the first applications to only show sub-entries of some menu entries after clicking an arrow icon on the context menu, otherwise executing an action associated with the parent entry. This makes it possible to quickly repeat an action with the parameters of the previous execution, and to better separate options from actions.       The following  |window_managers|Window_Manager|  provide context menu functionality:      |9wm|9Wm| |IceWM|Icewm| â€” |middle-click|Middle-Click|  and  |right-click|Right-Click|  context menus on  |desktop|Desktop_Environment| ,  |menubar|Menubar| .  |titlebars|Titlebar| , and  |titleicon|Titleicon| |olwm|Olwm| |openbox|Openbox| |sawfish|Sawfish|        Context menus have received some criticism from  |usability|Usability|  analysts when improperly used, as some applications make certain features only available in context menus, which may confuse even experienced users .     Context menus usually open in a fixed position under the  |pointer|Elements_Of_Graphical_User_Interfacespointer| , but when the pointer is near a screen edge the menu will be displaced - thus reducing consistency and impeding use of  |muscle_memory|Muscle_Memory| . If the context menu is being triggered by keyboard, such as by using Shift + F10, the context menu appears near the focused widget instead of the position of the pointer, to save recognition efforts.       Microsofts guidelines call for always using the term context menu, and explicitly deprecate shortcut menu.
