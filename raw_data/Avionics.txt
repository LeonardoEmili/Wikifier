           Avionics are the  |electronic|Electronics|  systems used on  |aircraft|Aircraft| ,  |artificial_satellites|Artificial_Satellite| , and  |spacecraft|Spacecraft| , in short Avionic — the science of electronics when used in designing and making aircraft. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a  |searchlight|Searchlight|  for a  |police_helicopter|Police_Helicopter|  or as complicated as the tactical system for an  |airborne_early_warning|Airborne_Early_Warning|  platform. The term avionics is a  |portmanteau|Portmanteau|  of the words aviation and electronics.       The term avionics was coined by the journalist  |Philip_J_Klass|Philip_J_Klass|  as a  |portmanteau|Portmanteau|  of aviation electronics .  Shaffer, Robert. Unexplained Cases–Only If You Ignore All Explanations ,  Skeptical Inquirer , March/April 2011, page 58 Many modern avionics have their origins in  |World_War_II|World_War_Nbsp_Ii|  wartime developments. For example,  |autopilot|Autopilot|  systems that are commonplace today began as specialized systems to help bomber planes fly steadily enough to hit precision targets from high altitudes. Famously, radar was developed in the UK, and then given to the US through the  |Tizard_Mission|Tizard_Mission|   Modern avionics is a substantial portion of military aircraft spending. Aircraft like the  |F_8209_15E|F_15E|  and the now retired  |F_8209_14|F_14|  have roughly 20 percent of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern  |helicopters|Helicopter|  now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics.      The civilian market has also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems  and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented.       Avionics plays a heavy role in modernization initiatives like the  |Federal_Aviation_Administrations|Federal_Aviation_Administration| |_Next_Generation_Air_Transportation_System|Next_Generation_Air_Transportation_System|  project in the United States and the  |Single_European_Sky_ATM_Research|Single_European_Sky_Atm_Research|  initiative in Europe. The  |Joint_Planning_and_Development_Office|Joint_Planning_And_Development_Office|  put forth a roadmap for avionics in six areas:    Published Routes and Procedures – Improved navigation and routing   Negotiated Trajectories – Adding data communications to create preferred routes dynamically   Delegated Separation – Enhanced situational awareness in the air and on the ground   LowVisibility/CeilingApproach/Departure – Allowing operations with weather constraints with less ground infrastructure   Surface Operations – To increase safety in approach and departure   ATM Efficiencies – Improving the ATM process         The  |Aircraft_Electronics_Association|Aircraft_Electronics_Association|  reports $1.73 billion avionics sales for the first three quarters of 2017 in  |business|Business_Aviation|  and  |general_aviation|General_Aviation| , a 4.1% yearly improvement: 73.5% came from North America, forward-fit represented 42.3% while 57.7% were  |retrofits|Retrofit|  as the U.S. deadline of Jan. 1, 2020 for mandatory  |ADS_B|Ads_B|  out approach.        The cockpit of an aircraft is a typical location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision systems. The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14- or 28‑volt  |DC|Direct_Current|  electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft  have  |AC|Alternating_Current|  systems operating at 400  Hz, 115 volts AC.  There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including  |Panasonic_Avionics_Corporation|Panasonic_Avionics_Corporation| ,  |Honeywell|Honeywell_Aerospace|  ,  |Universal_Avionics_Systems_Corporation|Universal_Avionics_Systems_Corporation| ,  |Rockwell_Collins|Rockwell_Collins|  ,  |Thales_Group|Thales_Group| ,  |GE_Aviation_Systems|Ge_Aviation_Systems| ,  |Garmin|Garmin| ,  |Raytheon|Raytheon| ,  |Parker_Hannifin|Parker_Hannifin| ,  |UTC_Aerospace_Systems|Utc_Aerospace_Systems|  ,  |Selex_ES|Selex_Es|   and  |Avidyne_Corporation|Avidyne_Corporation| .     International standards for avionics equipment are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee and published by ARINC.         Communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers. On‑board communications are provided by public-address systems and aircraft intercoms.     The VHF aviation communication system works on the  |airband|Airband|  of 118.000  MHz to 136.975  MHz. Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33  kHz in Europe, 25  kHz elsewhere. VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC.  |Amplitude_modulation|Amplitude_Modulation|  is used, and the conversation is performed in  |simplex|Simplex_Communication|  mode. Aircraft communication can also take place using HF or satellite communication.                  |Air_navigation|Air_Navigation|  is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth. Avionics can use  |satellite_navigation|Satellite_Navigation|  systems , INS, ground-based  |radio_navigation|Radio_Navigation|  systems , or any combination thereof. Some navigation systems such as GPS calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays. Older ground-based Navigation systems such as VOR or LORAN requires a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircrafts location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.             The first hints of  |glass_cockpits|Glass_Cockpit|  emerged in the 1970s when flight-worthy  |cathode_ray_tube|Cathode_Ray_Tube|  screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A glass cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls. Avionics: Development and Implementation by Cary R. Spitzer     Glass cockpits started to come into being with the  |Gulfstream|Gulfstream_Aerospace|  G‑IV private jet in 1985. One of the key challenges in glass cockpits is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.            Aircraft have means of automatically controlling flight.  |Autopilot|Autopilot|  was first invented by  |Lawrence_Sperry|Lawrence_Sperry|  during  |World_War_I|World_War_Nbsp_I|  to fly bomber planes steady enough to hit accurate targets from 25,000 feet. When it was first adopted by the  |U_S_military|U_S_Nbsp_Military| , a  |Honeywell|Honeywell_Aerospace|  engineer sat in the back seat with bolt cutters to disconnect the autopilot in case of emergency. Nowadays most commercial planes are equipped with aircraft flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error and workload at landing or takeoff. By Jeffrey L. Rodengen. . Published by Write Stuff Syndicate, Inc. in 1995. The Legend of Honeywell.     The first simple commercial auto-pilots were used to control  |heading|Aircraft_Heading|  and altitude and had limited authority on things like  |thrust|Thrust|  and  |flight_control|Flight_Control|  surfaces. In  |helicopters|Helicopter| , auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of  |fly_by_wire|Fly_By_Wire|  and electro-actuated flight surfaces has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.       Fuel Quantity Indication System monitors the amount of fuel aboard. Using various sensors, such as capacitance tubes, temperature sensors, densitometers & level sensors, the FQIS computer calculates the mass of fuel remaining on board.     Fuel Control and Monitoring System reports fuel remaining on board in a similar manner, but, by controlling pumps & valves, also manages fuel transfers around various tanks.     	Refuelling control to upload to a certain total mass of fuel and distribute it automatically.   	Transfers during flight to the tanks that feed the engines. E.G. from fuselage to wing tanks   	Centre of gravity control transfers from the tail tanks forward to the wings as fuel is expended   	Maintaining fuel in the wing tips & transferring to the main tanks after landing   	Controlling fuel jettison during an emergency to reduce the aircraft weight.            To supplement  |air_traffic_control|Air_Traffic_Control| , most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a  |traffic_alert_and_collision_avoidance_system|Tcas|  , which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive  and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.     To help avoid controlled flight into terrain , aircraft use systems such as  |ground_proximity_warning_systems|Gpws|  , which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of look-ahead information, because it only provides altitude above terrain look-down . In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system .            Commercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as black boxes , store flight information and audio from the  |cockpit|Cockpit| . They are often recovered from an aircraft after a crash to determine control settings and other parameters during the incident.          Weather systems such as  |weather_radar|Weather_Radar|   and  |lightning_detectors|Lightning_Detector|  are important for aircraft flying at night or in  |instrument_meteorological_conditions|Instrument_Meteorological_Conditions| , where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead. Heavy precipitation or severe  |turbulence|Clear_Air_Turbulence|  are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.     Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures  are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems. Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.     Modern weather systems also include  |wind_shear|Wind_Shear|  and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems.  In‑plane weather avionics are especially popular in Africa,  |India|India| , and other countries where air-travel is a growing market, but ground support is not as well developed.        There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management.  |Health_and_usage_monitoring_systems|Health_And_Usage_Monitoring_Systems|  are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.     The  |integrated_modular_avionics|Integrated_Modular_Avionics|  concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in  |fourth_generation_jet_fighters|Fourth_Generation_Jet_Fighter|  and the latest generation of  |airliners|Airliner| .        |Military_aircraft|Military_Aircraft|  have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military is used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms have mission-management computers.     Police and EMS aircraft also carry sophisticated tactical sensors.         While aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigors of the battle field.  |UHF|Ultra_High_Frequency| ,  |VHF|Very_High_Frequency|  Tactical and SatCom systems combined with  |ECCM|Electronic_Counter_Countermeasures|  methods, and  |cryptography|Cryptography|  secure the communications. Data links such as  |Link_11|Link_11| ,  |16|Link_16| ,  |22|Link_22|  and  |BOWMAN|Bowman| ,  |JTRS|Jtrs|  and even  |TETRA|Tetra|  provide the means of transmitting data .         Airborne  |radar|Radar|  was one of the first tactical sensors. The benefit of altitude providing range has meant a significant focus on airborne radar technologies. Radars include  |airborne_early_warning|Airborne_Early_Warning|  ,  |anti_submarine_warfare|Anti_Submarine_Warfare|  , and even  |weather_radar|Weather_Radar|   and ground tracking/proximity radar.     The military uses  |radar_in_fast_jets_to_help_pilots_fly_at_low_levels|Terrain_Following_Radar| . While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.          Dipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the  |helicopter|Helicopter|  to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices  and these are also used to determine the location of enemy submarines.       Electro-optic systems include devices such as the  |head_up_display|Head_Up_Display|  ,  |forward_looking_infrared|Forward_Looking_Infrared|  ,  |infra_red_search_and_track|Infra_Red_Search_And_Track|  and other passive infrared devices . These are all used to provide imagery and information to the flight crew. This imagery is used for everything from search and rescue to  |navigational_aids|Navigational_Aid|  and  |target_acquisition|Target_Acquisition| .         Electronic support measures and defensive aids are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. They can be used to launch devices to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat and identify it.       The avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. Common avionics databus protocols, with their primary application, include:    |Aircraft_Data_Network|Aircraft_Data_Network| |_Avionics_Full_Duplex_Switched_Ethernet_|Afdx|  for Commercial Aircraft    |ARINC_429|Arinc_429| |ARINC_664|Avionics_Full_Duplex_Switched_Ethernet| |ARINC_629|Arinc_629| |ARINC_708|Arinc_708| |ARINC_717|Arinc_717| |ARINC_825|Arinc_825| |CAN_bus|Can_Bus|  for commercial aircraft    |Commercial_Standard_Digital_Bus|Commercial_Standard_Digital_Bus| |_IEEE_1394b|Ieee_1394Bmilitary_Aircraft| |MIL_STD_1553|Mil_Std_1553| |MIL_STD_1760|Mil_Std_1760| |TTP|Time_Triggered_Protocol|  – Time-Triggered Protocol:  |Boeing_787_Dreamliner|Boeing_787_Dreamliner| ,  |Airbus_A380|Airbus_A380| , Fly-By-Wire Actuation Platforms from Parker Aerospace    |TTEthernet|Ttethernet|  – Time-Triggered Ethernet:  |NASA_Orion|Nasa_Orion| .
