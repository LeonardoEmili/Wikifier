      Encyclopedia Brown is a series of books featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed Encyclopedia for his intelligence and  |range_of_knowledge|Encyclopedic_Knowledge| . The series of 29  |childrens_novels|Childrens_Literature|  was written by  |Donald_J._Sobol|Donald_J._Sobol| , with the first book published in 1963 and the last novel published posthumously, in 2012. The Encyclopedia Brown series has spawned a comic strip, a TV series, and compilation books of puzzles and games.          Each book in the Encyclopedia Brown mystery series is self-contained in that the reader is not required to have read earlier books in order to understand the stories. The major characters, settings, etc. are usually introduced in each book.     Books featuring Brown are subdivided into a number—usually ten or more—of short stories, each of which presents a  |mystery|Mystery_Fiction| . The mysteries are intended to be solved by the reader, thanks to the placement of a logical or factual inconsistency somewhere within the text. This is very similar to the layout of Donald Sobols other book series, Two-Minute Mysteries. Brown, his father, or Sally Kimball invariably solves the case by exposing this inconsistency, in the Answers section in the back of the book.       Often, these books follow a formula wherein the first chapter involves Brown solving a case at the dinner table for his father, the local police chief in the fictional seaside town of Idaville in an unspecified state. When Chief Brown barely tastes his meal, that is a cue he was handed a difficult case. He pulls out his casebook and goes over it with the family. Encyclopedia solves these cases by briefly closing his eyes while he thinks deeply, then asking a single question which directly leads to him finding the solution.     The second mystery often begins in the Brown garage on Rover Avenue, where Encyclopedia has set up his own detective agency to help neighborhood children solve cases for 25 cents per day, plus expenses - No case too small. This second case usually involves the  |town_bully|Bullying|  and  |mischief|Mischief|  maker Bugs Meany, leader of a gang who call themselves the Tigers, who, after being foiled, will attempt revenge in the third mystery.     In the third mystery, the plot involves Encyclopedias partner, close friend, and bodyguard,  |Sally_Kimball|Sally_Kimball| , the one person under 14 years of age to physically stand up to Bugs. She is the only reason neither Bugs nor any of his Tigers ever try to physically attack Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia tends to dislike anyone whom Sally has a crush on, possibly indicating that he has a crush on her. Also intelligent, Sally once attempted—in the first book of the series—to prove herself smarter than Encyclopedia by stumping him with a mystery of her own creation. Ironically, the contest was held at the Tigers clubhouse, with Bugs and the others cheering him on. However, she was beaten in the contest , after which she became his friend. In subsequent storylines Bugs or his gang usually set up some sort of trap to get Encyclopedia or Sally in trouble. However, as in the previous story, they make a key mistake which Encyclopedia exposes.     Later cases may find Encyclopedia assisting his father at a crime scene  or interacting with people around town, often exposing scams. One such example is a high school dropout and would-be  |con_artist|Con_Artist|  named Wilford Wiggins who spends time trying to dream up schemes to fleece kids out of their money. Like Bugs, his schemes have an inconsistency which Encyclopedia exposes.     In some cases it is Sally and not Encyclopedia who figures it out because, as she tells Encyclopedia, You are a boy. In other words, she notices things that only a girl would find inconsistent. Sally further displays her intelligence in the various mysteries in that she often can deduce who committed the crime, or whether a certain person is lying, but she simply cannot always prove it.

From January 15 to June 30, 1989, a special Solve-It-Yourself Mystery Sweepstakes was held in conjunction with the Encyclopedia Brown books and  |Bantam_Books|Bantam_Books| . In the back of specially marked copies of Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Treasure Hunt, Sobol presented an unsolved mystery for the contestant to solve and submit an answer for a chance to win a prize. The mystery for the contest was called The Case of the Missing Birthday Gift , wherein Encyclopedia had to solve the case of a stolen bicycle that was given as a birthday gift to Willie Grant on his tenth birthday. The Tigers make an appearance as the suspects in the case; Bugs Meany, Jack Beck, and Rocky Graham all show up at the Tigers clubhouse.     Contestants were allowed to enter as many times as they wished, provided they used a separate envelope for each entry. The sweepstakes was only available to USA and Canada residents. No purchase was necessary, as one could either use the official form in the back of specially marked copies of Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Treasure Hunt   or send in a 3 by 5 index card with the solution and the contestants contact information.       The satirical newspaper  The Onion  ran an article in 2003 titled Idaville Detective Encyclopedia Brown Found Dead In Library Dumpster , which stated that Encyclopedia Brown, now a middle-aged police detective, had been murdered. The article parodied the books tendency to have crimes solved through knowledge of trivia, and ended with Bugs Meany, who was now police commissioner, stating that he had an alibi for the murder in that I was at the  |North_Pole|North_Pole|  watching the penguins.       |Ed_Brubaker|Ed_Brubaker|  and  |Sean_Phillips|Sean_Phillips| |Criminal:_Last_of_the_Innocent|List_Of_Criminal_Story_Arcsthe_Last_Of_The_Innocent|  graphic novel features a reference to Encyclopedia Brown, with a grown-up analogue of Encyclopedia featured in the comic, as confirmed by Ed Brubaker himself.      The  |Das_Racist|Das_Racist|  song Rainbow in the Dark features the lyric Wikipedia Brown as a reference to Encyclopedia Brown.
