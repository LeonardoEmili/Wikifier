          In  |logic|Logic| ,  |mathematics|Mathematics|  and  |linguistics|Linguistics| , And is the  |truth-functional|Truth_Function|  operator of logical conjunction; the and of a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true. The  |logical_connective|Logical_Connective|  that represents this operator is typically written as  or .     A   B is true only if A is true and B is true.     An operand of a conjunction is a conjunct.     The term logical conjunction is also used for the  |greatest_lower_bound|Greatest_Lower_Bound|  in  |lattice_theory|Lattice| .     Related concepts in other fields are:     In  |natural_language|Natural_Language| , the  |coordinating_conjunction|Grammatical_Conjunctioncoordinating_Conjunctions|  and .

In  |predicate_logic|Predicate_Logic| ,  |universal_quantification|Universal_Quantification| .         And is usually denoted by an infix operator: in mathematics and logic, it is denoted by ,  or ; in electronics, ; and in programming languages,  & amp; ,  & amp; & amp; , or  and . In  |Jan_Łukasiewiczs|Jan_Łukasiewicz| |prefix_notation_for_logic|Polish_Notationpolish_Notation_For_Logic| , the operator is K, for Polish koniunkcja.  |Józef_Maria_Bocheński|Józef_Maria_Bocheński|  , A Précis of Mathematical Logic, translated by Otto Bird from the French and German editions, Dordrecht, North Holland: D. Reidel, passim.       Logical conjunction is an  |operation|Logical_Operation|  on two  |logical_values|Logical_Value| , typically the values of two  |propositions|Proposition| , that produces a value of true  |if_and_only_if|Iff|  both of its operands are true.     The conjunctive  |identity|Identity_Element|  is true, which is to say that AND-ing an expression with true will never change the value of the expression. In keeping with the concept of  |vacuous_truth|Vacuous_Truth| , when conjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary  |arity|Arity| , the empty conjunction is often defined as having the result true.            The  |truth_table|Truth_Table|  of A   B :            In systems where logical conjunction is not a primitive, it may be defined as    : A   B     or   : A   B         As a rule of inference,  |conjunction_introduction|Conjunction_Introduction|  is a classically  |valid|Validity| , simple  |argument_form|Argument_Form| . The argument form has two premises, A and B. Intuitively, it permits the inference of their conjunction.     :A,   :B.   :Therefore, A and B.     or in  |logical_operator|Logical_Operator|  notation:   : A,   : B   :   A   B     Here is an example of an argument that fits the form  conjunction introduction  |Conjunction_elimination|Conjunction_Elimination|  is another classically  |valid|Validity| , simple  |argument_form|Argument_Form| . Intuitively, it permits the inference from any conjunction of either element of that conjunction.     :A and B.   :Therefore, A.     ...or alternatively,     :A and B.   :Therefore, B.     In  |logical_operator|Logical_Operator|  notation:   : A   B   :   A     ...or alternatively,     : A   B   :   B         A conjunction A  B is be proven false by establishing either   A or   B .   In terms of the object language, this reads     :   A      This formula can be seen as a special case of     :       when C is a false proposition.       If A implies   B , then both   A as well as A prove the conjunction false:   :     In other words, a conjunction can actually be proven false just by knowing about the relation of its conjuncts and not necessary about their truth values.     This formula can be seen as a special case of   :       when C is a false proposition.     Either of the above are constructively valid proofs by contradiction.        commutativity : yes         associativity : yes         distributivity : with various operations, especially with  or               idempotency : yes         monotonicity : yes        truth-preserving: yes   When all inputs are true, the output is true.        falsehood-preserving: yes   When all inputs are false, the output is false.         Walsh spectrum :      Non linearity : 1      If using  |binary|Binary_Numeral_System|  values for true and false , then logical conjunction works exactly like normal arithmetic  |multiplication|Multiplication| .        In high-level computer programming and  |digital_electronics|Digital_Electronics| , logical conjunction is commonly represented by an infix operator, usually as a keyword such as AND , an algebraic multiplication, or the ampersand symbol & . Many languages also provide  |short-circuit|Short-Circuit_Evaluation|  control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.     Logical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where 0 corresponds to false and 1 to true:     0 AND 0     0 ,   0 AND 1     0 ,   1 AND 0     0 ,   1 AND 1     1 .     The operation can also be applied to two binary  |words|Words|  viewed as  |bitstrings|Bitstring|  of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:     11000110 AND 10100011     10000010 .     This can be used to select part of a bitstring using a  |bit_mask|Mask| . For example, 10011101 AND 00001000     00001000 extracts the fifth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.     In  |computer_networking|Computer_Networking| , bit masks are used to derive the network address of a  |subnet|Subnetwork|  within an existing network from a given  |IP_address|Ip_Address| , by ANDing the IP address and the  |subnet_mask|Subnetworkbinary_Subnet_Masks| .     Logical conjunction AND is also used in  |SQL|Sql|  operations to form  |database|Database|  queries.     The  |Curry–Howard_correspondence|Curry–Howard_Correspondence|  relates logical conjunction to  |product_types|Product_Type| .       The membership of an element of an  |intersection_set|Intersection|  in  |set_theory|Set_Theory|  is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: x ∈ A ∩ B if and only if  ∧ . Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as  |associativity|Associativity| ,  |commutativity|Commutativity| , and  |idempotence|Idempotence| .       As with other notions formalized in  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic| , the logical conjunction and is related to, but not the same as, the  |grammatical_conjunction|Grammatical_Conjunction|  and in natural languages.     English and has properties not captured by logical conjunction. For example, and sometimes implies order having the sense of then . For example, They got married and had a child in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.     The word and can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as The American flag is red, white, and blue. Here it is not meant that the flag is at once.
