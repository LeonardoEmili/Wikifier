      Romantic nationalism  is the form of  |nationalism|Nationalism|  in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs. This includes, depending on the particular manner of practice, the  |language|Language| ,  |race|Race| ,  |ethnicity|Ethnicity| ,  |culture|Culture| ,  |religion|Religion| , and  |customs|Customs|  of the  |nation|Nation|  in its primal sense of those who were born within its culture. This form of nationalism arose in reaction to dynastic or imperial  |hegemony|Hegemony| , which assessed the legitimacy of the state from the top down, emanating from a monarch or other authority, which justified its existence. Such downward-radiating power might ultimately derive from a god or gods   .     Among the key themes of  |Romanticism|Romanticism| , and its most enduring legacy, the cultural assertions of romantic nationalism have also been central in  |post-Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  art and political philosophy. From its earliest stirrings, with their focus on the development of national languages and  |folklore|Folklore| , and the spiritual value of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for  |self-determination|Self-Determination|  of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key issues in Romanticism, determining its roles, expressions and meanings. Romantic nationalism, resulting from this interaction between cultural production and political thought, became the celebration of the nation as an inspiring ideal for artistic expression; and the instrumentalization of that expression in political consciousness-raising .  |Joep_Leerssen|Joep_Leerssen| , Notes towards a Definition of Romantic Nationalism , Romantik: Journal for the Study of Romanticisms, 2.1 : 9-25 .     Historically in Europe, the watershed year for romantic nationalism was 1848, when a  |revolutionary_wave|Revolutions_Of_1848|  spread across the continent; numerous  |nationalistic|Nationalism|  revolutions occurred in various fragmented regions or multinational states . While initially the revolutions fell to reactionary forces and the old order was quickly re-established, the many revolutions would mark the first step towards  |liberalization|Liberalism|  and the formation of modern  |nation_states|Nation_States|  across much of Europe.            The ideas of  |Rousseau|Jean-Jacques_Rousseau|  and of  |Johann_Gottfried_von_Herder|Johann_Gottfried_Von_Herder|  inspired much early Romantic nationalism in Europe. Herder argued nationality was the product of climate, geography but more particularly, languages, inclinations and characters, rather than genetics.      From its beginnings in the late 18th century, romantic nationalism has relied upon the existence of a historical ethnic culture which meets the romantic ideal;  |folklore|Folklore|  developed as a romantic nationalist concept. The  |Brothers_Grimm|Brothers_Grimm| , inspired by Herders writings, put together an idealized collection of tales, which they labeled as authentically German. The concept of an inherited cultural patrimony from a common origin rapidly became central to a divisive question within romantic nationalism: specifically, is a nation unified because it comes from the same genetic source, that is because of race, or is the participation in the organic nature of the folk culture self-fulfilling?     Romantic nationalism formed a key strand in the philosophy of  |Hegel|Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|  , who argued that there was a spirit of the age or  zeitgeist  that inhabited a particular people at a particular time, and that, when that people became the active determiner of history, it was simply because their cultural and political moment had come. Because of the Germans role in the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , Hegel argued that his historical moment had seen the Zeitgeist settle on the German-speaking peoples.     In continental Europe, Romantics had embraced the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  in its beginnings, then found themselves fighting the counter-Revolution in the trans-national Imperial system of  |Napoleon|Napoleon| . The sense of self-determination and  |national_consciousness|National_Consciousness|  that had enabled revolutionary forces to defeat aristocratic regimes in battle became rallying points for resistance against the  |French_Empire|First_French_Empire|  . In  |Prussia|Prussia| , the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in the struggle against Napoleon was argued by, among others,  |Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte|Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte|  , a disciple of  |Kant|Immanuel_Kant| . The word  Volkstum , or folkhood , was coined in Germany as part of this resistance to French  |hegemony|Hegemony| .     Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his thirteenth address  |To_the_German_Nation|Addresses_To_The_German_Nation|  in 1806:     :The first, original, and truly natural boundaries of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries. Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole.     :Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality-then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be; and only a man who either entirely lacks the notion of the rule of law and divine order, or else is an obdurate enemy thereto, could take upon himself to want to interfere with that law, which is the highest law in the spiritual world!       In the Balkans, Romantic views of a connection with classical Greece, which inspired  |Philhellenism|Philhellenism|  infused the  |Greek_War_of_Independence|Greek_War_Of_Independence|  , in which the Romantic poet  |Lord_Byron|Lord_Byron|  died of high fever.  |Rossinis|Gioachino_Rossini|  opera  William Tell  marked the onset of the  |Romantic_Opera|Opera| , using the central  |national_myth|National_Myth|  unifying Switzerland; and in Brussels, a riot after an opera that set a doomed romance against a background of foreign oppression  sparked the  |Belgian_Revolution|Belgian_Revolution|  of 1830–31, the first successful revolution in the model of Romantic nationalism.  |Verdis|Giuseppe_Verdi|  opera choruses of an oppressed people inspired two generations of patriots in Italy, especially with Va pensiero . Under the influence of romantic nationalism, among economic and political forces, both Germany and Italy found political unity, and movements to create nations similarly based upon ethnic groups. It would flower in the Balkans , along the Baltic Sea, and in the interior of Central Europe, where in the eventual outcome, the  |Habsburgs|Habsburg|  succumbed to the surge of Romantic nationalism.  |Miroslav_Hroch|Miroslav_Hroch| , Introduction: National romanticism , in Balázs Trencsényi and Michal Kopeček, eds. Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe, vol. II National Romanticism: The Formation of National Movements, 2007:4ff. In  |Norway|Norway| , romanticism was embodied, not in literature, but in the movement toward a national style, both in architecture and in  ethos . Oscar Julius Falnes, National romanticism in Norway, 1968. Earlier, there was a strong romantic nationalist element mixed with  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  rationalism in the rhetoric used in  |British_North_America|British_North_America| , in the colonists  |Declaration_of_Independence|United_States_Declaration_Of_Independence|  and the  |United_States_Constitution|United_States_Constitution|  of 1787, as well as the rhetoric in the wave of revolts, inspired by new senses of localized identities, which swept the American colonies of Spain, one after the other, from the May Revolution of  |Argentina|Argentina|  in 1810.            Following the ultimate collapse of the  |First_French_Empire|First_French_Empire|  with the fall of Napoleon, conservative elements took control in Europe, led by the Austrian noble  |Klemens_von_Metternich|Klemens_Von_Metternich| , ideals of the  |balance_of_power|Balance_Of_Power|  between the  |great_powers|Great_Powers|  of Europe dominated continental politics of the first half of the 19th century. Following the  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna| , and subsequent  |Concert_of_Europe|Concert_Of_Europe|  system, several major empires took control of European politics. Among these were the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| , the  |restored_French_monarchy|Bourbon_Restoration| , the  |German_Confederation|German_Confederation| , under the dominance of  |Prussia|Prussia| , the  |Austrian_Empire|Austrian_Empire| , and the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| .     The conservative forces held sway until the  |Revolutions_of_1848|Revolutions_Of_1848|  swept across Europe and threatened the old order. Numerous movements developed around various cultural groups, who began to develop a sense of national identity. While initially, all of these revolutions failed, and  |reactionary|Reactionary|  forces would re-establish political control, the revolutions marked the start of the steady progress towards the end of the Concert of Europe under the dominance of a few multi-national empires and led to the establishment of the modern  |nation_state|Nation_State|  in Europe; a process that would not be complete for over a century and a half.  |Central_and_Eastern_Europes|Central_And_Eastern_Europe|  political situation was partly shaped by the two  |World_Wars|World_Wars| , while many national identities in these two regions formed modern nation states when the collapse of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and the multinational states  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia|  and  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  led to numerous new states forming during the last decade of the 20th century.            Romantic nationalism inspired the collection of  |folklore|Folklore|  by such people as the  |Brothers_Grimm|Brothers_Grimm| . The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but it fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people.     The  |Brothers_Grimm|Brothers_Grimm|  were criticized because their first edition was insufficiently German, and they followed the advice. They rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by  |Charles_Perrault|Charles_Perrault| , which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;  Sleeping Beauty  survived in their collection because the tale of  |Brynhildr|Brynhildr|  convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. They also altered the language used, changing each Fee to an enchantress or wise woman, every prince to a kings son , every princess to a kings daughter .  |Maria_Tatar|Maria_Tatar| , The Hard Facts of the Grimms Fairy Tales, p31,  Discussing these views in their third editions, they particularly singled out  |Giambattista_Basiles|Giambattista_Basile|   Pentamerone  as the first national collection of fairy tales, and as capturing Neapolitan voice. Benedetto Croce, The Fantastic Accomplishment of Giambattista Basile and His Tale of Tales , Jack Zipes, ed., The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 888-9,      The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian  |Alexander_Afanasyev|Alexander_Afanasyev| , the Norwegians  |Peter_Christen_Asbjørnsen|Peter_Christen_Asbjørnsen|  and  |Jørgen_Moe|Jørgen_Moe| , and the Australian  |Joseph_Jacobs|Joseph_Jacobs| . Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 846,              The concept of a  |national_epic|National_Epic|  , an extensively mythologized legendary work of poetry of defining importance to a certain nation, is another product of Romantic nationalism. The discovery of  Beowulf  in a single manuscript, first transcribed in 1818, came under the impetus of Romantic nationalism, after the manuscript had lain as an ignored curiosity in scholars collections for two centuries. Beowulf was felt to provide people self-identified as  |Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxon|  with their missing national epic , The section III.Early National Poetry of The Cambridge History of English and American Literature begins By far the most important product of the national epos is Beowulf... just when the need for it was first being felt: the fact that Beowulf himself was a  |Geat|Geat|  was easily overlooked. The pseudo-Gaelic literary forgeries of  |Ossian|Ossian|  had failed, finally, to fill the need for the first Romantic generation.     The first publication of  The Tale of Igors Campaign  coincided with the rise in Russian national spirit in the wake of the  |Napoleonic_wars|Napoleonic_Wars|  and  |Suvorovs|Suvorov|  campaigns in Central Europe. The unseen and unheard  Song of Roland  had become a dim memory, until the antiquary  |Francisque_Michel|Francisque_Michel|  transcribed a worn copy in the  |Bodleian_Library|Bodleian_Library|  and put it into print in 1837; it was timely: French interest in the national epic revived among the Romantic generation. In Greece, the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  took on new urgency during the  |Greek_War_of_Independence|Greek_War_Of_Independence| . Amongst the worlds Jewish community, the early  |Zionists|Zionism|  considered the  |Bible|Bible|  a more suitable national epic than the  |Talmud|Talmud| .  |Moshe_Halbertal|Moshe_Halbertal|  , , p.132: With the rise of Jewish nationalism, the relation of many Jews to the Bible and the Talmud took another turn. The Zionists preferred the Bible to the Talmud as the national literature, for the Bible tells a heroic story of the national drama whose focus is the Land of Israel. While they objected to the Haskalah politics of emancipation, Zionist thinkers also stressed the role of the Bible, but they thought of it as an element in building a particular national consciousness rather than as the basis of a shared Judeo-Christian heritage enabling the integration of Jews in Europe. Unlike the Talmud, they held, the Bible had the potential to become a national epic. Its drama unfolded in the hills of Judea, and it connected the national claim to the land with a historical past. Nothing in the Talmud, in contrast, appealed to the romanticism vital to national movements. It does not tell the glorious story of a nation, it has no warriors and heroes, no geography which arouses longing in the reader or a sense of connection to an ancient home.     Many other national epics,  |epic_poetry|Epic_Poetry|  considered to reflect the national spirit, were produced or revived under the influence of Romantic nationalism: particularly in the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| , national minorities seeking to assert their own identities in the face of  |Russification|Russification|  produced new national poetry  – either out of whole cloth, or from cobbling together folk poetry, or by resurrecting older narrative poetry. Examples include the  |Estonia|Estonia| n  Kalevipoeg ,  |Finnish|Finland|   Kalevala ,  |Polish|Poland|   Pan Tadeusz ,  |Latvia|Latvia| n  Lāčplēsis ,  |Armenia|Armenia| n Sasuntzi Davit by  |Hovhannes_Tumanyan|Hovhannes_Tumanyan| ,  |Georgia|Georgia| n  The Knight in the Panthers Skin  and  |Greater_Iran|Greater_Iran|  ,  Shahnameh .       thu , St Petersburg , 1883–1907     :Main articles:  |Musical_nationalism|Musical_Nationalism|  and  |National_Romantic_style|National_Romantic_Style|  .     After the 1870s national romanticism , as it is more usually called, became a familiar movement in the arts. Romantic musical nationalism is exemplified by the work of Bedřich Smetana , especially the symphonic poem Vltava . In Scandinavia and the Slavic parts of Europe especially, national romanticism provided a series of answers to the 19th-century search for styles that would be culturally meaningful and evocative, yet not merely historicist. When a church was built over the spot in St Petersburg where Tsar Alexander II of Russia had been assassinated, the Church of the Savior on Blood , the natural style to use was one that best evoked traditional Russian features . In Finland, the reassembly of the national epic, the  |Kalevala|Kalevala| , inspired paintings and murals in the National Romantic style that substituted there for the international Art Nouveau styles. The foremost proponent in Finland was Akseli Gallen-Kallela .   thu , Akseli Gallen-Kallela     By the turn of the century, ethnic self-determination had become an assumption held as being progressive and liberal. There were romantic nationalist movements for separation in Finland , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , the Kingdom of Bavaria held apart from a united Germany, and Czech and Serb nationalism continued to trouble Imperial politics. The flowering of arts which drew inspiration from national epics and song continued unabated. The Zionist movement revived Hebrew, and began immigration to Eretz Yisrael , and Welsh and Irish tongues also experienced a poetic revival.       At the same time, linguistic and cultural nationality, colored with pre-genetic concepts of race, bolstered two rhetorical claims consistently associated with romantic nationalism to this day: claims of primacy and claims of superiority. Primacy is the claimed inalienable right of a culturally and racially defined people to a geographical terrain, a  heartland  or homeland . The polemics of racial superiority became inexorably intertwined with romantic nationalism. Richard Wagner notoriously argued that those who were ethnically different could not comprehend the artistic and cultural meaning inherent in national culture. Identifying Jewishness even in musical style, Wagner,  |Das_Judenthum_in_der_Musik|Das_Judenthum_In_Der_Musik|  1850. he specifically attacked the Jews as being unwilling to assimilate into German culture, and thus unable to truly comprehend the mysteries of its music and language. Sometimes national epics such as the Nibelunglied have had a galvanizing effect on social politics.       thu , 1918.In the first two decades of the 20th century, Romantic Nationalism as an idea was to have crucial influence on political events. Following the Panic of 1873 that gave rise to a new wave of antisemitism and racism in the German Empire politically ruled by an authoritarian, militaristic conservatism under Otto von Bismarck and in parallel with a wide revival of irrational emotionalism known as  |Fin_de_siècle|Fin_De_Siècle|  , the racist, so-called völkisch movement grew out of Romantic nationalism during the last third of the 19th century, to some extent modelling itself on British Imperialism and the White Mans Burden . The idea was that Germans should naturally rule over lesser peoples. Romantic nationalism, which had begun as a revolt against foreign kings and overlords, had come full circle, and was being used to make the case for a Greater Germanic Empire which would rule over Europe.     The nationalistic and imperialistic tensions rising high between the European nations throughout the irrational, neo-Romantic Fin de siècle period eventually erupted in the First World War . After Germany had lost the war and undergone the tumultuous German Revolution , the völkisch movement drastically radicalized itself in Weimar Germany under the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles , and Adolf Hitler would go on to say that the basic ideas of National-Socialism are völkisch, just as the völkisch .
