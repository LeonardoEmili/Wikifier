     Saint Bruno of Querfurt , also known as Brun and Boniface, was a Christian  |missionary|Missionary| |bishop|Bishop|  and  |martyr|Christian_Martyrs| , who was beheaded near the border of  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus|  and  |Lithuania|Lithuania|  for trying to spread Christianity. He is also called the second Apostle of the  |Prussians|Old_Prussians|  .           Bruno was from a noble family of  |Querfurt|Querfurt|  . He is rumored to have been a relative of the  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| |Otto_III|Otto_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| . At the age of six, he was sent to be educated at the cathedral school in  |Magdeburg|Magdeburg| , seat of  |Adalbert_of_Magdeburg|Adalbert_Of_Magdeburg| , the teacher and namesake of  |Saint_Adalbert|Adalbert_Of_Prague| . While still a youth, he was made a  |canon|Canon|  of the  |Cathedral_of_Magdeburg|Cathedral_Of_Magdeburg| . The fifteen-year-old Otto III made Bruno a part of his royal court. In 995 Otto III appointed Bruno as his court chaplain.      While in  |Rome|Rome|  for Ottos imperial coronation, Bruno met  |Saint_Adalbert_of_Prague|Adalbert_Of_Prague| , the first Apostle of the Prussians , killed a year later, which inspired Bruno to write a biography of St. Adalbert when he reached the  |recently_Christianized|Christianizationhungary|  and consolidated  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  himself. Bruno spent much time at the monastery where Adalbert had become a  |monk|Monk|  and where abbot  |John_Canaparius|John_Canaparius|  may have written a life of Saint Adalbert. In 998, Bruno entered a Benedictine monastery near  |Ravenna|Ravenna|  that Otto had founded, and later underwent strict  |ascetic|Ascetic|  training under the guidance of  |Saint_Romuald|Saint_Romuald| .              |Otto_III|Otto_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  hoped to establish a monastery between the  |Elbe|Elbe|  and the  |Oder|Oder|   to help convert the local population to Christianity and colonize the area. In 1001, two monks from his monastery traveled to Poland, while Bruno was with Otto in Italy, studying the language and awaiting the Apostolic appointment by  |Pope_Sylvester_II|Pope_Sylvester_Ii| .     In 1003  |Pope_Sylvester_II|Pope_Sylvester_Ii|  appointed Bruno, at the age of 33, to head a mission amongst the pagan peoples of Eastern Europe. Bruno left Rome in 1004, and having been named an archbishop was consecrated in February of that year by Archbishop Tagino of Magdeburg.  Owing to a regional conflict between the  |Holy_Roman_Emperor_Henry_II|Henry_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and  |Duke_Boleslaus_I_of_Poland|Boleslaus_I_Of_Poland| , Bruno could not go directly to Poland so he set out for Hungary. There he went to the places that Saint Adalbert of Prague had attended.     Bruno tried to persuade  |Ahtum|Ahtum| , the Duke of  |Banat|Banat| , who was under jurisdiction of  |Patriarchate_of_Constantinople|Patriarchate_Of_Constantinople|  to accept the jurisdiction of the  |Bishop_of_Rome|Bishop_Of_Rome| , but this precipitated a large controversy leading to organized opposition from local monks. Bruno elected to gracefully exit the region after he first finished his book, the famous  Life of St. Adalbert ,  a literary memorial giving a history of the conversion of the Hungarians.     After this diplomatic failure, Bruno went to  |Kiev|Kiev| , where Grand Duke  |Vladimir_I|Vladimir_I,_Prince_Of_Kiev|  authorized him to make Christian converts among the  |Pechenegs|Pechenegs| , semi-nomadic  |Turkic_peoples|Turkic_Peoples|  living between the  |Danube|Danube|  and the  |Don|Don_River,_Russia|  rivers. Bruno spent five months there and baptized some thirty adults. He helped to bring about a peace treaty between them and the ruler of Kiev.     Before leaving for Poland, Bruno  |consecrated|Consecration|  a bishop for the  |Pechenegs|Pechenegs| . While in Poland he consecrated the first Bishop of Sweden and is said to have sent emissaries to baptize the king of Sweden,  whose mother had come from Poland. Bruno found out that his friend Benedict and four companions had been killed by robbers in 1003. Bruno took eyewitness accounts and wrote down a touching history of the so-called Five Martyred Brothers.        In the autumn or at the end of 1008 Bruno and eighteen companions set out to found a mission among the  |Old_Prussians|Old_Prussians| ; they succeeded in converting Netimer and then traveled to the east, heading very likely towards  |Yotvingia|Yotvingians| . Yotvingia was a Prussian region, then subordinate to  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus|  , that intersected the borders of what was then  |Prussia|Old_Prussia| , Kievan Rus and the  |Duchy_of_Lithuania|Duchy_Of_Lithuania| . According to the Annals of Magdeburg and some other sources.     Bruno met opposition in his efforts to evangelize the borderland and that when he persisted in disregarding their warnings he was  |beheaded|Decapitation|  in 9 March 1009, and most of his eighteen companions were hanged by Zebeden, brother of Netimer. Duke  |Boleslaus_the_Brave|Boleslaus_The_Brave|  bought the bodies and brought them to Poland . The Annals of Magdeburg,  |Thietmar_of_Merseburgs|Thietmar_Of_Merseburg|  Chronicle, the  Annals of Quedlinburg , various works of  |Magdeburg|Magdeburg|  Bishops, and many other written sources of 11thâ€“15th centuries record this story.     Soon after his death, Bruno and his companions were venerated as martyrs and Bruno was soon after  |canonized|Canonized| . It was said that  |Braunsberg|Braunsberg| .
