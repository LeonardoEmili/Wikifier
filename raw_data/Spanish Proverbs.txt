Spanish proverbs are a subset of  |proverbs|Proverbs|  that are used in Western cultures in general; there are many that have essentially the same form and content as their counterparts in other Western languages. Proverbs that have their origin in Spanish have migrated to and from  |English|English_Language| ,  |French|French_Language| ,  |Flemish|Flemish_Language| ,  |German|German_Language|  and other languages.       Many Spanish proverbs have a long history of cultural diffusion; there are proverbs, for example, that have their origin traced to  |Babylon|Babylon|  and that have come down to us through  |Greece|Ancient_Greece|  and  |Rome|Ancient_Rome| ; equivalents of the Spanish proverb “En boca cerrada no entran moscas” belong to the cultural tradition of many  |north_African_countries|North_Africa|  as far as  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| ; having gone through multiple languages and millennia, this proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb.     The written evidence of the use of Spanish proverbs goes far back in Spanish literature. El Cantar de Mio Cid, written at the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century, is the first instance. Examples of other early works that use Spanish proverbs are the Libro de Buen Amor by  |Juan_Ruiz|Juan_Ruiz|  and El Corbacho by  |Alfonso_Martínez_de_Toledo|Alfonso_Martínez_De_Toledo|  . The first anthology of Spanish proverbs, Proverbios que dicen las viejas tras el fuego, was written by  |Íñigo_López_de_Mendoza_Marques_of_Santillana|Íñigo_López_De_Mendoza_Marqués_De_Santillana|  . Also in the 15th century was written the Seniloquium, an erudite and anonymous work containing a compendium of Spanish sayings and proverbs with commentaries. The language of the characters in  |Fernando_de_Rojas|Fernando_De_Rojas| ’  La Celestina  is enlivened with the use of proverbs. And then, of course, in the 17th century there is the incomparable  Don Quijote de la Mancha  by  |Cervantes|Miguel_De_Cervantes| .      |Sancho_Panza|Sancho_Panza| , Cervantes’ wonderful, earthy, character, is the essential common man. His thinking habitually relies on the authority he vests in the wealth of popular cultural wisdom expressed in proverbs, which he continually quotes. In many of his utterances there is reference to one and sometimes to more proverbs. Don Quijote is a veritable treasure trove of Spanish proverbs.     There are Spanish proverbs that contradict others; the “wisdom” that they encapsulate is not, of course, absolute. People will use those proverbs that best conform to their own particular way of approaching life. Taken together, however, they reveal the deep wellsprings of Spanish culture and of human nature in general.

When his father  |Ferdinand_I_of_Leon_and_Castile|Ferdinand_I_Of_Leon_And_Castile|  at his death in 1065 divided up his kingdom among his three sons, including himself, Sancho II remained silent. Soon after his fathers death, however, he turned on his brothers and succeeded in dispossessing them, reuniting thus his fathers possessions under his control in 1072. The author Correas, however, sustains that Sancho is used as a variation of the adjective santo and should therefore be written in lower-case.
