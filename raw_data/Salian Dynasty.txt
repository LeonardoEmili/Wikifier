     The Salian dynasty  was a  |dynasty|Dynasty|  in the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages| . The dynasty provided four  |German_Kings|List_Of_German_Kings_And_Emperorskings|  , all of whom went on to be crowned  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  ; as such, the term Salic dynasty is also used to refer to the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  of the time as a separate term.     After the death of the last  |Saxon|Duchy_Of_Saxony|  of the  |Ottonian_Dynasty|Ottonian_Dynasty|  in 1024, the  |elective|Elective_Monarchy|  titles of  |King_of_the_Germans|King_Of_The_Germans|  and then three years later Holy Roman Emperor both passed to the first monarch of the Salian dynasty in the person of  |Conrad_II|Conrad_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , the only son of  |Count_Henry_of_Speyer|Henry_Of_Speyer|  and  |Adelheid_of_Alsace|Adelheid_Of_Alsace|  . He was elected German King in 1024 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 26 March 1027.     The four Salian kings of the dynasty— |Conrad_II|Conrad_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| ,  |Henry_III|Henry_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| ,  |Henry_IV|Henry_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , and  |Henry_V|Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| —ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1027 to 1125, and firmly established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.             |Werner|Werner_V|  of  |Worms|Worms,_Germany|  and his son Duke  |Conrad_the_Red|Conrad_The_Red|  of Lorraine, who died in 955, founded the ancestral dynasty. Conrad the Red married  |Liutgarde|Liutgard_Of_Saxony| , a daughter of  |Emperor_Otto_I|Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| . Their son  |Otto_I,_Duke_of_Carinthia|Otto_I,_Duke_Of_Carinthia|  ruled Carinthia from 978 to 1004.     Duke Otto had three sons: Bruno, who became  |Pope_Gregory_V|Pope_Gregory_V| ; Conrad; and  |Henry|Henry_Of_Speyer| , count of  |Speyer|Speyer| . Henry was the father of the first Salian Emperor Conrad II.      |Pope_Leo_IX|Pope_Leo_Ix|  also had family ties to the dynasty, since his grandfather Hugo III was the brother of Adelheid, the grandmother of  |Henry_III|Henry_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| .       After the death of the last Saxon Emperor  |Henry_II|Henry_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  the first Salian regent Conrad II was elected by the majority of the  |Prince-electors|Prince-Elector|  and was crowned German king in  |Mainz|Mainz|  on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to  |Milan|Milan| , where  |Ariberto|Archbishop_Aribert_Of_Milan| ,  |archbishop_of_Milan|Archbishop_Of_Milan| , crowned him  |king_of_Italy|King_Of_Italy| . When  |Rudolph_III,_King_of_Burgundy|Rudolph_Iii,_King_Of_Burgundy|  died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Provençal nobles paid homage to Conrad in  |Zürich|Zürich|  in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the  |Kingdom_of_Arles|Kingdom_Of_Arles|  under Conrads successors.     Already in 1028 Conrad II had his son  |Henry_III|Henry_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  elected and anointed king of Germany. Henrys tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign  |Speyer_Cathedral|Speyer_Cathedral|  was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henrys conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in  |Lorraine|Lorraine| , this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052–1055. 1046 Henry ended the  |papal_schism|Schism| , freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.      The early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the  |Church|Catholic_Church| , a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the  |Investiture_Controversy|Investiture_Controversy|  , a struggle in which the reformist Pope,  |Gregory_VII|Pope_Gregory_Vii| , demanded that Emperor  |Henry_IV|Henry_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to  |Canossa|Canossa|  in northern  |Italy|Italy|  in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture and arranged the election of an  |antipope|Antipope|   in 1080.     The monarchs struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the  |Concordat_of_Worms|Concordat_Of_Worms|  in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty  |Henry_V|Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  coincided with the final phase of the great  |Investiture_Controversy|Investiture_Controversy| , which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of  |Gregorian_reform|Gregorian_Reform| ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.     According to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his familys territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire – in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empires intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in  |France|France|  and  |Italy|Italy| . For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.     The first  |Hohenstaufen|House_Of_Hohenstaufen|  king  |Conrad_III|Conrad_Iii_Of_Germany|  was a grandson of the Salian  |Henry_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Henry_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| .          |Conrad_II|Conrad_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  1024–1039, crowned emperor on 26 March 1027    |Henry_III|Henry_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  1039–1056, crowned emperor on 25 December 1046    |Henry_IV|Henry_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  1056–1106, crowned emperor on 31 March 1084    |Conrad|Conrad_Ii_Of_Italy|  1087–1098, nominal king under his father Henry IV    |Henry_V|Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  1106–1125, crowned emperor on 13 April 1111     Their regnal dates as emperor take into account elections and subsequent  |coronations|Coronation_Of_The_Holy_Roman_Emperor| .
