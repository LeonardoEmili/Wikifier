   In  |geometry|Geometry| , a dodecahedron  is any  |polyhedron|Polyhedron|  with twelve flat faces. The most familiar dodecahedron is the  |regular_dodecahedron|Regular_Dodecahedron| , which is a  |Platonic_solid|Platonic_Solid| . There are also three  |regular_star_dodecahedra|Kepler–Poinsot_Polyhedron| , which are constructed as  |stellations|Stellation|  of the convex form. All of these have  |icosahedral_symmetry|Icosahedral_Symmetry| , order 120.     The  |pyritohedron|Pyritohedron| , a common crystal form in  |pyrite|Pyrite| , is an irregular pentagonal dodecahedron, having the same topology as the regular one but  |pyritohedral_symmetry|Pyritohedral_Symmetry|  while the  |tetartoid|Tetartoid|  has  |tetrahedral_symmetry|Tetrahedral_Symmetry| . The  |rhombic_dodecahedron|Rhombic_Dodecahedron| , seen as a limiting case of the pyritohedron, has  |octahedral_symmetry|Octahedral_Symmetry| . The  |elongated_dodecahedron|Elongated_Dodecahedron|  and  |trapezo-rhombic_dodecahedron|Trapezo-Rhombic_Dodecahedron|  variations, along with the rhombic dodecahedra, are  |space-filling|Space-Filling_Polyhedra| . There are numerous  |other_dodecahedra|Other_Dodecahedra| .          The convex regular dodecahedron is one of the five regular  |Platonic_solids|Platonic_Solid|  and can be represented by its  |Schläfli_symbol|Schläfli_Symbol|  .     The  |dual_polyhedron|Dual_Polyhedron|  is the regular  |icosahedron|Icosahedron|  , having five equilateral triangles around each vertex.        The convex regular dodecahedron also has three  |stellations|Stellation| , all of which are regular star dodecahedra. They form three of the four  |Kepler–Poinsot_polyhedra|Kepler–Poinsot_Polyhedra| . They are the  |small_stellated_dodecahedron|Small_Stellated_Dodecahedron|  , the  |great_dodecahedron|Great_Dodecahedron|  , and the  |great_stellated_dodecahedron|Great_Stellated_Dodecahedron|  . The small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are dual to each other; the great stellated dodecahedron is dual to the  |great_icosahedron|Great_Icosahedron|  . All of these regular star dodecahedra have regular pentagonal or  |pentagram|Pentagram| mic faces. The convex regular dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron are different realisations of the same  |abstract_regular_polyhedron|Abstract_Polytope| ; the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are different realisations of another abstract regular polyhedron.       In  |crystallography|Crystallography| , two important dodecahedra can occur as crystal forms in some  |symmetry_classes|Crystallographic_Point_Groups|  of the  |cubic_crystal_system|Cubic_Crystal_System|  that are topologically equivalent to the regular dodecahedron but less symmetrical: the pyritohedron with  |pyritohedral_symmetry|Pyritohedral_Symmetry| , and the  |tetartoid|Tetartoid|  with  |tetrahedral_symmetry|Tetrahedral_Symmetry|             A pyritohedron is a dodecahedron with  |pyritohedral|Pyritohedral_Symmetry|  symmetry. Like the  |regular_dodecahedron|Regular_Dodecahedron| , it has twelve identical  |pentagon|Pentagon| al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices . . Galleries.com. Retrieved on 2016-12-02. However, the pentagons are not constrained to be regular, and the underlying atomic arrangement has no true fivefold symmetry axes. Its 30 edges are divided into two sets – containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of  |rotational_symmetry|Rotational_Symmetry|  are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.     Although regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral  |pyrite|Pyrite| , and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular  |Platonic_solid|Platonic_Solid|  form. The true regular dodecahedron can occur as a shape for  |quasicrystals|Quasicrystal|   with  |icosahedral_symmetry|Icosahedral_Symmetry| , which includes true fivefold rotation axes.            Its name comes from one of the two common  |crystal_habits|Crystal_Habit|  shown by  |pyrite|Pyrite| , the other one being the  |cube|Cube| .             The coordinates of the eight vertices of the original cube are:   :     The coordinates of the 12 vertices of the cross-edges are:   :   :   :     where h is the height of the  |wedge-shaped_roof|Wedge|  above the faces of the cube. When h    1, the six cross-edges degenerate to points and a  |rhombic_dodecahedron|Rhombic_Dodecahedron|  is formed. When h    0, the cross-edges are absorbed in the facets of the cube, and the pyritohedron reduces to a cube. When h    , the multiplicative inverse of the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio| , the result is a regular dodecahedron. When h    , the conjugate of this value, the result is a regular  |great_stellated_dodecahedron|Great_Stellated_Dodecahedron| .     A reflected pyritohedron is made by swapping the nonzero coordinates above. The two pyritohedra can be superimposed to give the  |compound_of_two_dodecahedra|Compound_Of_Two_Dodecahedra| . The image to the left shows the case where the pyritohedra are convex regular dodecahedra.                       The pyritohedron has a geometric degree of freedom with  |limiting_cases|Limiting_Case|  of a cubic  |convex_hull|Convex_Hull|  at one limit of colinear edges, and a  |rhombic_dodecahedron|Rhombic_Dodecahedron|  as the other limit as 6 edges are degenerated to length zero. The regular dodecahedron represents a special intermediate case where all edges and angles are equal.     The endo-dodecahedron can tessellate space with the convex regular dodecahedron.                  A tetartoid  is a dodecahedron with chiral  |tetrahedral_symmetry|Tetrahedral_Symmetry|  . Like the  |regular_dodecahedron|Regular_Dodecahedron| , it has twelve identical  |pentagon|Pentagon| al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.     Although regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry. Dutch, Steve.  .

Retrieved on 2016-12-02.        Its topology can be as a cube with square faces bisected into 2 rectangles like the pyritohedron, and then the bisection lines are slanted retaining 3-fold rotation at the 8 corners.

It can be seen as a tetrahedron, with edges divided into 3 segments, along with a center point of each triangular face. In  |Conway_polyhedron_notation|Conway_Polyhedron_Notation|  it can be seen as gT, a gyro tetrahedron.   :               A lower symmetry form of the regular dodecahedron can be constructed as the dual of a polyhedra constructed from two triangular  |anticupola|Anticupola|  connected base-to-base, called a triangular gyrobianticupola. It has D 3d symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.   :          The  rhombic dodecahedron  is a  |zonohedron|Zonohedron|  with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the  |quasiregular|Quasiregular_Polyhedron| |cuboctahedron|Cuboctahedron|   and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.     The rhombic dodecahedron can be seen as a degenerate  |pyritohedron|Pyritohedron|  where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.     The rhombic dodecahedron has several  |stellations|Stellation| , the  |first_of_which|First_Stellation_Of_Rhombic_Dodecahedron|  is also a  |parallelohedral_spacefiller|Rhombic_Dodecahedronparallelohedron| .     Another important rhombic dodecahedron, the  |Bilinski_dodecahedron|Bilinski_Dodecahedron| , has twelve faces congruent to those of the  |rhombic_triacontahedron|Rhombic_Triacontahedron| , i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio| .
