      Einsteinium is a  |synthetic_element|Synthetic_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Es and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  99. As a member of the  |actinide|Actinide|  series, it is the seventh  |transuranic_element|Transuranic_Element| .     Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the  |first_hydrogen_bomb|Ivy_Mike|  explosion in 1952, and named after  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein| . Its most common  |isotope|Isotope|  einsteinium-253 is produced artificially from decay of  |californium|Californium| -253 in a few dedicated high-power  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor|  with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but in much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element  |mendelevium|Mendelevium|  in 1955.     Einsteinium is a soft, silvery,  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism| |metal|Metal| . Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State| ; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000  |watts|Watt|  per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253s decay to  |berkelium|Berkelium| -249 and then  |californium|Californium| -249 at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. . periodic.lanl.gov Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.     Like all synthetic  |transuranic_elements|Transuranic_Element| , isotopes of einsteinium are very  |radioactive|Radioactivity|  and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.          Einsteinium was  |first_identified|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in December 1952 by  |Albert_Ghiorso|Albert_Ghiorso|  and co-workers at the  |University_of_California,_Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley|  in collaboration with the  |Argonne|Argonne_National_Laboratory|  and  |Los_Alamos|Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory|  National Laboratories, in the fallout from the  Ivy Mike  nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952, at  |Enewetak_Atoll|Enewetak_Atoll|  in the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean|  and was the first successful test of a  |hydrogen_bomb|Hydrogen_Bomb| . Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of  |plutonium|Plutonium| , , which could only have formed by the absorption of six  |neutrons|Neutron|  by a  |uranium-238|Uranium-238|  nucleus followed by two  |beta_decays|Beta_Decay| .   : U - /chem  ref name Ghiorso  /ref  ref names39  /ref ref name Ghiorso /  ref nameem  /ref sup /sup  ref name Ghiorso /  ref name Ghiorso / chem .
