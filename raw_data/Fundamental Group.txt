     In the  |mathematical|Mathematics|  field of  |algebraic_topology|Algebraic_Topology| , the fundamental group of a  |topological_space|Topological_Space|  is the  |group|Group|  of the  |equivalence_class|Equivalence_Class| es under  |homotopy|Homotopy|  of the    |loops|Loop|  contained in the space. It records information about the basic shape, or holes, of the  |topological_space|Topological_Space| . The fundamental group is the first and simplest  |homotopy_group|Homotopy_Group| . The fundamental group is a  |homotopy_invariant|Homotopy_Invariant|  topological spaces that are  |homotopy_equivalent|Homotopy_Equivalent|   have  |isomorphic|Group_Isomorphism|  fundamental groups.     The  |abelianization|Abelianization|  of the fundamental group can be identified with the first  |homology_group|Homology_Group|  of the space. When the topological space is homeomorphic to a  |simplicial_complex|Simplicial_Complex| , its fundamental group can be described explicitly in terms of  |generators_and_relations|Presentation_Of_A_Group| .      |Henri_Poincaré|Henri_Poincaré|  defined the fundamental group in 1895 in his paper  |Analysis_situs|Analysis_Situs|  .  Translated in  The concept emerged in the theory of  |Riemann_surfaces|Riemann_Surface| , in the work of  |Bernhard_Riemann|Bernhard_Riemann| , Poincaré, and  |Felix_Klein|Felix_Klein| . It describes the  |monodromy|Monodromy|  properties of  |complex-valued_functions|Complex-Valued_Function| , as well as providing a complete topological  |classification_of_closed_surfaces|Classification_Of_Surfaces| .       Start with a space , and some point in it, and all the loops both starting and ending at this point — paths that start at this point, wander around and eventually return to the starting point. Two loops can be combined together in an obvious way: travel along the first loop, then along the second.   Two loops are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without breaking. The set of all such loops with this method of combining and this equivalence between them is the fundamental group for that particular space.            Throughout this article, X is a topological space. A typical example is a surface such as the one depicted at the right. Moreover, x0 is a point in X called the base-point. The idea of the definition of the homotopy group is to measure how many curves on X can be deformed into each other. The precise definition depends on the notion of the homotopy of loops, which is explained first.         Given a topological space X, a  loop based at x0  is defined to be a  |continuous_function|Continuous_Function|     :   :   X   such that both the starting point   and the end point   are both equal to x0.        A  homotopy  is a continuous interpolation between two loops. More precisely, a homotopy between two loops     :   X is a continuous map   : h :     X,   such that   : h x0 for all t   that is, the starting point of the homotopy is x0 for all t .   : h x0 for all t   that is, similarly the end point stays at x0 for all t.   : h   h   for all r       If such a homotopy h exists,   and   are said to be homotopic. The relation   is homotopic to   is an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation|  so that the set of  |equivalence_class|Equivalence_Class| es can be considered:   :   :   /     It is called the fundamental group of the topological space X and the base point x0. The purpose of considering the equivalence classes of loops up to homotopy, as opposed to the set of all loops  is that the latter, while being useful for various purposes, is a rather big and unwieldy object. By contrast the above quotient has, in many cases, a manageable and computable size.          By the above definition,   is just a set. It becomes a group  using the concatenation of loops. More precisely, given two loops     their product is defined as the loop   :           : &   X     &       & 0   t           &     t   1.           Thus the loop       first follows the loop   with twice the speed and then follows   with twice the speed .     The product of two homotopy classes of loops and is then defined as It can be shown that this product does not depend on the choice of representatives and therefore gives a well-defined operation on the set   This operation turns   into a group. Its  |neutral_element|Neutral_Element|  is the constant loop which stays at x0 for all times t. The inverse of a loop is the same loop, but traversed in the opposite direction. More formally,   :   :     Given three based loops       the product   :       is the concatenation of these loops, traversing   and then   with quadruple speed, and then   with double speed. By comparison,   :       traverses the same paths , but   with double speed, and     with quadruple speed. Thus, because of the differing speeds, the two paths are not identical. The  |associativity|Associativity|  axiom   :           therefore crucially depends on the fact that paths are considered up to homotopy. Indeed, both above composites are homotopic, for example, to the loops which traverses all three loops       with triple speed. The set of based loops up to homotopy, equipped with the above operation therefore does turn   into a group.       Although the fundamental group in general depends on the choice of base point, it turns out that,  |up_to|Up_To| |isomorphism|Isomorphism|  , this choice makes no difference as long as the space X is  |path-connected|Path_Connected| . For path-connected spaces, therefore, many authors therefore write :     instead of            .
