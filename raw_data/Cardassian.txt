              The Cardassians  are a fictional  |extraterrestrial_species|Extraterrestrial_Life_In_Popular_Culture|  in the American  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  franchise  Star Trek . They were devised in 1991 for the series  Star Trek: The Next Generation  before being used in the subsequent series  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  and  Star Trek: Voyager .     The writers of The Next Generation introduced the Cardassians for the fourth season episode  |The_Wounded|The_Wounded|  . The species was devised to be new antagonists for the crew of the  |USS_Enterprise-D|Uss_Enterprise-D| , ones with whom the protagonists could interact; the other major antagonists of The Next Generation, the  |Borg|Borg| , lacked personality or individuality, hindering interpersonal drama. In the series, which is set in the 24th century, the Cardassians are presented as living under a military government controlling an interstellar empire, the Cardassian Union. They are depicted occupying other planets, most notably  |Bajor|Bajor| . When the spin-off show, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, was launched in 1993, its writers set its events in the vicinity of Bajor in the aftermath of the Cardassian occupation. The Cardassians remained major antagonists throughout the series, with the Cardassian characters  |Elim_Garak|Elim_Garak|   and  |Gul_Dukat|Dukat|   being recurrent.     Star Trek: The Next Generation The Wounded : 1991     The Cardassians were invented by the writers of  Star Trek: The Next Generation  for the shows fourth season episode  |The_Wounded|The_Wounded|  . The story was written by Stuart Charno, Sara Charno, and Cy Chermak, while the teleplay was written by  |Jeri_Taylor|Jeri_Taylor| . The episode was first screened in January 1991. The episodes script related that the Cardassian Union and the  |United_Federation_of_Planets|United_Federation_Of_Planets| —of which Earth is a part—had been involved in skirmishes for many years but had signed a peace treaty. Its plot begins with the revelation that the USS Phoenix, a renegade Federation starship under the command of Captain Benjamin Maxwell , has begun attacking Cardassian targets, because Maxwell is convinced that the Cardassians are re-arming for a war against the Federation. The  |USS_Enterprise-D|Uss_Enterprise-D| , the starship captained by  |Jean-Luc_Picard|Jean-Luc_Picard|  , is sent to stop the Phoenix, with the Cardassian Gul Macet  coming aboard the Enterprise to assist.     The design of the Cardassians was undertaken by the series costume designer Bob Blackman and makeup designer Michael Westmore. They sought to give the species a snakelike appearance. Westmore was inspired by an  |abstract_painting|Abstract_Art|  he had seen in a  |Ventura_Boulevard|Ventura_Boulevard|  store which featured a wide-shouldered woman with what looked like a spoon on her forehead.   For this episode, several Cardassians were depicted wearing helmets, something that was never again done in the franchise; Blackman and Westmores designs also gave Gul Macet facial hair, the only time a Cardassian would be depicted this way.     Rick Sternbach designed the Cardassian spaceship used in The Wounded . He initially proposed a pod-shaped vessel, before replacing that with a design resembling a  |scorpion|Scorpion| , and then one based on the  |ankh|Ankh|  symbol. Sternbach later noted that The Galor class started with an Egyptian ankh, given how they were like the Pharaohs to the Bajoran slaves, but you dont really see the basic shape unless you look straight down on the vessel. The little disruptor pyramids were a bit more obvious, as were the temple type structures on the ships backbone, and the sandy yellow shades.    Miarecki and Tom Hudson then built the model from Sternbachs design. On art department maps, the Cardassian Union was placed west of the United Federation of Planets, while the  |Klingon|Klingon|  and  |Romulan|Romulan|  Empires were presented to the east of it. For this episode, the designers displayed Cardassian weapons firing a pink discharge, although in later episodes this would be changed to amber.     Alaimos appearance as Gul Macet in The Wounded made him the second actor, after  |Mark_Lenard|Mark_Lenard| , to have played three separate alien species in the Star Trek franchise; in earlier episodes he had portrayed an Antican  and a Romulan . He would later portray a human in The Next Generation episode  |Times_Arrow|Times_Arrow|  before gaining a recurring role as the Cardassian Gul Dukat in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.         In the fifth season episode  |Ensign_Ro|Ensign_Ro|  , written by  |Rick_Berman|Rick_Berman|  and  |Michael_Piller|Michael_Piller|  and first screened in October 1991, the  |Bajoran|Bajoran|  species were introduced. The script explained that the Cardassians annexed the Bajoran homeworld—called Bajor—forty years previously, with many Bajorans fleeing their planet as refugees and often fighting back with militant tactics. Ensign Ro was the first episode in which the Cardassian warships were introduced as being Galor class vessels. Although it had not been intended at the time, the situation between the Cardassians and Bajorans laid the groundwork for the plot of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.     The Cardassians were central to the two-part sixth season episode  |Chain_of_Command|Chain_Of_Command|  , written by  |Frank_Abatemarco|Frank_Abatemarco|  and screened in December 1992. In these episodes, the Federation have gained intelligence that the Cardassians are developing a genetically engineered virus on an uninhabited planet. Picard is sent on a mission to infiltrate and destroy the weapon but is apprehended and tortured by the Cardassian Gul Madred .   Chain of Command Part I included the first mention that the Cardassians homeworld was called Cardassia and also included the first mention of the Cardassian Union as the name of their interstellar state, with previous mentions being of the Cardassian Empire . The script for Chain of Command Part I also introduced the news that the Cardassians had withdrawn from Bajor. This set the stage for the events of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, which began airing a month later. The shows designers first included the Cardassians hand weapon in this episode, with Sternbach describing its appearance as being like a copper-colored banana . The second part of Chain of Command provided a brief history of the Cardassians and their military government.     The Cardassians also appeared in the sixth season episode  |The_Chase|The_Chase|  , written by Joe Menovksy and Ron D. Moore and screened in April 1993. In this episode, it is revealed that humans and Cardassians—as well as the Klingons and Romulans—are all descended from an ancient species that seeded many planets with life. In the seventh season episode  |Journeys_End|Journeys_End|  , written by Ronald D. Moore, it is explained that the treaty between the Federation and the Cardassians left various Federation planets in Cardassian territory. Many of these Federation colonists refused to leave. The presence of these Federation colonists and their struggle for independence from Cardassian rule formed a recurring plot theme for both Deep Space Nine and Voyager. Journeys End was the first time that Cardassian communicators were featured; these were designed as affixed to the actors wrists. The conflict between the Cardassians and these rebel colonists, known as the Maquis, was again used as the basis for the penultimate episode in the series,  |Preemptive_Strike|Preemptive_Strike|  , which was written by Naren Shankar and René Echevarria and directed by Stewart.     Star Trek: Deep Space Nine     Launching the new series,  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine , was the pilot episode  |Emissary|Emissary|  , written by Rick Berman and Michael Pillar. For this episode, the writers focused in on the aftermath of the Cardassian departure from Bajor. The premise of the series revolves around the Federation taking control of Deep Space Nine, a Cardassian-built space station orbiting Bajor, at the request of the Bajoran provisional government. In Emissary , the stations new  |Starfleet|Starfleet|  commander,  |Benjamin_Sisko|Benjamin_Sisko|   is visited by the Cardassian who formerly served as prefect of Bajor, Gul Dukat . Alaimo had played a different Cardassian character in The Next Generation; he was brought in to replace the actor formerly cast as Dukat, whose performance had dissatisfied the creative team. Ira Behr recalled that It was either Mike Piller or Rick Berman who finally said, Lets get Marc Alaimo, who had done a bunch of TNG episodes for them in the past. Marc came in and, of course, he was Gul Dukat.      Later in the season, the shows creative team included another Cardassian-themed episode,  |Duet|Duet|  . Written by Lisa Rich and Jeanne Carrigan-Fauci as a  |bottle_episode|Bottle_Episode| , it featured the arrest of a Cardassian believed to be guilty of war crimes against Bajor, Aamin Marritza , and the relationship he developed with the stations Bajoran second-in-command,  |Kira_Nerys|Kira_Nerys|  . The dialogue given to Marritza was an early example of what the writers came to call Cardassian monologues : Behr stated that Cardassians love to speak. Garak loves to speak, Enabran Tain loves to speak. Dukat loves to speak—very slowly—and certainly Marritza loves to speak.             In  |cosmology|Cosmology| , the concept Cardassian expansion is a term used for a modification to the  |Friedmann_equations|Friedmann_Equations| . It is named after the fictional Star Trek race by the original authors,  |Katherine_Freese|Katherine_Freese|  and Matthew Lewis.  In their 2002 paper , a footnote on the Cardassian term states: 2 The name Cardassian refers to a humanoid race in Star Trek .
