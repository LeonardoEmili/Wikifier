   Stoichiometry  is the calculation of  |reactants|Reactant|  and  |products|Product|  in  |chemical_reactions|Chemical_Reaction| .     Stoichiometry is founded on the  |law_of_conservation_of_mass|Law_Of_Conservation_Of_Mass|  where the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products, leading to the insight that the relations among quantities of reactants and products typically form a ratio of positive integers. This means that if the amounts of the separate reactants are known, then the amount of the product can be calculated. Conversely, if one reactant has a known quantity and the quantity of the products can be empirically determined, then the amount of the other reactants can also be calculated.     This is illustrated in the image here, where the balanced equation is:   : + 2   →  + 2  .     Here, one molecule of  |methane|Methane|  reacts with two molecules of  |oxygen|Oxygen|  gas to yield one molecule of  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and two molecules of  |water|Properties_Of_Water| . This particular chemical equation is an example of complete combustion. Stoichiometry measures these quantitative relationships, and is used to determine the amount of products and reactants that are produced or needed in a given reaction. Describing the quantitative relationships among substances as they participate in chemical reactions is known as reaction stoichiometry. In the example above, reaction stoichiometry measures the relationship between the quantities of methane and oxygen that react to form carbon dioxide and water.     Because of the well known relationship of moles to atomic weights, the ratios that are arrived at by stoichiometry can be used to determine quantities by weight in a reaction described by a balanced equation. This is called composition stoichiometry.     Gas stoichiometry deals with reactions involving gases, where the gases are at a known temperature, pressure, and volume and can be assumed to be  |ideal_gas|Ideal_Gas| es. For gases, the volume ratio is ideally the same by the  |ideal_gas_law|Ideal_Gas_Law| , but the mass ratio of a single reaction has to be calculated from the  |molecular_mass|Molecular_Mass| es of the reactants and products. In practice, due to the existence of  |isotopes|Isotope| ,  |molar_mass|Molar_Mass| es are used instead when calculating the mass ratio.       The term stoichiometry was first used by  |Jeremias_Benjamin_Richter|Jeremias_Benjamin_Richter|  in 1792 when the first volume of Richters Stoichiometry or the Art of Measuring the Chemical Elements was published.  From p. 121:  Die Stöchyometrie  ist die Wissenschaft die quantitativen oder Massenverhältnisse … zu messen, in welchen die chemischen Elemente … gegen einander stehen.   Note: On pp. 3–7, Richter explains that an element is a pure substance, and that a chemical element  is a substance that cannot be resolved into dissimilar substances by known physical or chemical means. Thus, for example,  |aluminium_oxide|Aluminium_Oxide|  was a chemical element because in Richters time, it couldnt be resolved further into its component elements. The term is derived from the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  words  stoicheion element and  metron measure . In  |patristic|Patristic|  Greek, the word Stoichiometria was used by  |Nicephorus|Patriarch_Nicephorus_I_Of_Constantinople|  to refer to the number of line counts of the  |canonical|Biblical_Canon| |_New_Testament|New_Testament|  and some of the  |Apocrypha|Apocrypha| .         A stoichiometric amount What’s in a Name? Amount of Substance, Chemical Amount, and Stoichiometric Amount Carmen J. Giunta Journal of Chemical Education 2016 93 , 583-586  or stoichiometric ratio of a  |reagent|Reagent|  is the optimum amount or ratio where, assuming that the reaction proceeds to completion:   All of the reagent is consumed   There is no deficiency of the reagent   There is no excess of the reagent.     Stoichiometry rests upon the very basic laws that help to understand it better, i.e.,  |law_of_conservation_of_mass|Law_Of_Conservation_Of_Mass| , the  |law_of_definite_proportions|Law_Of_Definite_Proportions|  , the  |law_of_multiple_proportions|Law_Of_Multiple_Proportions|  and the  |law_of_reciprocal_proportions|Law_Of_Reciprocal_Proportions| . In general, chemical reactions combine in definite ratios of chemicals. Since chemical reactions can neither create nor destroy matter, nor  |transmute|Nuclear_Transmutation|  one element into another, the amount of each element must be the same throughout the overall reaction. For example, the number of atoms of a given element X on the reactant side must equal the number of atoms of that element on the product side, whether or not all of those atoms are actually involved in a reaction.     Chemical reactions, as macroscopic unit operations, consist of simply a very large number of  |elementary_reactions|Elementary_Reaction| , where a single molecule reacts with another molecule. As the reacting molecules consist of a definite set of atoms in an integer ratio, the ratio between reactants in a complete reaction is also in integer ratio. A reaction may consume more than one molecule, and the stoichiometric number counts this number, defined as positive for products and negative for reactants .      Different elements have a different  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass| , and as collections of single atoms, molecules have a definite  |molar_mass|Molar_Mass| , measured with the unit mole . By definition, carbon-12 has a molar mass of 12 g/mol. Thus, to calculate the stoichiometry by mass, the number of molecules required for each reactant is expressed in moles and multiplied by the molar mass of each to give the mass of each reactant per mole of reaction. The mass ratios can be calculated by dividing each by the total in the whole reaction.     Elements in their natural state are mixtures of  |isotopes|Isotope|  of differing mass, thus  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass| es and thus molar masses are not exactly integers. For instance, instead of an exact 14:3 proportion, 17.04  kg of ammonia consists of 14.01  kg of nitrogen and 3  ×  1.01  kg of hydrogen, because natural nitrogen includes a small amount of nitrogen-15, and natural hydrogen includes hydrogen-2 .     A stoichiometric reactant is a reactant that is consumed in a reaction, as opposed to a  |catalytic_reactant|Catalysis| , which is not consumed in the overall reaction because it reacts in one step and is regenerated in another step.       Stoichiometry is not only used to balance chemical equations but also used in conversions, i.e., converting from grams to moles using  |molar_mass|Molar_Mass|  as the conversion factor, or from grams to milliliters using  |density|Density| . For example, to find the  |amount|Amount_Of_Substance|  of NaCl in 2.00  g, one would do the following:     :   0.034         In the above example, when written out in fraction form, the units of grams form a multiplicative identity, which is equivalent to one , with the resulting amount in moles , as shown in the following equation,     :   0.034          Stoichiometry is often used to balance chemical equations . For example, the two  |diatomic|Diatomic_Molecule|  gases,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |oxygen|Oxygen| , can combine to form a liquid, water, in an  |exothermic_reaction|Exothermic_Reaction| , as described by the following equation:   :2   +  → 2       Reaction stoichiometry describes the 2:1:2 ratio of hydrogen, oxygen, and water molecules in the above equation.     The molar ratio allows for conversion between moles of one substance and moles of another. For example, in the reaction   :2   + 3   → 2   + 4       the amount of water that will be produced by the combustion of 0.27 moles of  is obtained using the molar ratio between  and  of 2 to 4.     :   0.54        The term stoichiometry is also often used for the  |molar|Mole|  proportions of elements in stoichiometric compounds . For example, the stoichiometry of hydrogen and oxygen in H 2 O is 2:1. In stoichiometric compounds, the molar proportions are whole numbers.       Stoichiometry can also be used to find the quantity of a product yielded by a reaction. If a piece of solid  |copper|Copper|  were added to an aqueous solution of  |silver_nitrate|Silver_Nitrate|  , the  |silver|Silver|  would be replaced in a  |single_displacement_reaction|Single_Displacement_Reaction|  forming aqueous  |copper_nitrate|Copper_Nitrate|  and solid silver. How much silver is produced if 16.00 grams of Cu is added to the solution of excess silver nitrate?     The following steps would be used:   Write and balance the equation   Mass to moles: Convert grams of Cu to moles of Cu   Mole ratio: Convert moles of Cu to moles of Ag produced   Mole to mass: Convert moles of Ag to grams of Ag produced     The complete balanced equation would be:   : + 2   →  + 2       For the mass to mole step, the mass of copper would be converted to moles of copper by dividing the mass of copper by its  |molecular_mass|Molecular_Mass| |propane|Propane|  reacting with  |oxygen_gas|Oxygen|  , the balanced chemical equation is:   : + 5   → 3   + 4       The mass of water formed if 120  g of propane is burned in excess oxygen is then     : m    196         Stoichiometry is also used to find the right amount of one  |reactant|Reactant|  to completely react with the other reactant in a  |chemical_reaction|Chemical_Reaction|  – that is, the stoichiometric amounts that would result in no leftover reactants when the reaction takes place. An example is shown below using the  |thermite_reaction|Thermite_Reaction| ,   : + 2   →  + 2       This equation shows that 1  mole of  and 2  moles of  |aluminum|Aluminum|  will produce 1  mole of  |aluminium_oxide|Aluminium_Oxide|  and 2  moles of  |iron|Iron| . So, to completely react with 85.0  g of  , 28.7  g of aluminium are needed.     : m    28.7            The limiting reagent is the reagent that limits the amount of product that can be formed and is completely consumed when the reaction is complete. An excess reactant is a reactant that is left over once the reaction has stopped due to the limiting reactant being exhausted.     Consider the equation of roasting  |lead_sulfide|Lead_Sulfide|  in oxygen to produce  |lead_oxide|Lead_Oxide|  and  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide|  :   :2   + 3   → 2   + 2       To determine the theoretical yield of lead oxide if 200.0  g of lead sulfide and 200.0  g of oxygen are heated in an open container:     : m    186.6       : m    930.0       Because a lesser amount of PbO is produced for the 200.0  g of PbS, it is clear that PbS is the limiting reagent.     In reality, the actual yield is not the same as the stoichiometrically-calculated theoretical yield. Percent yield, then, is expressed in the following equation:   :         If 170.0  g of lead oxide is obtained, then the percent yield would be calculated as follows:   :     91.12        Consider the following reaction, in which  |iron_chloride|Iron_Chloride|  reacts with  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  to produce  |iron_sulfide|Iron_Sulfide|  and  |hydrogen_chloride|Hydrogen_Chloride|  + 3   →  + 6       Suppose 90.0  g of FeCl 3 reacts with 52.0  g of H 2 S. To find the limiting reagent and the mass of HCl produced by the reaction, we could set up the following equations:     : m    60.8       : m    111       Thus, the limiting reagent is FeCl 3 and the amount of HCl produced is 60.8  g.     To find what mass of excess reagent remains after the reaction, we would set up the calculation to find out how much H 2 S reacts completely with the 90.0  g FeCl 3 :     : m        By subtracting this amount from the original amount of H 2 S, we can come to the answer:     : -         Often, more than one reaction is possible given the same starting materials. The reactions may differ in their stoichiometry. For example, the  |methylation|Methylation|  of  |benzene|Benzene|  , through a  |Friedel–Crafts_reaction|Friedel–Crafts_Reaction|  using  |AlCl_3_|Aluminium_Chloride|  as a catalyst, may produce singly methylated , doubly methylated , or still more highly methylated  products, as shown in the following example,   :C 6 H 6 + CH 3 Cl → C 6 H 5 CH 3 + HCl   :C 6 H 6 + 2  CH 3 Cl → C 6 H 4 2 + 2  HCl   :C 6 H 6 + n  CH 3 Cl → C 6 H 6−n n + n  HCl     In this example, which reaction takes place is controlled in part by the relative  |concentrations|Concentration|  of the reactants.       In lay terms, the stoichiometric coefficient  of any given component is the number of molecules that participate in the reaction as written.     For example, in the reaction , the stoichiometric coefficient of CH 4 is −1, the stoichiometric coefficient of O 2 is −2, for  it would be +1 and for H 2 O it is +2.     In more technically precise terms, the stoichiometric coefficient in a  |chemical_reaction|Chemical_Reaction| |_system|System|  of the ith component is defined as   :           or   :   Ni             where N i  is the number of  |molecules|Molecule|  of i, and ξ is the progress variable or  |extent_of_reaction|Extent_Of_Reaction| . Prigogine & Defay, p.  18; Prigogine, pp.  4–7; Guggenheim, p.  37   &  62       The extent of reaction  ξ can be regarded as a real product, one molecule of which produced each time the reaction event occurs. It is the extensive quantity describing the progress of a chemical reaction equal to the number of chemical transformations, as indicated by the reaction equation on a molecular scale, divided by the Avogadro constant . The change in the extent of reaction is given by dξ dn B /ν B , where ν B is the stoichiometric number of any reaction entity B and n B is the corresponding amount.        The stoichiometric coefficient  ν i represents the degree to which a chemical species participates in a reaction. The convention is to assign negative coefficients to reactants and positive ones to products. However, any reaction may be viewed as going in the reverse direction, and all the coefficients then change sign . Whether a reaction actually will go in the arbitrarily selected forward direction or not depends on the amounts of the  |substances|Chemical_Substance|  present at any given time, which determines the  |kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics|  and  |thermodynamics|Thermodynamic_Equilibrium| , i.e., whether  |equilibrium|Chemical_Equilibrium|  lies to the right or the left.     In  |reaction_mechanisms|Reaction_Mechanism| , stoichiometric coefficients for each step are always  |integers|Integer| , since elementary reactions always involve whole molecules. If one uses a composite representation of an overall reaction, some may be  |rational|Rational_Number| |_fractions|Fraction| . There are often chemical species present that do not participate in a reaction; their stoichiometric coefficients are therefore zero. Any chemical species that is regenerated, such as a  |catalyst|Catalyst| , also has a stoichiometric coefficient of zero.     The simplest possible case is an  |isomerization|Isomerization|    :A → B     in which  since one molecule of B is produced each time the reaction occurs, while  since one molecule of A is necessarily consumed. In any chemical reaction, not only is the total  |mass_conserved|Conservation_Of_Mass|  but also the numbers of  |atoms|Atom|  of each  |kind|Periodic_Table|  are conserved, and this imposes corresponding constraints on possible values for the stoichiometric coefficients.     There are usually multiple reactions proceeding simultaneously in any  |natural|Nature|  reaction system, including those in  |biology|Biology| . Since any chemical component can participate in several reactions simultaneously, the stoichiometric coefficient of the ith component in the kth reaction is defined as     :           so that the total change in the amount of the ith component is     : dNi     d        Extents of reaction provide the clearest and most explicit way of representing compositional change, although they are not yet widely used.     With complex reaction systems, it is often useful to consider both the representation of a reaction system in terms of the amounts of the chemicals present  , and the representation in terms of the actual compositional  |degrees_of_freedom|Degrees_Of_Freedom| , as expressed by the extents of reaction . The transformation from a  |vector|Vector_Space|  expressing the extents to a vector expressing the amounts uses a rectangular  |matrix|Matrix|  whose elements are the stoichiometric coefficients .     The  |maximum_and_minimum|Extreme_Value|  for any ξ k  occur whenever the first of the reactants is depleted for the forward reaction; or the first of the products is depleted if the reaction as viewed as being pushed in the reverse direction. This is a purely  |kinematic|Kinematics|  restriction on the reaction  |simplex|Simplex| , a  |hyperplane|Hyperplane|  in composition space, or N‑space, whose  |dimension|Dimension| ality equals the number of  linearly-independent  chemical reactions. This is necessarily less than the number of chemical components, since each reaction manifests a relation between at least two chemicals. The accessible region of the hyperplane depends on the amounts of each chemical species actually present, a contingent fact. Different such amounts can even generate different hyperplanes, all sharing the same algebraic stoichiometry.     In accord with the principles of  |chemical_kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics|  and  |thermodynamic_equilibrium|Thermodynamic_Equilibrium| , every chemical reaction is reversible, at least to some degree, so that each equilibrium point must be an  |interior_point|Interior|  of the simplex. As a consequence, extrema for the ξs will not occur unless an experimental system is prepared with zero initial amounts of some products.     The number of physically-independent reactions can be even greater than the number of chemical components, and depends on the various reaction mechanisms. For example, there may be two reaction paths for the isomerism above. The reaction may occur by itself, but faster and with different intermediates, in the presence of a catalyst.     The units may be taken to be  |molecules|Molecule|  or  |moles|Mole| . Moles are most commonly used, but it is more suggestive to picture incremental chemical reactions in terms of molecules. The Ns and ξs are reduced to molar units by dividing by  |Avogadros_number|Avogadros_Number| . While dimensional  |mass|Mass|  units may be used, the comments about integers are then no longer applicable.            In complex reactions, stoichiometries are often represented in a more compact form called the stoichiometry matrix. The stoichiometry matrix is denoted by the symbol N.     If a reaction network has n reactions and m participating molecular species then the stoichiometry matrix will have correspondingly m rows and n columns.     For example, consider the system of reactions shown below:   :S 1 → S 2   :5  S 3 + S 2 → 4  S 3 + 2  S 2   :S 3 → S 4   :S 4 → S 5     This systems comprises four reactions and five different molecular species. The stoichiometry matrix for this system can be written as:     :         -1 & 0 & 0 & 0     1 & 1 & 0 & 0     0 & -1 & -1 & 0     0 & 0 & 1 & -1     0 & 0 & 0 & 1             where the rows correspond to S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , S 4 and S 5 , respectively. Note that the process of converting a reaction scheme into a stoichiometry matrix can be a lossy transformation, for example, the stoichiometries in the second reaction simplify when included in the matrix. This means that it is not always possible to recover the original reaction scheme from a stoichiometry matrix.     Often the stoichiometry matrix is combined with the rate vector, v, and the species vector, S to form a compact equation describing the rates of change of the molecular species:     :                   Gas stoichiometry is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a  |chemical_reaction|Chemical_Reaction|  with reactions that produce  |gases|Gases| . Gas stoichiometry applies when the gases produced are assumed to be  |ideal|Ideal_Gas| , and the temperature, pressure, and volume of the gases are all known. The ideal gas law is used for these calculations. Often, but not always, the  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Temperature_And_Pressure|  are taken as 0  °C and 1 bar and used as the conditions for gas stoichiometric calculations.     Gas stoichiometry calculations solve for the unknown  |volume|Volume|  or  |mass|Mass|  of a gaseous product or reactant. For example, if we wanted to calculate the volume of gaseous NO 2 produced from the combustion of 100  g of NH 3 , by the reaction:   :4   + 7   → 4   + 6       we would carry out the following calculations:   : 100          There is a 1:1 molar ratio of NH 3 to NO 2 in the above balanced combustion reaction, so 5.871  mol of NO 2 will be formed. We will employ the  |ideal_gas_law|Ideal_Gas_Law|  to solve for the volume at 0  °C and 1 atmosphere using the  |gas_law_constant|Gas_Constant|  of R    0.08206 L·atm·K −1 ·mol −1 :   :     PV & nRT    V &     &     & 131.597            Gas stoichiometry often involves having to know the  |molar_mass|Molar_Mass|  of a gas, given the  |density|Density|  of that gas. The ideal gas law can be re-arranged to obtain a relation between the  |density|Density|  and the  |molar_mass|Molar_Mass|  of an ideal gas:   :         and     n       and thus:   :         where:   P   absolute gas  |pressure|Pressure|  V   gas  |volume|Volume|  n   amount    R   universal ideal gas law constant   T   absolute gas  |temperature|Temperature|  ρ   gas density at T and P m   mass of gas   M   molar mass of gas            In the  |combustion|Combustion|  reaction, oxygen reacts with the fuel, and the point where exactly all oxygen is consumed and all fuel burned is defined as the stoichiometric point. With more oxygen , some of it stays unreacted. Likewise, if the combustion is incomplete due to lack of sufficient oxygen, fuel remains unreacted. . Different hydrocarbon fuels have different contents of carbon, hydrogen and other elements, thus their stoichiometry varies.          Gasoline engines can run at stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio, because gasoline is quite volatile and is mixed with the air prior to ignition. Diesel engines, in contrast, run lean, with more air available than simple stoichiometry would require. Diesel fuel is less volatile and is effectively burned as it is injected.
