There are several well-known theorems in  |functional_analysis|Functional_Analysis|  known as the Riesz representation theorem. They are named in honor of  |Frigyes_Riesz|Frigyes_Riesz| .     This article will describe his theorem concerning the dual of a  |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space| , which is sometimes called the Fréchet–Riesz theorem. For the theorems relating  |linear_functionals|Linear_Functional|  to  |measures|Measure| , see  |Riesz–Markov–Kakutani_representation_theorem|Riesz–Markov–Kakutani_Representation_Theorem| .       This theorem establishes an important connection between a  |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space|  and its  |continuous_dual_space|Continuous_Dual_Space| . If the underlying  |field|Field|  is the  |real_numbers|Real_Number| , the two are  |isometrically|Isometry| |isomorphic|Isomorphism| ; if the underlying field is the  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number| , the two are isometrically  |anti-isomorphic|Anti-Isomorphic| . The  |isomorphism|Isomorphism|  is a particular  |natural|Natural_Transformation|  one as will be described next; a  |natural_isomorphism|Natural_Isomorphism| .     Let H be a Hilbert space, and let H denote its dual space, consisting of all  |continuous_linear_functionals|Continuous_Linear_Functional|  from H into the field   or   . If x is an element of H, then the function   for all y in H defined by:         y , x       where   denotes the  |inner_product|Inner_Product|  of the Hilbert space, is an element of H. The Riesz representation theorem states that every element of H can be written uniquely in this form.      Riesz–Fréchet representation theorem.  Let H be a Hilbert space and   H . Then there exists f  H such that for any x  H ,   f,x  . Moreover       Proof. Let M  . Clearly M is closed subspace of H . If MH , then we can trivially choose f0 . Now assume M  H . Then M is one-dimensional. Indeed, let v1,v2 be nonzero vectors in M . Then there is nonzero real number   , such that     . Observe that   v1-v2  M and   , so   v1-v2  M . This means that   v1-v20 . Now let g be unit vector in M . For arbitrary x  H , let v be the orthogonal projection of x onto M . Then v  g,x  g and   g,x-v  , so that x-v  M and   g,x  g,v  . Thus   g,x    g,x    . Hence f  . We also see   . From the  |Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwartz_inequality|Cauchy–Schwarz_Inequality|      , thus for x with unit norm     . This implies that   .     Given any continuous linear functional g in H, the corresponding element xg   H can be constructed uniquely by xg ge1 + ge2 + ... , where   is an  |orthonormal_basis|Orthonormal_Basis|  of H, and the value of xg does not vary by choice of basis. Thus, if y   H, y a1 e1 + a2 e2 + ... , then g a1g + a2g + ...   xg, y      Theorem. The mapping   : H → H defined by     is an isometric isomorphism, meaning that:     is  |bijective|Bijective| .   The  |norms|Norm|  of x and   agree:   x     .     is  |additive|Additive_Map| |complex_conjugation|Complex_Conjugation|  of   .     The  |inverse_map|Inverse_Operator|  of   can be described as follows. Given a non-zero element   of H, the  |orthogonal_complement|Orthogonal_Complement|  of the  |kernel|Kernel|  of   is a one-dimensional subspace of H. Take a non-zero element z in that subspace, and set x     z /2 . Then     .     Historically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to  |Riesz|Frigyes_Riesz|  and  |Fréchet|Maurice_René_Fréchet|  in 1907 .     In the mathematical treatment of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , the theorem can be seen as a justification for the popular  |bra–ket_notation|Bra–Ket_Notation| .
