   Baldr  is a  |god|Æsir|  in  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| , and a son of the god  |Odin|Odin|  and the goddess  |Frigg|Frigg| . He has  |numerous_brothers|Sons_Of_Odin| , such as  |Thor|Thor|  and  |Váli|Váli| .     During the 12th century, Danish accounts by  |Saxo_Grammaticus|Saxo_Grammaticus|  and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a  |euhemerized|Euhemerism|  account of his story. Compiled in  |Iceland|Iceland|  during the 13th century, but based on much older  |Old_Norse_poetry|Old_Norse_Poetry| , the  Poetic Edda  and the  Prose Edda  contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the  |Æsir|Æsir|  and a harbinger of  |Ragnarök|Ragnarök| .     According to  Gylfaginning , a book of  |Snorri_Sturlusons|Snorri_Sturluson|  Prose Edda, Baldrs wife is  |Nanna|Nanna|  and their son is  |Forseti|Forseti| . Baldr had the greatest ship ever built,  |Hringhorni|Hringhorni| , and there is no place more beautiful than his hall,  |Breidablik|Breidablik| .        |Jacob_Grimm|Jacob_Grimm| , in his  Teutonic Mythology  , identifies Old Norse Baldr with the Old High German Baldere , Palter , Paltar and with Old English bealdor, baldor lord, prince, king . Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in baldur î brynju  and herbaldr , epithets of heroes in general.     Grimm traces the etymology of the name to balþaz, whence Gothic balþs, Old English bald, Old High German pald, all meaning bold, brave . Baldrs would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. balþs , nor Paltar with the OHG. pald, nor Baldr with the ON. ballr dangerous, dire. As a rule, the Gothic ld is represented by ON. ld and OHG. ltlþ by ON. ll and OHG. ld. But the OS. and AS. have ld in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language; so that a close connexion between balþs and Baldrs, pald and Paltar, is possible after all.     But the interpretation of Baldr as the brave god may be secondary. Baltic  has a word meaning the white, the good , and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic| .   In continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of  |Woden|Odin|  is called not Bealdor but Baldag and  Bældæg, Beldeg  , which shows association with day , possibly with  |Day|Dagr|  personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning shining one, white one, a god derived from the meaning of Baltic baltas, further adducing Slavic  Belobog  and German  Berhta . Bæl-dæg itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly Bièlbôgh, Bèlbôgh of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of Bæl-dæg, that the Anglo-Saxon tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, brond, brand, ON. brandr , signifying jubar, fax, titio. Bældæg therefore, as regards his name, would agree with Berhta, the bright goddess.     Grimms etymology is endorsed by modern research. According to Rudolf Simek, the original name for Baldr must be understood as shining day. Simek. Dictionary of Northern Mythology, 2007, 26.

Among the visions which the  |Völva|Völva|  sees and describes in the prophecy known as the  Völuspá  is one of the fatal  |mistletoe|Mistletoe| , the birth of  |Váli|Váli|  and the weeping of  |Frigg|Frigg|  . Yet looking far into the future the Völva sees a brighter vision of a new world, when both Höðr and Baldr will come back . The Eddic poem  Baldrs Dreams  mentions that Baldr has bad dreams which the gods then discuss.  |Odin|Odin|  rides to Hel and awakens a seeress, who tells him Höðr will kill Baldr but Vali will avenge him .     Prose Edda     In Gylfaginning, Baldur is described as follows:          Apart from this description, Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death, which is seen as the first in a chain of events that will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at  |Ragnarök|Ragnarök| . According to  Völuspá , Baldr will be reborn in the new world.     He had a dream of his own death and his mother had the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, so his mother  |Frigg|Frigg|  made every object on earth  |vow|Vow|  never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except  |mistletoe|Mistletoe|   —a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life. Merrill Kaplan, Once More on the Mistletoe, in News from Other Worlds/Tíðendi ór ǫðrum heimum, ed. by Merrill Kaplan and Timothy R. Tangherlini, Wildcat Canyon Advanced Seminars Occasional Monographs, 1 , pp. 36-60; .        When  |Loki|Loki| , the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant . He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldrs brother, the blind god  |Höðr|Höðr| , who then inadvertently killed his brother with it . For this act, Odin and the asynja  |Rindr|Rindr|  gave birth to  |Váli|Váli| , who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.      Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship,  |Hringhorni|Hringhorni| , the largest of all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin of the giant  |Vafthrudnir|Vafthrudnir|  in the poem  Vafthrudnismal . The riddle also appears in the riddles of  |Gestumblindi|Gestumblindi|  in  Hervarar saga . According to Carolyne Larrington in her translation of the Poetic Edda it is assumed that what Odin whispered in Baldrs ear was a promise of resurrection.     The dwarf  |Litr|Litr|  was kicked by  |Thor|Thor|  into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldrs wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök when she would be reunited with her husband . Baldrs horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by  |Hyrrokin|Hyrrokin| , a  |giantess|Giantess| , who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.     Upon Friggs entreaties, delivered through the messenger  |Hermod|Hermóðr| ,  |Hel|Hel|  promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a  |giantess|Giantess| ,  |Þökk|Þökk|  , who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thors sons.     Gesta Danorum     Writing during the end of the 12th century, the  |Danish|Denmark|  historian  |Saxo_Grammaticus|Saxo_Grammaticus|  tells the story of Baldr  in a form that professes to be historical. According to him, Balderus and Høtherus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of  |Norway|Norway| . Balderus was a demigod and common  |steel|Steel|  could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and Høtherus married the princess.     Nevertheless, Balderus took heart of grace and again met Høtherus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a  |magic_sword|Magic_Sword| , named  |Mistletoe|Mistilteinn| ,  |Davidson,_H.R._Ellis|Hilda_Ellis_Davidson|  . Gods and Myths of Northern Europe. Pelican Books.  which he had received from Mimir, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.     Chronicon Lethrense and Annales Lundenses Chronicon Lethrense  and the  Annales Lundenses  of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second euhemerized account of Höðrs slaying of Baldr.     It relates that Hother was the king of the  |Saxons|Saxons|  and son of  |Hothbrodd|Hothbrodd|  and  |Hadding|Hadding| . Hother first slew Othens son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othens son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods.       A Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form Baldruo, , p. 210 & pp. 218-20. pointing to a Latin nominative singular Baldruus, which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god, , p. 126. although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned. , p. 43.  , p. 2.       In the  |Anglo_Saxon_Chronicles|Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle|  Baldr is named as the ancestor of the monarchy of  |Kent|Kingdom_Of_Kent| ,  |Bernicia|Bernicia| ,  |Deira|Deira| , and  |Wessex|Wessex|  through his supposed son  |Brond|Anglo-Saxon_Royal_Genealogies| .               Image:Tripleurospermum perforatum.JPG right thumb  |Baldrs_brow|Matricaria_Perforata|     As referenced in Gylfaginning, in Sweden and Norway , the scentless mayweed  and the similar sea mayweed  are both called baldursbrá Balders brow and regionally in northern England . In Iceland only the former is found. In Germany lily-of-the-valley is known as weisser Baldrian; variations using or influenced by reflexes of Phol include Faltrian , Villumfallum , and Fildron or Faldron .       There are a few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name Baldr. The most certain and notable one is the parish name Balleshol in Hedmark county, Norway: a Balldrshole 1356 . Others may be Baldrsberg in Vestfold county, Baldrsheimr in Hordaland county Baldrsnes.
