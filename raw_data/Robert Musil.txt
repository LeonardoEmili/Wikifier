He was baptized Robert Mathias Musil and his name was officially Robert Mathias Edler von Musil from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled , until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was  |forbidden_in_Austria|Austrian_Nobilityabolition_Of_Nobility_In_1919| .          Musil was short in stature but strong and skilled at wrestling, and by his early teens, he proved to be more than his parents could handle. They sent him to a military boarding school at  |Eisenstadt|Eisenstadt|  and then  |Hranice|Hranice|  . The school experiences are reflected in his first novel Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless .       After graduating Musil studied at a military academy in Vienna during the fall of 1897 but then switched to mechanical engineering, joining his fathers department at the Technical University in Brno. During his university studies, he studied  |engineering|Engineering|  by day, and at night read  |literature|Literature|  and  |philosophy|Philosophy| , and went to the theatre and art exhibitions.  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche| ,  |Fyodor_Dostoyevsky|Fyodor_Dostoyevsky| ,  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|  and  |Ernst_Mach|Ernst_Mach|  were particular interests of his university years.

During that time, he began work on  Young Törless .     He also invented , the Musil  |color_top|Color_Triangle| , a motorised device for producing mixed colours by additive colour-mixing with two differently colored, sectored, rotating discs. This was an improvement over earlier models, allowing a user to vary the proportions of the two colors during rotation and to read off those proportions precisely. Rupp, H. .

Corino S. 2003, 151–154. But he was also infatuated with the pianist and mountaineer Valerie Hilpert, who assumed mystical features. Pfohlmann 2012, S. 32–34; Corino 2003, S. 156–167. Pekar comments: Sigmund Freuds observation of the splitting of the love life in Eros and Sexus, the distant, pure lover and the whore find their clear confirmation here.   In March 1902, Musil underwent treatment for syphilis with mercurial ointment. During this time, his several years of relationship with Hermine Dietz, the Tonka of his own novel, published in 1923, began. Hermines syphilitic miscarriage in 1906 and her death in 1907 may be due to infection by Musil. Pfohlmann 2012, S. 34; Corino 2003, S. 190–194 und S. 1882 f.     Musil grew tired of engineering and what he perceived as the limited world-view of the engineer. He launched a new round of doctoral studies in psychology and philosophy at the  |University_of_Berlin|University_Of_Berlin|  under the renowned Professor  |Carl_Stumpf|Carl_Stumpf| . In 1905, Musil met his future wife, Martha Marcovaldi . She had already been widowed and remarried, with two children, and was seven years older than Musil. His first novel, Young Törless, was published in 1906.       In 1909, Musil completed his doctorate and Professor  |Alexius_Meinong|Alexius_Meinong|  offered him a position at the  |University_of_Graz|University_Of_Graz| , which he turned down to concentrate on writing of novels. Over the next two years, he wrote and published two stories collected in Vereinigungen  published in 1911. During the same year, Marthas divorce was completed, and Musil married her. As she was Jewish and Musil Roman Catholic, they both converted to  |Protestantism|Protestantism|  as a sign of their union.   Until then, Musil had been supported by his family, but he now found employment first as a librarian in the  |Technical_University_of_Vienna|Technical_University_Of_Vienna|  and then in an editorial role with the Berlin literary journal  Die neue Rundschau . He also worked on a play entitled Die Schwärmer , which was published in 1921.        When  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  began, Musil joined the Army and was stationed first in  |Tirol|Tyrol|  and then at Austrias Supreme Army Command in  |Bolzano|Bolzano| . In 1916, Musil visited  |Prague|Prague|  and met  |Franz_Kafka|Franz_Kafka| , whose work he held in high esteem. After the wars end, and the collapse of the  |Austro-Hungarian_Empire|Austria-Hungary| , Musil returned to his literary career in Vienna. He published a collection of short stories, Drei Frauen , in 1924. He also admired the Bohemian poet  |Rainer_Maria_Rilke|Rainer_Maria_Rilke| , whom Musil called great and not always understood at his memorial service in 1927 in Berlin. According to Musil, Rilke did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time, but by the time of his death, Rilke had turned into a delicate, well-matured liqueur suitable for grown-up ladies .  However, his work is too demanding to be considered relaxing . Robert Musil, Precision and Soul: Essays and Addresses, trans. Burton Pike and David S. Luft .     In 1930 and 1933, he published his masterpiece,  The Man Without Qualities  ,  in two volumes consisting of three parts, from Berlin, running into 1,074 pages.  Volume 1 and 605-page unfinished Volume 2 .  Part III did not include 20 chapters withdrawn from Volume 2 of 1933 in printers galley proofs. The novel deals with the moral and intellectual decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through the eyes of the books protagonist, Ulrich, an ex-mathematician who has failed to engage with the world around him in a manner that would allow him to possess qualities. It is set in  |Vienna|Vienna|  on the eve of  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .     The Man Without Qualities brought Musil only mediocre commercial success. Though he was nominated for the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature| , he felt that he did not receive the recognition he deserved. He sometimes expressed annoyance at the success of more famous colleagues like  |Thomas_Mann|Thomas_Mann|  or  |Hermann_Broch|Hermann_Broch| , who admired his work deeply and tried to shield him from economic difficulties and encouraged his writing even though Musil was initially critical of Mann.     In the early 1920s, Musil lived mostly in Berlin. In Vienna, Musil was a frequent visitor to  |Eugenie_Schwarzwalds|Eugenie_Schwarzwald|  salon . In 1932, the Robert Musil Society was founded in Berlin on the initiative of Mann. In the same year, Mann was asked to name outstanding contemporary novels, and he cited only one, The Man Without Qualities. In 1936, Musil suffered his first stroke.       The fundamental problem Musil confronts in his essays and fiction is the crisis of  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  values which engulfed Europe during the early twentieth century.  He endorses the Enlightenment project of emancipation while at the same time examining its shortcomings with a questioning irony. Musil believed that the crisis required a renewal in social and individual values which, accepting science and reason, could liberate humanity in beneficent ways. Musil wrote: After the Enlightenment most of us lost courage. A minor failure was enough to turn us away from reason, and we allowed every barren enthusiast to inveigh against the intentions of a  |dAlembert|Jean_Le_Rond_Dalembert|  or a  |Diderot|Denis_Diderot|  as mere rationalism. We beat the drums for feeling against intellect and forgot that without intellect...feeling is as dense as a blockhead .      He took aim at the ideological chaos and misleading generalizations about culture and society promoted by nationalist reactionaries. Musil wrote a withering critique of  |Oswald_Spengler|Oswald_Spengler|  titled Mind and Experience: Notes for Readers Who Have Escaped the Decline of the West  in which he dismantles the latters misunderstanding of science and misuse of axiomatic thinking to try to understand human complexity and promote a deterministic philosophy.      He deplored the social conditions under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and foresaw its disappearance.  Surveying the upheavals of the 1910s and 20s, Musil hoped that Europe could find an internationalist solution to the dead end of imperial nationalism.  In 1927, he signed a declaration of support for the  |Austrian_Social_Democratic_Party|Austrian_Social_Democratic_Party| .      Musil was a staunch  |individualist|Individualist|  who opposed the authoritarianism of both right and left. A recurring theme in his speeches and essays through the 1930s is the defense of the autonomy of the individual against the authoritarian and collectivist concepts then prevailing in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Russia.  He participated in the anti-fascist International Writers Congress for the Defense of Culture in 1935 in which he spoke in favor of artistic independence against the claims of the state, class, nation, and religion.

In 1943 in Lausanne, Martha published a 462-page collection of material from his literary remains, including the 20 galley chapters withdrawn from Part III before Volume 2 appeared in 1933, as well as drafts of the final incomplete chapters and notes on the development and direction of the novel. She died in Rome in 1949.       After his death Musils work was almost forgotten. His writings began to reappear during the early 1950s.
