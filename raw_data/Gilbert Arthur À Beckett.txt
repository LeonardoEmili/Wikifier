   Gilbert Arthur à Beckett was an  |English|England|  writer.       Beckett was born at Portland House  |Hammersmith|Hammersmith| , on 7 April 1837, the eldest son of the civil servant and humorist  |Gilbert_Abbott_à_Beckett|Gilbert_Abbott_À_Beckett|  and the composer  |Mary_Anne_à_Beckett|Mary_Anne_À_Beckett| , daughter of Joseph Glossop, clerk of the cheque to the hon. corps of gentlemen-at-arms.   His brother was  |Arthur_William_à_Beckett|Arthur_William_À_Beckett| .   He graduated from  |Christ_Church|Christ_Church_Oxford| ,  |Oxford|Oxford| , as a Westminster scholar in 1860.   He was entered at  |Lincolns_Inn|Lincolns_Inn|  on 15 October 1857, but gave his attention chiefly to drama, producing Diamonds and Hearts at the  |Haymarket_Theatre|Haymarket_Theatre|  in 1867; this was followed by other light comedies.   His adaptation of a French operetta by  |Émile_Jonas|Émile_Jonas|  called The Two Harlequins opened the new  |Gaiety_Theatre_London|Gaiety_Theatre_London|  in 1868, together with his distant cousin,  |W_S_Gilberts|W_S_Gilbert| ,  Robert the Devil  and another piece.     Becketts pieces include numerous  |burlesques|Victorian_Burlesque|  and  |pantomimes|Pantomime| , the libretti of Savonarola and The Canterbury Pilgrims for the music of Dr.  |C_V_Stanford|C_V_Stanford| .   With the composer  |Alfred_Cellier|Alfred_Cellier| , Beckett wrote the operetta Two Foster Brothers .     In 1879, he had been asked by  |Tom_Taylor|Tom_Taylor| , the editor of  Punch , to follow the example of his younger brother Arthur, and become a regular member of the staff of Punch.   Three years later he was appointed to the Table.   The Punch dinners were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them with regularity, although the paralysis of the legs, the result of falling down the stairway of  |Gower_Street_station|Gower_Street_Station| , rendered his locomotion, and especially the mounting of Mr. Punchs staircase, a matter of painful exertion.   To Punch he contributed both prose and verse; he wrote, in greater part, the admirable parody of a boys sensational shocker , and he developed Jerrolds idea of humorous bogus advertisements under the heading How we advertise now.   The idea of one of Sir  |John_Tenniels|John_Tenniel|  best cartoons for Punch, entitled Dropping the Pilot, illustrative of Bismarcks resignation in 1889, was due to him.     Apart from his work on Punch, he wrote songs and music for the German Reeds entertainment, while in 1873 and 1874 he was collaborator in two dramatic productions which evoked a considerable amount of public attention.        On 3 March 1873,  The Happy Land  was given at the  |Court_Theatre|Royal_Court_Theatre| , 1873, a daring political satire and burlesque of W. S. Gilberts  The Wicked World .   In this amusing piece of banter three statesmen were represented as visiting Fairyland in order to impart to the inhabitants the secrets of popular government. The actors representing Mr. G., Mr. L., and Mr. A. were dressed so as to resemble the ministers satirised, and the representation elicited a question in the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and an official visit of the Lord Chamberlain to the theatre, with the result that the actors had to change their make-up.     In the following year, he furnished the legend to  |Herman_Merivales|Herman_Merivale|  tragedy The White Pilgrim, first given at the Court in February 1874.   At the close of his life he furnished the lyrics and most of the book for the operetta  La Cigale , which at the time of his death was nearing its four hundredth performance at the Lyric Theatre.     In 1889, he suffered a great shock from the death by drowning of his only son, and he died in London on 15 October 1891, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.       Punch devoted some appreciative stanzas to his memory, bearing the epigraph Wearing the white flower of a blameless life . His portrait appeared in the well-known drawing of The Mahogany Tree , and likenesses were also given in the Illustrated London News and in Spielmanns History of Punch .       He married Emily, eldest daughter of William Hunt, J.P., of Bath, and his only daughter Minna married in 1896  |Mr_Hugh_Clifford|Hugh_Clifford| , C.M.G., governor of Labuan and British North Borneo.
