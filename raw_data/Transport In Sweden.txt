Transportation in  |Sweden|Sweden|  is carried out by car, bus, train, tram, boat or aeroplane.           |Rail_transport|Rail_Transport|  is operated by  |SJ|Sj_Ab| ,  |DSBFirst|Dsbfirst| ,  |Green_Cargo|Green_Cargo| ,  |Vy_Tåg|Vy_Tåg|  and more. Most  |counties|Counties_Of_Sweden|  have companies that do ticketing, marketing and financing of local passenger rail, but the actual operation are done by the above-mentioned companies.     Total: 11,663  km  or 9227  km of national railways    |standard_gauge|Standard_Gauge|  gauge    |narrow_gauge|Narrow_Gauge_Railways|  gauge   Trains generally keep to the left, as opposed to all neighbouring countries.          |Stockholm_Metro|Stockholm_Metro|  is the only metro system in Sweden.     Cities with light rail ;    |Gothenburg|Gothenburg| |Gothenburg_tram|Gothenburg_Tram|  - the most extensive tram network in Northern Europe, consisting of 190  km on a total track length of 80  km    |Norrköping|Norrköping| |Norrköping_tramway|Norrköping_Tramway|  - small but growing    |Stockholm|Stockholm| |Tvärbanan|Tvärbanan| ,  |Nockebybanan|Nockebybanan| ,  |Lidingöbanan|Lidingöbanan| ,  |Djurgården_line|Djurgården_Line| |Lund|Lund| |Tvärbanan|Tvärbanan|  in the late 1990s and early 2000s.        |Norway|Rail_Transport_In_Norway|  at  |Kornsjø|Kornsjø|  ,  |Charlottenberg|Charlottenberg| / |Eda|Eda,_Sweden|  ,  |Storlien|Storlien|   and  |Riksgränsen|Riksgränsen|     same gauge - same voltage - same  |protection_system|Automatic_Train_Control| . Most Swedish and Norwegian rail vehicles can cross the border. As there is only single-track at all border crossings, there is no need for bridges to make the transition from left- to right-hand traffic.     |Finland|Transportation_In_Finland|  at  |Tornio|Tornio| / |Haparanda|Haparanda| |break-of-gauge|Break-Of-Gauge|  / - other protection system. All freight has to be reloaded. No passenger traffic by rail.     |Denmark|Transportation_In_Denmark|  at  |Öresund_bridge|Öresund_Bridge| |15kVAC|15Kvac| / |25kVAC|25Kvac|  - other protection system. Only custom made locomotives or EMUs can cross the border. Bridges to make the transition from left- to right-hand traffic, are located north of Malmö, so all traffic south of Malmö is in right-hand traffic.                |Sweden|Sweden|  has right-hand traffic today like all its neighbours.     Sweden had left-hand traffic  from approximately 1736 and continued to do so until 1967. Despite this virtually all cars in Sweden were actually left-hand drive and the neighbouring  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries|  already drove on the right, leading to mistakes by visitors. The Swedish voters rejected a change to driving on the right in a  |referendum|Referenda_In_Sweden|  held in 1955.     Nevertheless, in 1963 the  |Riksdag|Riksdag|  passed legislation ordering the switch to right-hand traffic. The changeover took place on a Sunday morning at 5am on September 3, 1967, which was known in Swedish as  Dagen H  , the H standing for Högertrafik or right-hand traffic.     Since Swedish cars were left-hand drive, experts had suggested that changing to driving on the right would reduce accidents, because drivers would have a better view of the road ahead. Indeed, fatal car-to-car and car-to-pedestrian accidents did drop sharply as a result. This was likely due to drivers initially being more careful and because of the initially very low speed limits, since accident rates soon returned to nearly the same as earlier.     Total roadways: 572,900  km, as of 2009.        |Motorways|List_Of_Motorways_In_Sweden|  run through  |Sweden|Sweden| ,  |Denmark|Denmark|  and over the  |Öresund_Bridge|Öresund_Bridge|  to  |Stockholm|Stockholm| ,  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg| ,  |Uppsala|Uppsala|  and  |Uddevalla|Uddevalla| .
