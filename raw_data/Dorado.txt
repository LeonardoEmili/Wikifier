        Dorado  is a  |constellation|Constellation|  in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the  |88_modern_constellations|Iau_Designated_Constellations| . Its name refers to the  |dolphinfish|Coryphaena|  , which is known as dorado in  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language| , although it has also been depicted as a  |swordfish|Swordfish| . Dorado contains most of the  |Large_Magellanic_Cloud|Large_Magellanic_Cloud| , the remainder being in the constellation  |Mensa|Mensa| . The South  |Ecliptic_pole|Ecliptic_Pole|  also lies within this constellation.     Even though the name Dorado is not  |Latin|Latin|  but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin  |genitive|Genitive|  form Doradus when naming its stars; it is treated  as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō , which have a genitive ending -ūs.       Dorado was one of twelve constellations named by  |Petrus_Plancius|Petrus_Plancius|  from the observations of  |Pieter_Dirkszoon_Keyser|Pieter_Dirkszoon_Keyser|  and  |Frederick_de_Houtman|Frederick_De_Houtman| ,. It appeared:   On Planciuss maps of 1592 and 1594, figured as an elderly bearded man named  |Polophylax|Polophylax|  . Lost Stars, by Morton Wagman, publ. Mcdonald & Woodward Publishing Company, First printing September 2003, page 134,    On a  celestial globe published in 1597 in Amsterdam by Plancius with  |Jodocus_Hondius|Jodocus_Hondius| .   First depiction in a celestial atlas, in  |Johann_Bayers|Johann_Bayer|   Uranometria  of 1603, where it was named Dorado.   In  |Johannes_Keplers|Johannes_Kepler|  edition of  |Tycho_Brahes|Tycho_Brahe|  star list in the  Rudolphine Tables  of 1627: first time that it was named Xiphias, the  |swordfish|Swordfish| .   Dorado has been represented historically as a  |dolphinfish|Dolphinfish|  and a  |swordfish|Swordfish| ; the latter depiction is inaccurate. It has also been represented as a  |goldfish|Goldfish| . The constellation was also known in the 17th and 18th century as Xiphias. The name Dorado ultimately become dominant and was adopted by the  |IAU|Iau| .                    |Alpha_Doradus|Alpha_Doradus|  is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.3, 176 light-years from Earth. It is the brightest star in Dorado.  |Beta_Doradus|Beta_Doradus|  is a notably bright  |Cepheid_variable|Cepheid_Variable|  star. It is a yellow-tinged supergiant star that has a minimum magnitude of 4.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5. One thousand and forty light-years from Earth, Beta Doradus has a period of 9 days and 20 hours.      |R_Doradus|R_Doradus|  is one of the many  |variable_stars|Variable_Star|  in Dorado.  |S_Dor|S_Doradus| , 9.721  |hypergiant|Hypergiant|  in the  |Large_Magellanic_Cloud|Large_Magellanic_Cloud| , is the prototype of  |S_Doradus_variable|Luminous_Blue_Variable|  stars. The variable star  |R_Doradus|R_Doradus|  5.73 has the largest known apparent size of any star other than the Sun.   |Gamma_Doradus|Gamma_Doradus|  is the prototype of the  |Gamma_Doradus_variable|Gamma_Doradus_Variable|  stars.      |Supernova_1987A|Sn1987A|  was the closest supernova to occur since the invention of the telescope.  |SNR_0509_67_5|Snr_0509_67_5|  is the remnant of an unusually energetic Type 1a supernova from about 400 years ago.      |HE_0437_5439|He_0437_5439|  is a  |hypervelocity_star|Hypervelocity_Star|  escaping from the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| / |Magellanic_Cloud|Magellanic_Cloud|  system.     Dorado is also the location of the South  |Ecliptic_pole|Ecliptic_Pole| , which lies near the fishs head. The pole was called Polus Doradinalis by  |Willem_Jansson_Blaeu|Willem_Jansson_Blaeu| .       Because Dorado contains part of the  |Large_Magellanic_Cloud|Large_Magellanic_Cloud| , it is rich in deep sky objects. The Large Magellanic Cloud, 25,000 light-years in diameter, is a  |satellite_galaxy|Satellite_Galaxy|  of the Milky Way Galaxy, located at a distance of 179,000 light-years. It has been deformed by its gravitational interactions with the larger Milky Way. In 1987, it became host to  |SN_1987A|Sn_1987A| , the first supernova of 1987 and the closest since 1604.  This 25,000-light-year-wide galaxy contains over 10,000 million stars. All coordinates given are for Epoch  |J2000_0|J2000_0| .       |N_180B|N_180B|  is an  |emission_nebula|Emission_Nebula|  located in the  |Large_Magellanic_Cloud|Large_Magellanic_Cloud| .    |NGC_1566|Ngc_1566|   is a face-on spiral galaxy. It gives its name to the  |NGC_1566_Group|Ngc_1566_Group|  of galaxies.    |NGC_1755|Ngc_1755|  is a globular cluster.    |NGC_1763|Ngc_1763|  is a bright nebula associated with three type B stars.    |NGC_1820|Ngc_1820|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_1850|Ngc_1850|  is a globular cluster.    |NGC_1854|Ngc_1854|  is a globular cluster.    |NGC_1869|Ngc_1869|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_1901|Ngc_1901|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_1910|Ngc_1910|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_1936|Ngc_1936|  is a bright nebula and is one of four NGC objects in close proximity, the others being  |NGC_1929|Ngc_1929| ,  |NGC_1934|Ngc_1934|  and  |NGC_1935|Ngc_1935| .    |NGC_1978|Ngc_1978|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_2002|Ngc_2002|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_2027|Ngc_2027|  is an open cluster.    |NGC_2032|Ngc_2032|  is a nebula complex that contains four NGC designations:  |NGC_2029|Ngc_2029| , NGC 2032,  |NGC_2035|Ngc_2035|  and  |NGC_2040|Ngc_2040| .     |NGC_2074|Ngc_2074|  is an emission nebula.    |NGC_2080|Ngc_2080| , also called the Ghost Head Nebula , is an emission nebula that is 50 light-years wide in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is named for the two distinct white patches that it possesses, which are regions of recent  |star_formation|Star_Formation| . The western portion is colored green from  |doubly_ionized_oxygen|Doubly_Ionized_Oxygen| , the southern portion is red from  |hydrogen_alpha|Hydrogen_Alpha|  emissions, and the center region is colored yellow from both oxygen and hydrogen emissions. The western white patch, A1, has one massive, recently formed star inside. The eastern patch, A2, has several stars hidden in its dust.    |Tarantula_Nebula|Tarantula_Nebula|  is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, named for its spiderlike shape. It is also designated 30 Doradus, as it is visible to the naked eye as a slightly out-of-focus star. Larger than any nebula in the Milky Way at 1000 light-years in diameter, it is also brighter, because it is illuminated by the open star cluster  |NGC_2070|Ngc_2070| , which has at its center the star cluster  |R136|R136| . The illuminating stars are  |supergiants|Supergiant| .       |NGC_2164|Ngc_2164|  is a globular cluster.    |N44|N44|  is a  |superbubble|Superbubble|  in the Large Magellanic Cloud that is 1,000 light-years wide. Its overall structure is shaped by the 40 hot stars towards its center. Within the superbubble of N44 is a smaller bubble catalogued as N44F. It is approximately 35 light-years in diameter and is shaped by an incredibly hot star at its center, which has a  |stellar_wind|Stellar_Wind|  speed of 7 million kilometers per hour. N44F also features dust columns with probable  |star_formation|Star_Formation|  hidden inside.       In  |Chinese_astronomy|Chinese_Astronomy| , the stars of Dorado are in two of  |Xu_Guangqis|Xu_Guangqi| |_Southern_Asterisms|Chinese_Constellationsthe_Southern_Asterisms| |_White_Patches_Attached|Chinese_Constellationsthe_Southern_Asterisms|   and the  |Goldfish|Chinese_Constellationsthe_Southern_Asterisms|  .          |Dorado_|Uss_Dorado|  and  |Dorado_|Uss_Dorado| , two United States Navy submarines, were named after the same sea creature as the constellation.         NGC1706 - HST - Potw1943a.tif  |NGC_1706|Ngc_1706|  is a spiral galaxy, about 230 million light-years away.
