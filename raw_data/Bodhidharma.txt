Philippe Cornu, Dictionnaire enclyclopédique du Bouddhisme           thu     There are two known extant accounts written by contemporaries of Bodhidharma. According to these sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions , and was either a Persian Central Asian or a South Indian the third son of a great Indian king. Later sources draw on these two sources, adding additional details, including a change to being descendent from a Brahmin king, which accords with the reign of the Pallavas , who claim to belong to a brahmin lineage.
