A star catalogue  or star catalog , is an  |astronomical_catalog|Astronomical_Catalog| ue that lists  |stars|Star| . In  |astronomy|Astronomy| , many stars are referred to simply by catalogue numbers. There are a great many different star catalogues which have been produced for different purposes over the years, and this article covers only some of the more frequently quoted ones. Star catalogues were compiled by many different ancient people, including the  |Babylonia|Babylonia| ns,  |Greeks|Ancient_Greece| ,  |Chinese|History_Of_China| ,  |Persians|History_Of_Iran| , and  |Arabs|Arab| . They were sometimes accompanied by a  |star_chart|Star_Chart|  for illustration. Most modern catalogues are available in electronic format and can be freely downloaded from space agencies  |data_centres|Data_Centre| .     Completeness and accuracy is described by the weakest  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  V and the accuracy of the positions.           From their existing records, it is known that the  |ancient_Egyptians|Egyptian_Astronomy|  recorded the names of only a few identifiable  |constellations|Constellation|  and a list of thirty-six  |decans|Decans|  that were used as a  |star_clock|Star_Clock| .  The Egyptians called the  |circumpolar_star|Circumpolar_Star|  the star that cannot perish and, although they made no known formal star catalogues, they nonetheless created extensive  |star_charts|Star_Chart|  of the night sky which adorn the coffins and ceilings of tomb chambers.      Although the ancient  |Sumer|Sumer| ians were the first to record the names of constellations on  |clay_tablets|Clay_Tablet| ,  the  |earliest_known_star_catalogues|Babylonian_Star_Catalogues|  were compiled by  |the_ancient_Babylonians|Babylonian_Astronomy|  of  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the  |Kassite_Period|Kassites|  . They are better known by their  |Assyrian-era_name|Neo-Assyrian_Empire|  Three Stars Each. These star catalogues, written on  |clay_tablets|Enuma_Anu_Enlil| , listed thirty-six stars: twelve for  |Anu|Anu|  along the  |celestial_equator|Celestial_Equator| , twelve for  |Ea|Enki|  south of that, and twelve for  |Enlil|Enlil|  to the north.  The  |Mul.Apin|Mul.Apin|  lists, dated to sometime before the  |Neo-Babylonian_Empire|Neo-Babylonian_Empire|  ,  are direct textual descendants of the Three Stars Each lists and their constellation patterns show similarities to those of later  |Greek_civilization|Ancient_Greek_Science| .        In  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| , the astronomer and mathematician  |Eudoxus|Eudoxus_Of_Cnidus|  laid down a full set of the classical  |constellations|Constellation|  around 370 BC. His catalogue  Phaenomena , rewritten by  |Aratus_of_Soli|Aratus_Of_Soli|  between 275 and 250 BC as a didactic poem, became one of the most consulted astronomical texts in  |antiquity|Classical_Antiquity|  and beyond. It contains descriptions of the positions of the stars, the shapes of the constellations and provided information on their relative times of rising and setting.      Approximately in the 3rd century BC, the  |Greek_astronomers|Greek_Astronomy| |Timocharis_of_Alexandria|Timocharis_Of_Alexandria|  and  |Aristillus|Aristillus|  created another star catalogue.  |Hipparchus|Hipparchus|  completed his star catalogue in 129 BC,  which he compared to  |Timocharis|Timocharis|  and discovered that the  |longitude|Longitude|  of the stars had changed over time. This led him to determine the first value of the  |precession_of_the_equinoxes|Precession_Of_The_Equinoxes| .  In the 2nd century,  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  of  |Roman_Egypt|Egypt|  published a star catalogue as part of his  Almagest , which listed 1,022 stars visible from  |Alexandria|Alexandria| .    Ptolemys catalogue was based almost entirely on an earlier one by Hipparchus. Newton 1977; Rawlins 1982 It remained the standard star catalogue in the Western and  |Arab|Arab|  worlds for over eight centuries. The Islamic astronomer  |al-Sufi|Al-Sufi|  updated it in 964, and the star positions were redetermined by  |Ulugh_Beg|Ulugh_Beg|  in 1437,    but it was not fully superseded until the appearance of the thousand-star catalogue of  |Tycho_Brahe|Tycho_Brahe|  in 1598.      Although the ancient  |Vedas|Vedas|  of  |India|Indian_Astronomy|  specified how the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic|  was to be divided into twenty-eight  nakshatra , Indian constellation patterns were ultimately borrowed from Greek ones sometime after  |Alexanders_conquests_in_Asia|Wars_Of_Alexander_The_Great|  in the 4th century BC.           The earliest known inscriptions for  |Chinese_star_names|Chinese_Astronomy|  were written on  |oracle_bones|Oracle_Bone|  and date to the  |Shang_Dynasty|Shang_Dynasty|  .  Sources dating from the  |Zhou_Dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty|  which provide star names include the  Zuo Zhuan , the  Shi Jing , and the  |Canon_of_Yao|Canon_Of_Yao|  in the  Book of Documents .  The  Lüshi Chunqiu  written by the  |Qin|Qin|  statesman  |Lü_Buwei|Lü_Buwei|  provides most of the names for the  |twenty-eight_mansions|Twenty-Eight_Mansions|  . An earlier  |lacquerware|Lacquerware|  chest found in the  |Tomb_of_Marquis_Yi_of_Zeng|Tomb_Of_Marquis_Yi_Of_Zeng|  contains a complete list of the names of  |the_twenty-eight_mansions|Chinese_Constellationthe_Twenty-Eight_Mansions| .  Star catalogues are traditionally attributed to  |Shi_Shen|Shi_Shen|  and  |Gan_De|Gan_De| , two rather obscure  |Chinese_astronomers|Chinese_Astronomy|  who may have been active in the 4th century BC of the  |Warring_States_period|Warring_States_Period|  .  The Shi Shen astronomy is attributed to Shi Shen, and the Astronomic star observation to Gan De.      It was not until the  |Han_Dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  that astronomers started to observe and record names for all the stars that were apparent  in the night sky, not just those around the ecliptic.  A star catalogue is featured in one of the chapters of the late 2nd-century-BC history work  Records of the Grand Historian  by  |Sima_Qian|Sima_Qian|  and contains the schools of Shi Shen and Gan Des work .  Simas catalogue—the Book of Celestial Offices —includes some 90 constellations, the stars therein named after  |temples|Temple| , ideas in  |philosophy|Chinese_Philosophy| , locations such as markets and shops, and different people such as  |farmers_and_soldiers|Society_And_Culture_Of_The_Han_Dynastysocial_Class| .  For his Spiritual Constitution of the Universe of 120 AD, the astronomer  |Zhang_Heng|Zhang_Heng|  compiled a star catalogue comprising 124 constellations.   |Chinese_constellation|Chinese_Constellation|  names were later adopted by the  |Korea|Korea| ns and  |Japan|Japan| ese.        A large number of star catalogues were published by  |Muslim_astronomers|Islamic_Astronomy|  in the  |medieval_Islamic_world|Islamic_Golden_Age| . These were mainly  Zij  treatises, including  |Arzachels|Abū_Ishāq_Ibrāhīm_Al-Zarqālī|   Tables of Toledo  , the  |Maragheh_observatorys|Maragheh_Observatory|   Zij-i Ilkhani  and  |Ulugh_Begs|Ulugh_Beg|   Zij-i-Sultani  . Other famous  |Arabic|Arabic_Language|  star catalogues include  |Alfraganus|Ahmad_Ibn_Muhammad_Ibn_Kathīr_Al-Farghānī|  A compendium of the science of stars which corrected Ptolemys Almagest;  and  |Azophis|Abd_Al-Rahman_Al-Sufi|   Book of Fixed Stars  which described observations of the  |stars|Star| , their positions,  |magnitudes|Apparent_Magnitude| , brightness and  |colour|Colour| , drawings for each  |constellation|Constellation| , and the first descriptions of  |Andromeda_Galaxy|Andromeda_Galaxy|   and the  |Large_Magellanic_Cloud|Large_Magellanic_Cloud| .       Many stars are still known by their Arabic names .       The Motul Dictionary, compiled in the 16th century by an anonymous author , contains a list of stars originally observed by the  |ancient_Mayas|Maya_Civilization| . The Maya  |Paris_Codex|Paris_Codex|  also contain symbols for different constellations which were represented by mythological beings.             Two systems introduced in historical catalogues remain in use to the present day. The first system comes from the  |German|Germans|  astronomer  |Johann_Bayers|Johann_Bayer|   Uranometria , published in 1603 and regarding bright stars. These are given a  |Greek_letter|Greek_Alphabet|  followed by the  |genitive_case|Genitive_Case|  of the  |constellation|Constellation|  in which they are located; examples are  |Alpha_Centauri|Alpha_Centauri|  or  |Gamma_Cygni|Gamma_Cygni| . The major problem with Bayers naming system was the number of letters in the  |Greek_alphabet|Greek_Alphabet|  . It was easy to run out of letters before running out of stars needing names, particularly for large constellations such as  |Argo_Navis|Argo_Navis| . Bayer extended his lists up to 67 stars by using lower-case Roman letters then upper-case ones . Few of those designations have survived. It is worth mentioning, however, as it served as the starting point for  |variable_star_designations|Variable_Star_Designations| , which start with R through Z , then RR , RS , RT ... RZ , SS , ST ... ZZ and beyond.     The second system comes from the English astronomer  |John_Flamsteeds|John_Flamsteed|   Historia coelestis Britannica  . It kept the genitive-of-the-constellation rule for the back end of his catalogue names, but used numbers instead of the Greek alphabet for the front half. Examples include  |61_Cygni|61_Cygni|  and  |47_Ursae_Majoris|47_Ursae_Majoris| .       Bayer and Flamsteed covered only a few thousand stars between them. In theory, full-sky catalogues try to list every star in the sky. There are, however, billions of stars resolvable by  |telescopes|Telescope| , so this is an impossible goal; with this kind of catalog, an attempt is generally made to get every star brighter than a given  |magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude| .           |Jérôme_Lalande|Jérôme_Lalande|  published the  Histoire Céleste Française  in 1801, which contained an extensive star catalog, among other things. The observations made were made from the  |Paris_Observatory|Paris_Observatory|  and so it describes mostly northern stars. This catalogue contained the positions and magnitudes of 47,390 stars, out to magnitude 9, and was the most complete catalogue up to that time. A significant reworking of this catalogue in 1846 added reference numbers to the stars that are used to refer to some of these stars to this day. The decent accuracy of this catalogue kept it in common use as a reference by observatories around the world throughout the 19th century.            The  Bonner Durchmusterung   and follow-ups were the most complete of the pre-photographic star catalogues.     The Bonner Durchmusterung itself was published by  |Friedrich_Wilhelm_Argelander|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Argelander| ,  |Adalbert_Krüger|Adalbert_Krueger| , and  |Eduard_Schönfeld|Eduard_Schoenfeld|  between 1852 and 1859. It covered 320,000 stars in epoch 1855.0.     As it covered only the northern sky and some of the south , this was then supplemented by the Südliche Durchmusterung  , which covers stars between declinations −1 and −23 degrees   . It was further supplemented by the  Cordoba Durchmusterung  , which began to be compiled at  |Córdoba,_Argentina|Córdoba,_Argentina|  in 1892 under the initiative of  |John_M._Thome|John_M._Thome|  and covers declinations −22 to −90. Lastly, the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung , compiled at the Cape, South Africa, covers declinations −18 to  −90.     Astronomers preferentially use the HD designation of a star, as that catalogue also gives  |spectroscopic|Spectroscopy|  information, but as the Durchmusterungs cover more stars they occasionally fall back on the older designations when dealing with one not found in Draper. Unfortunately, a lot of catalogues cross-reference the Durchmusterungs without specifying which one is used in the zones of overlap, so some confusion often remains.     Star names from these catalogues include the initials of which of the four catalogues they are from , followed by the angle of  |declination|Declination|  of the star , followed by an arbitrary number as there are always thousands of stars at each angle. Examples include BD+50°1725 or CD−45°13677.            The Henry Draper Catalogue was published in the period 1918–1924. It covers the whole sky down to about ninth or tenth magnitude, and is notable as the first large-scale attempt to catalogue  |spectral_types|Spectral_Type|  of stars.   The catalogue was compiled by  |Annie_Jump_Cannon|Annie_Jump_Cannon|  and her co-workers at  |Harvard_College_Observatory|Harvard_College_Observatory|  under the supervision of  |Edward_Charles_Pickering|Edward_Charles_Pickering| , and was named in honour of  |Henry_Draper|Henry_Draper| , whose widow donated the money required to finance it.     HD numbers are widely used today for stars which have no Bayer or Flamsteed designation. Stars numbered 1–225300 are from the original catalogue and are numbered in order of  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  for the 1900.0  |epoch|Epoch| . Stars in the range 225301–359083 are from the 1949 extension of the catalogue. The notation HDE can be used for stars in this extension, but they are usually denoted HD as the numbering ensures that there can be no ambiguity.       The Catalogue astrographique was part of the international  Carte du Ciel  programme designed to photograph and measure the positions of all stars brighter than magnitude 11.0. In total, over 4.6 million stars were observed, many as faint as 13th magnitude. This project was started in the late 19th century. The observations were made between 1891 and 1950. To observe the entire celestial sphere without burdening too many institutions, the sky was divided among 20 observatories, by declination zones. Each observatory exposed and measured the plates of its zone, using a standardized telescope  so each plate photographed had a similar scale of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm. The  |U.S._Naval_Observatory|U.S._Naval_Observatory|  took over custody of the catalogue, now in its 2000.2 edition.            First published in 1930 as the  Yale Catalog of Bright Stars, this catalogue contained information on all stars brighter than  |visual_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  6.5 in the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue. The list was revised in 1983 with the publication of a supplement that listed additional stars down to magnitude 7.1. The catalogue detailed each stars coordinates,  |proper_motions|Proper_Motion| ,  |photometric|Photometry|  data,  |spectral_types|Spectral_Type| , and other useful information.     The last printed version of the Bright Star Catalogue was the 4th revised edition, released in 1982. The 5th edition is in electronic form and is available online.               The  |Smithsonian_Astrophysical_Observatory|Smithsonian_Astrophysical_Observatory|  catalogue was compiled in 1966 from various previous  |astrometric|Astrometry|  catalogues, and contains only the stars to about ninth magnitude for which accurate proper motions were known. There is considerable overlap with the Henry Draper catalogue, but any star lacking motion data is omitted. The  |epoch|Epoch|  for the position measurements in the latest edition is  |J2000.0|J2000.0| . The SAO catalogue contains this major piece of information not in Draper, the  |proper_motion|Proper_Motion|  of the stars, so it is often used when that fact is of importance. The cross-references with the Draper and Durchmusterung catalogue numbers in the latest edition are also useful.     Names in the SAO catalogue start with the letters SAO, followed by a number. The numbers are assigned following 18 ten-degree bands in the sky, with stars sorted by  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  within each band.       USNO-B1.0    is an all-sky catalogue created by research and operations astrophysicists at the  |U.S._Naval_Observatory|U.S._Naval_Observatory|  , that presents positions, proper motions, magnitudes in various optical passbands, and star/galaxy estimators for 1,042,618,261 objects derived from 3,643,201,733 separate observations. The data was obtained from scans of 7,435  |Schmidt|Schmidt_Camera|  plates taken for the various sky surveys during the last 50 years. USNO-B1.0 is believed to provide all-sky coverage, completeness down to V 21, 0.2 arcsecond astrometric accuracy at  |J2000.0|J2000.0| , 0.3 magnitude photometric accuracy in up to five colors, and 85% accuracy for distinguishing stars from non-stellar objects. USNO-B is now followed by NOMAD;    both can be found on the  |Naval_Observatory|Naval_Observatory|  server.    The  |Naval_Observatory|United_States_Naval_Observatory_Flagstaff_Station|  is currently working on B2 and C variants of the USNO catalogue series.          The Guide Star Catalog is an online catalogue of stars produced for the purpose of accurately positioning and identifying stars satisfactory for use as guide stars by the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope|  program. The first version of the catalogue was produced in the late 1980s by digitizing photographic plates and contained about 20 million stars, out to about magnitude 15. The latest version of this catalogue contains information for 945,592,683 stars, out to magnitude 21. The latest version continues to be used to accurately position the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope| .       The  |PPM_Star_Catalogue|Ppm_Star_Catalogue|  is one of the best, both in the proper motion and star position till 1999. Not as precise as the  |Hipparcos|Hipparcos|  catalogue but with many more stars. The PPM was built from BD, SAO, HD and more, with sophisticated algorithm and is an extension for the Fifth Fundamental Catalogue,  |Catalogues_of_Fundamental_Stars|Catalogues_Of_Fundamental_Stars|  .       The  |Hipparcos_catalogue|Hipparcos_Catalogue|  was compiled from the data gathered by the  |European_Space_Agencys|European_Space_Agency|  astrometric satellite  Hipparcos , which was operational from 1989 to 1993. The catalogue was published in June 1997 and contains 118,218 stars; an updated version with re-processed data was published in 2007. It is particularly notable for its  |parallax|Stellar_Parallax|  measurements, which are considerably more accurate than those produced by ground-based observations.       The Gaia catalogue is released in stages that will contain increasing amounts of information; the early releases will also miss some stars, especially fainter stars located in dense star fields.  Data from every data release can be accessed at the Gaia archive.  Gaia DR1, the first data release of the spacecraft  |Gaia_mission|Gaia| , based on 14 months of observations made through September 2015, took place on 13 September 2016. , Jonathan Amos, BBC, 14 July 2016 , ESA press release, 13 September 2016 The data release includes positions and magnitudes in a single photometric band for 1.1 billion stars using only Gaia data, positions, parallaxes and proper motions for more than 2 million stars based on a combination of Gaia and  |Tycho-2|Tycho-2_Catalogue|  data for those objects in both catalogues, light curves and characteristics for about 3000 variable stars, and positions and magnitudes for more than 2000 extragalactic sources used to define the celestial reference frame.   The second data release , which occurred on 25 April 2018,   is based on 22 months of observations made between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016. It includes positions, parallaxes and proper motions for about 1.3 billion stars and positions of an additional 300 million stars, red and blue photometric data for about 1.1 billion stars and single colour photometry for an additional 400 million stars, and median radial velocities for about 7 million stars between magnitude 4 and 13. It also contains data for over 14,000 selected Solar System objects.   The full Gaia catalogue will be released in 2022.       Specialized catalogues make no effort to list all the stars in the sky, working instead to highlight a particular type of star, such as  |variables|Variable_Star|  or  |nearby_stars|List_Of_Nearest_Stars| .        |Aitkens|Robert_Grant_Aitken| |double_star|Double_Star|  catalogue lists 17,180 double stars north of  |declination|Declination|  −30 degrees.        |Stephensons_General_Catalogue_of_galactic_Carbon_stars|Stephensons_General_Catalogue_Of_Galactic_Carbon_Stars|     is a catalogue of 7000+     |carbon_stars|Carbon_Star| .          The  |Gliese|Wilhelm_Gliese|   catalogue attempts to list all star systems within  of  |Earth|Earth|  ordered by  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  . Later editions expanded the coverage to . Numbers in the range 1.0–915.0  are from the second edition, which was     :Catalogue of Nearby Stars .   The integers up to 915 represent systems which were in the first edition. Numbers with a decimal point were used to insert new star systems for the second edition without destroying the desired order . This catalogue is referred to as CNS2, although this name is never used in catalogue numbers.     Numbers in the range 9001–9850  are from the supplement     :Extension of the Gliese catalogue .     Numbers in the ranges 1000–1294 and 2001–2159  are from the supplement     :Nearby Star Data Published 1969–1978 .     The range 1000–1294 represents nearby stars, while 2001–2159 represents suspected nearby stars. In the literature, the GJ numbers are sometimes retroactively extended to the Gl numbers . For example,  |Gliese_436|Gliese_436|  can be interchangeably referred to as either Gl 436 or GJ 436.     Numbers in the range 3001–4388 are from     :Preliminary Version of the Third Catalogue of Nearby Stars .     Although this version of the catalogue was termed preliminary , it is still the current one , and is referred to as CNS3. It lists a total of 3,803 stars. Most of these stars already had GJ numbers, but there were also 1,388 which were not numbered. The need to give these 1,388 some name has resulted in them being numbered 3001–4388 , and data files of this catalogue now usually include these numbers. An example of a star which is often referred to by one of these unofficial GJ numbers is  |GJ_3021|Gj_3021| .       The General Catalogue of Trigonometric Parallaxes, first published in 1952 and later superseded by the New GCTP , covers nearly 9,000 stars. Unlike the Gliese, it does not cut off at a given distance from the Sun; rather it attempts to catalogue all known measured parallaxes. It gives the co-ordinates in 1900 epoch, the secular variation, the proper motion, the weighted average absolute parallax and its standard error, the number of parallax observations, quality of interagreement of the different values, the visual magnitude and various cross-identifications with other catalogues. Auxiliary information, including UBV photometry, MK spectral types, data on the variability and binary nature of the stars, orbits when available, and miscellaneous information to aid in determining the reliability of the data are also listed.     :  |Louise_F._Jenkins|Louise_Freeland_Jenkins| ,  |Yale_University_Observatory|Yale_University_Observatory| .   : |William_F._van_Altena|William_F._Van_Altena| ,  |John_Truen-liang_Lee|John_Truen-Liang_Lee|  and  |Ellen_Dorrit_Hoffleit|Ellen_Dorrit_Hoffleit| , Yale University Observatory, 1995.       A common way of detecting nearby stars is to look for relatively high proper motions. Several catalogues exist, of which well mention a few. The  |Ross|Frank_Elmore_Ross|  and  |Wolf|Maximilian_Franz_Joseph_Cornelius_Wolf|  catalogues pioneered the domain:     : |Ross,_Frank_Elmore|Frank_Elmore_Ross| , New Proper Motion Stars, eight successive lists,  The Astronomical Journal , Vol. 36 to 48, 1925–1939        : |Wolf,_Max|Max_Wolf| , Katalog von 1053 stärker bewegten Fixsternen , Veröff. d. Badischen Sternwarte zu Heidelberg , Bd. 7, No. 10, 1919; and numerous lists in  Astronomische Nachrichten , 209 to 236, 1919–1929         |Willem_Jacob_Luyten|Willem_Jacob_Luyten|  later produced a series of catalogues:     L – Luyten, Proper motion stars and White dwarfs   :Luyten, W.

Around the same time period, Henry Lee Giclas worked on a similar series of catalogues:     :Giclas, H. L., et al., Lowell Proper Motion Survey, Lowell Observatory Bulletin, 1971–1979       The ubvyβ Photoelectric Photometric Catalogue is a compilation of previously published photometric data. Published in 1998, the catalogue includes 63,316 stars surveyed through 1996.         Stars evolve and move over time, making catalogues evolving, impermanent databases at even the most rigorous levels of production. The USNO catalogues are the most current and widely used astrometric catalogues available at present, and include USNO products such as  |USNO-B|Star_Catalogueusno-B1.0|  , NOMAD, UCAC and others in production or narrowly released. Some users may see specialized catalogues , tailored catalogues, interferometrically-produced cataloges, dynamic catalogues, and those with updated positions, motions, colors, and improved errors. Catalogue data is continually collected at the Naval Observatory dark-sky facility,  |NOFS|United_States_Naval_Observatory_Flagstaff_Station| ; and the latest refined, updated catalogues are reduced and produced by NOFS and the  |USNO|United_States_Naval_Observatory| . See the  |USNO|United_States_Naval_Observatory|  Catalog and Image Servers for more information and access.
