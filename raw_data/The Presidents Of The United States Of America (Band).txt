                 The Presidents of the United States of America  was an American  |alternative_rock|Alternative_Rock| |power_trio|Power_Trio|  band. The band formed in  |Seattle|Seattle| ,  |Washington|Washington| , in 1993, and disbanded in 2016. The three-piece group consisted of vocalist and bassist  |Chris_Ballew|Chris_Ballew| , drummer  |Jason_Finn|Jason_Finn|  with guitarist Andrew McKeag. Guitarist  |Dave_Dederer|Dave_Dederer|  was a member of the band for eleven years before leaving in 2004. The band released six  |studio_albums|Studio_Albums|  during its twenty-three-year existence, and were best known for their 1996 song  |Peaches|Peaches|  .         The band was formed in late 1993 by  |Chris_Ballew|Chris_Ballew|  and  |Dave_Dederer|Dave_Dederer|  , who met while attending  |The_Bush_School|Bush_School|  in Seattle. Ballew had previously been in a punk band called Egg, who wrote many songs that would later be turned into PUSA songs. Initially a drummerless duo, Ballew and Dederer performed a half-dozen or so shows in 1993 as The Lo-Fis , The Dynamic Duo , and Pure Frosting. Ballew eventually came upon the name The Presidents of the United States of America. Shortly after settling on their name, Ballew and Dederer added drummer  |Jason_Finn|Jason_Finn| ; the band played their first show as a trio at Seattles  |Romper_Room|Romper_Room|  in early December 1993. At the time, Finn was also the drummer in the band  |Love_Battery|Love_Battery| , who had recently changed record labels from  |Sub_Pop|Sub_Pop|  to  |Atlas_Records|Atlas_Records| , an  |A_&_M|A_&_M_Records|  subsidiary.     The Presidents recorded a ten-song cassette, Froggystyle, in early 1994 in one day at Laundry Room Studios. The band sold the cassette at shows in 1994. Finn also sold the cassette from behind the bar of Seattles Comet Tavern, where he tended bar.       In 1994, the band signed with the tiny Seattle label  |PopLlama_Records|Popllama_Records|  and released their  |self-titled_debut|The_Presidents_Of_The_United_States_Of_America|  in the following year. The band also released a limited edition blue vinyl 7 single, Fuck California , on  |C/Z_Records|C/Z_Records| .  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records|  signed the band shortly thereafter and re-released the album in late July 1995. Driven by the singles  |Lump|Lump|  ,  |Peaches|Peaches|  , and  |Kitty|Kitty|  , their debut album has been certified triple Platinum by the  |RIAA|Recording_Industry_Association_Of_America| .      A follow-up album,  II , received similar praise, but did not match the commercial success that the Presidents debut album had, though it was still  |certified_gold|Certified_Gold|  in the US.     Throughout 1995, 1996 and 1997, the band made worldwide tours to support their first two albums. In 1996, MTV aired a previously recorded live concert of the band from  |Mount_Rushmore|Mount_Rushmore|  for  |Presidents_Day|Presidents_Day| . They were introduced with: Ladies and gentlemen, the Presidents of the United States. In addition to relentless touring in the U.S. and Canada, PUSA made multiple tours of  |Europe|Europe| ,  |Australia|Australia| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  and  |Japan|Japan| . They also made many appearances in major print media and on radio and TV, including multiple appearances on  The Tonight Show with Jay Leno  and the  Late Show with David Letterman  in the U.S. The Presidents turned down an offer to perform on  Saturday Night Live  in the fall of 1995 because the date conflicted with Ballews wedding, but later made an appearance on the eleventh episode of  Mad TV  in January 1996. The band began the program with a skit called Public Domain , performed Lump later in the show and  |When_the_Saints_Go_Marching_In|When_The_Saints_Go_Marching_In|  during the end credits.      Pure Frosting, collaborations and break-up  Pure Frosting , a final album composed of new songs, covers, and demos, was released in 1998. The CD also contained videos for Lump, Peaches, Mach 5, and Dune Buggy.     Pure Frosting featured two songs that had previously been used in a movie and as a television show theme.  |Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star|Video_Killed_The_Radio_Star|  was included on the soundtrack for  The Wedding Singer , while  |Cleveland_Rocks|Cleveland_Rocks| , originally recorded by  |Ian_Hunter|Ian_Hunter| , was chosen as the theme song for  The Drew Carey Show . Another song on the album, Man , appeared in the Nickelodeon-produced motion picture  Good Burger  but was not directly written or performed for the film.     The Presidents also wrote the theme song for the 1998 TV movie  My Date with the Presidents Daughter . They also performed a cover of the  George of the Jungle  theme song for the  |1997_movie_of_the_same_name|George_Of_The_Jungle| . This performance is not available on any of their albums.     In 1998, the group appeared on the album  Happy Hour  by Japanese female rockers  |Shonen_Knife|Shonen_Knife|  ; they did backing vocals on the song Sushi Bar .     The Presidents also collaborated with  |Sir_Mix-A-Lot|Sir_Mix-A-Lot|  as Subset, a short-lived rock and  |hip-hop|Hip_Hop_Music|  band. They had a brief tour and recorded several songs, but never released an album. The band broke up because Sir Mix-A-Lot wanted to take the band in a harder, more electronic direction, but Finn and Dederer were not interested.        The Presidents reunited in 2000 to release a new single, Jupiter , on  |MUSICBLITZ_Records|Musicblitz_Records| . Because of the singles popularity, the label convinced the band to release a new album.  Freaked Out & Small  was released that year to critical praise. The band did not tour on or promote the album, which quietly sold 25,000 copies as MUSICBLITZ, an early digital music player, quickly went bankrupt.     Afterward, the band members once again went their own ways. Ballew continued to produce and record his own work, and collaborated with  |Tad_Hutchison|Tad_Hutchison|  of  |The_Young_Fresh_Fellows|The_Young_Fresh_Fellows|  as  |The_Chris_and_Tad_Show|The_Chris_And_Tad_Show| . Also during this time, The Young Fresh Fellows recorded a song, Good Times Rock N Roll , about The Presidents, which appeared on the 2001 album  Because We Hate You .             In 2003, the band once again reformed. In August 2004, the band released  Love Everybody  on their newly formed  |indie_label|Indie_Label|  PUSA Inc. As with their previous albums, it received praise from many critics. Two singles from the album have been released through the  |Apple|Apple_Computer| |iTunes_Store|Itunes_Store| . In late 2004, the rights to the debut album were returned to the band, who have since reissued the album through PUSA Inc. twice: once as a tenth-anniversary edition with extra tracks, and again in the spring of 2006 in a low-price edition.      |Andrew_McKeag|Andrew_Mckeag| , Seattle guitarist , joined the band on guitar in late 2004, as an occasional live-performance stand-in for Dave Dederer, who had expressed an interest in spending more time with his family. Since late 2007, McKeag started touring full-time with the band, and later replaced Dederer. Dederer has played live with the band in concerts in Seattle on occasion.     In November 2007, the bands next album,  These Are the Good Times People , was announced;  it was released on March 11, 2008. They performed  celebrating the albums release by Easy Street Records.

The band met their goal in just over a week, and the album, titled  Kudos to You! , was released on February 14, 2014. The band also released their first full live album,  Thanks for the Feedback , at the same time.
