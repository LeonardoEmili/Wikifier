      Anisotropy  is the property of being directionally dependent, which implies different properties in different directions, as opposed to  |isotropy|Isotropy| . It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a materials  |physical|Physical_Property|  or  |mechanical_properties|List_Of_Materials_Propertiesmechanical_Properties|       An example of anisotropy is light coming through a  |polarizer|Polarizer| . Another is  |wood|Wood| , which is easier to split along its  |grain|Wood_Grain|  than across it.             In the field of  |computer_graphics|Computer_Graphics| , an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its  |geometric_normal|Normal| , as is the case with  |velvet|Velvet| .      |Anisotropic_filtering|Anisotropic_Filtering|  is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view. Older techniques, such as  |bilinear|Bilinear_Filtering|  and  |trilinear_filtering|Trilinear_Filtering| , do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in  |aliasing|Aliasing|  or blurring of textures. By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.       A chemical anisotropic  |filter|Filter| , as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the  |proximal|Anatomical_Terms_Of_Locationproximal_And_Distal| |regions|Region|  filter out larger particles and  |distal|Anatomical_Terms_Of_Locationproximal_And_Distal|  regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.     In  |NMR_spectroscopy|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy| , the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their  |chemical_shift|Chemical_Shift| . In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of  |benzene|Benzene| . This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.     In  |fluorescence_spectroscopy|Fluorescence_Spectroscopy| , the  |fluorescence_anisotropy|Fluorescence_Anisotropy| , calculated from the  |polarization|Polarization|  properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.   Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.       Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity .              |Physicists|Physicists|  from  |University_of_California,_Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley|  reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in  |cosmic_microwave_background_radiation|Cosmic_Microwave_Background_Radiation|  in 1977. Their experiment demonstrated the  |Doppler_shift|Doppler_Shift|  caused by the movement of the earth with respect to the  |early_Universe_matter|Big_Bang| , the source of the radiation.  Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.     Physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials.  |Magnetic_anisotropy|Magnetic_Anisotropy| , for example, may occur in a  |plasma|Plasma| , so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction. Plasmas may also show filamentation  that is directional.     An anisotropic liquid has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or  |chloroform|Chloroform| , which contain no structural ordering of the molecules.  |Liquid_crystals|Liquid_Crystals|  are examples of anisotropic liquids.     Some materials  |conduct_heat|Heat_Conduction|  in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source. Heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in  |electronics|Electronics|  are often anisotropic.      Many  |crystals|Crystal|  are anisotropic to  |light|Light|  , and exhibit properties such as  |birefringence|Birefringence| .  |Crystal_optics|Crystal_Optics|  describes light propagation in these media. An axis of anisotropy is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken . Some materials can have multiple such  |optical_axes|Optical_Axis| .        |Seismic_anisotropy|Seismic_Anisotropy|  is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic  |wavelength|Wavelength|  have a dominant alignment. This alignment leads to a directional variation of  |elasticity|Elasticity|  wavespeed. Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earths  |crust|Crust| ,  |mantle|Mantle|  and  |inner_core|Earths_Inner_Core| .      |Geological|Geological|  formations with distinct layers of  |sedimentary|Sedimentary|  material can exhibit electrical anisotropy;  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity|  in one direction , is different from that in another . This property is used in the gas and  |oil_exploration|Oil_Exploration|  industry to identify  |hydrocarbon|Hydrocarbon| -bearing sands in sequences of  |sand|Sand|  and  |shale|Shale| . Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high  |resistivity|Resistivity|  , whereas shales have lower resistivity.  |Formation_evaluation|Formation_Evaluation|  instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells.     The  |hydraulic_conductivity|Hydraulic_Conductivity|  of  |aquifers|Aquifer|  is often anisotropic for the same reason. When calculating groundwater flow to  |drains|Drainage|  R.J.Oosterbaan, 1997, The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance.

The corresponding free WellDrain program can be downloaded from:  the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account, otherwise the results may be subject to error.     Most common rock-forming  |minerals|Mineral|  are anisotropic, including  |quartz|Quartz|  and  |feldspar|Feldspar| . Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their  |optical_properties|Optical_Mineralogy| . An example of an isotropic mineral is  |garnet|Garnet| .       Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting  |echogenicity|Echogenicity|  of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed. Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic when the transducer is angled obliquely. This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.       Anisotropy, in materials science, is a materials directional dependence of a physical property. This is a critical consideration for materials selection in engineering applications. For monocrystalline material, anisotropy is associated with the crystal symmetry.  Tensor descriptions of material properties can be used to determine the directional dependence of that property. When a material is polycrystalline, the directional dependence on properties is often related to the processing techniques it has undergone. A material with randomly oriented grains will be isotropic, whereas materials with texture will be often be anisotropic. Textured materials are often the result of processing techniques like hot rolling, wire-drawing, and heat treatments.     Mechanical properties of materials, such as Youngs modulus, creep, are often dependent on the direction of measurement.  Fourth rank  |tensor|Tensor|  properties, like the elastic constants, are anisotropic, even for materials with cubic symmetry. The Youngs modulus relates stress and strain when an isotropic material is elastically deformed; to describe elasticity in an anisotropic material, stiffness tensors are used instead. In metals, anisotropic elasticity behavior is prevalent in all single crystals, with the exception of Tungsten, due to the fact there are only two independent stiffness coefficients in the stiffness tensor . For face centered cubic materials like Copper, the elastic modulus is highest along the direction, normal to the close packed planes.     The anisotropy ratio is a value computed to compare elastic anisotropy in materials. It is given by the following expression:             where the C values are stiffness coefficients in Voight notation. For an isotropic material, the ratio is one.     Fiber-reinforced or layered  |composite_materials|Composite_Material|  exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties, due to orientation of the reinforcement material. In many fiber-reinforced composites like carbon fiber or glass fiber based composites, the weave of the material can determine the extent of the anisotropy of the bulk material.  The tunability of orientation of the fibers, allows for application-based designs of composite materials, depending on the direction of stresses applied onto the material.     Amorphous materials such as glass and polymers are typically isotropic. Due to the highly randomized orientation of  |macromolecul|Macromolecul| es in polymeric materials,  |polymers|Polymer|  are in general described as isotropic. However, polymers can be engineered to have directionally dependent properties through processing techniques or introduction of anisotropy-inducing elements. Researchers have built composite materials with aligned fibers and voids to generate anisotropic  |hydrogels|Hydrogel| , in order to mimic hierarchically ordered biological soft matter.  3D printing, especially Fused Deposition Modeling, can introduce anisotropy into printed parts. This is due to the fact that FDM is designed to extrude and print layers of thermoplastic materials.  This creates materials that are strong when tensile stress is applied in parallel to the layers and weak when the material is perpendicular to the layers.         Anisotropic etching techniques  are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high  |aspect_ratio|Aspect_Ratio| . These features are commonly used in  |MEMS|Microelectromechanical_Systems|  and  |microfluidic|Microfluidic|  devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device. Anisotropic etching can also refer to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes           |Diffusion_tensor_imaging|Diffusion_Tensor_Imaging|  is an  |MRI|Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging|  technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion  of water molecules in the brain. Water molecules located in  |fiber_tracts|White_Matter|  are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement , whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy. This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.        |Radiance|Radiance|  fields  from a reflective surface are often not isotropic in nature. This makes calculations of the total energy being reflected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate. In  |remote_sensing|Remote_Sensing|  applications, anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes, immensely simplifying the calculation of the net reflectance or the net  |irradiance|Irradiance|  of a scene.   For example, let the  |BRDF|Brdf|  be   where i denotes incident direction and v denotes viewing direction . And let P be the Planar Albedo, which represents the total reflectance from the scene.   : P   d    : A       It is of interest because, with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined, a measurement of the  |BRDF|Brdf|.
