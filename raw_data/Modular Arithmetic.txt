     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , modular arithmetic is a system of  |arithmetic|Arithmetic|  for  |integers|Integer| , where numbers wrap around when reaching a certain valueâ€”the modulus . The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by  |Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|  in his book  Disquisitiones Arithmeticae , published in 1801.     A familiar use of modular arithmetic is in the  |12_hour_clock|12_Hour_Clock| , in which the day is divided into two 12-hour periods. If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00. Usual addition would suggest that the later time should be , but this is not the answer because clock time wraps around every 12 hours. Because the hour number starts over after it reaches 12, this is arithmetic modulo 12. According to the definition below, 12 is  |congruent|Congruence_Relation|  not only to 12 itself, but also to 0, so the time called 12:00 could also be called 0:00 , since 12 is congruent to 0 modulo 12.             Modular arithmetic can be handled mathematically by introducing a  |congruence_relation|Congruence_Relation|  on the  |integers|Integer|  that is compatible with the operations on integers:  |addition|Addition| ,  |subtraction|Subtraction| , and  |multiplication|Multiplication| . For a positive integer , two numbers  and  are said to be , if their difference  is an  |integer_multiple|Integer_Multiple|  of  . This congruence relation is typically considered when  and  are integers, and is denoted   : a   b   n.
