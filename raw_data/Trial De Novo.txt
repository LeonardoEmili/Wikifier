   In  |law|Law| , the expression trial de novo means a new  |trial|Trial|  by a different tribunal . A trial de novo is usually ordered by an appellate court when the original trial failed to make a determination in a manner dictated by law.       In  |common_law|Common_Law|  systems, one feature that distinguishes an appellate proceeding from a trial de novo is that new evidence may not ordinarily be presented in an appeal, though there are rare instances when it may be allowedâ€”usually evidence that came to light only after the trial and could not, in all diligence, have been presented in the lower court. The general rule, however, is that an appeal must be based solely on points of law , and not on points of fact . Appeals are frequently based on a claim that the trial judge or jury did not allow or appreciate all the facts; if that claim is successful the appeal judges will often order a trial de novo . In order to protect the individuals rights against  |double_jeopardy|Double_Jeopardy|  ,ordering a trial de novo is often the exclusive right of an appeal judge.     For example, a system may relegate a claim of a certain amount to a  |judge|Judge|  but preserve the right to a new trial before a  |jury|Jury| .     In American Federal Court systems, de novo can also refer to a  |standard_of_review|Standard_Of_Review|  for courts of appeal. Sometimes, particularly potent issues are brought before an appeals court, such as a constitutional determination made by a lower court, or summary judgment granted by a lower court. When this sort of issue is on appeal, the court of appeals will review the lower court decision de novo or from the beginning. In this process, the panel of judges for the court of appeals will review the lower courts reasoning and fact-finding from the beginning, based on the record. This is a high level of scrutiny that is more likely to result in reversal or remand of an issue.     This is in contrast to more relaxed standards of review such as clearly erroneous or substantial evidence. These relaxed standards usually do not result in reversals, as the court of appeals grants more deference to the judgment of the lower courts.       In UK law,  |appeals|Crown_Courtappeals_From_Magistrates_27_Courts|  to the  |Crown_Court|Crown_Court|  against convictions in the  |Magistrates_Court|Magistrates_Court|  are held de novo.     De novo review refers to the appellate courts authority to review the trial courts conclusions on questions of the application, interpretation, and construction of law. Generally, the proper standard of review for employee benefit decisions, such as the denial of benefit claims, is de novo. Also, where the appellate court undertakes judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings that were required by statute, the reviewing court must conduct a de novo review of the interpretation and application of the law by the arbitrators.       In the United States, some states provide for  |bench_trials|Bench_Trial|  only for  |small_claims|Small_Claims_Court| ,  |traffic_offenses|Traffic_Court| , and criminal offenses with a penalty of imprisonment of less than six months, then provide the ability to appeal a loss to the trial court of  |general_jurisdiction|General_Jurisdiction|  for a brand-new trial. Unlike the appellate court which only examines the issues raised in the original trial, in a trial de novo a brand new trial takes place. The  |Supreme_Court_of_Virginia|Supreme_Court_Of_Virginia|  said this in Santen v. Tuthill,  |265_Va_492|Case_Citation|  , about the practice of an appeal from district court trial de novo to circuit court: This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial. . Some states use a system combining aspects of traditional appeal and absolute trial de novo; for instance, in  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| , decisions in minor criminal and traffic cases heard in the states Municipal Courts may be appealed to the Law Division, Criminal Part of the  |Superior_Court|New_Jersey_Superior_Court|  for trial de novo on the record, in which the Law Division makes new findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the record produced in the Municipal Courts trial , but does not hold any evidentiary hearings itself. N.J. Ct. R. 3:23-8 State v. Loce, 267 N.J. Super. 102, 104     It is often used in the review of  administrative proceeding s or the judgements of a  small claims court . If the determination made by a lower body is overturned, it may be renewed de novo in the review process . Sometimes administrative decisions may be reviewed by the courts on a de novo basis.
