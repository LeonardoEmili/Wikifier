                    Robert Edward Lee was an American and Confederate soldier, best known as a commander of the  |Confederate_States_Army|Confederate_States_Army| . He commanded the  |Army_of_Northern_Virginia|Army_Of_Northern_Virginia|  in the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  from 1862 until its surrender in 1865.     A son of Revolutionary War officer  |Henry_Light_Horse_Harry_Lee_III|Henry_Lee_Iii| , Lee was a top graduate of the  |United_States_Military_Academy|United_States_Military_Academy|  and an exceptional officer and  |military_engineer|Military_Engineering|  in the  |United_States_Army|United_States_Army|  for 32 years.

When  |Virginias_1861_Richmond_Convention|Virginia_Secession_Convention_Of_1861|  declared secession from the  |Union|Union| , Lee chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.  During the first year of the Civil War, he served as a senior military adviser to  |Confederate_President|President_Of_The_Confederate_States_Of_America| |Jefferson_Davis|Jefferson_Davis| . Once he took command of the  |Army_of_Northern_Virginia|Army_Of_Northern_Virginia|  in 1862, he soon emerged as an able tactician and battlefield commander, winning most of his battles, nearly all against far larger Union armies.

William Thorndale, The Parents of Colonel Richard Lee of Virginia, National Genealogical Society Quarterly 76 : 253–68 Lees family is one of  |Virginias_first_families|First_Families_Of_Virginia| , descended from  |Richard_Lee_I|Richard_Lee_I| , Esq., the Immigrant , from the county of  |Shropshire|Shropshire|  in England.      Lees mother grew up at  |Shirley_Plantation|Shirley_Plantation| , one of the most elegant homes in Virginia. His maternal great-great grandfather,  |Robert_King_Carter|Robert_King_Carter|  of  |Corotoman|Corotoman| , was the wealthiest man in  |the_colonies|Thirteen_Colonies|  when he died in 1732. Lees father, a tobacco planter, suffered severe financial reverses from failed investments.      Little is known of Lee as a child; he rarely spoke of his boyhood as an adult.  Nothing is known of his relationship with his father who, after leaving his family, mentioned Robert only once in a letter. When given the opportunity to visit his fathers Georgia grave, he remained there only briefly; yet, during his time as president of Washington College, he defended his father in a biographical sketch while editing Light Horse Harrys memoirs.           In 1809, Harry Lee was put in  |debtors_prison|Debtors_Prison| ; soon after his release the following year, Harry and Anne Lee and their five children moved to a small house on Cameron Street in  |Alexandria,_Virginia|Alexandria,_Virginia| , both because there were then high quality local schools there, and because several members of her extended family lived nearby.  In 1811, the family, including the newly born sixth child, Mildred, moved to a house on Oronoco Street, still close to the center of town and with the houses of a number of Lee relatives close by.      In 1812, Harry Lee was badly injured in a political riot in Baltimore and traveled to the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| . He would never return, dying when his son Robert was eleven years old.  Left to raise six children alone in straitened circumstances, Anne Lee and her family often paid extended visits to relatives and family friends.  Robert Lee attended school at Eastern View, a school for young gentlemen, in  |Fauquier_County|Fauquier_County,_Virginia| , and then at the Alexandria Academy, free for local boys, where he showed an aptitude for mathematics. Although brought up to be a practicing Christian, he was not confirmed in the  |Episcopal_Church|Episcopal_Church|  until age 46.      Anne Lees family was often supported by a relative,  |William_Henry_Fitzhugh|William_Henry_Fitzhugh| , who owned the Oronoco Street house and allowed the Lees to stay at his home in  |Fairfax_County|Fairfax_County,_Virginia| ,  |Ravensworth|Ravensworth| . When Robert was 17 in 1824, Fitzhugh wrote to the  |Secretary_of_War|United_States_Secretary_Of_War| ,  |John_C._Calhoun|John_C._Calhoun| , urging that Robert be given an appointment to the  |United_States_Military_Academy|United_States_Military_Academy|  at West Point. Fitzhugh wrote little of Roberts academic prowess, dwelling much on the prominence of his family, and erroneously stated the boy was 18. Instead of mailing the letter, Fitzhugh had young Robert deliver it.  In March 1824, Robert Lee received his appointment to West Point, but due to the large number of cadets admitted, Lee would have to wait a year to begin his studies there.       Lee entered West Point in the summer of 1825. At the time, the focus of the curriculum was engineering; the head of the  |Army_Corps_of_Engineers|United_States_Army_Corps_Of_Engineers|  supervised the school and the superintendent was an engineering officer. Cadets were not permitted leave until they had finished two years of study, and were rarely allowed off the Academy grounds. Lee graduated second in his class, behind only  |Charles_Mason|Charles_Mason|  . Lee did not incur any demerits during his four-year course of study, a distinction shared by five of his 45  classmates. In June 1829, Lee was commissioned a  |brevet|Brevet|  second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers.  After graduation, while awaiting assignment, he returned to Virginia to find his mother on her deathbed; she died at Ravensworth on July 26, 1829.                On August 11, 1829, Brigadier General  |Charles_Gratiot|Charles_Gratiot|  ordered Lee to  |Cockspur_Island|Cockspur_Island| ,  |Georgia|Georgia| . The plan was to build a fort on the marshy island which would command the outlet of the  |Savannah_River|Savannah_River| . Lee was involved in the early stages of construction as the island was being drained and built up.  In 1831, it became apparent that the existing plan to build what became known as  |Fort_Pulaski|Fort_Pulaski|  would have to be revamped, and Lee was transferred to  |Fort_Monroe|Fort_Monroe|  at the tip of the  |Virginia_Peninsula|Virginia_Peninsula|  .       While home in the summer of 1829, Lee had apparently courted  |Mary_Custis|Mary_Anna_Custis_Lee|  whom he had known as a child. Lee obtained permission to write to her before leaving for Georgia, though Mary Custis warned Lee to be discreet in his writing, as her mother read her letters, especially from men.  Custis refused Lee the first time he asked to marry her; her father did not believe the son of the disgraced Light Horse Harry Lee was a suitable man for his daughter.  She accepted him with her fathers consent in September 1830, while he was on summer leave,  and the two were wed on June 30, 1831.      Lees duties at Fort Monroe were varied, typical for a junior officer, and ranged from budgeting to designing buildings.   Although Mary Lee accompanied her husband to  |Hampton_Roads|Hampton_Roads| , she spent about a third of her time at Arlington, though the couples first son,  |Custis_Lee|George_Washington_Custis_Lee|  was born at Fort Monroe. Although the two were by all accounts devoted to each other, they were different in character: Robert Lee was tidy and punctual, qualities his wife lacked. Mary Lee also had trouble transitioning from being a rich mans daughter to having to manage a household with only one or two slaves.  Beginning in 1832, Robert Lee had a close but platonic relationship with Harriett Talcott, wife of his fellow officer  |Andrew_Talcott|Andrew_Talcott| .           Life at Fort Monroe was marked by conflicts between artillery and engineering officers. Eventually the War Department transferred all engineering officers away from Fort Monroe, except Lee, who was ordered to take up residence on the artificial island of  |Rip_Raps|Rip_Raps|  across the river from Fort Monroe, where  |Fort_Wool|Fort_Wool|  would eventually rise, and continue work to improve the island. Lee duly moved there, then discharged all workers and informed the War Department he could not maintain laborers without the facilities of the fort.      In 1834, Lee was transferred to Washington as General Gratiots assistant.  Lee had hoped to rent a house in Washington for his family, but was not able to find one; the family lived at Arlington, though Lieutenant Lee rented a room at a Washington boarding house for when the roads were impassable.   In mid-1835, Lee was assigned to assist Andrew Talcott in surveying the southern border of Michigan.  While on that expedition, he responded to a letter from an ill Mary Lee, which had requested he come to Arlington, But why do you urge my immediate return, & tempt one in the strongest manner  ... I rather require to be strengthened & encouraged to the full performance of what I am called on to execute. Lee completed the assignment and returned to his post in Washington, finding his wife ill at Ravensworth. Mary Lee, who had recently given birth to their second child, remained bedridden for several months. In October 1836, Lee was promoted to first lieutenant.      Lee served as an assistant in the chief engineers office in Washington, D.C. from 1834 to 1837, but spent the summer of 1835 helping to lay out the state line between  |Ohio|Ohio|  and  |Michigan|Michigan| . As a  |first_lieutenant|First_Lieutenant|  of engineers in 1837, he supervised the engineering work for  |St._Louis|St._Louis,_Missouri|  harbor and for the upper  |Mississippi|Mississippi_River|  and  |Missouri|Missouri_River|  rivers. Among his projects was the mapping of the  |Des_Moines_Rapids|Des_Moines_Rapids|  on the Mississippi above  |Keokuk,_Iowa|Keokuk,_Iowa| , where the Mississippis mean depth of  was the upper limit of steamboat traffic on the river. His work there earned him a promotion to  |captain|Captain| . Around 1842, Captain Robert E. Lee arrived as  |Fort_Hamiltons|Fort_Hamilton|  post engineer.           While Lee was stationed at Fort Monroe, he married  |Mary_Anna_Randolph_Custis|Mary_Anna_Custis_Lee|  , great-granddaughter of  |Martha_Washington|Martha_Washington|  by her first husband  |Daniel_Parke_Custis|Daniel_Parke_Custis| , and step-great-granddaughter of  |George_Washington|George_Washington| , the first president of the United States. Mary was the only surviving child of  |George_Washington_Parke_Custis|George_Washington_Parke_Custis| , George Washingtons stepgrandson, and  |Mary_Lee_Fitzhugh_Custis|Mary_Lee_Fitzhugh_Custis| , daughter of  |William_Fitzhugh|William_Fitzhugh|   and  |Ann_Bolling_Randolph|Ann_Bolling_Randolph_Fitzhugh| . Robert and Mary married on June 30, 1831, at  |Arlington_House|Arlington_House,_The_Robert_E._Lee_Memorial| , her parents house just across from Washington, D.C. The 3rd U.S. Artillery served as honor guard at the marriage. They eventually had seven children, three boys and four girls:      |George_Washington_Custis_Lee|George_Washington_Custis_Lee|  ; 1832–1913; served as major general in the Confederate Army and aide-de-camp to President Jefferson Davis, captured during the Battle of Sailors Creek; unmarried   Mary Custis Lee ; 1835–1918; unmarried    |William_Henry_Fitzhugh_Lee|William_Henry_Fitzhugh_Lee|  ; 1837–1891; served as major general in the Confederate Army ; married twice; surviving children by second marriage   Anne Carter Lee ; June 18, 1839  – October 20, 1862; died of  |typhoid_fever|Typhoid_Fever| , unmarried   Eleanor Agnes Lee ; 1841  – October 15, 1873; died of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| , unmarried    |Robert_Edward_Lee,_Jr.|Robert_Edward_Lee,_Jr.|  ; 1843–1914; served as captain in the Confederate Army ; married twice; surviving children by second marriage   Mildred Childe Lee ; 1846–1905; unmarried     All the children survived him except for Annie, who died in 1862. They are all buried with their parents in the crypt of the  |Lee_Chapel|Lee_Chapel|  at  |Washington_and_Lee_University|Washington_And_Lee_University|  in Lexington, Virginia.     Lee was a great-great-great grandson of  |William_Randolph|William_Randolph|  and a great-great grandson of  |Richard_Bland|Richard_Bland| .  He was also related to  |Helen_Keller|Helen_Keller|  through Helens mother, Kate, and was a distant relative of Admiral  |Willis_Augustus_Lee|Willis_Augustus_Lee| .     On May 1, 1864, General Lee was at the baptism of General  |A.P._Hills|A.P._Hill|  daughter, Lucy Lee Hill, to serve as her godfather. This is referenced in the painting Tender is the Heart by  |Mort_Künstler|Mort_Künstler| .  He is the godfather of actress and writer  |Odette_Tyler|Odette_Tyler| , the daughter of brigadier general  |William_Whedbee_Kirkland|William_Whedbee_Kirkland| . , Munseys Magazine : 492.            Lee distinguished himself in the  |Mexican–American_War|Mexican–American_War|  . He was one of  |Winfield_Scotts|Winfield_Scott|  chief aides in the march from  |Veracruz|Veracruz|  to Mexico City. He was instrumental in several American victories through his personal reconnaissance as a staff officer; he found routes of attack that the  |Mexicans|Mexico|  had not defended because they thought the terrain was impassable.     He was promoted to  |brevet|Brevet|  major after the  |Battle_of_Cerro_Gordo|Battle_Of_Cerro_Gordo|  on April 18, 1847.  He also fought at  |Contreras|Battle_Of_Contreras| ,  |Churubusco|Battle_Of_Churubusco| , and  |Chapultepec|Battle_Of_Chapultepec|  and was wounded at the last. By the end of the war, he had received additional brevet promotions to lieutenant colonel and colonel, but his permanent rank was still captain of engineers, and he would remain a captain until his transfer to the  |cavalry|Cavalry|  in 1855.     For the first time, Robert E. Lee and  |Ulysses_S._Grant|Ulysses_S._Grant|  met and worked with each other during the Mexican–American War. Close observations of their commanders constituted a learning process for both Lee and Grant.  The Mexican–American War concluded on February 2, 1848.     After the Mexican War, Lee spent three years at  |Fort_Carroll|Fort_Carroll|  in  |Baltimore|Baltimore|  harbor. During this time, his service was interrupted by other duties, among them surveying and updating maps in Florida. Cuban revolutionary  |Narciso_López|Narciso_López|  intended to forcibly liberate Cuba from Spanish rule. In 1849, searching for a leader for his  |filibuster|Filibuster|  expedition, he approached Jefferson Davis, then a United States senator. Davis declined and suggested Lee, who also declined. Both decided it was inconsistent with their duties.         The 1850s were a difficult time for Lee, with his long absences from home, the increasing disability of his wife, troubles in taking over the management of a large slave plantation, and his often morbid concern with his personal failures.      In 1852, Lee was appointed Superintendent of the  |Military_Academy_at_West_Point|United_States_Military_Academy| .  He was reluctant to enter what he called a snake pit , but the War Department insisted and he obeyed. His wife occasionally came to visit. During his three years at West Point, Brevet Colonel Robert E. Lee improved the buildings and courses and spent much time with the cadets. Lees oldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, attended West Point during his tenure. Custis Lee graduated in 1854, first in his class.      Lee was enormously relieved to receive a long-awaited promotion as second-in-command of the  |2nd_Cavalry_Regiment|5Th_Cavalry_Regiment|  in Texas in 1855. It meant leaving the Engineering Corps and its sequence of staff jobs for the combat command he truly wanted. He served under Colonel  |Albert_Sidney_Johnston|Albert_Sidney_Johnston|  at  |Camp_Cooper|Camp_Cooper| , Texas; their mission was to protect settlers from attacks by the  |Apache|Apache_Tribe|  and the  |Comanche|Comanche| .            In 1857, his father-in-law  |George_Washington_Parke_Custis|George_Washington_Parke_Custis|  died, creating a serious crisis when Lee took on the burden of executing the will. Custiss will encompassed vast landholdings and hundreds of slaves balanced against massive debts, and required Custiss former slaves to be emancipated by my executors in such manner as to my executors may seem most expedient and proper, the said emancipation to be accomplished in not exceeding five years from the time of my decease.  The estate was in disarray, and the plantations had been poorly managed and were losing money.    Lee tried to hire an overseer to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate & kind to the negroes, will be firm & make them do their duty.  But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and had to take a two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself.     Lees cruelty on the Arlington plantation nearly led to a slave revolt, since many of the slaves had been given to understand that they were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay. Wesley Norris,  in National Anti-Slavery Standard 4, reprinted in  In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, I have had some trouble with some of the people. Reuben, Parks & Edward, in the beginning of the previous week, rebelled against my authority—refused to obey my orders, & said they were as free as I was, etc., etc.—I succeeded in capturing them & lodging them in jail. They resisted till overpowered & called upon the other people to rescue them. Less than two months after they were sent to the  |Alexandria|Alexandria,_Virginia|  jail, Lee decided to remove these three men and three female house slaves from Arlington, and sent them under lock and key to the slave-trader William Overton Winston in  |Richmond|Richmond,_Virginia| , who was instructed to keep them in jail until he could find good & responsible slaveholders to work them until the end of the five-year period.     Lee ruptured the Washington and Custis tradition of respecting slave families and by 1860 he had broken up every family but one on the estate, some of whom had been together since Mount Vernon days.        In 1859, three of the Arlington slaves—Wesley Norris, his sister Mary, and a cousin of theirs—fled for the North, but were captured a few miles from the  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|  border and forced to return to Arlington. On June 24, 1859, the anti-slavery newspaper  New York Daily Tribune  published two anonymous letters , each claiming to have heard that Lee had the Norrises whipped, and each going so far as to claim that the overseer refused to whip the woman but that Lee took the whip and flogged her personally. Lee privately wrote to his son Custis that The N. Y. Tribune has attacked me for my treatment of your grandfathers slaves, but I shall not reply. He has left me an unpleasant legacy.      Wesley Norris himself spoke out about the incident after the war, in an 1866 interview printed in an abolitionist newspaper, the  National Anti-Slavery Standard . Norris stated that after they had been captured, and forced to return to Arlington, Lee told them that he would teach us a lesson we would not soon forget. According to Norris, Lee then had the three of them firmly tied to posts by the overseer, and ordered them whipped with fifty lashes for the men and twenty for Mary Norris. Norris claimed that Lee encouraged the whipping, and that when the overseer refused to do it, called in the county constable to do it instead. Unlike the anonymous letter writers, he does not state that Lee himself whipped any of the slaves. According to Norris, Lee frequently enjoined Williams to lay it on well, an injunction which he did not fail to heed; not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with  |brine|Brine| , which was done. Wesley Norris, , National Anti-Slavery Standard, April 14, 1866.     The Norris men were then sent by Lees agent to work on the railroads in Virginia and  |Alabama|Alabama| . According to the interview, Norris was sent to Richmond in January 1863 from which place I finally made my escape through the rebel lines to freedom. But Federal authorities reported that Norris came within their lines on September 5, 1863, and that he left Richmond ... with a pass from General Custis Lee.

List of Slaves Emancipated in the Will of George W. P. Custis, December 29, 1862       Biographers of Lee have differed over the credibility of the account of the punishment as described in the letters in the Tribune and in Norriss personal account. They broadly agree that Lee had a group of escaped slaves recaptured, and that after recapturing them he hired them out off of the Arlington plantation as a punishment; but they disagree over the likelihood that Lee flogged them, and over the charge that he personally whipped Mary Norris. In 1934,  |Douglas_S._Freeman|Douglas_S._Freeman|  described them as Lees first experience with the extravagance of irresponsible antislavery agitators and asserted that There is no evidence, direct or indirect, that Lee ever had them or any other Negroes flogged. The usage at Arlington and elsewhere in Virginia among people of Lees station forbade such a thing.      In 2000, Michael Fellman, in  The Making of Robert E. Lee , found the claims that Lee had personally whipped Mary Norris extremely unlikely, but found it not at all unlikely that Lee had ordered the runaways whipped: corporal punishment was an intrinsic and necessary part of slave discipline. Although it was supposed to be applied only in a calm and rational manner, overtly physical domination of slaves, unchecked by law, was always brutal and potentially savage.      In 2003, Bernice-Marie Yatess The Perfect Gentleman, cited Freemans denial and followed his account in holding that, because of Lees family connections to George Washington, he was a prime target for abolitionists who lacked all the facts of the situation.      Lee biographer Elizabeth Brown Pryor concluded in 2008 that the facts are verifiable, based on the consistency of the five extant descriptions of the episode , as well as the existence of an account book that indicates the constable received compensation from Lee on the date that this event occurred. Elizabeth Brown Pryor, Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E. Lee Through His Private Letters , chapter 16. Ariel Burriss, .     In 2014, Michael Korda wrote that Although these letters are dismissed by most of Lees biographers as exaggerated, or simply as unfounded abolitionist propaganda, it is hard to ignore them. ... It seems incongruously out of character for Lee to have whipped a slave woman himself, particularly one stripped to the waist, and that charge may have been a flourish added by the two correspondents; it was not repeated by Wesley Norris when his account of the incident was published in 1866. ... though it seems unlikely that he would have done any of the whipping himself, he may not have flinched from observing it to make sure his orders were carried out exactly.        Several historians have noted the paradoxical nature of Lees beliefs and actions concerning race and slavery. While Lee protested he had sympathetic feelings for blacks, they were subordinate to his own racial identity.  While Lee held slavery to be an evil institution, he also saw some benefit to blacks held in slavery. Cox, R. David. The Religious Life of Robert E. Lee 2017, , p. 157 While Lee helped assist individual slaves to freedom in Liberia, and provided for their emancipation in his own will,  he believed the enslaved should be eventually freed in a general way only at some unspecified future date as a part of Gods purpose.  Slavery for Lee was a moral and religious issue, and not one that would yield to political solutions.  Emancipation would sooner come from Christian impulse among slave masters before storms and tempests of fiery controversy such as was occurring in  |Bleeding_Kansas|Bleeding_Kansas|  . Countering southerners who argued for slavery as a positive good, Lee in his well-known analysis of slavery from an 1856 letter called it a moral and political evil. While both Robert and his wife Mary Lee were disgusted with slavery, they also defended it against  |Abolitionist|Abolitionism|  demands for immediate emancipation for all enslaved.      Lees father-in-law  |G._W._Parke_Custis|George_Washington_Parke_Custis|  freed his slaves in his will.  In the same tradition, before leaving to serve in Mexico, Lee had written a will providing for the  |manumission|Manumission|  of the only slaves he owned.  Parke Custis was a member of the  |American_Colonization_Society|American_Colonization_Society| , which was formed to gradually end slavery by establishing a free republic in  |Liberia|Liberia|  for African-Americans, and Lee assisted several ex-slaves to emigrate there. Also, according to historian Richard B. McCaslin, Lee was a gradual emancipationist, denouncing extremist proposals for immediate abolition of slavery. Lee rejected what he called evilly motivated political passion, fearing a civil and servile war from precipitous emancipation.      Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor offered an alternative interpretation of Lees voluntary manumission of slaves in his will, and assisting slaves to a life of freedom in Liberia, seeing Lee as conforming to a primacy of slave law . She wrote that Lees private views on race and slavery,   : which today seem startling, were entirely unremarkable in Lees world. No visionary, Lee nearly always tried to conform to accepted opinions. His assessment of black inferiority, of the necessity of racial stratification, the primacy of slave law, and even a divine sanction for it all, was in keeping with the prevailing views of other moderate slaveholders and a good many prominent Northerners. Pryor, Elizabeth Brown.  , p. 151.     On taking on the role of administrator for the Parke Custis will, Lee used a provision to retain them in slavery to produce income for the estate to retire debt. Lee did not welcome the role of planter while administering the Custis properties at Romancoke, another nearby the Pamunkey River and Arlington; he rented the estates mill. While all the estates prospered under his administration, Lee was unhappy at direct participation in slavery as a hated institution.     Even before what Michael Fellman called a sorry involvement in actual slave management , Lee judged the experience of white mastery to be a greater moral evil to the white man than blacks suffering under the painful discipline of slavery which introduced Christianity, literacy and a work ethic to the heathen African .  Columbia University historian   |Eric_Foner|Eric_Foner|  notes that:   : Lee was not a pro-slavery ideologue. But I think equally important is that, unlike some white southerners, he never spoke out against slavery    By the time of Lees career in the U.S. Army, the officers of West Point stood aloof from political-party and sectional strife on such issues as slavery, as a matter of principle, and Lee adhered to the principle. Skelton, William B., , 1992, p. 285. Officers developed a conception of the army as an apolitical instrument of public policy. As servants of the nation, they should stand aloof from party and sectional strife and avoid taking public positions on controversial issues such as slavery. Davis, William.  , p. 46. From early manhood Lee held a low opinion of politicians, and believed military men should stay out of politics. He considered it his patriotic duty to be apolitical while in active Army service, . In 1863, even before Chancellorsville, Lee began to advance, for the first time, a political understanding of the war, quite unlike his previous apolitical belief in duty . Taylor, John. , 1999, p. 223. He epitomized the nonpolitical tradition in the U.S. military, and his lifelong attempt to remain aloof from the political turmoil about him would be emulated by twentieth-century soldiers ... Pryor, Elizabeth Brown. , 2008, p.284. Pryor notes in describing Lees public silence on controversial sectional issues such as slavery, that the regular army was an apolitical institution, which discouraged displays of partisan sentiment and muted any parochialism in its officers. At the military academy a cadet was taught that he belongs no longer to section or party but, in his life and all his faculties, to his country. and Lee did not speak out publicly on the subject of slavery prior to the Civil War. Foner, Eric quoted in Fortin, Jacey. , NYT Aug 18, unlike some white southerners, never spoke out against slavery. . Lee believed in Gods time, not mans, and Gods disposition, not human politics. So when it came to grappling with the issue of slavery, he could not comprehend why men could not leave well enough alone. ... on major public conflicts, Lee had no active position. Before the outbreak of the War, in 1860, Lee voted for  |John_C._Breckinridge|John_C._Breckinridge| , who was the extreme pro-slavery candidate in the 1860 presidential election, not  |John_Bell|John_Bell| , the more moderate Southerner who won Virginia.     Lee himself owned a small number of slaves in his lifetime and considered himself a paternalistic master.  There are various historical and newspaper hearsay accounts of Lee personally whipping a slave, but they are not direct eyewitness accounts. He was definitely involved in administering the day-to-day operations of a plantation and was involved in the recapture of runaway slaves.  One historian noted that Lee separated slave families, something that prominent slave-holding families in Virginia such as Washington and Custis did not do.  In 1862, Lee freed the slaves that his wife inherited, but that was in accordance with his father-in-laws will.      Lee claimed that he found slavery bothersome and time-consuming as an everyday institution to run. In an 1856 letter to his wife, he maintained that slavery was a great evil, but primarily due to adverse impact that it had on white people:  In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.      Foner writes that Lees code of gentlemanly conduct did not seem to apply to blacks during the War, as he did not stop his soldiers from kidnapping free black farmers and selling them into slavery. Princeton University historian  |James_M._McPherson|James_M._Mcpherson|  noted that Lee initially rejected a  |prisoner_exchange_between_the_Confederacy_and_the_Union|American_Civil_War_Prison_Campsprisoner_Exchanges|  when the Union demanded that black Union soldiers be included. Lee did not accept the swap until a few months before the Confederacys surrender.     After the War, Lee told a congressional committee that blacks were not disposed to work and did not possess the intellectual capacity to vote and participate in politics. Lee also said to the committee that he hoped that Virginia could get rid of them, referring to blacks. While not politically active, Lee defended Lincolns successor,  |Andrew_Johnsons|Andrew_Johnson|  approach to Reconstruction, which according to Foner, abandoned the former slaves to the mercy of governments controlled by their former owners.  According to Foner, A word from Lee might have encouraged white Southerners to accord blacks equal rights and inhibited the violence against the freed people that swept the region during Reconstruction, but he chose to remain silent. Lee was also urged to condemn the white-supremacy  organization  |Ku_Klux_Klan|Ku_Klux_Klan| , but opted to remain silent.     In the generation following the war, Lee, though he died just a few years later, became a central figure in the  |Lost_Cause|Lost_Cause_Of_The_Confederacy|  interpretation of the war. The argument that Lee had always somehow opposed slavery, and freed his wifes slaves, helped maintain his stature as a symbol of Southern honor and national reconciliation.  |Douglas_Southall_Freemans|Douglas_Southall_Freeman|  Pulitzer prize-winning four-volume R. E. Lee: A Biography , which was for a long period considered the definitive work on Lee, downplayed his involvement in slavery and emphasized Lee as a virtuous person. Eric Foner, who describes Freemans volume as a  |hagiography|Wiktionary:Hagiography|  , notes that on the whole, Freeman displayed little interest in Lees relationship to slavery. The index to his four volumes contained 22 entries for devotion to duty, 19 for kindness, 53 for Lees celebrated horse,  |Traveller|Traveller| . But slavery, slave emancipation and slave insurrection together received five. Freeman observed, without offering details, that slavery in Virginia represented the system at its best. He ignored the postwar testimony of Lees former slave  |Wesley_Norris|Wesley_Norris|  about the brutal treatment to which he had been subjected.       Both  |Harpers_Ferry|John_Browns_Raid_On_Harpers_Ferry|  and the  |secession_of_Texas|Texas_In_The_American_Civil_War|  were monumental events leading up to the Civil War. Robert E. Lee was at both events. Lee initially remained loyal to the Union after Texas seceded.        |John_Brown|John_Brown|  led a band of 21 abolitionists who seized the  |federal_arsenal|Harpers_Ferry_Armory|  at  |Harpers_Ferry|Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia| , Virginia, in October 1859, hoping to incite a slave rebellion. President  |James_Buchanan|James_Buchanan|  gave Lee command of detachments of militia, soldiers, and  |United_States_Marines|United_States_Marines| , to suppress the uprising and arrest its leaders.  By the time Lee arrived that night, the militia on the site had surrounded Brown and his hostages. At dawn, Brown refused the demand for surrender. Lee attacked, and Brown and his followers were captured after three minutes of fighting. Lees summary report of the episode shows Lee believed it was the attempt of a fanatic or madman . Lee said Brown achieved temporary success by creating panic and confusion and by magnifying the number of participants involved in the raid.        In 1860, Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee relieved Major  |Heintzelman|Samuel_P._Heintzelman|  at  |Fort_Brown|Fort_Brown,_Texas| , and the Mexican authorities offered to restrain their citizens from making predatory descents upon the territory and people of Texas ... this was the last active operation of the  |Cortina_War|Cortina_War|  .  |Rip_Ford|Rip_Ford| , a  |Texas_Ranger|Texas_Rangers_Division|  at the time, described Lee as dignified without hauteur, grand without pride ... he evinced an imperturbable self-possession, and a complete control of his passions ... possessing the capacity to accomplish great ends and the gift of controlling and leading men.      When Texas seceded from the  |Union|Union|  in February 1861, General  |David_E._Twiggs|David_E._Twiggs|  surrendered all the American forces to the Texans. Twiggs immediately resigned from the U.S. Army and was made a Confederate general. Lee went back to Washington and was appointed Colonel of the First Regiment of Cavalry in March 1861. Lees colonelcy was signed by the new President, Abraham Lincoln. Three weeks after his promotion, Colonel Lee was offered a senior command in the expanding Army to fight the Southern States that had left the Union.  |Fort_Mason,_Texas|Fort_Mason|  was Lees last command with the United States Army.            Unlike many Southerners who expected a glorious war, Lee correctly predicted it as protracted and devastating.  He privately opposed the new  |Confederate_States_of_America|Confederate_States_Of_America|  in letters in early 1861, denouncing secession as nothing but revolution and an unconstitutional betrayal of the efforts of the  |Founding_Fathers|Founding_Fathers| . Writing to George Washington Custis in January, Lee stated:             Despite opposing secession, Lee said in January that we can with a clear conscience separate if all peaceful means failed. He agreed with secessionists in most areas, such as dislike of Northern anti-slavery criticisms and prevention of expanding slavery to new territories, and fear of its larger population. Lee supported the  |Crittenden_Compromise|Crittenden_Compromise| , which would have constitutionally protected slavery.     Lees objection to secession was ultimately outweighed by a sense of personal honor, reservations about the legitimacy of a strife-ridden Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets , and duty to defend his native Virginia if attacked. He was asked while leaving Texas by a lieutenant if he intended to fight for the Confederacy or the Union, to which Lee replied, I shall never bear arms against the Union, but it may be necessary for me to carry a musket in the defense of my native state, Virginia, in which case I shall not prove recreant to my duty .       Although Virginia had the most slaves of any state, it was more similar to Maryland, which stayed in the Union, than the Deep South; a convention voted against secession in early 1861. Scott, commanding general of the Union Army and Lees mentor, told Lincoln he wanted him for a top command, telling Secretary of War  |Simon_Cameron|Simon_Cameron|  that he had entire confidence in Lee. He accepted a promotion to colonel of the  |1st_Cavalry_Regiment|1St_Cavalry_Regiment|  on March 28, again swearing an oath to the United States.   Meanwhile, Lee ignored an offer of command from the Confederacy. After Lincolns call for troops to put down the rebellion, a second Virginia convention in Richmond voted to secede on April 17, and a May 23 referendum would likely ratify the decision. That night Lee dined with brother  |Smith|Sydney_Smith_Lee|  and cousin  |Phillips|Samuel_Phillips_Lee| , naval officers. Because of Lees indecision, Phillips went to the War Department the next morning to warn that the Union might lose his cousin if the government did not act quickly.     In Washington that day, Lee was offered by presidential advisor  |Francis_P._Blair|Francis_P._Blair|  a role as major general to command the  |defense_of_the_national_capital|Civil_War_Defenses_Of_Washington_Dc| . He replied:    Lee immediately went to Scott, who tried to persuade him that Union forces would be large enough to prevent the South from fighting, so he would not have to oppose his state; Lee disagreed. When Lee asked if he could go home and not fight, the fellow Virginian said that the army did not need equivocal soldiers and that if he wanted to resign, he should do so before receiving official orders. Scott told him that he had made the greatest mistake of your life .     Lee agreed that to avoid dishonor he had to resign before receiving unwanted orders. While historians have usually called his decision inevitable  given the ties to family and state, an 1871 letter from his eldest daughter, Mary Custis Lee, to a biographer described Lee as worn and harassed yet calm as he deliberated alone in his office. People on the street noticed Lees grim face as he tried to decide over the next two days, and he later said that he kept the resignation letter for a day before sending it on April 20. Two days later the Richmond convention invited Lee to the city. It elected him as commander of Virginia state forces before his arrival on April 23, and almost immediately gave him George Washingtons sword as symbol of his appointment; whether he was told of a decision he did not want without time to decide, or did want the excitement and opportunity of command, is unclear.       A cousin on Scotts staff told the family that Lees decision so upset Scott that he collapsed on a sofa and mourned as if he had lost a son, and asked to not hear Lees name. When Lee told family his decision he said I suppose you will all think I have done very wrong , as the others were mostly pro-Union; only Mary Custis was a secessionist, and her mother especially wanted to choose the Union but told her husband that she would support whatever he decided. Many younger men like nephew  |Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh_Lee|  wanted to support the Confederacy, but Lees three sons joined the Confederate military only after their fathers decision.     Most family members like brother Smith reluctantly also chose the South, but Smiths wife and Anne, Lees sister, still supported the Union; Annes son joined the Union Army, and no one in his family ever spoke to Lee again. Many cousins fought for the Confederacy, but Phillips and John Fitzgerald told Lee in person that they would uphold their oaths;  |John_H._Upshur|John_H._Upshur|  stayed with the Union military despite much family pressure;  |Roger_Jones|Roger_Jones|  stayed in the Union army after Lee refused to advise him on what to do; and two of  |Philip_Fendalls|Philip_Richard_Fendall_Ii|  sons fought for the Union. Forty percent of Virginian officers stayed with the North.       At the outbreak of war, Lee was appointed to command all of Virginias forces, but upon the formation of the Confederate States Army, he was named one of its first five  |full_generals|Full_General| . Lee did not wear the insignia of a Confederate general, but only the three stars of a Confederate colonel, equivalent to his last U.S. Army rank.  He did not intend to wear a generals insignia until the Civil War had been won and he could be promoted, in peacetime, to general in the Confederate Army.     Lees first field assignment was commanding Confederate forces in western Virginia, where he was defeated at the  |Battle_of_Cheat_Mountain|Battle_Of_Cheat_Mountain|  and was widely blamed for Confederate setbacks.  He was then sent to organize the coastal defenses along the Carolina and Georgia seaboard, appointed commander, Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida on November 5, 1861. Between then and the fall of  |Fort_Pulaski|Battle_Of_Fort_Pulaski| , April 11, 1862, he put in place a defense of Savannah that proved successful in blocking Federal advance on Savannah. Confederate fort and naval gunnery dictated night time movement and construction by the besiegers. Federal preparations required four months. In those four months, Lee developed a defense in depth. Behind Fort Pulaski on the Savannah River,  |Fort_Jackson|Fort_James_Jackson|  was improved, and two additional batteries covered river approaches. Fort Pulaskis masonry was impervious to round shot, but it was penetrated in 30 hours by  |Parrott_rifle|Parrott_Rifle|  guns, much to the surprise of senior commanders of both sides. In the future, Confederate breast works defending coastal areas were successfully protected against rifle-fired explosive projectiles with banks of dirt and sand such as at Fort McAllister. Later, holding the city of Savannah would allow two additional attempts at breaking the Union blockade with ironclads  |CSS_Atlanta|Uss_Atlanta|  and  |CSS_Savannah|Css_Savannah|  . In the face of the Union superiority in naval, artillery and infantry deployment, Lee was able to block any Federal advance on Savannah, and at the same time, well-trained Georgia troops were released in time to meet McClellans Peninsula Campaign. The city of Savannah would not fall until  |Shermans_approach_from_the_interior|Shermans_March_To_The_Sea|  at the end of 1864.     At first, the press spoke to the disappointment of losing Fort Pulaski. Surprised by the effectiveness of large caliber Parrott Rifles in their first deployment, it was widely speculated that only betrayal could have brought overnight surrender to a  |Third_System_Fort|Seacoast_Defense_In_The_United_States| . Lee was said to have failed to get effective support in the Savannah River from the three sidewheeler gunboats of the Georgia Navy. Although again blamed by the press for Confederate reverses, he was appointed military adviser to  |Confederate_President|President_Of_The_Confederate_States| |Jefferson_Davis|Jefferson_Davis| , the former  |U.S._Secretary_of_War|United_States_Secretary_Of_War| . While in  |Richmond|Richmond,_Virginia| , Lee was ridiculed as the King of Spades for his excessive digging of trenches around the capitol. These trenches would later play a pivotal role in battles near the end of the war. Foot Soldier: The Rebels. Prod. A & E Television Network. Karn, Richard. The History Channel. 1998. DVD. A & E Television Networks, 2008.       In the spring of 1862, in the  |Peninsula_Campaign|Peninsula_Campaign| , the Union  |Army_of_the_Potomac|Army_Of_The_Potomac|  under General  |George_B._McClellan|George_B._Mcclellan|  advanced on Richmond from  |Fort_Monroe|Fort_Monroe|  to the east. McClellan forced Gen.  |Joseph_E._Johnston|Joseph_E._Johnston|  and the Army of Virginia to retreat to just north and east of the Confederate capital.     Then Johnston was wounded at the  |Battle_of_Seven_Pines|Battle_Of_Seven_Pines| , on June 1, 1862. Lee now got his first opportunity to lead an army in the field  – the force he renamed the  |Army_of_Northern_Virginia|Army_Of_Northern_Virginia| , signalling his confidence that the Union army would be driven away from Richmond. Early in the war, Lee had been called Granny Lee for his allegedly timid style of command.  Confederate newspaper editorials objected to him replacing Johnston, opining that Lee would be passive, waiting for Union attack. And for the first three weeks of June, he did not attack, instead strengthening Richmonds defenses.          But then he launched a series of bold attacks against McClellans forces, the  |Seven_Days_Battles|Seven_Days_Battles| . Despite superior Union numbers, and some clumsy tactical performances by his subordinates, Lees attacks derailed McClellans plans and drove back part of his forces. Confederate casualties were heavy, but McClellan was unnerved, retreated  to the lower  |James_River|James_River| , and abandoned the Peninsula Campaign. This success completely changed Confederate morale, and the publics regard for Lee. After the Seven Days Battles, and until the end of the war, his men called him simply Marse Robert , a term of respect and affection.     The setback, and the resulting drop in Union morale, impelled Lincoln to adopt a new policy of relentless, committed warfare.   After the Seven Days, Lincoln decided he would move to emancipate most Confederate slaves by executive order, as a military act, using his authority as commander-in-chief.  But he needed a Union victory first.     Meanwhile, Lee defeated another Union army under Gen.  |John_Pope|John_Pope|  at the  |Second_Battle_of_Bull_Run|Second_Battle_Of_Bull_Run| . In less than 90 days after taking command, Lee had run McClellan off the Peninsula, defeated Pope, and moved the battle lines from  outside Richmond, to  outside Washington.     Lee now invaded Maryland and Pennsylvania, hoping to collect supplies in Union territory, and possibly win a victory that would sway  |the_upcoming_Union_elections|United_States_Elections,_1862|  in favor of ending the war. But McClellans men found a lost Confederate dispatch,  |Special_Order_191|Special_Order_191| , that revealed Lees plans and movements. McClellan always exaggerated Lees numerical strength, but now he knew the Confederate army was divided and could be destroyed in detail. However, McClellan moved slowly, not realizing a spy had informed Lee that McClellan had the plans. Lee quickly concentrated his forces west of Antietam Creek, near Sharpsburg, Maryland, where McClellan attacked on September 17. The  |Battle_of_Antietam|Battle_Of_Antietam|  was the single bloodiest day of the war, with both sides suffering enormous losses. Lees army barely withstood the Union assaults, then retreated to Virginia the next day. This narrow Confederate defeat gave President  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln|  the opportunity to issue his  |Emancipation_Proclamation|Emancipation_Proclamation| ,  which put the Confederacy on the diplomatic and moral defensive.      Disappointed by McClellans failure to destroy Lees army, Lincoln named  |Ambrose_Burnside|Ambrose_Burnside|  as commander of the Army of the Potomac. Burnside ordered an attack across the  |Rappahannock_River|Rappahannock_River|  at  |Fredericksburg,_Virginia|Fredericksburg,_Virginia| . Delays in bridging the river allowed Lees army ample time to organize strong defenses, and  |the_Union_frontal_assault|Battle_Of_Fredericksburg|  on December 13, 1862, was a disaster. There were 12,600 Union casualties to 5,000 Confederate; one of the most one-sided battles in the Civil War.  After this victory, Lee reportedly said It is well that war is so terrible, else we should grow too fond of it. At Fredericksburg, according to historian Michael Fellman, Lee had completely entered into the spirit of war, where destructiveness took on its own beauty.     After the bitter Union defeat at Fredericksburg, President Lincoln named  |Joseph_Hooker|Joseph_Hooker|  commander of the Army of the Potomac. In May 1863, Hooker maneuvered to attack Lees army via  |Chancellorsville,_Virginia|Chancellorsville,_Virginia| . But Hooker  |was_defeated|Battle_Of_Chancellorsville|  by Lees daring maneuver: dividing his army and sending  |Stonewall_Jacksons|Stonewall_Jackson|  corps to attack Hookers flank. Lee won a decisive victory over a larger force, but with heavy casualties, including Jackson, his finest corps commander, who was accidentally killed by his own troops.        The critical decisions came in May–June 1863, after Lees smashing victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The western front was crumbling, as multiple uncoordinated Confederate armies were unable to handle General  |Ulysses_S._Grants|Ulysses_S._Grant|  campaign against Vicksburg. The top military advisers wanted to save Vicksburg, but Lee persuaded Davis to overrule them and authorize yet another invasion of the North. The immediate goal was to acquire urgently needed supplies from the rich farming districts of Pennsylvania; a long-term goal was to stimulate peace activity in the North by demonstrating the power of the South to invade. Lees decision proved a significant strategic blunder and cost the Confederacy control of its western regions, and nearly cost Lee his own army as Union forces cut him off from the South. Stephen W. Sears, We Should Assume the Aggressive: Origins of the Gettysburg Campaign, North and South: The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society, March 2002, Vol. 54 pp. 58–66; Donald Stoker, The Grand Design: Strategy and the U.S. Civil War p. 295 says that attacking Grant would have been the wiser choice for Lee.          In the summer of 1863, Lee invaded the North again, marching through western Maryland and into south central Pennsylvania. He encountered Union forces under  |George_G._Meade|George_G._Meade|  at the three-day  |Battle_of_Gettysburg|Battle_Of_Gettysburg|  in Pennsylvania in July; the battle would produce the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War. With some of his subordinates being new and inexperienced in their commands,  |J.E.B._Stuarts|J.E.B._Stuart|  cavalry being out of the area, and Lee being slightly ill, he was less than comfortable with how events were unfolding. While the first day of battle was controlled by the Confederates, key terrain that should have been taken by  |General_Ewell|Richard_S._Ewell|  was not. The second day ended with the Confederates unable to break the Union position, and the Union being more solidified. Lees decision on the third day, against the judgment of his best corps commander  |General_Longstreet|General_Longstreet| , to launch a massive frontal assault on the center of the Union line turned out to be disastrous. The assault known as  |Picketts_Charge|Picketts_Charge|  was repulsed and resulted in heavy Confederate losses. The general rode out to meet his retreating army and proclaimed, All this has been my fault.  Lee was compelled to retreat. Despite flooded rivers that blocked his retreat, he escaped Meades ineffective pursuit. Following his defeat at Gettysburg, Lee sent a letter of resignation to President Davis on August 8, 1863, but Davis refused Lees request. That fall, Lee and Meade met again in two minor campaigns that did little to change the strategic standoff. The Confederate Army never fully recovered from the substantial losses incurred during the three-day battle in southern Pennsylvania. The historian  |Shelby_Foote|Shelby_Foote|  stated, Gettysburg was the price the South paid for having Robert E. Lee as commander.       In 1864 the new Union general-in-chief, Lt. Gen.  |Ulysses_S._Grant|Ulysses_S._Grant| , sought to use his large advantages in manpower and material resources to destroy Lees army by  |attrition|Attrition_Warfare| , pinning Lee against his capital of Richmond. Lee successfully stopped each attack, but Grant with his superior numbers kept pushing each time a bit farther to the southeast. These battles in the  |Overland_Campaign|Overland_Campaign|  included the  |Wilderness|Battle_Of_The_Wilderness| ,  |Spotsylvania_Court_House|Battle_Of_Spotsylvania_Court_House|  and  |Cold_Harbor|Battle_Of_Cold_Harbor| .     Grant eventually was able to stealthily move his army across the  |James_River|James_River| . After stopping a Union attempt to capture  |Petersburg,_Virginia|Petersburg,_Virginia| , a vital railroad link supplying Richmond, Lees men built elaborate trenches and were besieged in Petersburg, a development which presaged the  |trench_warfare|Trench_Warfare|  of  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . Lee attempted to break the stalemate by sending  |Jubal_A._Early|Jubal_A._Early|  on a raid through the  |Shenandoah_Valley|Shenandoah_Valley|  to Washington, D.C., but Early was defeated early on by the superior forces of  |Philip_Sheridan|Philip_Sheridan| . The  |Siege_of_Petersburg|Siege_Of_Petersburg|  lasted from June 1864 until March 1865, with Lees outnumbered and poorly supplied army shrinking daily because of desertions by disheartened Confederates.            On February 6, 1865, Lee was appointed  |General_in_Chief_of_the_Armies_of_the_Confederate_States|General_In_Chief_Of_The_Armies_Of_The_Confederate_States| .     As the South ran out of manpower the issue of arming the slaves became paramount. Lee explained, We should employ them without delay ... gradual and general emancipation. The first units were in training as the war ended.   As the Confederate army was devastated by casualties, disease and desertion, the Union attack on  |Petersburg|Petersburg,_Virginia|  succeeded on April 2, 1865. Lee abandoned Richmond and retreated west. Lee then made an attempt to escape to the southwest and join up with Joseph E. Johnstons Army of Tennessee in North Carolina. However, his forces were soon surrounded and he surrendered them to Grant on April 9, 1865, at the  |Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House|Battle_Of_Appomattox_Court_House| .  Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended. The day after his surrender, Lee issued his  |Farewell_Address|Lees_Farewell_Address|  to his army.     Lee resisted calls by some officers to reject surrender and allow small units to melt away into the mountains, setting up a lengthy guerrilla war. He insisted the war was over and energetically campaigned for inter-sectional reconciliation. So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South.        The following are summaries of Civil War campaigns and major battles where Robert E. Lee was the commanding officer:                          After the war, Lee was not arrested or punished , but he did lose the right to vote as well as some property. Lees prewar family home, the  |Custis-Lee_Mansion|Arlington_House,_The_Robert_E._Lee_Memorial| , was seized by Union forces during the war and turned into  |Arlington_National_Cemetery|Arlington_National_Cemetery| , and his family was not compensated until more than a decade after his death. In December 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court returned the property to Lees son because it had been confiscated without due process of law. In 1883, the government paid the Lee family $150,000.      Lee somewhat supported President Johnsons plan of  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era| . In 1866 Lee counseled southerners not to resume fighting, of which Grant said Lee was setting an example of forced acquiescence so grudging and pernicious in its effects as to be hardly realized .  Lee joined with Democrats in opposing the Radical Republicans who demanded punitive measures against the South, distrusted its commitment to the abolition of slavery and, indeed, distrusted the regions loyalty to the United States.   Lee supported a system of free public schools for blacks, but forthrightly opposed allowing blacks to vote. My own opinion is that, at this time, they cannot vote intelligently, and that giving them the would lead to a great deal of demagogism, and lead to embarrassments in various ways, Lee stated.   |Emory_Thomas|Emory_Thomas|  says Lee had become a suffering Christ-like icon for ex-Confederates. President Grant invited him to the White House in 1869, and he went. Nationally he became an icon of reconciliation between the North and South, and the reintegration of former Confederates into the national fabric.           Lee hoped to retire to a farm of his own, but he was too much a regional symbol to live in obscurity. From April to June 1865, he and his family resided in Richmond at the  |Stewart-Lee_House|Stewart-Lee_House| .  He accepted an offer to serve as the president of Washington College  in  |Lexington,_Virginia|Lexington,_Virginia| , and served from October 1865 until his death. The Trustees used his famous name in large-scale fund-raising appeals and Lee transformed Washington College into a leading Southern college, expanding its offerings significantly, adding programs in commerce and journalism, and incorporating the  |Lexington_Law_School|Washington_And_Lee_University_School_Of_Law| . Lee was well liked by the students, which enabled him to announce an  |honor_system|Honor_System|  like that of West Point, explaining that we have but one rule here, and it is that every student be a  |gentleman|Gentlemanrobert_E._Lee| . To speed up national reconciliation Lee recruited students from the North and made certain they were well treated on campus and in town.      Several glowing appraisals of Lees tenure as college president have survived, depicting the dignity and respect he commanded among all. Previously, most students had been obliged to occupy the campus dormitories, while only the most mature were allowed to live off-campus. Lee quickly reversed this rule, requiring most students to board off-campus, and allowing only the most mature to live in the dorms as a mark of privilege; the results of this policy were considered a success. A typical account by a professor there states that the students fairly worshipped him, and deeply dreaded his displeasure; yet so kind, affable, and gentle was he toward them that all loved to approach him. ... No student would have dared to violate General Lees expressed wish or appeal; if he had done so, the students themselves would have driven him from the college.      While at Washington College, Lee told a colleague that the greatest mistake of his life was taking a military education.             On May 29, 1865, President  |Andrew_Johnson|Andrew_Johnson|  issued a Proclamation of  |Amnesty|Amnesty|  and  |Pardon|Pardon|  to persons who had participated in the  |rebellion|Rebellion|  against the United States. There were fourteen excepted classes, though, and members of those classes had to make special application to the President. Lee sent an application to Grant and wrote to President Johnson on June 13, 1865:          On October 2, 1865, the same day that Lee was inaugurated as president of  |Washington_College|Washington_And_Lee_University|  in  |Lexington,_Virginia|Lexington,_Virginia| , he signed his Amnesty Oath, thereby complying fully with the provision of Johnsons proclamation. Lee was not pardoned, nor was his citizenship restored.     Three years later, on December 25, 1868, Johnson proclaimed a second amnesty which removed previous exceptions, such as the one that affected Lee.        Lee, who had opposed secession and remained mostly indifferent to politics before the Civil War, supported President  |Andrew_Johnsons|Andrew_Johnson|  plan of Presidential  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era_Of_The_United_States|  that took effect in 1865–66. However, he opposed the Congressional Republican program that took effect in 1867. In February 1866, he was called to testify before the  |Joint_Congressional_Committee_on_Reconstruction|United_States_Congress_Joint_Committee_On_Reconstruction|  in Washington, where he expressed support for Johnsons plans for quick restoration of the former Confederate states, and argued that restoration should return, as far as possible, to the  status quo ante  in the Southern states governments .           Lee told the Committee, ...every one with whom I associate expresses kind feelings towards the freedmen. They wish to see them get on in the world, and particularly to take up some occupation for a living, and to turn their hands to some work. Lee also expressed his willingness that blacks should be educated, and ... that it would be better for the blacks and for the whites. Lee forthrightly opposed allowing blacks to vote: My own opinion is that, at this time, they cannot vote intelligently, and that giving them the would lead to a great deal of demagogism, and lead to embarrassments in various ways.       In an interview in May 1866, Lee said: The Radical party are likely to do a great deal of harm, for we wish now for good feeling to grow up between North and South, and the President, Mr. Johnson, has been doing much to strengthen the feeling in favor of the Union among us. The relations between the Negroes and the whites were friendly formerly, and would remain so if legislation be not passed in favor of the blacks, in a way that will only do them harm.      In 1868, Lees ally  |Alexander_H._H._Stuart|Alexander_H._H._Stuart|  drafted a public letter of endorsement for the  |Democratic_Partys|United_States_Democratic_Party| |presidential_campaign|1868_United_States_Presidential_Election| , in which  |Horatio_Seymour|Horatio_Seymour|  ran against Lees old foe Republican  |Ulysses_S._Grant|Ulysses_S._Grant| . Lee signed it along with thirty-one other ex-Confederates. The Democratic campaign, eager to publicize the endorsement, published the statement widely in newspapers.  Their letter claimed paternalistic concern for the welfare of freed Southern blacks, stating that The idea that the Southern people are hostile to the negroes and would oppress them, if it were in their power to do so, is entirely unfounded. They have grown up in our midst, and we have been accustomed from childhood to look upon them with kindness.  However, it also called for the restoration of white political rule, arguing that It is true that the people of the South, in common with a large majority of the people of the North and West, are, for obvious reasons, inflexibly opposed to any system of laws that would place the political power of the country in the hands of the negro race. But this opposition springs from no feeling of enmity, but from a deep-seated conviction that, at present, the negroes have neither the intelligence nor the other qualifications which are necessary to make them safe depositories of political power.      In his public statements and private correspondence, Lee argued that a tone of reconciliation and patience would further the interests of white Southerners better than hotheaded antagonism to federal authority or the use of violence. Lee repeatedly expelled white students from Washington College for violent attacks on local black men, and publicly urged obedience to the authorities and respect for law and order.  He privately chastised fellow ex-Confederates such as  |Jefferson_Davis|Jefferson_Davis|  and  |Jubal_Early|Jubal_Early|  for their frequent, angry responses to perceived Northern insults, writing in private to them as he had written to a magazine editor in 1865, that It should be the object of all to avoid controversy, to allay passion, give full scope to reason and to every kindly feeling. By doing this and encouraging our citizens to engage in the duties of life with all their heart and mind, with a determination not to be turned aside by thoughts of the past and fears of the future, our country will not only be restored in material prosperity, but will be advanced in science, in virtue and in religion.           On September 28, 1870, Lee suffered a stroke. He died two weeks later, shortly after 9 a.m. on October 12, 1870, in  |Lexington,_Virginia|Lexington,_Virginia| , from the effects of  |pneumonia|Pneumonia| . According to one account, his last words on the day of his death, were Tell  |Hill|A._P._Hill|  he must come up! Strike the tent ,  but this is debatable because of conflicting accounts and because Lees stroke had resulted in  |aphasia|Aphasia| , possibly rendering him unable to speak.      At first no suitable coffin for the body could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded for anyone to get in or out of the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were washed down the  |Maury_River|Maury_River| . Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it was used for the Generals body, though it was a bit short for him. As a result, Lee was buried without shoes.  He was buried underneath  |Lee_Chapel|Lee_Chapel|  at  |Washington_and_Lee_University|Washington_And_Lee_University| , where his body remains.       Among the supporters of the Confederacy, Lee came to be even more revered after his surrender than he had been during the war, when  |Stonewall_Jackson|Stonewall_Jackson|  had been the great Confederate hero. In an address before the Southern Historical Society in  |Atlanta|Atlanta| , Georgia in 1874,  |Benjamin_Harvey_Hill|Benjamin_Harvey_Hill|  described Lee in this way:          By the end of the 19th century, Lees popularity had spread to the North.  Lees admirers have pointed to his character and devotion to duty, and his brilliant tactical successes in battle after battle against a stronger foe.          Military historians continue to pay attention to his battlefield tactics and maneuvering, though many think he should have designed better strategic plans for the Confederacy. He was not given full direction of the Southern war effort until late in the conflict.     Historian  |Eric_Foner|Eric_Foner|  writes that at the end of his life,   : Lee had become the embodiment of the Southern cause. A generation later, he was a national hero. The 1890s and early 20th century witnessed the consolidation of white supremacy in the post-Reconstruction South and widespread acceptance in the North of Southern racial attitudes.             Robert E. Lee has been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps at least five times, the first one being a commemorative stamp that also honored  |Stonewall_Jackson|Stonewall_Jackson| , issued in 1936. A second regular-issue stamp was issued in 1955. He was commemorated with a 32-cent stamp issued in the American Civil War Issue of June 29, 1995. His horse Traveller is pictured in the background. 32c Robert E. Lee single , Arago: people, postage & the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed May 7, 2014.

Lee was again commemorated on a commemorative stamp in 1970, along with Jefferson Davis and Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson, depicted on horseback on the 6-cent Stone Mountain Memorial commemorative issue, modeled after the actual  |Stone_Mountain_Memorial|Stone_Mountain_Memorial|  carving in Georgia. The stamp was issued on September 19, 1970, in conjunction with the dedication of the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial in Georgia on May 9, 1970. The design of the stamp replicates the memorial, the largest high relief sculpture in the world. It is carved on the side of Stone Mountain 400 feet above the ground.

Stone Mountain also led to Lees appearance on a  |commemorative_coin|Early_United_States_Commemorative_Coins| , the 1925  |Stone_Mountain_Memorial_half_dollar|Stone_Mountain_Memorial_Half_Dollar| . During the 1920s and 30s dozens of specially designed half dollars were struck to raise money for various events and causes. This issue had a particularly wide distribution, with 1,314,709 minted. Unlike some of the other issues it remains a very common coin.       On September 29, 2007, General Lees three Civil War-era letters were sold for $61,000 at auction by Thomas Willcox, much less than the record of $630,000 for a Lee item in 2002. The auction included more than 400 documents of Lees from the estate of the parents of Willcox that had been in the family for generations.  |South_Carolina|South_Carolina|  sued to stop the sale on the grounds that the letters were official documents and therefore property of the state, but the court ruled in favor of Willcox.      In 1865, after the war, Lee was paroled and signed an  |oath_of_allegiance|Loyalty_Oath| , asking to have his  |citizenship_of_the_United_States|Citizenship_Of_The_United_States|  restored. However, his application was misplaced and as a result he did not receive a pardon and his citizenship was not restored. , Prologue, Spring 2005, Vol. 37, No. 1. On January 30, 1975, Senate Joint Resolution 23, A joint resolution to restore posthumously full rights of citizenship to General R. E. Lee was introduced into the Senate by Senator  |Harry_F._Byrd_Jr.|Harry_F._Byrd_Jr.|  , the result of a five-year campaign to accomplish this. The resolution, which enacted Public Law 94-67, was passed, and the bill was signed by President  |Gerald_Ford|Gerald_Ford|  on September 5.   Ten objecting Congressmen argued the resolution should include  |amnesty_for_Vietham_war_draft_dodgers|Draft_Dodgervietnam_War| , subsequently granted in 1977.                   Lee opposed the construction of public memorials to Confederate rebellion on the grounds that they would prevent the healing of wounds inflicted during the war. Nevertheless, after his death, he became an icon used by promoters of  |Lost_Cause|Lost_Cause_Of_The_Confederacy|  mythology, who sought to romanticize the Confederate cause and strengthen  |white_supremacy|White_Supremacy|  in the South. Later in the 20th century, particularly following the  |civil_rights_movement|Civil_Rights_Movement| , historians reassessed Lee; his reputation fell based on his failure to support rights for  |freedmen|Freedman|  after the war, and even his strategic choices as a military leader fell under scrutiny.      From its installation in 1884 until its removal in 2017, the most prominent monument in  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans|  was a -tall  |monument_to_General_Lee|Robert_E._Lee_Monument| .

Around the corner from Lee Circle is  |New_Orleanss_Confederate_museum|Confederate_Memorial_Hall_Museum| , which contains the second-largest collection of Confederate memorabilia in the world.  The statue of General Lee was removed on May 19, 2017, the last of four Confederate monuments in New Orleans to be taken down.      In a tribute to Lee Circle , former Confederate soldier  |George_Washington_Cable|George_Washington_Cable|  wrote:   In Tivoli Circle, New Orleans, from the centre and apex of its green flowery mound, an immense column of pure white marble rises in the ... majesty of Grecian proportions high up above the citys house-tops into the dazzling sunshine ... On its dizzy top stands the bronze figure of one of the worlds greatest captains. He is alone. Not one of his mighty lieutenants stand behind, beside or below him. His arms are folded on that breast that never knew fear, and his calm, dauntless gaze meets the morning sun as it rises, like the new prosperity of the land he loved and served so masterly, above the far distant battle fields where so many thousands of his gray veterans lie in the sleep of fallen heroes.       |Arlington_House,_The_Robert_E._Lee_Memorial|Arlington_House,_The_Robert_E._Lee_Memorial| , also known as the Custis–Lee Mansion,   is a  |Greek_revival|Greek_Revival_Architecture|  mansion in Arlington, Virginia, that was once Lees home. It overlooks the  |Potomac_River|Potomac_River|  and the  |National_Mall|National_Mall|  in Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, the grounds of the mansion were selected as the site of  |Arlington_National_Cemetery|Arlington_National_Cemetery| , in part to ensure that Lee would never again be able to return to his home. The United States designated the mansion as a  |National_Memorial|National_Memorial|  to Lee in 1955, a mark of widespread respect for him in both the  |North|Northern_United_States|  and  |South|Southern_United_States| .           In Richmond, Virginia, a large equestrian statue of Lee by French sculptor  |Jean_Antonin_Mercié|Jean_Antonin_Mercié|  is the centerpiece of the citys famous  |Monument_Avenue|Monument_Avenue| , which boasts four other statues to famous Confederates. This monument to Lee was unveiled on May 29, 1890; over 100,000 people attended this dedication. That has been described as the day white Virginia stopped admiring Gen. Robert E. Lee and started worshiping him .  Lee is also shown mounted on Traveller in  |Gettysburg_National_Military_Park|Gettysburg_National_Military_Park|  on top of the Virginia Monument; he is facing roughly in the direction of  |Picketts_Charge|Picketts_Charge| . Lees portrayal on a mural on Richmonds Flood Wall on the  |James_River|James_River| , considered offensive by some, was removed in the late 1990s, but currently is back on the flood wall.

Since there is no historical link between Lee and the city of Charlottesville, the City Council of Charlottesville voted in February 2017 to remove it, along with a statue of Stonewall Jackson, but this was temporarily stayed by court action. They did rename Lee Park, Emancipation Park. The prospect of the statues being removed and the parks being renamed brought many out-of-towners, described as  |white_supremacist|White_Supremacist|  and  |alt-right|Alt-Right| , to Charlottesville in the  |Unite_the_Right_rally|Unite_The_Right_Rally|  of August 2017, in which 3 people died. For several months the monuments were shrouded in black. As of October 2018, the fate of the statue of Lee is unresolved. The name of the park it is located in was changed again by the City Council, to Market Street Park, in July 2018.      In  |Baltimores|Baltimore|  Wyman Park, a large double equestrian statue of Lee and Jackson is located directly across from the Baltimore Museum of Art. Designed by Laura Gardin Fraser and dedicated in 1948, Lee is depicted astride his horse Traveller next to Stonewall Jackson who is mounted on Little Sorrel. Architect John Russell Pope created the base, which was dedicated on the anniversary of the eve of the  |Battle_of_Chancellorsville|Battle_Of_Chancellorsville| .  The Baltimore area of  |Maryland|Maryland|  is also home to a large nature park called  |Robert_E._Lee_Memorial_Park|Robert_E._Lee_Memorial_Park| .
