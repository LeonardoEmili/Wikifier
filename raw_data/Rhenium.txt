           Rhenium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Re and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  75. It is a silvery-gray, heavy, third-row  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal|  in  |group_7|Group_7_Element|  of the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| . With an estimated average concentration of 1  |part_per_billion|Parts_Per_Notation|  , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust| . Rhenium has the  |third_highest|List_Of_Elements_By_Melting_Point| |_melting_point|Melting_Point|  and highest boiling point of any stable element at 5903  K. Rhenium resembles  |manganese|Manganese|  and  |technetium|Technetium|  chemically and is mainly obtained as a  |by_product|By_Product|  of the extraction and refinement of  |molybdenum|Molybdenum|  and  |copper|Copper|  ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  ranging from −1 to +7.     Discovered in 1908, rhenium was the second-last  |stable_element|Stable_Element|  to be discovered . It was named after the river  |Rhine|Rhine|  in Europe.      |Nickel|Nickel| -based  |superalloys|Superalloys|  of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of  |jet_engines|Jet_Engine| . These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element. The second-most important use is as a  |catalyst|Catalysis| |hydrogenation|Hydrogenation|  and isomerization, and is used for example in  |catalytic_reforming|Catalytic_Reforming|  of naphtha for use in gasoline . Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is expensive, with price reaching an all-time high in 2008/2009 US$10,600 per  |kilogram|Kilogram|  . Due to increases in rhenium recycling and a drop in demand for rhenium in catalysts, the price of rhenium has dropped to US$2,844 per  |kilogram|Kilogram|  as of July 2018.           Rhenium   was the second last-discovered of the elements that have a stable isotope .  The existence of a yet-undiscovered element at this position in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  had been first predicted by  |Dmitri_Mendeleev|Dmitri_Mendeleev| . Other calculated information was obtained by  |Henry_Moseley|Henry_Moseley|  in 1914.  In 1908,  |Japan|Japan| ese chemist  |Masataka_Ogawa|Masataka_Ogawa|  announced that he had discovered the 43rd element and named it nipponium after  |Japan|Japan|  . However, recent analysis indicated the presence of rhenium , not  |element_43|Technetium| ,  although this reinterpretation has been questioned by  |Eric_Scerri|Eric_Scerri| .  |Eric_Scerri|Eric_Scerri| , A tale of seven elements, , p.109–114 The symbol Np was later used for the element  |neptunium|Neptunium| , and the name nihonium , also  |named_after_Japan|Names_Of_Japannihon_And_Nippon| , along with symbol Nh, was later used for  |element_113|Nihonium| . Element 113 was also discovered by a team of Japanese scientists and was named in respectful homage to Ogawas work.      Rhenium is generally considered to have been discovered by  |Walter_Noddack|Walter_Noddack| ,  |Ida_Noddack|Ida_Tacke| , and  |Otto_Berg|Otto_Berg|  in  |Germany|Germany| . In 1925 they reported that they had detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral  |columbite|Columbite| . They also found rhenium in  |gadolinite|Gadolinite|  and  |molybdenite|Molybdenite| .  In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660  kg of molybdenite.   It was estimated in 1968 that 75% of the rhenium metal in the  |United_States|United_States|  was used for research and the development of  |refractory_metal|Refractory_Metal|  alloys. It took several years from that point before the superalloys became widely used.         Rhenium is a silvery-white metal with one of the highest  |melting_points|Melting_Point|  of all elements, exceeded by only  |tungsten|Tungsten|  and  |carbon|Carbon| . It also has one of the highest  |boiling_points|Boiling_Points|  of all elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by  |platinum|Platinum| ,  |iridium|Iridium|  and  |osmium|Osmium| . Rhenium has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a    276.1  pm and c    445.6  pm.      Its usual commercial form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and  |sintering|Sintering|  in a vacuum or  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of the density of the metal. When  |annealed|Annealing|  this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled.  Rhenium-molybdenum  |alloys|Alloy|  are  |superconductive|Superconductivity|  at 10  |K|Kelvin| ; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive  around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at .       In bulk form and at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the element resists alkalis,  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| ,  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| , dilute  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| , and  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| .          Rhenium has one  |stable|Stable_Nuclide|  isotope, rhenium-185, which nevertheless occurs in minority abundance, a situation found only in two other elements . Naturally occurring rhenium is only 37.4% 185 Re, and 62.6% 187 Re, which is  |unstable|Radionuclide|  but has a very long  |half_life|Half_Life|  . This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of rhenium atom.   The  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  of 187 Re is used for  |rhenium_osmium_dating|Rhenium_Osmium_Dating|  of ores. The available energy for this beta decay  is one of the lowest known among all  |radionuclides|Radionuclide| . The isotope rhenium-186m is notable as being one of the longest lived metastable isotopes with a half-life of around 200,000 years. There are twenty-five other recognized radioactive isotopes of rhenium.             Rhenium compounds are known for all the  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_States|  between −3 and +7 except −2. The oxidation states +7, +6, +4, and +2 are the most common.  Rhenium is most available commercially as salts of  |perrhenate|Perrhenate| , including  |sodium|Sodium_Perrhenate|  and  |ammonium_perrhenates|Ammonium_Perrhenate| . These are white, water-soluble compounds. Glemser, O. Ammonium Perrhenate in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd ed., G. Brauer , Academic Press, NY., Vol. 1, pp. 1476–85.       The most common rhenium chlorides are ReCl 6 ,  |ReCl_5_|Rhenium_Pentachloride| , ReCl 4 , and  |ReCl_3_|Rhenium_Trichloride| .  The structures of these compounds often feature extensive Re-Re bonding, which is characteristic of this metal in oxidation states lower than VII. Salts of 2− feature a  |quadruple|Quadruple_Bond|  metal-metal bond. Although the highest rhenium chloride features Re, fluorine gives the d 0 Re derivative  |rhenium_heptafluoride|Rhenium_Heptafluoride| . Bromides and iodides of rhenium are also well known.     Like tungsten and molybdenum, with which it shares chemical similarities, rhenium forms a variety of  |oxyhalides|Oxohalide| . The oxychlorides are most common, and include ReOCl 4 , ReOCl 3 .            The most common oxide is the volatile colourless  |Re_2_O_7_|Rhenium_Oxide| .  |Rhenium_trioxide|Reo3|  ReO 3 adopts a  |perovskite|Perovskite| -like structure. Other oxides include Re 2 O 5 ,  |ReO_2_|Rhenium_Oxide| , and Re 2 O 3 . The  |sulfides|Sulfide|  are  |ReS_2_|Rhenium_Disulfide|  and  |Re_2_S_7_|Dirhenium_Heptasulfide| . Perrhenate salts can be converted to  |tetrathioperrhenate|Tetrathioperrhenate|  by the action of  |ammonium_hydrosulfide|Ammonium_Hydrosulfide| .         |Rhenium_diboride|Rhenium_Diboride|  is a hard compound having the hardness similar to that of  |tungsten_carbide|Tungsten_Carbide| ,  |silicon_carbide|Silicon_Carbide| ,  |titanium_diboride|Titanium_Diboride|  or  |zirconium_diboride|Zirconium_Diboride| .            |Dirhenium_decacarbonyl|Dirhenium_Decacarbonyl|  is the most common entry to organorhenium chemistry. Its reduction with sodium  |amalgam|Amalgam|  gives Na with rhenium in the formal oxidation state −1.  Dirhenium decacarbonyl can be oxidised with  |bromine|Bromine|  to  |bromopentacarbonylrhenium|Bromopentacarbonylrhenium|    :Re 2 10 + Br 2 → 2 Re 5 Br     Reduction of this pentacarbonyl with  |zinc|Zinc|  and  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid|  gives  |pentacarbonylhydridorhenium|Pentacarbonylhydridorhenium|    :Re 5 Br + Zn + HOAc → Re 5 H + ZnBr      |Methylrhenium_trioxide|Methylrhenium_Trioxide|  , CH 3 ReO 3 is a volatile, colourless solid has been used as a  |catalyst|Catalyst|  in some laboratory experiments. It can be prepared by many routes, a typical method is the reaction of Re 2 O 7 and  |tetramethyltin|Tetramethyltin| |hydrogen_peroxide|Hydrogen_Peroxide| . Terminal  |alkynes|Alkyne|  yield the corresponding acid or ester, internal alkynes yield diketones, and  |alkenes|Alkene|  give epoxides. MTO also catalyses the conversion of  |aldehydes|Aldehyde|  and  |diazoalkanes|Diazoalkane|  into an alkene. Hudson, A. “Methyltrioxorhenium” in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis. John Wiley & Sons: New York, , .          A distinctive derivative of rhenium is  |nonahydridorhenate|Potassium_Nonahydridorhenate| , originally thought to be the rhenide anion, Re − , but actually containing the  anion in which the oxidation state of rhenium is +7.          Rhenium is one of the rarest elements in  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust|  with an average concentration of 1  ppb; other sources quote the number of 0.5  ppb making it the 77th most abundant element in Earths crust.  Rhenium is probably not found free in nature , but occurs in amounts up to 0.2% in the mineral  |molybdenite|Molybdenite|  , the major commercial source, although single molybdenite samples with up to 1.88% have been found.  |Chile|Chile|  has the worlds largest rhenium reserves, part of the copper ore deposits, and was the leading producer as of 2005.  It was only recently that the first rhenium  |mineral|Mineral|  was found and described , a rhenium  |sulfide_mineral|Sulfide_Mineral|  condensing from a  |fumarole|Fumarole|  on  |Kudriavy|Kudriavy|  volcano,  |Iturup|Iturup|  island, in the  |Kuril_Islands|Kuril_Islands| .  Kudriavy discharges up to 20–60  kg rhenium per year mostly in the form of rhenium disulfide.   Named  |rheniite|Rheniite| , this rare mineral commands high prices among collectors.               Commercial rhenium is extracted from molybdenum roaster-flue gas obtained from copper-sulfide ores. Some molybdenum ores contain 0.001% to 0.2% rhenium.   |Rhenium_oxide|Rhenium_Oxide|  and  |perrhenic_acid|Perrhenic_Acid|  readily dissolve in water; they are leached from flue dusts and gasses and extracted by precipitating with  |potassium|Potassium_Chloride|  or  |ammonium_chloride|Ammonium_Chloride|  as the  |perrhenate|Perrhenate|  salts, and purified by  |recrystallization|Recrystallization| . Total world production is between 40 and 50 tons/year; the main producers are in Chile, the United States, Peru, and Poland.  Recycling of used Pt-Re catalyst and special alloys allow the recovery of another 10 tons per year. Prices for the metal rose rapidly in early 2008, from $1000–$2000 per  |kg|Kilogram|  in 2003–2006 to over $10,000 in February 2008.   The metal form is prepared by reducing  |ammonium_perrhenate|Ammonium_Perrhenate|  with  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  at high temperatures:     :2 NH 4 ReO 4 + 7 H 2 → 2 Re + 8 H 2 O + 2 NH 3          Rhenium is added to high-temperature superalloys that are used to make  |jet_engine|Jet_Engine|  parts, using 70% of the worldwide rhenium production.  Another major application is in platinum–rhenium  |catalysts|Catalyst| , which are primarily used in making  |lead|Lead| -free, high-octane  |gasoline|Gasoline| .        The nickel-based  |superalloys|Superalloys|  have improved  |creep_strength|Creep|  with the addition of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium.  Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the  |F_15_and_F_16|Pratt_Whitney_F100| , whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the  |F_22|Pratt_Whitney_F119|  and  |F_35|Pratt_Whitney_F135|  engines.  Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 and CMSX-10 that are used in industrial  |gas_turbine|Gas_Turbine|  engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause  |superalloys|Superalloys|  to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP  |phases|Phase| . In 4th- and 5th-generation  |superalloys|Superalloys| ,  |ruthenium|Ruthenium|  is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new  |superalloys|Superalloys|  are EPM-102 and TMS-162 ,  as well as TMS-138  and TMS-174.            For 2006, the consumption is given as 28% for  |General_Electric|General_Electric| , 28%  |Rolls_Royce_plc|Rolls_Royce_Plc|  and 12%  |Pratt_Whitney|Pratt_Whitney| , all for superalloys, whereas the use for catalysts only accounts for 14% and the remaining applications use 18%. In 2006, 77% of the rhenium consumption in the United States was in alloys. The rising demand for military jet engines and the constant supply made it necessary to develop superalloys with a lower rhenium content. For example, the newer  |CFM_International_CFM56|Cfm_International_Cfm56|  high-pressure turbine blades will use Rene N515 with a rhenium content of 1.5% instead of Rene N5 with 3%.       Rhenium improves the properties of  |tungsten|Tungsten| . Tungsten-rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature, allowing them to be more easily machined. The high-temperature stability is also improved. The effect increases with the rhenium concentration, and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to 27% of Re, which is the solubility limit.  Tungsten-rhenium wire was originally created in efforts to develop a wire that was more ductile after recrystallization. This allows the wire to meet specific performance objectives, including superior vibration resistance, improved ductility, and higher resistivity.  One application for the tungsten-rhenium alloys is  |X_ray|X_Ray|  sources. The high melting point of both elements, together with their high atomic mass, makes them stable against the prolonged electron impact.  Rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as  |thermocouples|Thermocouple|  to measure temperatures up to 2200 ° |C|Celsius| .      The high temperature stability, low vapor pressure, good  |wear_resistance|Wear|  and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning  |electrical_contacts|Switchcontacts| . In particular, the discharge that occurs during electrical switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re 2 O 7 has poor stability and therefore is removed during the discharge.     Rhenium has a high melting point and a low vapor pressure similar to  |tantalum|Tantalum|  and tungsten. Therefore, rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere.  Those filaments are widely used in  |mass_spectrometers|Mass_Spectrometer| , in  |ion_gauges|Ion_Gauge|   and in photoflash lamps in  |photography|Photography| .        Rhenium in the form of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as catalyst for  |catalytic_reforming|Catalytic_Reforming| , which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery  |naphthas|Petroleum_Naphtha|  with low  |octane_ratings|Octane_Rating|  into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium.  The  |olefin_metathesis|Olefin_Metathesis|  is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re 2 O 7 on  |alumina|Alumina|  is used for this process.  Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to  |chemical_poisoning|Catalyst_Poisoning|  from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.         The isotopes 188 Re and 186 Re are radioactive and are used for treatment of  |liver_cancer|Liver_Cancer| . They both have similar penetration depth in tissue , but 186 Re has advantage of longer lifetime .       188 Re is also being used experimentally in a novel treatment of pancreatic cancer where it is delivered by means of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.      Related by  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trends| , rhenium has a similar chemistry to that of  |technetium|Technetium| ; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where it is difficult to work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.        Very little is known about the toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself.  Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an  |LD_50_|Median_Lethal_Dose|  value of 2800  mg/kg after seven days and the rhenium trichloride showed LD 50 of 280  mg/kg.
