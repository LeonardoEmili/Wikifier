        The kidneys are two bean-shaped  |organs|Organ|  found in  |vertebrates|Vertebrate| . They are located on the left and right in the  |retroperitoneal_space|Retroperitoneal_Space| , and in adult humans are about  in length. They receive blood from the paired  |renal_arteries|Renal_Artery| ; blood exits into the paired  |renal_veins|Renal_Vein| . Each kidney is attached to a  |ureter|Ureter| , a tube that carries excreted  |urine|Urine|  to the  |bladder|Urinary_Bladder| .     The  |nephron|Nephron|  is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons. The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various  |body_fluid|Body_Fluid|  compartments, fluid  |osmolality|Osmolality| ,  |acid_base_balance|Acid_Base_Balance| , various  |electrolyte|Electrolyte|  concentrations, and removal of  |toxins|Toxins| . Filtration occurs in the  |glomerulus|Glomerulus| |water|Water| ,  |sodium|Sodium| ,  |bicarbonate|Bicarbonate| ,  |glucose|Glucose| , and  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid| . Examples of substances secreted are  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| ,  |ammonium|Ammonium| ,  |potassium|Potassium|  and  |uric_acid|Uric_Acid| . The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron. For example, they convert a precursor of  |vitamin_D|Vitamin_D|  to its active form,  |calcitriol|Calcitriol| ; and synthesize the  |hormones|Hormone| |_erythropoietin|Erythropoietin|  and  |renin|Renin| .      |Renal_physiology|Renal_Physiology|  is the study of  |kidney_function|Kidney_Function| .  |Nephrology|Nephrology|  is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function |chronic_kidney_disease|Chronic_Kidney_Disease| ,  |nephritic|Nephritic_Syndrome|  and  |nephrotic_syndromes|Nephrotic_Syndrome| ,  |acute_kidney_injury|Acute_Kidney_Injury| , and  |pyelonephritis|Pyelonephritis| .  |Urology|Urology|  addresses diseases of kidney anatomy |cancer|Kidney_Cancer| ,  |renal_cysts|Renal_Cyst| ,  |kidney_stones|Kidney_Stones|  and  |ureteral_stones|Ureteral_Stones| , and  |urinary_tract_obstruction|Urinary_Tract_Obstruction| .      Procedures used in the management of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine , measurement of  |kidney_function|Kidney_Function|  by calculating the estimated  |glomerular_filtration_rate|Glomerular_Filtration_Rate|  using the  |serum_creatinine|Serum_Creatinine| ; and  |kidney_biopsy|Kidney_Biopsy|  and  |CT_scan|Ct_Scan|  to evaluate for abnormal anatomy.  |Dialysis|Dialysis|  and  |kidney_transplantation|Kidney_Transplantation|  are used to treat  |kidney_failure|Kidney_Failure| ; one of these are almost always used when renal function drops below 15%.  |Nephrectomy|Nephrectomy|  is frequently used to cure  |renal_cell_carcinoma|Renal_Cell_Carcinoma| .               In humans, the kidneys are located high in the  |abdominal_cavity|Abdominal_Cavity| , one on each side of the  |spine|Vertebral_Column| , and lie in a  |retroperitoneal|Retroperitoneal|  position at a slightly oblique angle.  The asymmetry within the abdominal cavity, caused by the position of the  |liver|Liver| , typically results in the right kidney being slightly lower and smaller than the left, and being placed slightly more to the middle than the left kidney.     The left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level  |T12|Thoracic_Vertebrae|  to  |L3|Lumbar_Vertebrae| , BÃ¥lens ytanatomy . Anca Dragomir, Mats Hjortberg and Godfried M. Romans. Section for human anatomy at the Department of Medical Biology, Uppsala University, Sweden. and the right is slightly lower. The right kidney sits just below the  |diaphragm|Thoracic_Diaphragm|  and posterior to the  |liver|Liver| . The left sits below the diaphragm and posterior to the  |spleen|Spleen| . On top of each kidney is an  |adrenal_gland|Adrenal_Gland| . The upper parts of the kidneys are partially protected by the 11th and 12th  |ribs|Rib| . Each kidney, with its adrenal gland is surrounded by two layers of fat: the  |perirenal_fat|Adipose_Capsule_Of_Kidney|  present between renal fascia and renal capsule and  |pararenal_fat|Pararenal_Fat|  superior to the  |renal_fascia|Renal_Fascia| .     The kidney is a bean-shaped structure with a  |convex|Wikt_Convex|  and a  |concave|Wikt_Concave|  border. A recessed area on the concave border is the  |renal_hilum|Renal_Hilum| , where the  |renal_artery|Renal_Artery|  enters the kidney and the  |renal_vein|Renal_Vein|  and  |ureter|Ureter|  leave. The kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the  |renal_capsule|Renal_Capsule| , which is itself surrounded by  |perirenal_fat|Adipose_Capsule_Of_Kidney| ,  |renal_fascia|Renal_Fascia| , and  |pararenal_fat|Pararenal_Fat| . The anterior surface of these tissues is the  |peritoneum|Peritoneum| , while the posterior surface is the  |transversalis_fascia|Transversalis_Fascia| .     The superior pole of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver. For the left kidney, it is next to the  |spleen|Spleen| . Both, therefore, move down upon inhalation.        A Danish study measured the median renal length to be  on the left side and  on the right side in adults. Median renal volumes were 146  cm 3 on the left and 134  cm 3 on the right.           The functional substance, or  |parenchyma|Parenchymarenal_Parenchyma| , of the kidney is divided into two major structures: the outer  |renal_cortex|Renal_Cortex|  and the inner  |renal_medulla|Renal_Medulla| . Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped  |renal_lobes|Renal_Lobe| , each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a  |renal_pyramid|Renal_Pyramid| .  Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called  |renal_columns|Renal_Column| .  |Nephrons|Nephron| , the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of a nephron is the  |renal_corpuscle|Renal_Corpuscle| , which is located in the cortex. This is followed by a  |renal_tubule|Renal_Tubule|  that passes from the cortex deep into the medullary pyramids. Part of the renal cortex, a  |medullary_ray|Medullary_Ray|  is a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single  |collecting_duct|Collecting_Duct| .     The tip, or  |papilla|Renal_Papilla| , of each pyramid empties urine into a  |minor_calyx|Minor_Calyx| ; minor calyces empty into  |major_calyces|Major_Calyces| , and major calyces empty into the  |renal_pelvis|Renal_Pelvis| . This becomes the ureter. At the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes surrounds these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the  |renal_sinus|Renal_Sinus| . The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue. Clapp, WL. Renal Anatomy . In: Zhou XJ, Laszik Z, Nadasdy T, DAgati VD, Silva FG, eds. Silvas Diagnostic Renal Pathology  |CT_scan|Ct_Scan|  of the abdomen showing the position of the kidneys. The left cross-section in the uper abdomen shows the  |liver|Liver| |_cadaver|Cadaver|  ic specimen showing the position of the kidneys.            The kidneys receive blood from the  |renal_arteries|Renal_Artery| , left and right, which branch directly from the  |abdominal_aorta|Abdominal_Aorta| . Despite their relatively small size, the kidneys receive approximately 20% of the  |cardiac_output|Cardiac_Output| . Each renal artery branches into segmental arteries, dividing further into  |interlobar_arteries|Interlobar_Arteries| , which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between the renal pyramids. The interlobar arteries then supply blood to the  |arcuate_arteries|Arcuate_Arteries|  that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. Each arcuate artery supplies several  |interlobular|Interlobular|  arteries that feed into the  |afferent_arterioles|Afferent_Arteriole|  that supply the glomeruli.     Blood drains from the kidneys, ultimately into the  |inferior_vena_cava|Inferior_Vena_Cava| . After filtration occurs, the blood moves through a small network of small veins  that converge into interlobular veins. As with the arteriole distribution, the veins follow the same pattern: the interlobular provide blood to the arcuate veins then back to the interlobar veins, which come to form the  |renal_veins|Renal_Vein|  which exiting the kidney .       The kidney and  |nervous_system|Nervous_System|  communicate via the  |renal_plexus|Renal_Plexus| , whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney.  Input from the  |sympathetic_nervous_system|Sympathetic_Nervous_System|  triggers  |vasoconstriction|Vasoconstriction|  in the kidney, thereby reducing  |renal_blood_flow|Renal_Blood_Flow| . The kidney also receives input from the  |parasympathetic_nervous_system|Parasympathetic_Nervous_System| , by way of the renal branches of the  |vagus_nerve|Vagus_Nerve| ; the function of this is yet unclear.  Sensory input from the kidney travels to the T10-11 levels of the  |spinal_cord|Spinal_Cord|  and is sensed in the corresponding  |dermatome|Dermatome| . Thus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.       Renal  |histology|Histology|  is the study of the  |microscopic|Microscopic|  structure of the kidney. Distinct  |cell_types|Cell_Type|  include:   Kidney glomerulus parietal cell    |Kidney_glomerulus_podocyte|Kidney_Glomerulus_Podocyte| |_Kidney_proximal_tubule_brush_border_cell|Kidney_Proximal_Tubule_Brush_Border_Cell| |_Loop_of_Henle_thin_segment_cell|Loop_Of_Henle_Thin_Segment_Cell| |_Thick_ascending_limb|Thick_Ascending_Limb|  cell    |Kidney_distal_tubule_cell|Kidney_Distal_Tubule_Cell| |_Collecting_duct_principal_cell|Collecting_Duct_Systemprincipal_Cell| |_Collecting_duct_intercalated_cell|Collecting_Duct_Systemintercalated_Cell|     About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and almost 70% of these genes are expressed in normal, adult kidneys.   Just over 300 genes are more specifically expressed in the kidney, with only some 50 genes being highly specific for the kidney. Many of the corresponding kidney specific proteins are expressed in the cell membrane and function as transporter proteins. The highest expressed kidney specific protein is  |uromodulin|TammâHorsfall_Protein| , the most abundant protein in urine with functions that prevent calcification and growth of bacteria. Specific proteins are expressed in the different compartments of the kidney with  |podocin|Podocin|  and  |nephrin|Nephrin|  expressed in glomeruli, Solute carrier family protein  |SLC22A8|Slc22A8|  expressed in proximal tubules,  |calbindin|Calbindin|  expressed in distal tubules and  |aquaporin_2|Aquaporin_2|  expressed in the collecting duct cells.             The mammalian kidney develops from  |intermediate_mesoderm|Intermediate_Mesoderm| .  |Kidney_development|Kidney_Development| , also called nephrogenesis, proceeds through a series of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.                The kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by  |metabolism|Metabolism|  into the urine. The microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the  |nephron|Nephron| . It processes the blood supplied to it via filtration, reabsorption, secretion and excretion; the consequence of those processes is the production of  |urine|Urine| . These include the nitrogenous wastes  |urea|Urea| , from protein  |catabolism|Catabolism| , and  |uric_acid|Uric_Acid| , from  |nucleic_acid|Nucleic_Acid|  metabolism. The ability of mammals and some birds to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate  |countercurrent_multiplication|Countercurrent_Multiplication|  mechanism. This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop, and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb. In addition, passive  |countercurrent_exchange|Countercurrent_Exchange|  by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function.     The kidney participates in whole-body  |homeostasis|Homeostasis| , regulating  |acid_base_balance|Acid_Base_Balance| ,  |electrolyte|Electrolyte|  concentrations,  |extracellular_fluid_volume|Extracellular_Fluid_Volume| , and  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure| . The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs, particularly those of the  |endocrine_system|Endocrine_System| . Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include  |renin|Renin| ,  |angiotensin_II|Angiotensin_Ii| ,  |aldosterone|Aldosterone| ,  |antidiuretic_hormone|Antidiuretic_Hormone| , and  |atrial_natriuretic_peptide|Atrial_Natriuretic_Peptide| , among others.            Filtration, which takes place at the  |renal_corpuscle|Renal_Corpuscle| , is the process by which cells and large proteins are retained while materials of smaller molecular weights are Guyton and Hall, Textbook of Medical Physiology, 13th Edition filtered from the blood to make an  |ultrafiltrate|Ultrafiltrate|  that eventually becomes urine. The kidney generates 180 liters of filtrate a day. The process is also known as hydrostatic filtration due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary walls.          Reabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the peritubular capillary. It is accomplished via selective  |receptors|Cell_Surface_Receptor|  on the luminal cell membrane. Water is 55% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism for this is the Na + /glucose cotransporter. A plasma level of 350  mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.     Amino acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule.  |Hartnup_disease|Hartnup_Disease|  is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter, which results in  |pellagra|Pellagra| . Le, Tao. First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2013. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2013. Print.            Secretion is the reverse of reabsorption: molecules are transported from the peritubular capillary through the interstitial fluid, then through the renal tubular cell and into the ultrafiltrate.       The last step in the processing of the ultrafiltrate is excretioncollecting duct, which is part of the  |collecting_duct_system|Collecting_Duct_System| , and then to the ureters where it is renamed urine. In addition to transporting the ultrafiltrate, the collecting duct also takes part in reabsorption.       The kidneys secrete a variety of  |hormones|Hormones| , including  |erythropoietin|Erythropoietin| ,  |calcitriol|Calcitriol| , and  |renin|Renin| .  |Erythropoietin|Erythropoietin|  is released in response to  |hypoxia|Hypoxia|  in the renal circulation. It stimulates  |erythropoiesis|Erythropoiesis|  in the  |bone_marrow|Bone_Marrow| .  |Calcitriol|Calcitriol| , the activated form of  |vitamin_D|Vitamin_D| , promotes intestinal absorption of  |calcium|Calcium|  and the renal  |reabsorption|Reabsorption|  of  |phosphate|Phosphate| . Renin is an  |enzyme|Enzyme|  which regulates  |angiotensin|Angiotensin|  and  |aldosterone|Aldosterone|  levels.            Although the kidney cannot directly sense blood, long-term regulation of  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure|  predominantly depends upon the kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the  |extracellular_fluid|Extracellular_Fluid|  compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma  |sodium|Sodium|  concentration. Renin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make up the  |reninâangiotensin_system|ReninâAngiotensin_System| . Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones  |angiotensin_II|Angiotensin_Ii|  and  |aldosterone|Aldosterone| . Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidneys absorption of  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride| , thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.            Two organ systems, the kidneys and lungs, maintain acid-base homeostasis, which is the maintenance of  |pH|Ph|  around a relatively stable value. The lungs contribute to acid-base homeostasis by regulating  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  concentration. The kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acid-base balance: to reabsorb and regenerate bicarbonate from urine, and to excrete  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  ions and fixed acids into urine.       The kidneys help maintain the water and salt level of the body. Any significant rise in  |plasma_osmolality|Plasma_Osmolality|  is detected by the  |hypothalamus|Hypothalamus| , which communicates directly with the  |posterior_pituitary_gland|Posterior_Pituitary_Gland| . An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete  |antidiuretic_hormone|Antidiuretic_Hormone|  , resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.          Various calculations and methods are used to try to measure kidney function.  |Renal_clearance|Renal_Clearance|  is the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time. The  |filtration_fraction|Filtration_Fraction|  is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through the kidney. This can be defined using the equation. The kidney is a very complex organ and  |mathematical_model|Mathematical_Model| ling has been used to better understand kidney function at several scales, including fluid uptake and secretion.             |Nephrology|Nephrology|  is the subspeciality under  |Internal_Medicine|Internal_Medicine|  that deals with kidney function and disease states related to renal malfunction and their management including  |dialysis|Dialysis|  and kidney  |transplantation|Organ_Transplantation| .  |Urology|Urology|  is the specialty under  |Surgery|Surgery|  that deals with kidney structure abnormalities such as kidney  |cancer|Cancer|  and  |cysts|Cysts|  and problems with  |urinary_tract|Urinary_Tract| .  |Nephrologists|Nephrologists|  are  |internists|Internists| , and  |urologists|Urologists|  are  |surgeons|Surgeons| , whereas both are often called kidney doctors . There are overlapping areas that both  |nephrologists|Nephrologists|  and  |urologists|Urologists|  can provide care such as  |kidney_stones|Kidney_Stones|  and kidney related  |infections|Infections| .     There are many causes of  |kidney_disease|Kidney_Disease| . Some causes are acquired over the course of life, such as  |diabetic_nephropathy|Diabetic_Nephropathy|  whereas others are  |congenital|Congenital| , such as  |polycystic_kidney_disease|Polycystic_Kidney_Disease| .     Medical terms related to the kidneys commonly use terms such as renal and the prefix nephro-. The  |adjective|Adjective|  renal, meaning related to the kidney, is from the  |Latin|Latin_Language|  rÄnÄs, meaning kidneys; the prefix nephro- is from the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  word for kidney, nephros .  For example, surgical removal of the kidney is a  nephrectomy , while a reduction in kidney function is called renal dysfunction.          |Diabetic_nephropathy|Diabetic_Nephropathy| |_Glomerulonephritis|Glomerulonephritis| |_Hydronephrosis|Hydronephrosis|  is the enlargement of one or both of the kidneys caused by obstruction of the flow of urine.    |Interstitial_nephritis|Interstitial_Nephritis| |Kidney_stones|Kidney_Stone|  are a relatively common and particularly painful disorder. A chronic condition can result in scars to the kidneys. The removal of kidney stones involves  |ultrasound|Ultrasound|  treatment to break up the stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract. One common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp to disabling pain in the middle and sides of the lower back or groin.    |Kidney_tumour|Kidney_Tumour| |_Wilms_tumor|Wilms_Tumor| |_Renal_cell_carcinoma|Renal_Cell_Carcinoma| |_Lupus_nephritis|Lupus_Nephritis| |_Minimal_change_disease|Minimal_Change_Disease| |_nephrotic_syndrome|Nephrotic_Syndrome| , the  |glomerulus|Glomerulus|  has been damaged so that a large amount of  |protein|Protein|  in the blood enters the  |urine|Urine| . Other frequent features of the nephrotic syndrome include swelling, low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.    |Pyelonephritis|Pyelonephritis|  is infection of the kidneys and is frequently caused by complication of a  |urinary_tract_infection|Urinary_Tract_Infection| .    |Kidney_failure|Kidney_Failure| |_Acute_kidney_failure|Acute_Kidney_Failure| |_Stage_5_Chronic_Kidney_Disease|Chronic_Kidney_Disease| |_Renal_artery_stenosis|Renal_Artery_Stenosis| |_Renovascular_hypertension|Renovascular_Hypertension|             Generally, humans can live normally with just one kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue than is needed to survive. Only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished does one develop  |chronic_kidney_disease|Chronic_Kidney_Disease| .  |Renal_replacement_therapy|Renal_Replacement_Therapy| , in the form of  |dialysis|Dialysis|  or  |kidney_transplantation|Kidney_Transplantation| , is indicated when the  |glomerular_filtration_rate|Glomerular_Filtration_Rate|  has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms.             Dialysis is a treatment that substitutes for the function of normal kidneys. Dialysis may be instituted when approximately 85%-90% of kidney function is lost, as indicated by a glomerular filtration rate of less than 15. Dialysis removes metabolic waste products as well as excess water and sodium ; and maintains many chemical levels within the body. Life expectancy is 5â10 years for those on dialysis; some live up to 30 years. Dialysis can occur via the blood , or through the  |peritoneum|Peritoneum|   Dialysis is typically administered three times a week for several hours at free-standing dialysis centers, allowing recipients to lead an otherwise essentially normal life.        Congenital  |hydronephrosis|Hydronephrosis| |_Duplicated_ureter|Duplicated_Ureter|  occurs in approximately one in 100 live births    |Horseshoe_kidney|Horseshoe_Kidney|  occurs in approximately one in 400 live births    |Nephroblastoma|Nephroblastoma| |_Nutcracker_syndrome|Nutcracker_Syndrome| |_Polycystic_kidney_disease|Polycystic_Kidney_Disease| |_Autosomal_dominant_polycystic_kidney_disease|Autosomal_Dominant_Polycystic_Kidney_Disease|  afflicts patients later in life. Approximately one in 1000 people will develop this condition    |Autosomal_recessive_polycystic_kidney_disease|Autosomal_Recessive_Polycystic_Kidney_Disease|  is far less common, but more severe, than the dominant condition. It is apparent in utero or at birth.    |Renal_agenesis|Renal_Agenesis| . Failure of one kidney to form occurs in approximately one in 750 live births. Failure of both kidneys to form used to be fatal; however, medical advances such as amnioinfusion therapy during pregnancy and peritoneal dialysis have made it possible to stay alive until a transplant can occur.    |Renal_dysplasia|Renal_Dysplasia| |_Multicystic_dysplastic_kidney|Multicystic_Dysplastic_Kidney|  occurs in approximately one in every 2400 live births   Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction or UPJO; although most cases are congenital, some are acquired.        Many renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of a detailed  |medical_history|Medical_History| , and  |physical_examination|Physical_Examination| . The medical history takes into account present and past symptoms, especially those of kidney disease; recent infections; exposure to substances toxic to the kidney; and family history of kidney disease.      |Kidney_function|Renal_Function|  is tested for using  |blood_tests|Blood_Test|  and  |urine_tests|Clinical_Urine_Tests| . A usual blood test is for  |urea|Urea|  and  |electrolytes|Electrolyte| , known as a U and E.  |Creatinine|Creatinine|  is also tested for. Urine tests such as  |urinalysis|Clinical_Urine_Tests|  can evaluate for pH, protein, glucose, and the presence of blood. Microscopic analysis can also identify the presence of  |urinary_casts|Urinary_Cast|  and crystals. The  |glomerular_filtration_rate|Glomerular_Filtration_Rate|  can be calculated.         |Renal_ultrasonography|Renal_Ultrasonography|  is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. Content initially copied from:   Other modalities, such as  |CT|Ct_Scan|  and  |MRI|Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging| , should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities in the assessment of renal disease.       The role of the renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means . In general, a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A renal  |pathologist|Pathologist|  is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens.     Ideally, multiple core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy intraoperatively. A pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen for submission for light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy.     The pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques on multiple level sections. Multiple immunofluorescence stains are performed to evaluate for antibody, protein and complement deposition. Finally, ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patients renal disease.         In the majority of vertebrates, the  |mesonephros|Mesonephros|  persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced  |metanephros|Metanephros| ; only in  |amniotes|Amniote|  is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of  |fish|Fish|  and  |amphibians|Amphibian|  are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is  |homologous|Homology|  with the  |vas_deferens|Vas_Deferens|  of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in  |cartilaginous_fish|Cartilaginous_Fish|  and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the  |bladder|Bladder|  or  |cloaca|Cloaca| . Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.     In the most primitive vertebrates, the  |hagfish|Hagfish|  and  |lampreys|Lamprey| , the kidney is unusually simple: it consists of a row of nephrons, each emptying directly into the archinephric duct. Invertebrates may possess excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as kidneys , but, even in  Amphioxus , these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately referred to by other names, such as  |nephridia|Nephridia| . In  |amphibians|Amphibian| , kidneys and the  |urinary_bladder|Urinary_Bladder|  harbour specialized  |parasites|Parasite| ,  |monogenea|Monogenea| ns of the family Polystomatidae.      The kidneys of  |reptiles|Reptile|  consist of a number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern. Each lobule contains a single branch of the ureter in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. Reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly because of their lower  |metabolic_rate|Metabolic_Rate| .       |Birds|Bird|  have relatively large, elongated kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes. The lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred on a branch of the ureter. Birds have small glomeruli, but about twice as many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.     The human kidney is fairly typical of that of  |mammals|Mammal| . Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney, in comparison with that of other vertebrates, include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids and a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla. The latter feature is due to the presence of elongated  |loops_of_Henle|Loop_Of_Henle| ; these are much shorter in birds, and not truly present in other vertebrates . It is only in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical kidney shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed  |reniculate_kidneys|Reniculate_Kidney|  of  |pinnipeds|Pinniped|  and  |cetacea|Cetacea| ns.       Kidneys of various animals show evidence of evolutionary  |adaptation|Adaptation|  and have long been studied in  |ecophysiology|Ecophysiology|  and  |comparative_physiology|Comparative_Physiology| . Kidney morphology, often indexed as the relative medullary thickness, is associated with habitat  |aridity|Aridity|  among species of mammals  and diet .               In  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| , the kidneys, like the heart, were left inside the mummified bodies, unlike other organs which were removed. Comparing this to the biblical statements, and to drawings of human body with the heart and two kidneys portraying a set of scales for weighing justice, it seems that the Egyptian beliefs had also connected the kidneys with judgement and perhaps with moral decisions.        According to studies in modern and ancient Hebrew, various body organs in humans and animals served also an emotional or logical role, today mostly attributed to the  |brain|Brain|  and the  |endocrine_system|Endocrine_System| . The kidney is mentioned in several biblical verses in conjunction with the heart, much as the  |bowels|Bowels|  were understood to be the seat of emotion â grief, joy and pain.  Similarly, the  |Talmud|Talmud|   states that one of the two kidneys counsels what is good, and the other evil.     In the sacrifices offered at the biblical  |Tabernacle|Tabernacle|  and later on at the temple in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| , the priests were instructed Leviticus 3: 4, 10 and 15 to remove the kidneys and the adrenal gland covering the kidneys of the sheep, goat and cattle offerings, and to burn them on the altar, as the holy part of the offering for God never to be eaten. ie Deut 3:4,9,10,15... or the Babylonian Talmud, Bechorot Ch6:Tr2...       In ancient India, according to the  |Ayurvedic_medical_systems|Ayurveda| , the kidneys were considered the beginning of the excursion channels system, the head of the Mutra Srotas, receiving from all other systems, and therefore important in determining a persons health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three Doshas â the three health elements: Vatha â air, Pitta â  |bile|Bile| , and Kapha â  |mucus|Mucus| . The temperament and health of a person can then be seen in the resulting color of the urine.      Modern Ayurveda practitioners, a practice which is characterized as pseudoscience,  |List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience|List_Of_Topics_Characterized_As_Pseudoscience| , according to the  |American_Medical_Associations|American_Medical_Association|  Report 12 of the Council of Scientific Affairs and  have attempted to revive these methods in medical procedures as part of Ayurveda  |Urine_therapy|Urine_Therapy| .  These procedures have been called nonsensical by skeptics.

The Latin term renes is related to the English word reins , a synonym for the kidneys in  |Shakespearean_English|Shakespearean_English|  , which was also the time when the  |King_James_Version|King_James_Version|  of the  |Bible|Bible|  was translated.

The kidneys, like other  |offal|Offal| , can be  |cooked|Cooking|  and eaten.     Kidneys are usually grilled or sautÃ©ed, but in more complex dishes they are stewed with a sauce that will improve their flavor. In many preparations, kidneys are combined with pieces of meat or liver, as in  |mixed_grill|Mixed_Grill| .
