                 Oceania  is a geographic region that includes  |Australasia|Australasia| ,  |Melanesia|Melanesia| ,  |Micronesia|Micronesia|  and  |Polynesia|Polynesia| . Spanning the  |eastern|Eastern_Hemisphere|  and  |western_hemispheres|Western_Hemisphere| , Oceania has a land area of  and a population of  million. Situated in the southeast of the  |Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific|  region, Oceania, when compared to continental regions, is the smallest in  |land_area|Land_Area|  and the second  |smallest_in_population|List_Of_Continents_By_Population|  after  |Antarctica|Antarctica| .     Definitions of Oceania vary; however, the islands at the geographic extremes of Oceania are generally considered to be the  |Bonin_Islands|Bonin_Islands| , a politically integral part of  |Japan|Japan| ;  |Hawaii|Hawaii| , a state of the  |United_States|United_States| ;  |Clipperton_Island|Clipperton_Island| , a possession of  |France|France| ; the  |Juan_Fernández_Islands|Juan_Fernández_Islands| , belonging to  |Chile|Chile| ; and  |Macquarie_Island|Macquarie_Island| , belonging to  |Australia|Australia| .   Oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the  |highly_developed|Developed_Countries|  and globally competitive  |financial_markets|Market_Economy|  of Australia and  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| , which rank high in  |quality_of_life|Quality_Of_Life|  and  |human_development_index|Human_Development_Index| , to the much  |less_developed_economies|Least_Developed_Countries|  that belong to countries such as  |Kiribati|Kiribati|  and  |Tuvalu|Tuvalu| , while also including  |medium-sized_economies|Developing_Country|  of  |Pacific|Pacific_Ocean|  islands such as  |Palau|Palau| ,  |Fiji|Fiji|  and  |Tonga|Tonga| . The largest and most populous  |country_in_Oceania|List_Of_Sovereign_States_And_Dependent_Territories_In_Oceania|  is Australia, with  |Sydney|Sydney|  being the largest city of both Oceania and Australia.     In the 1950s, present-day  |Indonesia|Indonesia|   and the  |Philippines|Philippines|  were removed from Oceania and added to Asia; this resulted in Oceania as a great division of the world being replaced by the concept of the  |continent_of_Australia|Australia| .  in the sense of one of the parts of the world , and the concept of Australia as a continent does not exist.      The first settlers of Australia, New Guinea, and the large islands just to the east arrived more than 60,000 years ago. Oceania was  |first_explored_by_Europeans|Exploration_Of_The_Pacific|  from the 16th century onward.  |Portuguese_navigators|Portuguese_Navigators| , between 1512 and 1526, reached the  |Tanimbar_Islands|Tanimbar_Islands| , some of the  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands|  and west  |Papua_New_Guinea|Papua_New_Guinea| . On his first voyage in the 18th century,  |James_Cook|James_Cook| , who later arrived at the highly developed  |Hawaiian_Islands|Hawaiian_Islands| , went to  |Tahiti|Tahiti|  and followed the  |east_coast_of_Australia|Eastern_Australia|  for the first time. The  |Pacific_front|Military_History_Of_Oceaniaworld_War_Ii|  saw major action during the  |Second_World_War|World_War_Ii| , mainly between  |Allied_powers|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  the  |United_States|United_States_Home_Front_During_World_War_Ii|  and  |Australia|Australia_In_World_War_Ii| , and  |Axis_power|Axis_Powers| |Japan|Empire_Of_Japan| .     The  |arrival_of_European_settlers|Europeans_In_Oceania|  in subsequent centuries resulted in a significant alteration in the social and political landscape of Oceania. In more contemporary times there has been increasing discussion on  |national_flags|Flags_Of_Oceania|  and a desire by some Oceanians to display their distinguishable and   individualistic  |identity|National_Identity| . The  |rock_art|Rock_Art|  of  |Australian_Aborigines|Aboriginal_Australians|  is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world.  |Puncak_Jaya|Puncak_Jaya|  in Papua is the highest peak in Oceania at 4,884 metres. Most Oceanian countries have a  |parliamentary|Parliamentary_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| , with  |tourism|Tourism|  being a large source of income for the  |Pacific_Islands|Pacific_Islands|  nations.          The geographer  |Conrad_Malte-Brun|Conrad_Malte-Brun|  coined the  |French|French_Language|  term Océanie  1812. Océanie derives from the  |Latin|Latin_Language|  word , and this from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  word  , ocean . The term Oceania is used because, unlike the other continental groupings, it is the ocean that links the parts of the region together.  Oceania serves as a synonym for the  |Australasian_ecozone|Australasian_Ecozone|  and the Pacific ecozone , with New Zealand forming the south-western corner of the  |Polynesian_Triangle|Polynesian_Triangle| . Note that New Zealand may also be considered part of Australasia, despite forming a part of Polynesia.   As an  |ecozone|Ecozone| ,  |Oceania|Oceania_Ecozone|  includes all of  |Micronesia|Micronesia| ,  |Fiji|Fiji| , and all of Polynesia except New Zealand. New Zealand, along with  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea|  and nearby islands, part of the  |Philippine_islands|Philippines| ,  |Australia|Australia| ,  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands| ,  |Vanuatu|Vanuatu| , and  |New_Caledonia|New_Caledonia| , constitute the separate  |Australasian_ecozone|Australasian_Ecozone| .   In the geopolitical conception used by the  |United_Nations|United_Nations_Geoscheme| , by the  |International_Olympic_Committee|International_Olympic_Committee| , and by many atlases, Oceania includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not  |Indonesian_New_Guinea|Indonesian_New_Guinea| .                     |Indigenous_Australians|Indigenous_Australians|  are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands who migrated from Africa to Asia around 70,000 years ago and arrived in Australia around 50,000 years ago. They are believed to be among the  |earliest_human_migrations_out_of_Africa|Recent_African_Origin_Of_Modern_Humans| . Although they likely migrated to Australia through Southeast Asia they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or Polynesian population. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modern-day  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea|  and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and  |intermarriage|Interracial_Marriage| .     They reached  |Tasmania|Tasmania|  approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a  |land_bridge|Land_Bridge|  from the mainland that existed during the last  |ice_age|Ice_Age| . It is believed that the first  |early_human_migration|Early_Human_Migration|  to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the  |Sahul_continent|Sahul_Continent| , connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge. The  |Torres_Strait_Islanders|Torres_Strait_Islanders|  are indigenous to the  |Torres_Strait|Torres_Strait|  Islands, which are at the northernmost tip of Queensland near  |Papua_New_Guinea|Papua_New_Guinea| . The earliest definite human remains found in Australia are that of  |Mungo_Man|Mungo_Man| , which have been dated at about 40,000 years old.             The original inhabitants of the group of islands now named Melanesia were likely the ancestors of the present-day  |Papuan|Papuan_Languages| -speaking people. Migrating from South-East Asia, they appear to have occupied these islands as far east as the main islands in the  |Solomon_Islands_archipelago|Solomon_Islands| , including  |Makira|Makira|  and possibly the smaller islands farther to the east.     Particularly along the north coast of New Guinea and in the islands north and east of New Guinea, the  |Austronesian_people|Austronesian_People| , who had migrated into the area somewhat more than 3,000 years ago, came into contact with these pre-existing populations of Papuan-speaking peoples. In the late 20th century, some scholars theorized a long period of interaction, which resulted in many complex changes in genetics, languages, and culture among the peoples.                Micronesia began to be settled several millennia ago, although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers. There are numerous difficulties with conducting archaeological excavations in the islands, due to their size, settlement patterns and storm damage. As a result, much evidence is based on linguistic analysis.     The earliest archaeological traces of civilization have been found on the island of  |Saipan|Saipan| , dated to 1500 BC or slightly before. The ancestors of the Micronesians settled there over 4,000 years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on  |Yap|Yap|  and  |Pohnpei|Pohnpei| . The prehistories of many Micronesian islands such as Yap are not known very well.     The first people of the Northern Mariana Islands navigated to the islands and discovered it at some period between 4000 BC to 2000 BC from  |South-East_Asia|South-East_Asia| . They became known as the  |Chamorros|Chamorro_People| . Their  |language|Chamorro_Language|  was named after them. The ancient Chamorro left a number of megalithic ruins, including  |Latte_stone|Latte_Stone| . The Refaluwasch, or Carolinian, people came to the Marianas in the 1800s from the  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands| . Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands during the  |2nd_millennium_BC|2Nd_Millennium_Bc| , with inter-island navigation made possible using  |traditional_stick_charts|Marshall_Islands_Stick_Chart| .       Polynesians are the greatest navigators and voyagers to ever live. They discovered all the islands in Polynesia, from Samoa, to Hawaii, to Rapa Nui and down to Aotearoa New Zealand.            The Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic, archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea-migrating  |Austronesian_people|Austronesian_People|  and tracing  |Polynesian_languages|Polynesian_Languages|  places their  |prehistoric|Prehistory|  origins in the  |Malay_Archipelago|Malay_Archipelago| , and ultimately, in  |Taiwan|Geography_Of_Taiwan| . Between about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of  |Austronesian_languages|Austronesian_Languages|  began spreading from Taiwan into  |Island_South-East_Asia|Island_Southeast_Asia| , as tribes whose  |natives|Taiwanese_Aborigines|  were thought to have arrived through South China about 8,000 years ago to the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia.     In the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty. It is thought that by roughly 1400 BC,  |Lapita|Lapita|  Peoples , so-named after their pottery tradition, appeared in the  |Bismarck_Archipelago|Bismarck_Archipelago|  of north-west Melanesia.     Easter Islanders claimed that a chief  |Hotu_Matua|Hotu_Matua|  discovered the island in one or two large canoes with his wife and extended family. They are believed to have been  |Polynesian|Polynesians| . Around 1200,  |Tahitian|Tahitian_People|  explorers discovered and began settling the area. This date range is based on  |glottochronological|Glottochronology|  calculations and on three  |radiocarbon_dates|Radiocarbon_Dating|  from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities. Moreover, a recent study which included radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material suggests that the island was discovered and settled as recently as 1200.             From 1527 to 1595 a number of other large Spanish expeditions crossed the Pacific Ocean, leading to the arrival in  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  and  |Palau|Palau|  in the North Pacific, as well as  |Tuvalu|Tuvalu| , the  |Marquesas|Marquesas_Islands| , the  |Solomon_Islands_archipelago|Solomon_Islands| , the  |Cook_Islands|Cook_Islands|  and the  |Admiralty_Islands|Admiralty_Islands|  in the South Pacific.     In the quest for  |Terra_Australis|Terra_Australis| , Spanish explorations in the 17th century, such as the expedition led by the Portuguese navigator  |Pedro_Fernandes_de_Queirós|Pedro_Fernandes_De_Queirós| , sailed to  |Pitcairn|Pitcairn_Islands|  and  |Vanuatu|Vanuatu|  archipelagos, and sailed the  |Torres_Strait|Torres_Strait|  between Australia and New Guinea, named after navigator  |Luís_Vaz_de_Torres|Luís_Vaz_De_Torres| .  |Willem_Janszoon|Willem_Janszoon| , made the first completely documented European landing in Australia , in  |Cape_York_Peninsula|Cape_York_Peninsula| .  |Abel_Janszoon_Tasman|Abel_Tasman|  circumnavigated and landed on parts of the Australian continental coast and discovered  |Van_Diemens_Land|Van_Diemens_Land|  , New Zealand in 1642, and  |Fiji|Fiji|  islands. He was the first known European explorer to reach these islands.     On 23 April 1770 British explorer  |James_Cook|James_Cook|  made his first recorded direct observation of  |indigenous_Australians|Indigenous_Australians|  at  |Brush_Island|Brush_Island|  near  |Bawley_Point|Bawley_Point,_New_South_Wales| . On 29 April, Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the  |Kurnell_Peninsula|Silver_Beach| . It is here that James Cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the  |Gweagal|Gweagal| . His expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline of Australia.             In 1789 the  |Mutiny_on_the_Bounty|Mutiny_On_The_Bounty|  against  |William_Bligh|William_Bligh|  led to several of the mutineers escaping the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  and settling on  |Pitcairn_Islands|Pitcairn_Islands| , which later became a British colony. Britain also established colonies in Australia in 1788, New Zealand in 1840 and  |Fiji|Colonial_Fiji|  in 1872, with much of Oceania becoming part of the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| . The  |Gilbert_Islands|Gilbert_Islands|   and the Ellice Islands  came under Britains sphere of influence in the late 19th century.     French Catholic missionaries arrived on Tahiti in 1834; their expulsion in 1836 caused France to send a gunboat in 1838. In 1842, Tahiti and  |Tahuata|Tahuata|  were declared a  |French_protectorate|Protectorate| , to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. The capital of  |Papeetē|Papeete|  was founded in 1843. On 24 September 1853, under orders from  |Napoleon_III|Napoleon_Iii| , Admiral  |Febvrier_Despointes|Auguste_Febvrier_Despointes|  took formal possession of New Caledonia and  |Port-de-France|Port-De-France|  was founded 25 June 1854.     The Spanish explorer  |Alonso_de_Salazar|Alonso_De_Salazar|  landed in the Marshall Islands in 1529. They were named by  |Krusenstern|Adam_Johann_Von_Krusenstern| , after English  |explorer|Explorer| |John_Marshall|John_Marshall| , who visited them together with  |Thomas_Gilbert|Thomas_Gilbert|  in 1788, en route from  |Botany_Bay|Botany_Bay|  to  |Canton|Guangzhou|  . In 1905 the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over south-east New Guinea to Australia ; and in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. The Marshall Islands were claimed by Spain in 1874. Germany established colonies in New Guinea in 1884, and  |Samoa|German_Samoa|  in 1900. The United States also expanded into the Pacific, beginning with  |Baker_Island|Baker_Island|  and  |Howland_Island|Howland_Island|  in 1857, and with Hawaii becoming a  |U.S._territory|Territory_Of_Hawaii|  in 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the  |Tripartite_Convention_of_1899|Tripartite_Convention| .             One of the first land offensives in Oceania was the  |Occupation_of_German_Samoa|Occupation_Of_German_Samoa|  in August 1914 by  |New_Zealand_forces|New_Zealand_Defence_Force| . The campaign to take Samoa ended without bloodshed after over 1,000 New Zealanders landed on the German colony. Australian forces attacked  |German_New_Guinea|German_New_Guinea|  in September 1914. A company of Australians and a British warship besieged the Germans and their colonial subjects, ending with a German surrender.     The  |attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor|  by the Japanese  |Imperial_General_Headquarters|Imperial_General_Headquarters| , was a surprise  |military_strike|Military_Strike|  conducted by the  |Imperial_Japanese_Navy|Imperial_Japanese_Navy|  against the United States  |naval_base|Naval_Base|  at  |Pearl_Harbor|Pearl_Harbor| ,  |Hawaii|Hawaii| , on the morning of 7 December 1941. The attack led to the  |United_States_entry_into_World_War_II|Military_History_Of_The_United_States_During_World_War_Ii| . The Japanese subsequently invaded New Guinea, Solomon Islands and other Pacific islands. The Japanese were turned back at the  |Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea|Battle_Of_The_Coral_Sea|  and the  |Kokoda_Track_campaign|Kokoda_Track_Campaign|  before they were finally defeated in 1945. Some of the most prominent Oceanic battlegrounds were the  |Battle_of_Bita_Paka|Battle_Of_Bita_Paka| , the  |Solomon_Islands_campaign|Solomon_Islands_Campaign| , the  |Air_raids_on_Darwin|Bombing_Of_Darwin| , the  |Kokada_Track|Kokoda_Track_Campaign| , and the  |Borneo_campaign|Borneo_Campaign| . The United States fought the  |Battle_of_Guam|Battle_Of_Guam|  from July 21 to August 10, 1944, to recapture the island from  |Japanese_military|Japanese_Military|  occupation.     Australia and New Zealand became  |dominions|British_Dominions|  in the 20th century, adopting the  |Statute_of_Westminster_Act|Statute_Of_Westminster_1931|  in 1942 and 1947 respectively. In 1946, Polynesians were granted French citizenship and the islands status was changed to an  |overseas_territory|Overseas_Administrative_Territorial_Entity| ; the islands name was changed in 1957 to Polynésie Française . Hawaii became a  |U.S._state|U.S._State|  in 1959.  |Fiji|Fiji|  and  |Tonga|Tonga|  became independent in 1970. On 1 May 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands| , the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the  |Republic_of_the_Marshall_Islands|Republic_Of_The_Marshall_Islands| . The South Pacific Forum was founded in 1971, which became the  |Pacific_Islands_Forum|Pacific_Islands_Forum|  in 2000.                     Oceania was originally conceived as the lands of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from the  |Strait_of_Malacca|Strait_Of_Malacca|  to the coast of the Americas. It comprised four regions:  Polynesia ,  Micronesia , Malaysia , and  Melanesia . Today, parts of three geological continents are included in the term Oceania : Eurasia, Australia, and  |Zealandia|Zealandia| , as well the non-continental volcanic islands of the  |Philippines|Philippines| ,  |Wallacea|Wallacea| , and the open Pacific.     Oceania extends to New Guinea in the west, the  |Bonin_Islands|Bonin_Islands|  in the northwest, the  |Hawaiian_Islands|Hawaiian_Islands|  in the northeast,  |Rapa_Nui|Easter_Island|  and  |Sala_y_Gómez_Island|Isla_Salas_Y_Gómez|  in the east, and  |Macquarie_Island|Macquarie_Island|  in the south. Not included are the Pacific islands of  |Taiwan|Taiwan| , the  |Ryukyu_Islands|Ryukyu_Islands| , the  |Japanese_archipelago|Japanese_Archipelago| , and the  |Maluku_Islands|Maluku_Islands| , all on the margins of Asia, and the  |Aleutian_Islands|Aleutian_Islands|  of North America. In its periphery, Oceania sprawls  |28_degrees_north|28Th_Parallel_North|  to the Bonin Islands in the  |northern_hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| , and  |55_degrees_south|55Th_Parallel_South|  to Macquarie Island in the  |southern_hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere| .     Oceanian islands are of four basic types: continental islands,  |high_islands|High_Island| ,  |coral_reefs|Coral_Reef|  and uplifted  |coral_platforms|Coral_Island| . High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. Among these are  |Bougainville|Bougainville_Island| , Hawaii, and Solomon Islands.     Oceania is one of eight terrestrial  |ecozones|Ecozone| , which constitute the major ecological regions of the planet. Related to these concepts are  |Near_Oceania|Near_Oceania| , that part of western  |Island_Melanesia|Island_Melanesia|  which has been inhabited for tens of millennia, and  |Remote_Oceania|Remote_Oceania|  which is more recently settled. Although the majority of the Oceanian islands lie in the South Pacific, a few of them are not restricted to the Pacific Ocean –  |Kangaroo_Island|Kangaroo_Island|  and  |Ashmore_and_Cartier_Islands|Ashmore_And_Cartier_Islands| , for instance, are situated in the  |Southern_Ocean|Southern_Ocean|  and  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| , respectively, and  |Tasmanias_west_coast|West_Coast,_Tasmania|  faces the Southern Ocean.   The coral reefs of the South Pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the oceans surface. One of the most dramatic is the  |Great_Barrier_Reef|Great_Barrier_Reef|  off northeastern Australia with chains of reef patches. A second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform, which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands. Examples include  |Banaba|Banaba_Island|  and  |Makatea|Makatea|  in the Tuamotu group of  |French_Polynesia|French_Polynesia| .                |Micronesia|Micronesia| , which lies north of the equator and west of the  |International_Date_Line|International_Date_Line| , includes the  |Mariana_Islands|Mariana_Islands|  in the northwest, the  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands|  in the center, the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  to the west and the islands of  |Kiribati|Kiribati|  in the southeast.      |Melanesia|Melanesia| , to the southwest, includes  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea| , the worlds second largest island after  |Greenland|Greenland|  and by far the largest of the Pacific islands. The other main Melanesian groups from north to south are the  |Bismarck_Archipelago|Bismarck_Archipelago| , the  |Solomon_Islands_archipelago|Solomon_Islands| ,  |Santa_Cruz|Santa_Cruz_Islands| ,  |Vanuatu|Vanuatu| ,  |Fiji|Fiji|  and  |New_Caledonia|New_Caledonia| .      |Polynesia|Polynesia| , stretching from Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the south, also encompasses  |Tuvalu|Tuvalu| ,  |Tokelau|Tokelau| ,  |Samoa|Samoa| ,  |Tonga|Tonga|  and the  |Kermadec_Islands|Kermadec_Islands|  to the west, the  |Cook_Islands|Cook_Islands| ,  |Society_Islands|Society_Islands|  and  |Austral_Islands|Austral_Islands|  in the center, and the  |Marquesas_Islands|Marquesas_Islands| ,  |Tuamotu|Tuamotus| ,  |Mangareva_Islands|Mangareva_Islands| , and  |Easter_Island|Easter_Island|  to the east.      |Australasia|Australasia|  comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea| , and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Most of Australasia lies on the southern portion of the  |Indo-Australian_Plate|Indo-Australian_Plate| , flanked by the Indian Ocean to the west and the  |Southern_Ocean|Southern_Ocean|  to the south. The bulk of Australasia sits on the  |Indo-Australian_Plate|Indo-Australian_Plate| , together with India.             The  |Pacific_Plate|Pacific_Plate| , which makes up most of Oceania, is an oceanic  |tectonic_plate|Plate_Tectonics|  that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At , it is the largest tectonic plate. The plate contains an interior  |hot_spot|Hotspot|  forming the  |Hawaiian_Islands|Hawaiian_Islands| . It is almost entirely  |oceanic_crust|Oceanic_Crust| . The oldest member disappearing by way of the  |plate_tectonics|Plate_Tectonics|  cycle is early- |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  .     Australia, being part of the  |Indo-Australian_plate|Indo-Australian_Plate| , is the lowest, flattest, and oldest landmass on Earth and it has had a relatively stable geological history. Geological forces such as  |tectonic_uplift|Tectonic_Uplift|  of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australias early history, when it was still a part of  |Gondwana|Gondwana| . Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism.   The  |geology|Geology|  of New Zealand is noted for its  |volcanic|Volcanic|  activity,  |earthquakes|Earthquake|  and  |geothermal|Geothermal| |areas|Geothermal_Areas_In_New_Zealand|  because of its position on the boundary of the  |Australian_Plate|Australian_Plate|  and Pacific Plates. Much of the basement rock of New Zealand was once part of the super-continent of Gondwana, along with South America, Africa,  |Madagascar|Madagascar| , India, Antarctica and Australia. The rocks that now form the continent of  |Zealandia|Zealandia|  were nestled between Eastern Australia and  |Western_Antarctica|Western_Antarctica| .     The Australia-New Zealand continental fragment of Gondwana split from the rest of Gondwana in the  |late_Cretaceous|Late_Cretaceous|  time . By 75 Ma, Zealandia was essentially separate from Australia and Antarctica, although only shallow seas might have separated Zealandia and Australia in the north. The  |Tasman_Sea|Tasman_Sea| , and part of Zealandia then locked together with Australia to form the  |Australian_Plate|Australian_Plate|  , and a new plate boundary was created between the Australian Plate and Pacific Plate.     Most islands in the Pacific are  |high_islands|High_Islands|  , such as,  |Easter_Island|Easter_Island| ,  |American_Samoa|American_Samoa|  and  |Fiji|Fiji| , among others, having peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore. The  |Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands|Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands|  were formed approximately 7 to 30 million years ago, as  |shield_volcano|Shield_Volcano| es over the same volcanic  |hotspot|Hotspot|  that formed the  |Emperor_Seamounts|Emperor_Seamounts|  to the north and the Main Hawaiian Islands to the south. Hawaiis tallest mountain  |Mauna_Kea|Mauna_Kea|  is  above mean sea level.                  The most diverse country of Oceania when it comes to the environment is Australia, with tropical  |rainforests|Rainforest|  in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre.  |Desert|Deserts_Of_Australia|  or semi-arid land commonly known as the  |outback|Outback|  makes up by far the largest portion of land. The  |coastal_uplands|Eastern_Australian_Temperate_Forests|  and a  |belt_of_Brigalow_grasslands|Brigalow_Belt|  lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland. The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested  |Cape_York_Peninsula|Cape_York_Peninsula| .     Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to  |aridity|Aridity|  and fire which include  |scleromorphy|Sclerophyll|  and  |serotiny|Serotiny| .

In Hawaii, one endemic plant,  Brighamia , now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct. The two species of Brighamia  – B. rockii and B. insignis  – are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants. To ensure these plants set seed, biologists rappel down  cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.

There are also Creoles formed from the interaction of Malay or the colonial languages with indigenous languages, such as Tok Pisin , Bislama , Chavacano , various Malay trade and creole languages , Hawaiian Pidgin , Norfuk , and Pitkern . Contact between Austronesian and Papuan resulted in several instances in mixed languages such as Maisin .     Immigrants brought their own languages to the region, such as Mandarin , Italian, Arabic, Polish, Hindi, German, Spanish, Korean, Cantonese and Greek , among others, namely in Australia and New Zealand, or Fiji Hindi in Fiji .         thu immigrants arriving in Australia   The most multicultural areas in Oceania, which have a high degree of immigration , are Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. Since 1945, more than 7 million people have settled in Australia. From the late 1970s, there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries, making Australia a multicultural country .     Sydney is the most multicultural city in Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking a language other than English at home. Furthermore, 36 percent of the population reported having been born overseas , with top countries being Italy, Lebanon, Vietnam and Iraq, among others. Melbourne is also fairly multicultural, having the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Europe, and the second largest Asian population in Australia after Sydney.     European migration to New Zealand provided a major influx following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the British Isles, but also from continental Europe, the Pacific, The Americas and Asia.
