Hewlett returned to direct the singles music video, featuring animated versions of the two collaborators on the track.       In April 2012, Albarn told  The Guardian  that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were unlikely .  Tension between the two had been building, partly due to a belief held by Hewlett that his contributions to Gorillaz were being diminished. Speaking to The Guardian in April 2017, Hewlett explained: Damon had half the Clash on stage, and Bobby Womack and Mos Def and De La Soul, and fucking Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and Bashy and everyone else. It was the greatest band ever. And the screen on stage behind them seemed to get smaller every day. I’d say, ‘Have we got a new screen?’ and the tour manager was like, ‘No, it’s the same screen.’ Because it seemed to me like it was getting smaller.  On 25 April 2012, in an interview with Metro, Albarn was more optimistic about Gorillaz future, saying that once he had worked out his differences with Hewlett, he was sure that they would make another record.  On 24 June 2013, Hewlett stated that he and Albarn planned to someday record a follow-up to their 2010 album  Plastic Beach .

On 19 October 2014, Albarn told  The Sydney Morning Herald  that he was planning to release new Gorillaz material in 2016.  Albarn has described the music that he has written for the next Gorillaz album as being very upbeat, humorous, and positive, stating that he plans on giving the tracks a benchmark of 125 bpm and nothing underneath that , while also suggesting that it once again may have many collaborations.
