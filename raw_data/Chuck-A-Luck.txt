          Chuck-a-luck, also known as birdcage, is a  |game_of_chance|Gambling|  played with three  |dice|Dice| . It is derived from  |grand_hazard|Grand_Hazard|  and both can be considered a variant of  |sic_bo|Sic_Bo| , which is a popular  |casino_game|Casino_Game| , although chuck-a-luck is more of a  |carnival_game|Carnival_Game|  than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for  |charity|Charitable_Organization| .       Chuck-a-luck is played with three standard  |dice|Dice|  that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an  |hourglass|Hourglass|  that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.     Wagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice. The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in  |sic_bo|Sic_Bo|  and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game.     The wagers, and their associated odds, that are typically available are set out in the table below.               Chuck-a-luck is a  |game_of_chance|Gambling| . On average, the players are expected to lose more than they win. The casinos advantage  is greater than most other  |casino_games|Casino_Games|  and can be much greater.     For example, there are 216 possible outcomes for a single throw of three dice. For a specific number:     there are 75 possible outcomes, where only one die will match the number;   there are 15 possible outcomes, where only two dice will match; and   there is one possible outcome, where all three dice will match.     At odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 10 to 1 respectively for each of these types of outcome, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:     1 - 4.6%     At worse odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:     1 - 7.9%     If the odds are adjusted to 1 to 1, 3 to 1 and 5 to 1 respectively, the expected loss as a percentage is:     1 - 0%     However, commercially organised gambling games always have a house advantage which acts as a fee for the privilege of being allowed to play the game, so the last scenario does not represent real practice.       A version of the  |Big_Six_wheel|Big_Six_Wheel|  is loosely based on chuck-a-luck, with various combinations of three dice appearing in 54 slots on a spinning wheel. Because of the distribution of the combinations, the house advantage or edge for this wheel is greater than for chuck-a-luck.   Chuck-a-luck is essentially identical to the traditional Vietnamese game  |Bau_cua_ca_cop|Bau_Cua_Ca_Cop| .

Chuck-a-luck is featured in the lyrics to the theme song and in some plot points.     The game is played by Lazar in the James Bond movie  The Man with the Golden Gun .
