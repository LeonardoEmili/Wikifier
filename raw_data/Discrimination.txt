            In human  |social_behavior|Social_Behavior| , discrimination is prejudiced treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction towards, a being based on the group, class, or category to which they are perceived to belong. These include  |age|Ageism| ,  |caste|Caste| ,  |criminal_record|Employment_Discrimination_Against_Persons_With_Criminal_Records| ,  |height|Heightism| ,  |disability|Ableism| ,  |family_status|Family| ,  |gender_identity|Gender_Identity| ,  |gender_expression|Gender_Expression| ,  |generation|Generation| ,  |genetic_characteristics|Genetics| ,  |marital_status|Marital| ,  |nationality|Nationalism| ,  |colour|Colorism| ,  |race|Racism|  and  |ethnicity|Racism| ,  |religion|Religious_Discrimination| ,  |sex|Sexism|  and  |sex_characteristics|Sex_Characteristics| ,  |sexual_orientation|Sexual_Orientation_Discrimination| ,  |social_class|Classism| ,  |species|Speciesism| , as well other categories. Discrimination consists of treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated .  It involves the groups initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individuals actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the  |exclusion|Social_Exclusion|  of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making. Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York:  |W._W._Norton_&_Company|W._W._Norton_&_Company|  Inc, 2009. p. 334.     Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and  |institutions|Institution|  in every part of the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called  |reverse_discrimination|Reverse_Discrimination| .       The term discriminate appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the  |Latin|Latin_Language|  discriminat- distinguished between, from the verb discriminare, from discrimen distinction, from the verb discernere.  Since the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  the term discrimination generally evolved in  |American_English|American_English|  usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable  |group|Social_Group|  or social category.  The word discrimination derives from Latin, where the verb discrimire means to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction .       Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as disadvantageous treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated worse than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way despite the fact that the people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation.   In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as different so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.      Based on realistic-conflict theory  and social-identity theory,  Rubin and Hewstone  have highlighted a distinction among three types of discrimination:   Realistic competition is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources for the in-group .   Social competition is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups .   Consensual discrimination is driven by the need for accuracy and reflects stable and legitimate inter group status hierarchies .     The  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  stance on discrimination includes the statement: Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection.  International bodies  |United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council|United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council|  work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.               |Ageism|Ageism|  or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someones age.  It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a persons age.  Ageism is most often directed towards old people, or adolescents and children.

Retrieved on 11 April 2012.      Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States. Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at  |Texas_A_&_M|Texas_A_&_M| , found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant. Lahey, J.  Boston College.  In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at  |Ghent_University|Ghent_University| , measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In  |Belgium|Belgium| , they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment. Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M.  Journal of Economic Psychology.     In a survey for the  |University_of_Kent|University_Of_Kent| , England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination. This is a higher proportion than for  |gender|Sexism|  or  |racial|Racism|  discrimination.  |Dominic_Abrams|Dominic_Abrams| , social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.  London: Age Concern.             According to  |UNICEF|Unicef|  and  |Human_Rights_Watch|Human_Rights_Watch| ,  |caste|Caste|  discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide. , UNICEF   Discrimination based on caste, as perceived by  |UNICEF|Unicef| , is mainly prevalent in parts of  |Asia|Asia| , ,  |Africa|Africa|  and others. , there were 200 million  |Dalits|Dalit|  or  |Scheduled_Castes|Scheduled_Castes|  in India.             Discrimination can be directed towards a person based on their culture or subculture. In 2013, the  |Greater_Manchester_Police|Greater_Manchester_Police|  in the United Kingdom began to classify attacks on subcultures such as  |goths|Goth_Subculture| ,  |emos|Emo| ,  |punks|Punk_Subculture|  and  |metallers|Heavy_Metal_Subculture|  as hate crimes, in the same way they record abuse against people because of their religion, race, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.  The decision followed the  |murder_of_Sophie_Lancaster|Murder_Of_Sophie_Lancaster|  and beating of her boyfriend in 2007, who were attacked because they were goths.             Discrimination against people with  |disabilities|Disability|  in favor of people who are not is called  |ableism|Ableism|  or  |disablism|Disablism| . Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of normal living, results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve standard people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown, employment is needed to not only provide a living but to sustain mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.  A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce isolation.     In the United States, the  |Americans_with_Disabilities_Act|Americans_With_Disabilities_Act|  mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the  |Equality_Act_2010|Equality_Act_2010|  in the UK.                Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity. However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Notable examples are the  |Anti-French_sentiment_in_the_United_States|Anti-French_Sentiment_In_The_United_States|  as well as the  |Anti-Quebec_sentiment|Anti-Quebec_Sentiment|  in Canada targeting people who speak the French language. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate  |ethnic_groups|Ethnic_Group| . Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who either do or do not speak a particular language or languages. An example of this is when thousands of Wayúu Native Colombians were given derisive names and the same birth date, by government officials, during a campaign to provide them with identification cards. The issue was not discovered until many years later.      Another noteworthy example of linguistic discrimination is the backdrop to the  |Bengali_Language_Movement|Bengali_Language_Movement|  in erstwhile  |Pakistan|Pakistan| , a political campaign that played a key role in the creation of  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| . In 1948,  |Mohammad_Ali_Jinnah|Mohammad_Ali_Jinnah|  declared  |Urdu|Urdu|  as the national language of  |Pakistan|Pakistan|  and branded those supporting the use of  |Bengali|Bengali_Language| , the most widely spoken language in the state, as enemies of the state.  |Hossain_&_Tollefson_2006|1971_Bangladesh_Genocideciterefhossaintollefson2006| , p. 345.     Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled  linguicism  or logocism. Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the countrys predominant or official language, is  |bilingualism|Bilingualism|  such as official documents in two languages, and  |multiculturalism|Multiculturalism|  in more than two languages.       Discrimination based on a persons name may also occur, with researchers suggesting the presence of discrimination based on a names meaning, its pronunciation, its uniqueness, its gender affiliation, and its racial affiliation.      Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each résumé before making their initial fit/no fit screen-out decision and that a persons name is one of the six things they focus on most.  France has made it illegal to view a persons name on a résumé when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates. Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands have also experimented with name-blind summary processes.  Some apparent discrimination may be explained by other factors such as name frequency.  The effects of name discrimination based on a names fluency is subtle, small and subject to significantly changing norms.        Discrimination on the basis of  |nationality|Nationality|  is usually included in  |employment_laws|Employment_Discrimination|  , State of Wisconsin  . It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination  although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.     Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a level of acceptance in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members. Christiane Schwieren,  , Maastricht University     In the  |GCC|Cooperation_Council_For_The_Arab_States_Of_The_Gulf|  states, in the workplace, preferential treatment is given to full citizens, even though many of them lack experience or motivation to do the job. State benefits are also generally available for citizens only.  Westerners might also get paid more than other expatriates.                         Racial and ethnic discrimination differentiates individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial and ethnic differences and leads to various forms of the  |ethnic_penalty|Ethnic_Penalty| .  It has been official government policy in several countries, such as  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  during the  |apartheid|Apartheid|  era. Discriminatory policies towards ethnic minorities include the race-based discrimination against ethnic  |Indians|Malaysian_Indian|  and Chinese in  |Malaysia|Malaysia|   . March 4, 2008. BBC News.

The  |Equality_and_Human_Rights_Commission|Equality_And_Human_Rights_Commission|  found that in England and Wales , a black person was five times more likely to be imprisoned than a white person. The discrepancy was attributed to decades of racial prejudice in the criminal justice system . Ramesh, Randeep.  . The Guardian. October 11, 2010     In the United States, the  |racial_profiling|Racial_Profiling|  of minorities by law-enforcement officials has been called racial discrimination.    Within the criminal justice system of the United States, minorities are convicted and imprisoned disproportionately when compared to the majority.   . Human Rights Watch. June 5, 2008. As early as 1866, the  |Civil_Rights_Act|Civil_Rights_Act_Of_1866|  and  |Civil_Rights_Act_of_1871|Civil_Rights_Act_Of_1871|  provided a remedy for intentional racism in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The  |Civil_Rights_Act_of_1991|Civil_Rights_Act_Of_1991|  expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial.     Racial discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in both the United States and Europe.   Using a field experiment,  |Marianne_Bertrand|Marianne_Bertrand|  and  |Sendhil_Mullainathan|Sendhil_Mullainathan|  showed that applications from job candidates with white-sounding names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with African-American-sounding names in the United States at the start of this millennium. Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S.  American Economic Review, 94, 991-1013 A 2009 study by  |Devah_Pager|Devah_Pager| ,  |Bruce_Western|Bruce_Western| , and Bart Bonikowski found that black applicants to low-wage jobs were half as likely as identically qualified white applicants to receive callbacks or job offers.  More recently, Stijn Baert, Bart Cockx, Niels Gheyle and Cora Vandamme replicated and extended their field experiment in Belgium, Europe. They found that racial discrimination in the labour market is heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared to natives, candidates with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a job interview in Belgium if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, but they have to send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low. Baert, S., Cockx, B., Gheyle, N., Vandamme, C.  Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 68, 467-500.          Regional or geographic discrimination is discrimination based on the region in which a person lives or was born. It differs from national discrimination in that it may not be based on national borders or the country in which the victim lives, instead, it is based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese who were born in regions of the countryside that are far away from cities that are located within China, and discrimination against  |Americans|Americans|  who are from the  |southern|Southern_United_States|  or  |northern|Northern_United_States|  regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.                   Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given  |religion|Religion| . For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the  |Balkans|Balkans| , known as the rayah or the protected flock , was subjected to discrimination under the  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as cattle rather than flock or subjects in order to emphasize the Christian populations inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah. Maan Z. Madina, Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language, 1973.      Restrictions upon  |Jew|Jew| ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and  |moneylending|Moneylending| , occupations only tolerated as a  |necessary_evil|Necessary_Evil|  .  .

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights which are guaranteed by the  |Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|Fourteenth_Amendment_To_The_United_States_Constitution| . Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for  |Freedom_of_Religion|Freedom_Of_Religion|  , religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied equal protection under the law, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom . U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington. D.C., April 9–10, 1979               Though gender discrimination and sexism refer to beliefs and  |attitudes|Attitude|  in relation to the  |gender|Gender|  of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. Sex discrimination, on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of  |prejudice|Prejudice|  and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.     Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an  |employer|Employer|  not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender.  Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women.  This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for  |systemic_bias|Systemic_Bias| . Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia.  In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on ones gender.  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – Barmaid wanted, but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt.  Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on ones gender.     Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify  |different_roles_for_men_and_women|Gender_Role| , in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.    Unfair discrimination usually follows the  |gender_stereotyping|Sexism|  held by a society. Raymond F. Gregory, Women and Workplace Discrimination: Overcoming Barriers to Gender Equality, Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003     The  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  had concluded that women often experience a  |glass_ceiling|Glass_Ceiling|  and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, Glass Ceilings and Open Doors, Fordham Law Review, 64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs, The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40 The term glass ceiling is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination. Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism, Routledge, 2004 In the United States in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: Over half of all Masters degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white. In its report, it recommended  |affirmative_action|Affirmative_Action| , which is the consideration of an employees gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.  , women accounted for 51% of workers in high-paying management, professional, and related occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.  .  |U.S._Department_of_Labor|U.S._Department_Of_Labor| ,  |Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics|Bureau_Of_Labor_Statistics| , Employment and Earnings, 2010 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review.     In addition, women are found to experience a  |sticky_floor|Sticky_Floor| . While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution. It might be explained by both employer discrimination and gender differences in career aspirations.

Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as womens jobs . One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas. Noack v YMCA of Greater Houston Area, 132, S. Ct.425 The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and black people in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.     Discrimination in slasher films is relevant. Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive, thus reinforcing the idea that female sexuality can be costly.                 Ones sexual orientation is a predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality . World English Dictionary,  Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexuality; a term for such hatred based upon ones sexual orientation is often called  |homophobia|Homophobia| . Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against  |asexual_people|Asexuality|  than to homosexual or bisexual people.      Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country. Revealing a lesbian sexual orientation lowers employment opportunities in  |Cyprus|Cyprus|  and  |Greece|Greece|  but overall, it has no negative effect in  |Sweden|Sweden|  and  |Belgium|Belgium| .   Ahmed, A. M., Andersson, L., Hammarstedt, M.   Institute for Labour Market Policy Evaluation Working Paper Series 21.  In the latter country, even a positive effect of revealing a lesbian sexual orientation is found for women at their fertile ages.     Besides these academic studies, in 2009,  |ILGA|Ilga|  published a report based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden.

Under Iranian Sharia law, certain crimes such as sodomy, rape, theft, fornication, apostasy and consumption of alcohol for the third time are considered to be claims of God and therefore have mandatory death sentences. Though often prejudicially stereotyped as deviants and misfits, most drug users are well-adjusted and productive members of society.  According to a survey of more than 850 people aged between 16 and 24, and 100 in-depth interviews, drug use is commonplace and consumers tend to be independent, lead active lives, and do not lack self-esteem.  Drug prohibitions may have been partly motivated by racism and other prejudice against minorities,    and  |racial_disparities|Race_And_The_War_On_Drugs|  have been found to exist in the enforcement and prosecution of drug laws.    Discrimination due to illicit drug use was the most commonly reported type of discrimination among Blacks and Latinos in a 2003 study of minority drug users in New York City, double to triple that due to race.  People who use legal drugs such as tobacco and prescription medications may also face discrimination.  Some even prohibit nicotine patches.       Ideas of  |self-ownership|Self-Ownership|  and  |cognitive_liberty|Cognitive_Liberty|  affirm  |rights|Civil_Rights|  to use drugs, whether for  |medicine|Self-Medication| |recreation|Recreational_Drugs| ,    or  |spiritual_fulfilment|Entheogen| .    Those espousing such ideas question the  |legality_of_drug_prohibition|Legality_Of_The_War_On_Drugs|  and cite the rights and freedoms enshrined in such documents as the  |U.S._Declaration_of_Independence|U.S._Declaration_Of_Independence| , the  |U.S._Constitution|U.S._Constitution|  and  |Bill_of_Rights|United_States_Bill_Of_Rights| ,  Transcript of a speech given at the 1991 Indiana Civil Liberties Union Conference at Indiana University. the  |European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|European_Convention_On_Human_Rights| ,   and the  |Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights|Universal_Declaration_Of_Human_Rights| ,  as protecting personal drug  |choices|Freedom_Of_Choice| . They are inspired by and see themselves following in the tradition of those who have struggled against other forms of discrimination in the past.  Were really following in the footsteps of other movements for individual freedom and social justice in this country.      |Drug_policy_reform|Drug_Policy_Reform|  organizations such as the  |Drug_Policy_Alliance|Drug_Policy_Alliance| ,  the  |Drug_Equality_Alliance|Drug_Equality_Alliance| ,  the  |Transform_Drug_Policy_Foundation|Transform_Drug_Policy_Foundation| ,  and the  |Beckley_Foundation|Beckley_Foundation|   have highlighted the issue of stigma and discrimination in drug policy. The  |Partnership_for_Drug-Free_Kids|Partnership_For_Drug-Free_Kids|  also recognizes this issue  and shares on its website stories that break through the stigma and discrimination that people with drug or drinking problems often face.      A report issued by the  |Global_Commission_on_Drug_Policy|Global_Commission_On_Drug_Policy| , critical of the global war on drugs,  End the criminalization, marginalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but who do no harm to others. states, under Undermining Human Rights, Fostering Discrimination :     Punitive approaches to drug policy are severely undermining human rights in every region of the world. They lead to the erosion of civil liberties and fair trial standards, the stigmatization of individuals and groups – particularly women, young people, and ethnic minorities – and the imposition of abusive and inhumane punishments.        Although still illegal at the federal level, about half of U.S. states have legalized marijuana for medical use and several of those states have laws, or are considering legislation, specifically protecting  |medical_marijuana|Medical_Marijuana|  patients from discrimination in such areas as education, employment, housing, child custody, and organ transplantation.  Arizona, Delaware and Minnesota offer the strongest protections for medical marijuana patients.  Qualifying patients and caregivers are protected from discrimination with employment, education, housing, parental rights, or medical care, including transplants.                   In the US, a government policy known as  |affirmative_action|Affirmative_Action|  was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as  |African_Americans|African_Americans|  and women, who have been subject to discrimination for a long time.      Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as reverse discrimination. In particular, minority quotas  may discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group or other minority groups. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institutes  |Ward_Connerly|Ward_Connerly|  stated, There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about affirmative action programs that give preference to some groups based on race.               |Australia|Australia| |Canada|Canada| |Ontario_Human_Rights_Code|Ontario_Human_Rights_Code|  1962    |Canadian_Human_Rights_Act|Canadian_Human_Rights_Act|  1977     |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| |Israel|Israel| |Prohibition_of_Discrimination_in_Products,_Services_and_Entry_into_Places_of_Entertainment_and_Public_Places_Law,_2000|Prohibition_Of_Discrimination_In_Products,_Services_And_Entry_Into_Places_Of_Entertainment_And_Public_Places_Law,_2000| |Employment_Law,_1988|Employment_Law,_1988| |Netherlands|Netherlands| |Wetboek_van_Strafrecht|Wetboek_Van_Strafrecht|  prohibits insults towards a group because of its race, religion, sexual orientation , handicap in public or by speech, by writing or by a picture.

In some societies, including most developed countries, each individuals civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.    Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, abolitionist or vegan egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual , warrant  |equal_consideration|Equal_Consideration_Of_Interests|  with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is  |speciesist|Speciesist|  .        Discrimination, in  |labeling_theory|Labeling_Theory| , takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of  |stereotype|Stereotype| . This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and  |social_stigma|Social_Stigma|   that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a natural social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy. The  |Nazis|Nazis|  in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990  |Apartheid|Apartheid|  government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.        Economist  |Yanis_Varoufakis|Yanis_Varoufakis|  argues that discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory , and that neither classical  |game_theory|Game_Theory|  nor  |neoclassical_economics|Neoclassical_Economics|  can explain this.  Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround  |hawk-dove_game|Hawk-Dove_Game|  . At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue. At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent. Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a  |Nash_equilibrium|Nash_Equilibrium|  where players of one color  |consistently|Pure_Strategy|  played the aggressive hawk strategy against players of the other, disadvantaged color, who played the acquiescent dove strategy against the advantaged color. Players of both colors used a  |mixed_strategy|Mixed_Strategy|  when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.     The experimenters then added a  |cooperation|Prisoners_Dilemma|  option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not. They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by  |evolutionary_game_theory|Evolutionary_Game_Theory| , game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group. Citing earlier psychological work of  |Matthew_Rabin|Matthew_Rabin| , they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a fairness equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.          It is debated as to whether or not  |markets|Market|  discourage discrimination brought about by the state. One argument is that since discrimination restricts access to customers and incurs additional expense, market logic will punish discrimination. Opposition by companies to Jim Crow segregation laws is an example of this. Jennifer Roback, The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars. Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 : 893–917. An alternative argument is that markets dont necessarily undermine discrimination, as it is argued that if discrimination is profitable by catering to the  |tastes|Taste-Based_Discrimination|  of individuals , then the market will not punish discrimination. It is argued that micro economic analysis of discrimination uses unusual methods to determine its effects and that the very existence of discrimination in employment in the long run contradicts claims that the market will function well and punish discrimination.
