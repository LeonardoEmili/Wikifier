        ". Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation.       In English usage, the genitive  of Æsir faith is often used on its own to denote adherents . This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of Scandinavia, although it is problematic as many Asatruar worship deities and entities other than the Æsir, such as the Vanir, Valkyries, Elves, and Dwarves. Other practitioners term their religion Vanatrú, meaning those who honour the Vanir or Dísitrú, meaning those who honour the Goddesses , depending on their particular theological emphasis.     Within the community it is sometimes stated that the term Ásatrú pertains to groups which are not racially focused, while Odinism is the term preferred by racially oriented groups. However, in practice, there is no such neat division in terminology.     There are notable differences of emphasis between Ásatrú as practiced in the US and in Scandinavia. According to Strmiska and Sigurvinsson , American Asatruar tend to prefer a more devotional form of worship and a more emotional conception of the Nordic gods than Scandinavian practitioners, reflecting the parallel tendency of highly emotional forms of Christianity prevalent in the United States. American Nordic Pagans want to feel an intimate relationship with their gods, not unlike evangelical attitudes towards Jesus. Icelandic Asatruar, by contrast, are more focused on devotion to their past cultural heritage rather than to particular gods. Strmiska and Sigurvinsson , p. 165.       Although deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the Heathen community in the US, sociologist Jeffrey Kaplan estimated that, in the mid-1990s, there were around 500 active practitioners in the country, with a further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement. He noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the movement were white, male, and young. Most had at least an undergraduate degree, and worked in a mix of ": null

The majority had a college education, but were generally less well educated than the wider Pagan community, with a lower median income than the wider Pagan community too.   Subsequent assessments have suggested a larger support base; 10,000 to 20,000 according to McNallen,  and 7,878 according to the 2014 census.
