             Limited overs cricket, also known as one-day cricket, is a version of the sport of  |cricket|Cricket|  in which a match is generally completed in one day, which includes  |List_A_cricket|List_A_Cricket|  and  |Twenty20_cricket|Twenty20_Cricket| . The name reflects the rule that in the match each team bowls a set maximum number of  |overs|Over| , usually between 20 and 50, although shorter and longer forms of limited overs cricket have been played.     The concept contrasts with  |Test|Test_Cricket|  and  |first_class|First_Class_Cricket|  matches, which can take up to five days to complete. One-day cricket is popular with spectators as it can encourage aggressive, risky, entertaining  |batting|Batting| , often results in cliffhanger endings, and ensures that a spectator can watch an entire match without committing to five days of continuous attendance.            Each team bats only once, and each  |innings|Innings|  is limited to a set number of  |overs|Over| , usually fifty in a  |One_Day_International|One_Day_International|  and between forty and sixty in a List A. List A is a classification of the limited-overs form of cricket, technically as the domestic level.     Despite its name, important one-day matches, international and domestic, often have two days set aside, the second day being a reserve day to allow more chance of the game being completed if a result is not possible on the first day .         As mentioned above, in almost all competitive one-day games, a restriction is placed on the number of overs that may be bowled by any one bowler. This is to prevent a side playing two top-class bowlers with extremely good stamina who can bowl throughout their opponents innings. The usual limitation is set so that a side must include at least five players who bowl. For example, the usual limit for twenty-over cricket is four overs per bowler, for forty-over cricket eight per bowler and for fifty-over cricket ten per bowler. There are exceptions:  |Pro_Cricket|Pro_Cricket|  in the United States restricted bowlers to five overs each, thus leaving a side requiring only four bowlers.       The idea for a one-day, limited 50-over cricket tournament, was first played in the inaugural match of the All India Pooja Cricket Tournament in 1951 in the small town of  |Thrippunithura|Thrippunithura|  in  |Kerala|Kerala| . It is thought to be the brain child of KV Kelappan Thampuran, a former cricketer and the first Secretary of the Kerala Cricket Association.  The one day limited over cricket game was later adapted and played between English county teams for the first instance on 2 May 1962.  |Leicestershire|Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club|  beat  |Derbyshire|Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club|  and  |Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club|  beat  |Nottinghamshire|Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club|  over 65 overs in the Midlands Knock-Out Cup , which Northamptonshire went on to win a week later. The following year, the first full-scale one-day competition between first-class teams was played, the knock-out  |Gillette_Cup|C_G_Trophy| , won by  |Sussex|Sussex_County_Cricket_Club| . The number of overs was reduced to 60 for the 1964 season. League one-day cricket also began in England, when the John Player  |Sunday_League|National_League|  was started in 1969 with forty over matches. Both these competitions have continued every season since inauguration, though the sponsorship has changed. There is now one 50 over competition, which is called the Royal London One-Day Cup.     The first Limited Overs International or One-Day International match was played in Melbourne in 1971, and the quadrennial  |cricket_World_Cup|Cricket_World_Cup|  began in 1975. Many of the packaging innovations, such as coloured clothing, were as a result of  |World_Series_Cricket|World_Series_Cricket| , a rebel series set up outside the cricketing establishment by Australian entrepreneur  |Kerry_Packer|Kerry_Packer| . For more details, see  |History_of_cricket|History_Of_Cricket| .      |Twenty20|Twenty20| , a curtailed form of one-day cricket with 20 overs per side, was first played in England in 2003. It has proven very popular, and several Twenty20 matches have been played between national teams. It makes several changes to the usual  |laws_of_cricket|Laws_Of_Cricket| , including the addition of a  |bowl_out|Bowl_Out|   to decide the result of tied matches, which was subsequently dispensed in favour of a  |Super_Over|Super_Over| .      |100_ball_cricket|100_Ball_Cricket| , another form of one-day cricket with 100 deliveries per side, will launch in England in 2020. It is designed to further shorten game time and hopes to attract a new audience. It makes further changes to the usual  |laws_of_cricket|Laws_Of_Cricket| , including the addition of one 10-ball over which is bowled by each side in addition to 15 traditional 6-ball overs.                |One_Day_International|One_Day_International|  matches are usually played in brightly coloured clothing often in a day-night format where the first innings of the day occurs in the afternoon and the second occurs under stadium lights.       Every four years, the  |Cricket_World_Cup|Cricket_World_Cup|  involves all the Test-playing nations and other national sides who qualify through the  |ICC_World_Cup_Qualifier|Icc_World_Cup_Qualifier| . It usually consists of round-robin stages, followed by semi-finals and a final. The  |International_Cricket_Council|International_Cricket_Council|  determines the venue far in advance.     The  |ICC_Champions_Trophy|Icc_Champions_Trophy|  also involves all the Test-playing nations, and is held between World Cups. It usually consists of a round-robin group stage, semifinals, and a final.     Each Test-playing country often hosts triangular tournaments, between the host nation and two touring sides. There is usually a round-robin group stage, and then the leading two teams play each other in a final, or sometimes a best-of-three final. When there is only one touring side, there is still often a best-of-five or best-of-seven series of limited overs matches.     The ICC  |World_Cricket_League|World_Cricket_League|  is an ODI competition for national teams with Associate or Affiliate status.         Domestic one-day competitions exist in almost every country where cricket is played.         List A cricket is a classification of the limited-overs form of the sport of  |cricket|Cricket| . Much as domestic  |first_class_cricket|First_Class_Cricket|  is the level below international  |Test_match|Test_Cricket|  cricket, so List A cricket is the domestic level of  |one_day_cricket|One_Day_Cricket|  below  |One_Day_Internationals|One_Day_International| . Twenty20 matches do not qualify for the present.     Most cricketing nations have some form of domestic List A competition. The number of  |overs|Over|  in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side.     The  |Association_of_Cricket_Statisticians_and_Historians|Association_Of_Cricket_Statisticians_And_Historians|  created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches. Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included. The categorisation of cricket matches as List A was not officially endorsed by the  |International_Cricket_Council|International_Cricket_Council|  until 2006, when the ICC announced that it and its member associations would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first class matches. , from Cricinfo, 30 July 2006     Matches that qualify as List A:   One Day Internationals   Other international matches   Premier one-day tournaments in each country   Official matches of a touring Test team against main first-class teams   Matches that do not qualify as List A:   World Cup warm-up matches   Other Tourist matches   Festival and friendly matches          The  JLT One Day Cup  is a 50 overs tournament held since 1969.
