            In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the absolute value or modulus of a  |real_number|Real_Number|   , denoted , is the  |non-negative|Non-Negative|  value of   without regard to its  |sign|Sign| . Namely,  if  is  |positive|Positive_Number| , and  if  is  |negative|Negative_Number|  , and . For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its  |distance|Distance|  from zero.     Generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example, an absolute value is also defined for the  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number| , the  |quaternions|Quaternion| ,  |ordered_rings|Ordered_Ring| ,  |fields|Field|  and  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space| . The absolute value is closely related to the notions of  |magnitude|Magnitude| ,  |distance|Distance| , and  |norm|Norm|  in various mathematical and physical contexts.       In 1806,  |Jean-Robert_Argand|Jean-Robert_Argand|  introduced the term module, meaning unit of measure in French, specifically for the complex absolute value,  |Oxford_English_Dictionary|Oxford_English_Dictionary| , Draft Revision, June 2008 Nahin, , and ; for the French sense, see  |Littré|Dictionnaire_De_La_Langue_Française| , 1877 and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent modulus. The term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in French  |Lazare_Nicolas_M._Carnot|Lazare_Nicolas_Marguerite_Carnot| , Mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans lespace, p.  105  and 1857 in English. James Mill Peirce, A Text-book of Analytic Geometry . The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term absolute value is also used in contrast to relative value. The notation , with a  |vertical_bar|Vertical_Bar|  on each side, was introduced by  |Karl_Weierstrass|Karl_Weierstrass|  in 1841. Nicholas J. Higham, Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences, SIAM. , p.  25 Other names for absolute value include numerical value and magnitude. In programming languages and computational software packages, the absolute value of x is generally represented by abs , or a similar expression.     The vertical bar notation also appears in a number of other mathematical contexts: for example, when applied to a set, it denotes its  |cardinality|Cardinality| ; when applied to a  |matrix|Matrix| , it denotes its  |determinant|Determinant| . Vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined, notably an element of a  |normed_division_algebra|Normed_Division_Algebra| , for example a real number, a complex number, or a quaternion. A closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the  |euclidean_norm|Euclidean_Norm|   or  |sup_norm|Sup_Norm|   of a vector in   , although double vertical bars with subscripts are a more common and less ambiguous notation.           For any  |real_number|Real_Number|   , the absolute value or modulus of   is denoted by   and is defined as Mendelson, .     :  x       .
