Here, the chain rule gives a method for computing  in terms of  and . While it is always possible to directly apply the definition of the derivative to compute the derivative of a composite function, this is usually very difficult. The utility of the chain rule is that it turns a complicated derivative into several easy derivatives.     The chain rule states that, under appropriate conditions,   : f  g.   In this example, this equals   :       In the statement of the chain rule,  and  play slightly different roles because  is evaluated at g  , whereas  is evaluated at .

The product of f  and g  therefore has the correct units of pascals per second.     Here, notice that it is not possible to evaluate  anywhere else. For instance, the 10 in the problem represents ten seconds, while the expression f  would represent the change in pressure at a height of ten meters, which is not what we wanted. Similarly, while  has a unit of meters per second, the expression  would represent the change in pressure at a height of −98 meters, which is again not what we wanted.

To find the temperature drop per hour, we can apply the chain rule. Let the function  be the altitude of the car at time , and let the function  be the temperature  kilometers above sea level.  and  are not known exactly: For example, the altitude where the car starts is not known and the temperature on the mountain is not known. However, their derivatives are known:  is , and  is . The chain rule states that the derivative of the composite function is the product of the derivative of  and the derivative of . This is .     One of the reasons why this computation is possible is because  is a constant function. A more accurate description of how the temperature near the car varies over time would require an accurate model of how the temperature varies at different altitudes. This model may not have a constant derivative. To compute the temperature change in such a model, it would be necessary to know  and not just , because without knowing  it is not possible to know where to evaluate .       The chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions. To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of , , and  is the composite of  with . The chain rule states that to compute the derivative of , it is sufficient to compute the derivative of  and the derivative of . The derivative of  can be calculated directly, and the derivative of  can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.     For concreteness, consider the function   : y e.   This can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:   :     y & f eu,     u & g   v       v & h x2.       Their derivatives are:   :       & f eu e,       & g   v         & h 2x.         The chain rule states that the derivative of their composite at the point  is:     :       & f      & f   g   h     h.           In Leibniz notation, this is:   :       or for short,   :       The derivative function is therefore:   :   e  2x.     Another way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function  as the composite of  and h. Applying the chain rule in this manner would yield:   :   h f  g  h.     This is the same as what was computed above. This should be expected because .     Sometimes, it is necessary to differentiate an arbitrarily long composition of the form f1   f2       f   fn  . In this case, define   : f f   f       f   f   where f fa and f x when b ": null
