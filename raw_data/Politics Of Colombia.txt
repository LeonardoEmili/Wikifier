          The Politics of Colombia take place in a framework of a  |presidential|Presidential_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |republic|Republic| , whereby the  |President_of_Colombia|President_Of_Colombia|  is both  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and of a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| .  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is carried out by the government.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the government and the two chambers of  |congress|Congress_Of_Colombia| , the  |Senate|Senate_Of_Colombia|  and the  |House_of_Representatives_of_Colombia|House_Of_Representatives_Of_Colombia| . The  |Judiciary|Judiciary|  is independent of the executive and the legislature.             |Colombias|Colombia|  present constitution, enacted on July 5, 1991, strengthened the administration of justice with the provision for introduction of an  |adversarial_system|Adversarial_System|  which ultimately is to entirely replace the existing  |Napoleonic_Code|Napoleonic_Code| . Other significant reforms  under the new constitution provide for civil divorce, dual nationality, the election of a vice president, and the election of departmental governors. The constitution expanded citizens basic rights, including that of tutela, under which an immediate court action can be requested by an individual if he or she feels that their constitutional rights are being violated and if there is no other  |legal_recourse|Legal_Recourse| .     The national government has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches.             The president is elected for a four-year term and, since 2005, can be re-elected for one consecutive term. The 1991 constitution reestablished the position of  |vice_president|Vice_President_Of_Colombia| , who is elected on the same ticket as the president. By law, the vice president will succeed in the event of the presidents resignation, illness, or death.             Colombias bicameral Congress consists of a 108-member  |Senate_of_Colombia|Senate_Of_Colombia|  and a 172-member  |Chamber_of_Representatives_of_Colombia|Chamber_Of_Representatives_Of_Colombia| . Senators are elected on the basis of a nationwide ballot, while representatives are elected in multi member districts co-located within the 32 national departments. The countrys capital is a separate capital district and elects its own representatives. Members may be re-elected indefinitely, and, in contrast to the previous system, there are no alternate congressmen. Congress meets twice a year, and the president has the power to call it into special session when needed.                                           The civilian judiciary is a separate and independent branch of government. Guidelines and the general structure for Colombias administration of justice are set out in Law 270 of March 7, 1996. Colombias legal system has recently begun to incorporate some elements of an oral, accusatory system. The judicial branchs general structure is composed of four distinct jurisdictions . Colombias highest judicial organs are the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_Justice_Of_Colombia| , the  |Council_of_State|Council_Of_State| , the  |Constitutional_Court|Constitutional_Court_Of_Colombia| , and the  |Superior_Judicial_Council|Superior_Council_Of_Judicature| . Although all the high courts technically oversee separate jurisdictions, the Constitutional Court has a broad spectrum of judicial oversight which often allows it to rule on issues overseen by different jurisdictions and even weigh in directly in the rulings of other high courts.         |BCIE|Central_American_Bank_For_Economic_Integration| ,  |CAN|Andean_Community_Of_Nations| ,  |CDB|Caribbean_Development_Bank| ,  |CSN|South_American_Community_Of_Nations| ,  |FAO|Food_And_Agriculture_Organization| ,  |G-3|G3_Free_Trade_Agreement| ,  |G-24|Group_Of_24| ,  |G-77|Group_Of_77| ,  |IADB|Inter-American_Development_Bank| ,  |IAEA|International_Atomic_Energy_Agency| ,  |IBRD|International_Bank_For_Reconstruction_And_Development| ,  |ICAO|Icao| ,  |ICC|International_Chamber_Of_Commerce| ,  |ICCt|International_Criminal_Court| ,  |ITUC|International_Trade_Union_Confederation| ,  |ICRM|International_Red_Cross_And_Red_Crescent_Movement| ,  |IDA|International_Development_Association| ,  |IFAD|Ifad| ,  |IFC|International_Finance_Corporation| ,  |IFRCS|Ifrcs| ,  |IHO|Iho| ,  |ILO|International_Labour_Organization| ,  |IMF|International_Monetary_Fund| ,  |IMO|International_Maritime_Organization| ,  |Interpol|Interpol| ,  |IOC|Ioc| ,  |IOM|International_Organization_For_Migration| ,  |ISO|International_Organization_For_Standardization| ,  |ITU|Itu| ,  |LAES|Latin_American_Economic_System| ,  |LAIA|Laia| ,  |Mercosur|Mercosur|  ,  |MIGA|Miga| ,  |NAM|Non-Aligned_Movement| ,  |OAS|Organization_Of_American_States| ,  |OPANAL|Opanal| ,  |OPCW|Opcw| ,  |PCA|Permanent_Court_Of_Arbitration| ,  |RG|Rio_Group| ,  |UN|United_Nations| ,  |UNASUR|Union_Of_South_American_Nations| ,  |UNCTAD|Unctad| ,  |UNESCO|Unesco| ,  |UNHCR|Unhcr| ,  |UNIDO|United_Nations_Industrial_Development_Organization| ,  |UPU|Upu| ,  |WCO|World_Customs_Organization| ,  |WFTU|World_Federation_Of_Trade_Unions| ,  |WHO|Who| ,  |WIPO|Wipo| ,  |WMO|Wmo| ,  |WToO|Wtoo| ,  |WTO|World_Trade_Organization|.
