                         George Washington  was an American political leader, military general, statesman, and  |Founding_Father|Founding_Fathers_Of_The_United_States|  who served as the first  |president_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States|  from 1789 to 1797. Previously, he led  |Patriot|Patriot|  forces to victory in the nations  |War_for_Independence|American_Revolutionary_War| . He presided at the  |Constitutional_Convention|Constitutional_Convention|  of 1787 which established the  |U.S._Constitution|Constitution_Of_The_United_States|    and a federal government. Washington has been called the  |Father_of_His_Country|Father_Of_The_Nation|  for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the new nation.     Washington received his initial military training and command with the  |Virginia_Regiment|Virginia_Regiment|  during the  |French_and_Indian_War|French_And_Indian_War| . He was later elected to the  |Virginia_House_of_Burgesses|House_Of_Burgesses|  and was named a delegate to the  |Continental_Congress|Continental_Congress| , where he was appointed  |Commanding_General|Commanding_General_Of_The_United_States_Army|  of the  |Continental_Army|Continental_Army| . He commanded American forces, allied with France, in the defeat and surrender of the British during the  |Siege_of_Yorktown|Siege_Of_Yorktown| , and resigned his commission in 1783 after the signing of the  |Treaty_of_Paris|Treaty_Of_Paris| .     Washington played a key role in the adoption and ratification of the  |Constitution|United_States_Constitution|  and was then elected president by the  |Electoral_College|United_States_Electoral_College|  in the first two elections. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson|  and  |Alexander_Hamilton|Alexander_Hamilton| . During the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| , he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the  |Jay_Treaty|Jay_Treaty| . He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title President of the United States , and his  |Farewell_Address|George_Washingtons_Farewell_Address|  is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on  |republicanism|Republicanism| .      |Washington_owned_slaves|George_Washington_And_Slavery|  for labor and trading, and supported measures passed by Congress protecting slavery, in order to preserve national unity. He later became troubled with the institution of  |slavery|Slavery_In_The_United_States|  and freed his slaves in a 1799 will. He endeavored to assimilate  |Native_Americans|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  into Western culture, but responded to their hostility in times of war. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the  |Freemasons|Freemasonry| , and he urged broad religious freedom in his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he was eulogized as first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen. He has been memorialized by monuments, art, geographical locations, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank him among  |the_greatest_American_presidents|Historical_Rankings_Of_Presidents_Of_The_United_States| .              The Washington family was a wealthy Virginia family which had made its fortune in  |land_speculation|Land_Speculation| . Harlow Giles Unger, Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence, , p. 100-101 Washingtons great-grandfather  |John_Washington|John_Washington|  immigrated in 1656 from  |Sulgrave|Sulgrave| , England to the British  |Colony_of_Virginia|Colony_Of_Virginia|  where he accumulated  of land, including  |Little_Hunting_Creek|Little_Hunting_Creek|  on the  |Potomac_River|Potomac_River| . George Washington was born February 22, 1732 at  |Popes_Creek|George_Washington_Birthplace_National_Monument|  in  |Westmoreland_County,_Virginia|Westmoreland_County,_Virginia| , and was the first of six children of  |Augustine|Augustine_Washington|  and  |Mary_Ball_Washington|Mary_Ball_Washington| . By English  |common_law|Jus_Sanguinis|  Washington was a naturalized subject of the King, as were all others born in the English colonies. His father was a  |justice_of_the_peace|Justice_Of_The_Peace|  and a prominent public figure who had three additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. The family moved to  |Little_Hunting_Creek|Little_Hunting_Creek| , in 1735, then to  |Ferry_Farm|Ferry_Farm|  near  |Fredericksburg,_Virginia|Fredericksburg,_Virginia|  in 1738. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother  |Lawrence|Lawrence_Washington|  inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it  |Mount_Vernon|Mount_Vernon| .     Washington did not have the formal education that his elder brothers received at  |Appleby_Grammar_School|Appleby_Grammar_School|  in England, but he did learn mathematics, trigonometry, and land  |surveying|Surveying| , and he was talented in draftsmanship and map-making. By early adulthood, he was writing with considerable force and precision.  However, his writing displayed little wit or humor. As a young man in pursuit of admiration, status, and power, he had a tendency to attribute his shortcomings and failures on someone elses ineffectuality.     Washington often visited Mount Vernon and  |Belvoir|Belvoir| , the plantation that belonged to Lawrences father-in-law  |William_Fairfax|William_Fairfax| . Fairfax became Washingtons patron and surrogate father, and Washington spent a month in 1748 with a team surveying Fairfaxs  |Shenandoah_Valley|Shenandoah_Valley|  property. He received a surveyors license the following year from the  |College_of_William_&_Mary|College_Of_William_&_Mary| ; Fairfax appointed him surveyor of  |Culpeper_County,_Virginia|Culpeper_County,_Virginia| , and he thus familiarized himself with the frontier region. He resigned from the job in 1750 and had bought almost  in the Valley, and he owned  by 1752.     In 1751, Washington made his only trip abroad when he accompanied Lawrence to  |Barbados|Barbados| , hoping that the climate would cure his brothers tuberculosis. Washington contracted  |smallpox|Smallpox|  during that trip, which immunized him but left his face slightly scarred. Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount Vernon from his widow; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761.       Lawrences service as adjutant general of the  |Virginia_militia|Virginia_Militia|  inspired Washington to seek a commission, and Virginias Lieutenant Governor  |Robert_Dinwiddie|Robert_Dinwiddie|  appointed him as a major in December 1752 and as commander of one of the four militia districts. The British and French were competing for control of the  |Ohio_Valley|Ohio_Valley|  at the time, the British building forts along the Ohio River and the French doing likewise, between Lake Erie and the Ohio River.     In October 1753, Dinwiddie appointed Washington as a special envoy to demand that the French vacate territory which the British had claimed. Dinwiddie also appointed him to make peace with the  |Iroquois_Confederacy|Iroquois_Confederacy|  and to gather intelligence about the French forces. Washington met with Half-King  |Tanacharison|Tanacharison|  and other Iroquois chiefs at  |Logstown|Logstown|  to secure their promise of support against the French, and his party reached the Ohio River in November. They were intercepted by a French patrol and escorted to  |Fort_Le_Boeuf|Fort_Le_Boeuf|  where Washington was received in a friendly manner. He delivered the British demand to vacate to French commander  |Saint-Pierre|Jacques_Legardeur_De_Saint-Pierre| , but the French refused to leave. Saint-Pierre gave Washington his official answer in a sealed envelope after a few days delay, and he gave Washingtons party food and extra winter clothing for the trip back to Virginia. Washington completed the precarious mission in 77 days in difficult winter conditions and achieved a measure of distinction when his report was published in Virginia and London.          In February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 300-strong Virginia Regiment, with orders to confront French forces at the  |Forks_of_the_Ohio|Forks_Of_The_Ohio| . Washington set out for the Forks with half of the regiment in April but soon learned that a French force of 1,000 had begun construction of  |Fort_Duquesne|Fort_Duquesne|  there. In May, Washington had set up a  |defensive_position|Fort_Necessity_National_Battlefield|  at Great Meadows when he learned that the French had made camp  away. Washington decided to take the offensive in pursuit of the French contingent.      The French detachment proved to be only about 50 men, so Washington advanced on May 28 with a small force of Virginians and Indian allies to ambush them. What took place, known as the  |Battle_of_Jumonville_Glen|Battle_Of_Jumonville_Glen|  or the Jumonville affair, was disputed, but French forces were killed outright with muskets and hatchets. French commander  |Joseph_Coulon_de_Jumonville|Joseph_Coulon_De_Jumonville| , who carried a diplomatic message for the British to evacuate, was killed. French forces found Jumonville and some of his men dead and scalped and assumed that Washington was responsible. Washington placed blame on his translator for not communicating the French intentions. Dinwiddie congratulated Washington for his victory over the French. This incident ignited the  |French_and_Indian_War|French_And_Indian_War| , which later became part of the larger  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War| .     The full Virginia Regiment joined Washington at Fort Necessity the following month with news that he had been promoted to command of the regiment and to colonel upon the death of the regimental commander. The regiment was reinforced by an  |independent_company_of_100_South_Carolinians|British_Army_Independent_Companies_Of_Foot_In_South_Carolina,_1721–1763| , led by Captain  |James_Mackay|James_Mackay| , whose royal commission outranked Washington, and a conflict of command ensued. On July 3, a French force attacked with 900 men, and the  |ensuing_battle|Battle_Of_Fort_Necessity|  ended in Washingtons surrender. In the aftermath, Colonel  |James_Innes|James_Innes|  took command of intercolonial forces, the Virginia Regiment was divided, and Washington was offered a captaincy which he refused, with resignation of his commission.          In 1755, Washington served voluntarily as an aide to General  |Edward_Braddock|Edward_Braddock| , who led a British  |expedition|Braddock_Expedition|  to expel the French from Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Country. On Washingtons recommendation, Braddock split the army into one main column and a lightly equipped flying column . Suffering from a severe case of  |dysentery|Dysentery| , Washington was left behind, and when he rejoined Braddock at Monongahela, the French and their Indian allies  |ambushed|Battle_Of_The_Monongahela|  the divided army. The British suffered two-thirds casualties, including the mortally wounded Braddock. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage, Washington, still very ill, rallied the survivors and formed a rear guard, which allowed the remnants of the force to disengage and retreat. During the engagement he had two horses shot from under him, and his hat and coat were bullet-pierced. His conduct under fire redeemed his reputation among critics of his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity, but he was not included by the succeeding commander Colonel Thomas Dunbar in planning subsequent operations.     The Virginia Regiment was reconstituted in August 1755, and Dinwiddie appointed Washington its commander, again with the colonial rank of colonel. Washington clashed over seniority almost immediately, this time with  |John_Dagworthy|John_Dagworthy| , another captain of superior royal rank, who commanded a detachment of Marylanders at the regiments headquarters in  |Fort_Cumberland|Fort_Cumberland| . Washington, impatient for an offensive against Fort Duquesne, was convinced Braddock would have granted him a royal commission, and pressed his case in February 1756 with Braddocks successor,  |William_Shirley|William_Shirley| , and again in January 1757 with Shirleys successor,  |Lord_Loudoun|John_Campbell,_4Th_Earl_Of_Loudoun| . Shirley ruled in Washingtons favor only in the matter of Dagworthy; Loudoun humiliated Washington, refused him a royal commission and agreed only to relieve him of the responsibility of manning Fort Cumberland.     In 1758, the Virginia Regiment was assigned to Britains  |Forbes_Expedition|Forbes_Expedition|  to take Fort Duquesne. Washington disagreed with General  |John_Forbes|John_Forbes|  tactics and chosen route. Forbes nevertheless made Washington a brevet brigadier general and gave him command of one of the three brigades that would assault the fort. The French abandoned the fort and the valley before the assault was launched, with Washington seeing only a friendly-fire incident which left 14 dead and 26 injured. The war lasted another four years, but Washington resigned his commission and returned to Mount Vernon.     Under Washington, the Virginia Regiment had defended  of frontier against 20 Indian attacks in 10 months. He increased the professionalism of the regiment as it increased from 300 to 1,000 men, and Virginias frontier population suffered less than other colonies. Some historians have said this was Washingtons only unqualified success during the war. Though he failed to realize a royal commission, he gained valuable knowledge of British tactics, self-confidence, and leadership skills. The destructive competition Washington witnessed among colonial politicians fostered his later support of strong central government.              On January 6, 1759, Washington, at age 26, married  |Martha_Dandridge_Custis|Martha_Washington| , the 28 year-old widow of wealthy plantation owner  |Daniel_Parke_Custis|Daniel_Parke_Custis| . The marriage took place at Marthas estate; she was intelligent and gracious, and experienced in managing a planters estate, and the couple created a happy marriage. They raised  |John_Parke_Custis|John_Parke_Custis|  and Martha Parke Custis, children from her previous marriage, and later their grandchildren  |Eleanor_Parke_Custis|Eleanor_Parke_Custis_Lewis|  and  |George_Washington_Parke_Custis|George_Washington_Parke_Custis|  . Washingtons 1751 bout with smallpox is thought to have rendered him sterile, though it is equally likely Martha may have sustained injury during the birth of Patsy, her final child, making additional births impossible. Chernow, R. . Washington: A life. New York, NY: Penguin Books. They lamented the fact that they had no children together. They moved to Mount Vernon, near  |Alexandria|Alexandria,_Virginia| , where he took up life as a planter of tobacco and wheat and emerged as a political figure.     The marriage gave Washington control over Marthas one-third  |dower|Dower|  interest in the   |Custis_estate|Daniel_Parke_Custisestate| , and he managed the remaining two-thirds for Marthas children; the estate also included 84 slaves. He became one of Virginias wealthiest men which increased his social standing.     At Washingtons urging, Governor  |Lord_Botetourt|Norborne_Berkeley,_4Th_Baron_Botetourt|  fulfilled Dinwiddies 1754 promise of land bounties to all volunteer militia during the French and Indian War. In late 1770, Washington inspected the lands in the  |Ohio|Ohio_River|  and  |Great_Kanawha|Kanawha_River|  regions, and he engaged surveyor  |William_Crawford|William_Crawford|  to subdivide it. Crawford allotted  to Washington; Washington told the veterans that their land was hilly and unsuitable for farming, and he agreed to purchase , leaving some feeling that they had been duped. He also doubled the size of Mount Vernon to  and increased its slave population to more than 100 by 1775.     As a respected military hero and large landowner, Washington held local offices and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758. He plied the voters with beer, brandy, and other beverages, although he was absent while serving on the Forbes Expedition. He won election with roughly 40 percent of the vote, defeating three other candidates with the help of several local supporters. He rarely spoke in his early legislative career, but he became a prominent critic of Britains taxation and mercantilist policies in the 1760s.          By occupation Washington was a planter, and he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting tobacco. His profligate spending combined with low tobacco prices left him £1,800 in debt by 1764, prompting him to diversify. In 1765, because of erosion and other soil problems he changed Mount Vernons primary cash crop from tobacco to wheat, and expanded operations to include corn  |flour_milling|George_Washingtons_Gristmill| , fishing, and other pursuits. Washington also took time for leisure with fox hunting, fishing, dances, theater, cards, backgammon, and billiards,     Washington soon was counted among the political and social elite in Virginia. From 1768 to 1775, he invited some 2,000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate, mostly those whom he considered people of rank . He became more politically active in 1769, presenting legislation in the  |Virginia_Assembly|Virginia_General_Assembly|  to establish an embargo on goods from Great Britain.     Washingtons stepdaughter Patsy Custis suffered from epileptic attacks from age 12, and she died in his arms in 1773. The following day, he wrote to  |Burwell_Bassett|Burwell_Bassett|  He canceled all business activity and remained with Martha every night for three months.            Washington played a central role before and during the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| . His disdain for the British military had begun when he was abashedly passed over for promotion into the Regular Army. He was opposed to the continuing taxes imposed by the British Parliament on the Colonies without  |proper_representation|Virtual_Representation| . He and other colonists were also angered by the  |Royal_Proclamation_of_1763|Royal_Proclamation_Of_1763|  which banned American settlement west of the  |Allegheny_Mountains|Allegheny_Mountains|  and protected the  |British_fur_trade|North_American_Fur_Trade| .     Washington believed that the  |Stamp_Act|Stamp_Act_1765|  of 1765 was an Act of Oppression , and he celebrated its repeal the following year. In March 1766, Parliament passed the  |Declaratory_Act|Declaratory_Act|  asserting that Parliamentary law superseded colonial law. Washington helped to lead widespread protests against the  |Townshend_Acts|Townshend_Acts|  passed by Parliament in 1767, and he introduced a proposal in May 1769 drafted by  |George_Mason|George_Mason|  which called Virginians to boycott English goods; the Acts were mostly repealed in 1770.     Parliament sought to punish Massachusetts colonists for their role in the  |Boston_Tea_Party|Boston_Tea_Party|  in 1774 by passing the  |Coersive_Acts|Intolerable_Acts| , which Washington referred to as an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges . He said Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny since custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway . That July, he and George Mason drafted a list of resolutions for the  |Fairfax_County|Fairfax_County,_Virginia|  committee which Washington chaired, and the committee adopted the  |Fairfax_Resolves|Fairfax_Resolves|  calling for a Continental Congress. On August 1, Washington attended the  |First_Virginia_Convention|Virginia_Conventions|  where he was selected as a delegate to the  |First_Continental_Congress|First_Continental_Congress| . As tensions rose in 1774, he assisted in the training of county militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the  |Continental_Association|Continental_Association|  boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress.     The  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War|  began on April 19, 1775 with the  |Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord|Battles_Of_Lexington_And_Concord|  and the  |Siege_of_Boston|Siege_Of_Boston| . The colonists were divided over breaking away from British rule and split into two factions:  |Patriots|Patriot|  who rejected British rule, and  |Loyalists|Loyalist|  who desired to remain subject to the British King. General  |Thomas_Gage|Thomas_Gage|  was commander of British forces in America at the beginning of the war. Upon hearing the shocking news of the onset of war, Washington was sobered and dismayed , and he hastily departed Mount Vernon on May 4, 1775 to join the Continental Congress in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania| .              |Congress|Second_Continental_Congress|  created the  |Continental_Army|Continental_Army|  on June 14, 1775, and  |Samuel|Samuel_Adams|  and  |John_Adams|John_Adams|  nominated Washington to become its commander in chief. Washington was chosen over  |John_Hancock|John_Hancock|  because of his military experience and the belief that a Virginian would better unite the colonies. He was considered an incisive leader who kept his ambition in check.  He was unanimously elected commander in chief by Congress the next day. |ner|Ner| |ssachuset|Ssachuset| |ldi|Ldi| |ldi|Ldi| |w_Yo|W_Yo| |ner|Ner| |erican,_Schwäbisch_Gmünd_1816–1868_Washington,_D.C.1851_painting18|Erican,_Schwäbisch_Gmünd_1816–1868_Washington,_D.C.1851_Painting18| |ner|Ner| |ldi|Ldi| 2,400 troops |nnsylvan|Nnsylvan| 700 |ner|Ner| 1,500 |See_map|:File:Battle_Of_Trenton.Dean.Usma.Edu.History.Gif| .including Colonel  |Johann_Rall|Johann_Rall| referred to as the  |Conway_Cabal|Conway_Cabal| |itish_Army_officer,_born_17|Itish_Army_Officer,_Born_17| |51–18|51–18| |itish_Army_officer,_born_17|Itish_Army_Officer,_Born_17| |ner|Ner| |itish_Army_officer,_born_17|Itish_Army_Officer,_Born_17| |54-17|54-17| |yali|Yali| |ited_Stat|Ited_Stat| |w_Yo|W_Yo| |ce_preside|Ce_Preside| |w_Yo|W_Yo| |9517|9517| |ancell|Ancell| |ited_Stat|Ited_Stat| Kentucky in 1792, Tennessee in 1796 |shington,_D.|Shington,_D.| |lbert_Stuart_portra|Lbert_Stuart_Portra| or indeed no crime at all2010 |iladelph|Iladelph| |ncinnati,_Oh|Ncinnati,_Oh| British allies |ptember_19,_17|Ptember_19,_17| |Piedmont|Piedmont| |Dr._William_Thornton|Dr._William_Thornton|  arrived some hours after Washington died. |inter18|Inter18| tracheal inflammation |rightrig|Rightrig| |chite|Chite| |ti|Ti| |r|R| |r|R| |02–16|02–16| his great-great-grandfatherthe Anglican Church |iscopal_prie|Iscopal_Prie| |edenborgi|Edenborgi| 20002001 |sh|Sh| 2003 |ldi|Ldi| 20052010201012 vols., 1834–18371931–44 |a|A| |ited_States_co|Ited_States_Co| the  |Washington_quarter|Washington_Quarter| cropped |ited_States_co|Ited_States_Co|.
