           Electric charge is the  |physical_property|Physical_Property|  of  |matter|Matter|  that causes it to experience a  |force|Force|  when placed in an  |electromagnetic_field|Electromagnetic_Field| . There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative . Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as . Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called  |classical_electrodynamics|Classical_Electrodynamics| , and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of  |quantum_effects|Quantum_Mechanics| .     Electric charge is a  |conserved_property|Conservation_Law| ; the net charge of an  |isolated_system|Isolated_System| , the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge, cannot change. Electric charge is carried by  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle| . In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by  |electrons|Electron| , and positive charge is carried by the  |protons|Proton|  in the  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus|  of  |atoms|Atom| . If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter, it will have a negative charge, if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. Charge is  quantized ; it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the  |elementary_charge|Elementary_Charge| , e, about , which is the smallest charge which can exist freely . The  |proton|Proton|  has a charge of +e, and the  |electron|Electron|  has a charge of −e.     An electric charge has an  |electric_field|Electric_Field| , and if the charge is moving it also generates a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| . The combination of the electric and magnetic field is called the  |electromagnetic_field|Electromagnetic_Field| , and its interaction with charges is the source of the  |electromagnetic_force|Electromagnetic_Force| , which is one of the four  |fundamental_forces|Fundamental_Interaction|  in  |physics|Physics| . The study of  |photon|Photons| -mediated interactions among charged particles is called  |quantum_electrodynamics|Quantum_Electrodynamics| .     The  |SI_derived_unit|Si_Derived_Unit|  of electric charge is the  |coulomb|Coulomb|  named after French physicist  |Charles_Augustin_de_Coulomb|Charles_Augustin_De_Coulomb| . In  |electrical_engineering|Electrical_Engineering| , it is also common to use the  |ampere_hour|Ampere_Hour|  ; in  |physics|Physics|  and  |chemistry|Chemistry| , it is common to use the elementary charge . Chemistry also uses the  |Faraday_constant|Faraday_Constant|  as the charge on a  |mole|Mole|  of electrons. The symbol Q often denotes charge.            Charge is the fundamental property of forms of matter that exhibit  |electrostatic|Electrostatic|  attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many  |subatomic_particles|Charged_Particle| . The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge e; we say that electric charge is  quantized .  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday| , in his  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge.  |Robert_Millikans|Robert_Millikan| |_oil_drop_experiment|Oil_Drop_Experiment|  demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge. It has been discovered that one type of particle,  |quarks|Quark| , have fractional charges of either − or +, but it is believed they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free-standing quarks have never been observed.      |By_convention|Convention| , the charge of an  |electron|Electron|  is negative, −e, while that of a  |proton|Proton|  is positive, +e. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract.  |Coulombs_law|Coulombs_Law|  quantifies the electrostatic  |force|Force|  between two particles by asserting that the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and  |inversely_proportional_to_the_square|Inverse_Square_Law|  of the distance between them. The charge of an  |antiparticle|Antiparticle|  equals that of the corresponding particle, but with opposite sign.     The electric charge of a  |macroscopic|Macroscopic|  object is the sum of the electric charges of the particles that make it up. This charge is often small, because matter is made of  |atoms|Atom| , and atoms typically have equal numbers of  |protons|Proton|  and  |electrons|Electron| , in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.     An  ion  is an atom that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge , or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge . Monatomic ions are formed from single atoms, while polyatomic ions are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.        During the formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral ionic compounds electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.     Sometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, can more or less easily take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as  |static_electricity|Static_Electricity| . This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing  |amber|Amber|  with  |fur|Fur|  or  |glass|Glass|  with  |silk|Silk| . In this way, non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of  conservation of charge  always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.     Even when an objects net charge is zero, the charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object . In such cases, the object is said to be  |polarized|Polarization_Density| . The charge due to polarization is known as  |bound_charge|Bound_Charge| , while the charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called free charge. The motion of electrons in conductive  |metals|Metal|  in a specific direction is known as  |electric_current|Electric_Current| .       The  |SI|International_System_Of_Units|  derived unit of  |quantity|Quantity|  of electric charge is the  |coulomb|Coulomb|  . The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that passes through the  |cross_section|Cross_Section|  of an  |electrical_conductor|Electrical_Conductor|  carrying one  |ampere|Ampere|  for one  |second|Second| .  This unit was proposed in 1946 and ratified in 1948. In modern practice, the phrase amount of charge is used instead of quantity of charge . , p. 150 The amount of charge in 1 electron  is approximately , and 1 coulomb corresponds to the amount of charge for about . The symbol Q is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge. The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an  |electrometer|Electrometer| , or indirectly measured with a  |ballistic_galvanometer|Galvanometer| .     After finding the  |quantized|Charge_Quantization|  character of charge, in 1891  |George_Stoney|George_Johnstone_Stoney|  proposed the unit electron for this fundamental unit of electrical charge. This was before the discovery of the particle by  |J_J_Thomson|J_J_Thomson|  in 1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as , , or simply as . A measure of charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge e, even if at  |large_scales|Macroscopic_Scale|  charge seems to behave as a  |real_quantity|Real_Number| . In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; for example in the charging of a  |capacitor|Capacitor| , or in the  |fractional_quantum_Hall_effect|Fractional_Quantum_Hall_Effect| .     The unit  |faraday|Faraday_Constant|  is sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons,  i.e. 96485.33289 C.     In systems of units other than SI such as  |cgs|Cgs| , electric charge is expressed as combination of only three fundamental quantities , and not four, as in SI, where electric charge is a combination of length, mass, time, and electric current.                   From ancient times, persons were familiar with four types of phenomena that today would all be explained using the concept of electric charge:  |lightning|Lightning| , the  |torpedo_fish|Torpedo_Fish|  ,  |St_Elmos_Fire|St_Elmos_Fire| , and that  |amber|Amber|  rubbed with  |fur|Fur|  would attract small, light objects.  The first account of the  is often attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician  |Thales_of_Miletus|Thales_Of_Miletus| , who lived from c. 624 – c. 546 BC, but there are doubts about whether Thales left any writings;  his account about amber is known from an account from early 200s. This account can be taken as evidence that the phenomenon was known since at least c. 600 BC, but Thales explained this phenomenon as evidence for inanimate objects having a soul.  In other words, there was no indication of any conception of electric charge. More generally, the ancient Greeks did not understand the connections among these four kinds of phenomena. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as  |hair|Hair| . They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an  |electric_spark|Electric_Spark|  to jump, but there is also a claim that no mention of electric sparks appeared until late 17th century.  This property derives from the  |triboelectric_effect|Triboelectric_Effect| .   In late 1100s, the substance  |jet|Jet| , a compacted form of coal, was noted to have an amber effect,  and in the middle of the 1500s,  |Girolamo_Fracastoro|Girolamo_Fracastoro| , discovered that  |diamond|Diamond|  also showed this effect.  Some efforts were made by Fracastoro and others, especially  |Gerolamo_Cardano|Gerolamo_Cardano|  to develop explanations for this phenomenon.      In contrast to  |astronomy|Astronomy| ,  |mechanics|Mechanics| , and  |optics|Optics| , which had been studied quantitatively since antiquity, the start of ongoing qualitative and quantitative research into electrical phenomena can be marked with the publication of  De Magnete  by the English scientist  |William_Gilbert|William_Gilbert|  in 1600.  In this book, there was a small section where Gilbert returned to the amber effect in addressing many of the earlier theories, and coined the  |New_Latin|New_Latin|  word electrica . The Latin word was translated into English as .     Gilbert is also credited with the term electrical, while the term electricity came later, first attributed to Sir  |Thomas_Browne|Thomas_Browne|  in his  |Pseudodoxia_Epidemica|Pseudodoxia_Epidemica|  from 1646.   Gilbert hypothesized that this amber effect could be explained by an effluvium that acts on other objects. This idea of a material electrical effluvium was influential in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was a precursor to ideas developed in the 18th century about electric fluid and electric charge.      Around 1663  |Otto_von_Guericke|Otto_Von_Guericke|  invented what was probably the first  |electrostatic_generator|Electrostatic_Generator| , but he did not recognize it primarily as an electrical device and only conducted minimal electrical experiments with it.   Other European pioneers were  |Robert_Boyle|Robert_Boyle| , who in 1675 published the first book in English that was devoted solely to electrical phenomena.  His work was largely a repetition of Gilberts studies, but he also identified several more electrics ,  and noted mutual attraction between two bodies.     In 1729  |Stephen_Gray|Stephen_Gray|  was experimenting with  |static_electricity|Static_Electricity| , which he generated using a glass tube. He noticed that a cork, used to protect the tube from dust and moisture, also became electrified . Further experiments showed – for the first time – that electrical effluvia could be transmitted over a distance. Gray managed to transmit charge with twine and wire .  Through these experiments, Gray discovered the importance of different materials, which facilitated or hindered the conduction of electrical effluvia.  |John_Theophilus_Desaguliers|John_Theophilus_Desaguliers| , who repeated many of Gray’s experiments, is credited with coining the terms  |conductors|Electrical_Conductor|  and  |insulators|Electrical_Insulation|  to refer to the effects of different materials in these experiments. Gray also discovered electrical induction . For example, he showed that by bringing a charged glass tube close to, but not touching, a lump of lead that was sustained by a thread, it was possible to make the lead become electrified .  He attempted to explain this phenomenon with the idea of electrical effluvia.      Gray’s discoveries introduced an important shift in the historical development of knowledge about electric charge. The fact that electrical effluvia could be transferred from one object to another, opened the theoretical possibility that this property was not inseparably connected to the bodies that were electrified by rubbing.  In 1733  |Charles_François_de_Cisternay_du_Fay|Charles_François_De_Cisternay_Du_Fay| , inspired by Grays work, made a series of experiments , showing that more or less all substances could be electrified by rubbing, except for metals and fluids  and proposed that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, which he expressed in terms of a two-fluid theory.  . sparkmuseum.com When  |glass|Glass|  was rubbed with  |silk|Silk| , du Fay said that the glass was charged with  vitreous electricity, and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was charged with  resin ous electricity. Another important two-fluid theory from this time was proposed by  |Jean_Antoine_Nollet|Jean_Antoine_Nollet|  .  In 1839,  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday|  showed that the apparent division between  |static_electricity|Static_Electricity| ,  |current_electricity|Electric_Current| , and  |bioelectricity|Bioelectricity|  was incorrect, and all were a consequence of the behavior of a single kind of  |electricity|Electricity|  appearing in opposite  |polarities|Electrical_Polarity| . It is arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative. Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a glass rod after being rubbed with silk. Roald K. Wangsness Electromagnetic Fields . Wiley. .     Up until about 1745, the main explanation for electrical attraction and repulsion was the idea that electrified bodies gave off an effluvium.     |Benjamin_Franklin|Benjamin_Franklin|  started electrical experiments in late 1746,  and by 1750 had developed a one- |fluid_theory_of_electricity|Fluid_Theory_Of_Electricity| , based on an experiment that showed that a rubbed glass received the same, but opposite, charge strength as the cloth used to rub the glass.  Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter; for example, he believed that it was the  |glass|Glass|  in a  |Leyden_jar|Leyden_Jar|  that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained too little of the fluid it was  charged, and when it had an excess it was  charged. He identified the term  with vitreous electricity and  with resinous electricity after performing an experiment with a glass tube he had received from his overseas colleague Peter Collinson. The experiment had participant A charge the glass tube and participant B receive a shock to the knuckle from the charged tube. Franklin identified participant B to be positively charged after having been shocked by the tube.   |William_Watson|William_Watson|  independently arrived at the same one-fluid explanation at about the same time . After Franklins work, effluvia-based explanations were rarely put forward.      It is now known that the Franklin–Watson model was fundamentally correct. There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge.      Until 1800 it was only possible to study conduction of electric charge by using an electrostatic discharge. In 1800  |Alessandro_Volta|Alessandro_Volta|  was the first to show that charge could be maintained in continuous motion through a closed path.         |Static_electricity|Static_Electricity|  refers to the electric charge of an object and the related  |electrostatic_discharge|Electrostatic_Discharge|  when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.             When a piece of glass and a piece of resin—neither of which exhibit any electrical properties—are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated, they attract each other.     A second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these phenomena:   The two pieces of glass repel each other.   Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin.   The two pieces of resin repel each other.     This attraction and repulsion is an electrical phenomenon, and the bodies that exhibit them are said to be electrified, or electrically charged. Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by friction. The electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.     If a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to be vitreously electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be resinously electrified. All electrified bodies are either vitreously or resinously electrified.     An established convention in the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention—just as it is a matter of convention in  |mathematical_diagram|Mathematical_Diagram|  to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.     No force, either of attraction or of repulsion, can be observed between an electrified body and a body not electrified.  |James_Clerk_Maxwell|James_Clerk_Maxwell|   A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism , pp. 32–33, Dover Publications        |Electric_current|Electric_Current|  is the flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge. The most common  |charge_carriers|Charge_Carriers|  are the positively charged  |proton|Proton|  and the negatively charged  |electron|Electron| . The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak of the  conventional current  without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.     At the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an  |electric_current|Electric_Current| , including: a flow of electrons; a flow of electron  |holes|Electron_Hole|  that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles  flowing in opposite directions in an  |electrolytic|Electrolyte| |_solution|Solution|  or a  |plasma|Plasma| .     Beware that, in the common and important case of metallic wires, the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the  |drift_velocity|Drift_Velocity|  of the actual charge carriers; i.e., the electrons. This is a source of confusion for beginners.               The total electric charge of an  |isolated_system|Isolated_System|  remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from  |gauge_invariance|Gauge_Invariance|  of the  |wave_function|Wave_Function| . The conservation of charge results in the charge-current  |continuity_equation|Continuity_Equation| . More generally, the rate of change in  |charge_density|Charge_Density|  ρ within a volume of integration V is equal to the area integral over the  |current_density|Current_Density|  J through the closed surface S ∂V, which is in turn equal to the net  |current|Electric_Current|  I     Thus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:   : I -      The charge transferred between times t  and t  is obtained by integrating both sides:   : Q   I      where I is the net outward current through a closed surface and Q is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.       Aside from the properties described in articles about  |electromagnetism|Electromagnetism| , charge is a  |relativistic|Theory_Of_Relativity| |_invariant|Charge_Invariance| . This means that any particle that has charge Q, no matter how fast it goes, always has charge Q. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of one  |helium|Helium| |_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|   is the same as two  |deuterium|Deuterium|  nuclei .
