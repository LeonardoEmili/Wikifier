   Holmium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Ho and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  67. Part of the  |lanthanide_series|Lanthanide_Series| , holmium is a  |rare_earth_element|Rare_Earth_Element| . Holmium was discovered by Swedish chemist  |Per_Theodor_Cleve|Per_Theodor_Cleve| . Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores in 1878. The elements name comes from Holmia, the Latin name for the city of  |Stockholm|Stockholm| .     Elemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white  |metal|Metal| . It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature, but when isolated, is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily and also burns in air when heated.     Holmium is found in the minerals  |monazite|Monazite|  and  |gadolinite|Gadolinite|  and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange|  techniques. Its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare-earth ions , and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass-colorant applications.     Holmium has the highest  |magnetic_permeability|Magnetic_Permeability|  of any element and therefore is used for the  |polepieces|Polepiece|  of the strongest static  |magnets|Magnet| . Because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used as a  |burnable_poison|Burnable_Poison|  in nuclear reactors.              Holmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly  |corrosion|Corrosion| -resistant and stable in dry air at  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Temperature_And_Pressure| . In moist air and at higher  |temperatures|Temperature| , however, it quickly  |oxidizes|Oxidation| , forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster.      |Holmium_oxide|Holmium_Oxide|  has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, it has a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is fiery orange-red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions. The perceived color change is related to the sharp absorption bands of holmium interacting with a subset of the sharp emission bands of the trivalent ions of europium and terbium, acting as phosphors.      Holmium has the highest  |magnetic_moment|Magnetic_Moment|   of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties. When combined with  |yttrium|Yttrium| , it forms highly  |magnetic|Magnetism|  compounds. Holmium is  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  at ambient conditions, but is  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  at temperatures below .        Holmium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form  |holmium_oxide|Holmium_Oxide| |HoCl_3_|Holmium_Chloride|    :2 Ho + 3 Br 2 → 2 HoBr 3   :2 Ho + 3 I 2 → 2 HoI 3     Holmium dissolves readily in dilute  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  to form solutions containing the yellow Ho ions, which exist as a 3+ complexes:      :2 Ho + 3 H 2 SO 4 → 2 Ho 3+ + 3  + 3 H 2     Holmiums most common oxidation state is +3. Holmium in  |solution|Solution|  is in the form of Ho 3+ surrounded by nine molecules of water. Holmium dissolves in acids.            |Natural|Nature|  holmium contains one  |stable|Stable| |_isotope|Isotope| , holmium-165. Some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known; the most stable one is holmium-163, with a half-life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have ground-state half-lives not greater than 1.117 days, and most have half-lives under 3 hours. However, the  |metastable|Metastable|  166m1 Ho has a half-life of around 1200 years because of its high  |spin|Spin| . This fact, combined with a high excitation energy resulting in a particularly rich spectrum of decay  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray|  produced when the metastable state de-excites, makes this isotope useful in  |nuclear_physics|Nuclear_Physics|  experiments as a means for calibrating energy responses and intrinsic efficiencies of  |gamma_ray_spectrometers|Gamma_Ray_Spectrometer| .       Holmium  was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  by  |Jacques_Louis_Soret|Jacques_Louis_Soret|  and  |Marc_Delafontaine|Marc_Delafontaine|  in 1878 who noticed the aberrant  |spectrographic|Spectrophotometry| |absorption_bands|Absorption_Band|  of the then-unknown element .       The following year,  |Per_Teodor_Cleve|Per_Teodor_Cleve|  independently discovered the element while he was working on  |erbia|Erbia|  earth .  Cleve named holmium on p. 480:  Je propose pour ce métal le nom de holmium, Ho, dérivé du nom latinisé de Stockholm, dont les environs renferment tant de minéraux riches en yttria.         Using the method developed by  |Carl_Gustaf_Mosander|Carl_Gustaf_Mosander| , Cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia and the green one thulia. Holmia was later found to be the  |holmium_oxide|Holmium_Oxide| , and thulia was  |thulium_oxide|Thulium_Oxide| .   In  |Henry_Moseleys|Henry_Moseley|  classic paper  on atomic numbers, holmium was assigned an atomic number of 66. Evidently, the holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been grossly impure, dominated by neighboring dysprosium. He would have seen x-ray emission lines for both elements, but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium, instead of the dysprosium impurity.          Like all other rare earths, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It does occur combined with other elements in  |gadolinite|Gadolinite|  ,  |monazite|Monazite|  and other rare-earth minerals. No holmium-dominant mineral has yet been found.  The main mining areas are  |China|China| ,  |United_States|United_States| ,  |Brazil|Brazil| ,  |India|India| ,  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka| , and  |Australia|Australia|  with reserves of holmium estimated as 400,000 tonnes.      Holmium makes up 1.4 parts per million of the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust|  by mass. This makes it the 56th most abundant element in the Earths crust. Holmium makes up 1 part per million of the  |soils|Soil| , 400 parts per quadrillion of  |seawater|Seawater| , and almost none of  |Earths_atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere| . Holmium is rare for a lanthanide.  It makes up 500 parts per trillion of the  |universe|Universe|  by mass.      It is commercially extracted by  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange|  from monazite sand , but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths. The element has been isolated through the  |reduction|Redox|  of its anhydrous  |chloride|Chloride|  or  |fluoride|Fluoride|  with metallic  |calcium|Calcium| . Its estimated abundance in the Earths crust is 1.3  mg/kg. Holmium obeys the  |Oddo–Harkins_rule|Oddo–Harkins_Rule| |dysprosium|Dysprosium|  and  |erbium|Erbium| . However, it is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavy  |lanthanides|Lanthanides| . The principal current source are some of the ion-adsorption clays of southern China. Some of these have a rare-earth composition similar to that found in  |xenotime|Xenotime|  or gadolinite.  |Yttrium|Yttrium|  makes up about 2/3 of the total by mass; holmium is around 1.5%. The original ores themselves are very lean, maybe only 0.1% total lanthanide, but are easily extracted.  Holmium is relatively inexpensive for a rare-earth metal with the price about 1000   |USD|Usd| /kg.           Holmium has the highest magnetic strength of any element, and therefore is used to create the strongest artificially generated  |magnetic_fields|Magnetic_Field| , when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece .  Since it can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, it is also used as a burnable poison to regulate nuclear reactors.     Holmium-doped  |yttrium_iron_garnet|Yttrium_Iron_Garnet|  and  |yttrium_lithium_fluoride|Yttrium_Lithium_Fluoride|  have applications in  |solid_state_lasers|Solid_State_Laser| , and Ho-YIG has applications in  |optical_isolators|Optical_Isolator|  and in  |microwave|Microwave|  equipment . Holmium lasers emit at 2.1 micrometres.  They are used in medical, dental, and fiber-optical applications.      Holmium is one of the colorants used for  |cubic_zirconia|Cubic_Zirconia|  and  |glass|Glass| , providing yellow or red coloring.  Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions  have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200–900  nm. They are therefore used as a calibration standard for  |optical_spectrophotometers|Monochromator|   and are available commercially.      The radioactive but long-lived 166m1 Ho is used in calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers.      In March 2017,  |IBM|Ibm|  announced that they had developed a technique to store one  |bit|Bit|  of data on a single holmium atom set on a bed of  |magnesium_oxide|Magnesium_Oxide| .      With sufficient quantum and classical control techniques, Ho could be a good candidate to make  |quantum_computers|Quantum_Computers| .        Holmium plays no biological role in  |humans|Human| , but its salts are able to stimulate  |metabolism|Metabolism| .  Humans typically consume about a milligram of holmium a year. Plants do not readily take up holmium from the soil. Some vegetables have had their holmium content measured, and it amounted to 100 parts per trillion.       Large amounts of holmium  |salts|Salt|  can cause severe damage if  |inhaled|Inhaled| , consumed  |orally|Mouth| , or  |injected|Injection| . The biological effects of holmium over a long period of time are not known. Holmium has a low level of  |acute_toxicity|Acute_Toxicity| .  in Periodic Table v2.5 .
