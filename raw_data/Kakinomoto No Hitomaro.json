A significant number of poems in the  Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū  were apparently recorded by Hitomaro before 690, and are characteristic of court poetry, leading to the conclusion that he was active at court from the early part of Emperor Tenmus reign. From this point he was active in recording and composing love poems at court.     Watase speculates that Hitomaro came to court in the service of the  in response to an imperial edict in 673.

Other scholars take the presence of shells as meaning Hitomaro died near the mouth of a river where it meets the sea.
