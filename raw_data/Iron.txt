            Iron  is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with  |symbol|Symbol|  Fe  and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  26. It is a  |metal|Metal|  that belongs to the  |first_transition_series|First_Transition_Series|  and  |group_8|Group_8_Element|  of the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| . It is by mass the most common element on  |Earth|Earth| , forming much of Earths  |outer|Outer_Core|  and  |inner_core|Inner_Core| . It is the fourth most common  |element_in_the_Earths_crust|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust| .     In its metallic state, iron is rare in the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust| , limited to deposition by  |meteorites|Meteorites| .  |Iron_ores|Iron_Ore| , by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earths crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires  |kilns|Kiln|  or  |furnaces|Furnace|  capable of reaching 1500  °C or higher, about 500  °C higher than what is enough to  |smelt|Smelting| |copper|Copper| . Humans started to master that process in  |Eurasia|Eurasia|  only about 2000 BCE, and the use of iron  |tools|Tool|  and  |weapons|Weapon|  began to displace  |copper_alloys|List_Of_Copper_Alloys| , in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  to the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| . In the  |modern_world|Modern_World| , iron alloys, such as  |steel|Steel| ,  |inox|Stainless_Steel| ,  |cast_iron|Cast_Iron|  and  |special_steels|Alloy_Steel|  are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their high mechanical properties and low cost.     Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |water|Water|  to give brown to black  |hydrate|Hydrate| d  |iron_oxides|Iron_Oxide| , commonly known as  |rust|Rust| . Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form  |passivating|Passivation|  layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.     The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams of iron, mostly in  |hemoglobin|Hemoglobin|  and  |myoglobin|Myoglobin| . These two  |proteins|Protein|  play essential roles in  |vertebrate|Vertebrate| |metabolism|Metabolism| , respectively  |oxygen_transport|Oxygen_Transport|  by  |blood|Blood|  and oxygen storage in  |muscles|Muscle| . To maintain the necessary levels,  |human_iron_metabolism|Human_Iron_Metabolism|  requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important  |redox|Redox| |enzymes|Enzymes|  dealing with  |cellular_respiration|Cellular_Respiration|  and  |oxidation_and_reduction|Oxidation_And_Reduction|  in plants and animals  .      Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are  |iron|Iron|  and  |iron|Iron| . Iron shares many properties of other  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| , including the other  |group_8_elements|Group_8_Element| ,  |ruthenium|Ruthenium|  and  |osmium|Osmium| . Iron forms compounds in a wide range of  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State| , −2 to +7. Iron also forms many  |coordination_compounds|Coordination_Compound| ; some of them, such as  |ferrocene|Ferrocene| ,  |ferrioxalate|Potassium_Ferrioxalate| , and  |Prussian_blue|Prussian_Blue| , have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.                 At least four allotropes of iron are known, conventionally denoted α, γ, δ, and ε.        The first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538  °C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, which has a  |body-centered_cubic|Body-Centered_Cubic| |crystal_structure|Crystal_Structure| . As it cools further to 1394  °C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a  |face-centered_cubic|Face-Centered_Cubic|  crystal structure, or  |austenite|Austenite| . At 912  °C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope.     The physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into another  |hexagonal_close-packed|Hexagonal_Close-Packed|  structure, which is also known as  |ε-iron|Hexaferrum| . The higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher pressure.     Some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable β phase at pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K. It is supposed to have an  |orthorhombic|Orthorhombic|  or a double hcp structure.      The  |inner_core|Inner_Core|  of the  |Earth|Earth|  is generally presumed to consist of an iron- |nickel|Nickel| |alloy|Alloy|  with ε structure.        The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its  |enthalpy_of_atomization|Enthalpy_Of_Atomization| , are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from  |scandium|Scandium|  to  |chromium|Chromium| , showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1116 however, they are higher than the values for the previous element  |manganese|Manganese|  because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.     The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than 50  GPa. For greater pressures, published data still varies by tens of gigapascals and over a thousand kelvin.           Below its  |Curie_point|Curie_Point|  of 770  °C, α-iron changes from  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  to  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic| |spins|Spin|  of the two unpaired electrons in each atom generally align with the spins of its neighbors, creating an overall  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| .  This happens because the orbitals of those two electrons  do not point toward neighboring atoms in the lattice, and therefore are not involved in metallic bonding.     In the absence of an external source of magnetic field, the atoms get spontaneously partitioned into  |magnetic_domains|Magnetic_Domain| , about 10  micrometers across,   such that the atoms in each domain have parallel spins, but different domains have other orientations. Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field.     Application of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field. This effect is exploited in devices that needs to channel magnetic fields, such as  |electrical_transformers|Electrical_Transformer| ,  |magnetic_recording|Magnetic_Recording|  heads, and  |electric_motors|Electric_Motor| . Impurities,  |lattice_defects|Lattice_Defect| , or grain and particle boundaries can pin the domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed -- thus turning the iron object into a  |magnet|Magnet| .     Similar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the ferrites and the mineral  |magnetite|Magnetite| , a crystalline form of the mixed iron oxide  . Pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization  provided the earliest  |compass|Compass| es for navigation. Particles of magnetite were extensively used in magnetic recording media such as  |core_memories|Computer_Memory| ,  |magnetic_tapes|Magnetic_Tape| ,  |floppies|Floppy_Disk| , and  |disks|Hard_Disk_Drive| , until they were replaced by  |cobalt|Cobalt| -based materials.          Iron has four stable  |isotopes|Isotope| : 54 Fe ,  |56_Fe|Iron-56|  , 57 Fe and 58 Fe . 20-30 artificial isotopes have also been created. Of these stable isotopes, only 57 Fe has a  |nuclear_spin|Nuclear_Spin|  . The  |nuclide|Nuclide|  54 Fe theoretically can undergo  |double_electron_capture|Double_Beta_Decay|  to 54 Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×10 22 years has been established.      60 Fe is an  |extinct_radionuclide|Extinct_Radionuclide|  of long  |half-life|Half-Life|  .  It is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter, the stable nuclide  |60_Ni|Nickel-60| . Much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the  |nucleosynthesis|Nucleosynthesis|  of 60 Fe through studies of  |meteorites|Meteorite|  and ore formation. In the last decade, advances in  |mass_spectrometry|Mass_Spectrometry|  have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  |stable_isotopes|Stable_Isotope|  of iron. Much of this work is driven by the  |Earth|Earth_Science|  and  |planetary_science|Planetary_Science|  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging.      In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut, a correlation between the concentration of 60 Ni, the  |granddaughter|Daughter_Product|  of 60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of 60 Fe at the time of  |formation_of_the_Solar_System|Formation_And_Evolution_Of_The_Solar_System| . Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60 Fe, along with that released by  |26_Al|Aluminium-26| , contributed to the remelting and  |differentiation|Planetary_Differentiation|  of  |asteroids|Asteroid|  after their formation 4.6  billion years ago. The abundance of 60 Ni present in  |extraterrestrial|Wikt:Extraterrestrial|  material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| .      The most abundant iron isotope 56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of  |nucleosynthesis|Nucleosynthesis| .  Since 56 Ni  is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  |alpha_process|Alpha_Process|  in  |nuclear_reactions|Nuclear_Reaction|  in supernovae , it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  |extremely_massive_stars|Population_Iii_Stars| , since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60 Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56 Ni, which has a half-life of about 6  days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  |supernova_remnant|Supernova_Remnant|  gas cloud, first to radioactive 56 Co, and then to stable 56 Fe. As such, iron is the most abundant element in the core of  |red_giants|Red_Giant| , and is the most abundant metal in  |iron_meteorites|Iron_Meteorite|  and in the dense metal  |cores_of_planets|Planetary_Core|  such as  |Earth|Earth| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 12 It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable  |metals|Metallicity|  of approximately the same  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Mass| .  Iron is the sixth most  |abundant_element|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in the  |Universe|Universe| , and the most common  |refractory|Refractory|  element.      Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  |62_Ni|Nickel-62| , which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56 Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56 Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62 Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons.  Hence, elements heavier than iron require a  |supernova|Supernova|  for their formation, involving  |rapid_neutron_capture|R-Process|  by starting 56 Fe nuclei.     In the  |far_future|Timeline_Of_The_Far_Future|  of the universe, assuming that  |proton_decay|Proton_Decay|  does not occur, cold  |fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  occurring via  |quantum_tunnelling|Quantum_Tunnelling|  would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56 Fe nuclei. Fission and  |alpha-particle_emission|Alpha_Decay|  would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.          Irons abundance in  |rocky_planets|Terrestrial_Planet|  like Earth is due to its abundant production by  |fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  in high-mass  |stars|Star| , where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a  |supernova|Type_Ii_Supernova| , which scatters the iron into space.          Metallic or  |native_iron|Native_Iron|  is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize. However, both the Earths  |inner|Inner_Core|  and  |outer_core|Outer_Core| , that account for 35% of the mass of the whole Earth, are believed to consist largely of an iron alloy, possibly with  |nickel|Nickel| . Electric currents in the liquid outer core are believed to be the origin of the  |Earths_magnetic_field|Earths_Magnetic_Field| . The other  |terrestrial_planets|Terrestrial_Planet|   as well as the  |Moon|Moon|  are believed to have a metallic core consisting mostly of iron. The  |M-type_asteroids|M-Type_Asteroid|  are also believed to be partly or mostly made of metallic iron alloy.     The rare  |iron_meteorites|Iron_Meteorite|  are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earths surface. Items made of  |cold-worked|Cold_Forging|  meteoritic iron have been found in various archaeological sites dating from a time when iron smelting had not yet been developed; and the  |Inuit|Inuit_People|  in  |Greenland|Greenland|  have been reported to use iron from the  |Cape_York_meteorite|Cape_York_Meteorite|  for tools and hunting weapons.  About 1 in 20  |meteorites|Meteorite|  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  |taenite|Taenite|  and  |kamacite|Kamacite|  .         |Ferropericlase|Ferropericlase|  O, a solid solution of  |periclase|Periclase|  and  |wüstite|Wüstite|  , makes up about 20% of the volume of the  |lower_mantle|Lower_Mantle|  of the Earth, which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after  |silicate_perovskite|Silicate_Perovskite|  SiO 3 ; it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle. Stark, Anne M. .  |Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory|Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory|  At the bottom of the  |transition_zone|Transition_Zone|  of the mantle, the reaction γ- 2 ↔ + O transforms  |γ-olivine|Ringwoodite|  into a mixture of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase and vice versa. In the literature, this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesiowüstite. . Mindat.org  |Silicate_perovskite|Silicate_Perovskite|  may form up to 93% of the lower mantle,  and the magnesium iron form, SiO 3 , is considered to be the most abundant  |mineral|Mineral|  in the Earth, making up 38% of its volume.           While iron is the most abundant element on Earth, it accounts for only 5% of the  |Earths_crust|Crust| ; thus being only the fourth most abundant element, after  |oxygen|Oxygen| ,  |silicon|Silicon| , and  |aluminium|Aluminium| .      Most of the iron in the crust is combined with various other elements to form many  |iron_minerals|Iron_Mineral| . An important class is the  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  minerals such as  |hematite|Hematite|  ,  |magnetite|Magnetite|  , and  |siderite|Siderite|  , which are the major  |ores_of_iron|Iron_Ore| . Many  |igneous_rocks|Igneous_Rock|  also contain the sulfide minerals  |pyrrhotite|Pyrrhotite|  and  |pentlandite|Pentlandite| .  Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut, Jr. Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 20th ed, pp. 278–79  During  |weathering|Weathering| , iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1071        Large deposits of iron are  |banded_iron_formations|Banded_Iron_Formations| , a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron-poor  |shale|Shale|  and  |chert|Chert| . The banded iron formations were laid down in the time between  and .       Materials containing finely ground iron oxides or oxide-hydroxides, such as  |ochre|Ochre| , have been used as yellow, red, and brown  |pigments|Pigment|  since pre-historical times. They contribute as well to the color of various rocks and  |clays|Clay| , including entire geological formations like the  |Painted_Hills|Painted_Hills|  in  |Oregon|Oregon|  and the  |Buntsandstein|Buntsandstein|  . Dickinson, Robert E. .  Germany: A regional and economic geography  . London: Methuen. Through Eisensandstein   Landesamt für Geologie, Rohstoffe und Bergbau, Baden-Württemberg and  |Bath_stone|Bath_Stone|  in the UK, iron compounds are responsible for the yellowish color of many historical buildings and sculptures.  The proverbial  |red_color_of_the_surface_of_Mars|Mars_Surface_Color|  is derived from an iron oxide-rich  |regolith|Regolith| .      Significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral  |pyrite|Pyrite|  , but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not exploited. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it.     According to the  |International_Resource_Panels|International_Resource_Panel| |Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report|Metal_Stocks_In_Society_Report| , the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200  kg per capita. More-developed countries differ in this respect from less-developed countries . , 2010,  |International_Resource_Panel|International_Resource_Panel| ,  |UNEP|Unep|                  Iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| , namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound,  |ferrocene|Ferrocene| , that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 905 Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the  |configuration|Electron_Configuration|  d 6 4s 2 , of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.     Iron forms compounds mainly in the  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  +2  and +3 . Iron also occurs in  |higher_oxidation_states|High-Valent_Iron| , e.g. the purple  |potassium_ferrate|Potassium_Ferrate|  , which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state. Although iron oxide has been claimed, the report could not be reproduced and such a species has been found to be improbable computationally.  However, one form of anionic – with iron in its +7 oxidation state, along with an iron-peroxo isomer, has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4 K after cocondensation of laser-ablated Fe atoms with a mixture of O 2 /Ar.  Iron is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions.   Numerous  |organoiron|Organoiron_Chemistry|  compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2. The oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of  |Mössbauer_spectroscopy|Mössbauer_Spectroscopy| .    Many  |mixed_valence_compounds|Mixed_Valence_Compound|  contain both iron and iron centers, such as  |magnetite|Magnetite|  and  |Prussian_blue|Prussian_Blue|  . The latter is used as the traditional blue in  |blueprints|Blueprint| .      Iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium. Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In the second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors  |cobalt|Cobalt|  and  |nickel|Nickel|  in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at  |room_temperature|Room_Temperature|  and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the  |iron_triad|Iron_Triad| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1070     Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with  |mercury|Mercury| . As a result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks made of iron.      Iron is by far the most reactive element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe 2+ . However, it does not react with concentrated  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| .            Iron forms various  |oxide_and_hydroxide_compounds|Iron_Oxide| ; the most common are  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  , and  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  .  |Iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all  |non-stoichiometric_compounds|Non-Stoichiometric_Compound|  whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron . They are also used in the production of  |ferrites|Ferrite| , useful  |magnetic_storage|Magnetic_Storage|  media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is  |iron_pyrite|Iron_Pyrite|  , also known as fools gold owing to its golden luster. It is not an iron compound, but is actually an iron  |polysulfide|Polysulfide|  containing Fe 2+ and  ions in a distorted  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride|  structure. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1079               The binary ferrous and ferric  |halides|Halide|  are well-known. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding  |hydrohalic_acid|Hydrohalic_Acid|  to give the corresponding hydrated salts.   :Fe + 2 HX → FeX 2 + H 2   Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides,  |ferric_chloride|Ferric_Chloride|  being the most common.   :2 Fe + 3 X 2 → 2 FeX 3   Ferric iodide is an exception, being thermodynamically unstable due to the oxidizing power of Fe 3+ and the high reducing power of I − :   :2 I − + 2 Fe 3+ → I 2 + 2 Fe 2+     Ferric iodide, a black solid, is not stable in ordinary conditions, but can be prepared through the reaction of  |iron_pentacarbonyl|Iron_Pentacarbonyl|  with  |iodine|Iodine|  and  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  in the presence of  |hexane|Hexane|  and light at the temperature of −20  °C, with oxygen and water excluded.          The  |standard_reduction_potentials|Standard_Reduction_Potential|  in acidic aqueous solution for some common iron ions are given below: Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1075–79        The red-purple tetrahedral  |ferrate|Ferrate|  anion is such a strong oxidizing agent that it oxidizes nitrogen and ammonia at room temperature, and even water itself in acidic or neutral solutions: Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1082–84   :4  + 10  → 4  + 20  + 3 O 2     The Fe 3+ ion has a large simple cationic chemistry, although the pale-violet hexaquo ion 3+ is very readily hydrolyzed when pH increases above 0 as follows: Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1088–91               As pH rises above 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  precipitates out of solution. Although Fe 3+ has an d 5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn 2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe 3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal  |charge_transfer|Charge-Transfer_Complex|  absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when  |carbonate|Carbonate|  anions are added, which instead results in white  |iron_carbonate|Iron_Carbonate|  being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1091–97       Due to its electronic structure, iron has a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry.      Many coordination compounds of iron are known. A typical six-coordinate anion is hexachloroferrate, 3− , found in the mixed  |salt|Salt| |tetrakis_hexachloroferrate_chloride|Tetrakis_Hexachloroferrate_Chloride| .   Complexes with multiple bidentate ligands have  |geometric_isomers|Geometric_Isomer| . For example, the trans- |chlorohydridobisiron|Chlorohydridobisiron|  complex is used as a starting material for compounds with the Fe 2  |moiety|Moiety| .   The ferrioxalate ion with three  |oxalate|Oxalate|  ligands displays  |helical_chirality|Helical_Chirality|  with its two non-superposable geometries labelled Λ for the left-handed screw axis and Δ for the right-handed screw axis, in line with IUPAC conventions.  |Potassium_ferrioxalate|Potassium_Ferrioxalate|  is used in chemical  |actinometry|Actinometry|  and along with its  |sodium_salt|Sodium_Ferrioxalate|  undergoes  |photoreduction|Photoreduction|  applied in old-style photographic processes. The  |dihydrate|Hydrate|  of  |iron_oxalate|Iron_Oxalate|  has a  |polymer|Polymer| ic structure with co-planar oxalate ions bridging between iron centres with the water of crystallisation located forming the caps of each octahedron, as illustrated below.            Iron complexes are quite similar to those of  |chromium|Chromium|  with the exception of irons preference for O-donor instead of N-donor ligands. The latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron complexes and often dissociate in water. Many Fe–O complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for  |phenols|Phenol|  or  |enols|Enol| . For example, in the  |ferric_chloride_test|Ferric_Chloride_Test| , used to determine the presence of phenols,  |iron_chloride|Iron_Chloride|  reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex:     :3 ArOH + FeCl 3 → Fe 3 + 3 HCl      Among the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron are the most stable, with the colorless 2− being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in − ; − and − are reduced easily to iron.  |Thiocyanate|Thiocyanate|  is a common test for the presence of iron as it forms the blood-red 2+ . Like manganese, most iron complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the  |spectrochemical_series|Spectrochemical_Series|  such as  |cyanide|Cyanide| . An example of a low-spin iron complex is 3− . The cyanide ligands may easily be detached in 3− , and hence this complex is poisonous, unlike the iron complex 4− found in Prussian blue, which does not release  |hydrogen_cyanide|Hydrogen_Cyanide|  except when dilute acids are added. Iron shows a great variety of electronic  |spin_states|Spin_States| , including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 to  . This value is always half the number of unpaired electrons. Complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five are considered high-spin.     Iron complexes are less stable than iron complexes but the preference for O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They have a tendency to be oxidized to iron but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.           |Organoiron_chemistry|Organoiron_Chemistry|  is the study of  |organometallic_compounds|Organometallic_Compound|  of iron, where carbon atoms are covalently bound to the metal atom. They are many and varied, including  |cyanide_complexes|Cyanometallate| ,  |carbonyl_complex|Carbonyl_Complex| es,  |sandwich|Sandwich_Compound|  and  |half-sandwich_compounds|Half-Sandwich_Compound| .         |Prussian_blue|Prussian_Blue|  or ferric ferrocyanide , Fe 4 3 , is an old and well-known iron-cyanide complex, extensively used as pigment and in several other applications. Its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ as they react with  |potassium_ferricyanide|Potassium_Ferricyanide|  and  |potassium_ferrocyanide|Potassium_Ferrocyanide|  to form Prussian blue.     Another old example of organoiron compound is  |iron_pentacarbonyl|Iron_Pentacarbonyl| , Fe 5 , in which a neutral iron atom is bound to the carbon atoms of five  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  molecules. The compound can be used to make  |carbonyl_iron|Carbonyl_Iron|  powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives  |triiron_dodecacarbonyl|Triiron_Dodecacarbonyl| , , a with a cluster of three iron atoms at its core. Collmans reagent,  |disodium_tetracarbonylferrate|Disodium_Tetracarbonylferrate| , is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state.  |Cyclopentadienyliron_dicarbonyl_dimer|Cyclopentadienyliron_Dicarbonyl_Dimer|  contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state. .        A landmark in this field was the discovery in 1951 of the remarkably stable  |sandwich_compound|Sandwich_Compound| |ferrocene|Ferrocene|  , by  |Paulson|Peter_L._Paulson|  and  |Kealy|T._J.Kealy|   and independently by  |Miller|S._A._Miller|  and others,  whose surprising molecular structure was determined only a year later by  |Woodward|Robert_Burns_Woodward|  and  |Wilkinson|Geoffrey_Wilkinson|   and  |Fischer|Ernst_Otto_Fischer| .    Ferrocene is still one of the most important tools and models in this class. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1104     Iron-centered organometallic species are used as  |catalysts|Catalyst| . The  |Knölker_complex|Knölker_Complex| , for example, is a  |transfer_hydrogenation|Transfer_Hydrogenation|  catalyst for  |ketones|Ketone| .        The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are  |iron_sulfate|Iron_Sulfate|   and  |iron_chloride|Iron_Chloride|  . The former is one of the most readily available sources of iron, but is less stable to aerial oxidation than  |Mohrs_salt|Mohrs_Salt|  . Iron compounds tend to be oxidized to iron compounds in the air.          As iron has been in use for such a long time, it has many names. The source of its chemical symbol Fe is the Latin word ferrum, and its descendants are the names of the element in the  |Romance_languages|Romance_Language|  .  The word ferrum itself possibly comes from the  |Semitic_languages|Semitic_Language| , via  |Etruscan|Etruscan_Language| , from a root that also gave rise to  |Old_English|Old_English_Language|  bræs  |brass|Brass|  .    The English word iron derives ultimately from  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic_Language|  isarnan, which is also the source of the German name Eisen. It was most likely borrowed from  |Celtic|Celtic_Languages|  isarnon, which ultimately comes from  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European|  is-ro- powerful, holy and finally eis strong , referencing irons strength as a metal.    Kluge relates isarnon to Illyric and Latin  ira , wrathe.g.  |Russian|Russian_Language|  железо zhelezo,  |Polish|Polish_Language|  żelazo,  |Lithuanian|Lithuanian_Language|  geležis |traditional|Traditional_Chinese|  鐵;  |simplified|Simplified_Chinese|  铁similar to how iron is referenced in the English word  |blacksmith|Blacksmith| Kokugo Dai Jiten, Revised Editionin Japanese1990 1suggesting smelting in  |Anatolia|Anatolia|  or the  |Caucasus|Caucasus| compare  |history_of_metallurgy_in_South_Asia|History_Of_Metallurgy_In_South_Asia| metal2001EJVS19372009eds.2008ed.200119931999403–221 BC1999or bar iron |tallur|Tallur| |tallurgi|Tallurgi| 2007eds.in this context known as  |pig_iron|Pig_Iron| 1986e.g. French, Spanish, Italian and Germanwith smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron  |taph|Taph| lines 109–201I gave gold for iron1981Art of Prussian cast iron1963ed.  |coal|Coal|  that has been separately baked to remove volatile components |tallur|Tallur| |calcium_carbonate|Calcium_Carbonate| |ner|Ner| calcium-magnesium carbonatewith the slag on top |tallur|Tallur| 1975with heat and a catalystwith up to about 2% carboncommercially pure iron |tallur|Tallur| |il_transpo|Il_Transpo|  99.99% |emist|Emist| no more than 0.021% by mass at 910  °Cγ-ironas much as 2.04% by mass at 1146  °CFe 3 C |emist|Emist| |e|E| OHOHformed when atmospheric  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide|  attacks ironlike  |rail|Railroad| sIIIsee  |high-valent_iron|High-Valent_Iron| |olo|Olo| biological iron molecules |ochemist|Ochemist| predominantly as  |bicarbonate|Bicarbonate|  anionsand is then called deoxyhemoglobinin the hydrophobic protein interiorAdditionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O 2 –Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ , and the destruction of hemoglobin.named after  |Christian_Bohr|Christian_Bohr| , the father of  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr| 5 March 2012relative to iron sulfateIOMEARsRDAspost menopauseULsEFSAPRI%DVwomen of child-bearing age |dici|Dici| |rculato|Rculato| DRIUL .
