In the Cook Islands to the east, the tradition is that Karika, or Tui Manua Alia, came to the Cook Islands from Manua; suggesting that it was from Manua and Samoa that the rest of Polynesia developed.     The Tui Manua gained his name when he first defeated Tagaloa in a battle over the Faleula , and in doing so was injured gaining the name Tui Manua approximately 2,000 years ago.   Also there are oral traditions that the name of Samoa based upon Sa Moa sacred center, where Lu finally defeated Tagaloa and took all his power and married his daughter. The TuiAtua was one of Tagaloas titles. Moa was also the family name of the Tui Manua so another interpretation is that SaMoa is the family of Moa, the Tui Manua. Tui Manua and Leifi TuiAtua Faanonofo ruled Samoa. Tui Manua was the elder brother and there are still 2 posts in the meeting house of the Tui Manua where only two kings are allowed to sit. The Tui Manua and Leifi. The Tui Manua controlled a pacific empire, extending over Tonga Fiji, cook islands etc, and Leifi was his war leader. He also fought internal wars. The Red fish of Manua went to war and destroyed the Shark of Savaii.     Leifi also would bestow another TuiAtua title. The TuiAtiua title has always been bestowed by Leifi, mostly in the last 1,000 years at his malae of Kings at Lufilufi. Various families and people would competeeg sons of the TuiManua and Leifi would decide who he would give it to. In more modern times, it was mainly the Tama Aiga that Leifi/Fuataga would bestow the TuiAtua on, eg Salamasina.   The Papa or 4 titles were all originally created by Leifi, but were later brought together by the Tama Aiga as an important collection of titles. Leifi bestowed the Tui Atua and created the Tui Aana. He had originally made the Vaetamasoalii and the Ngailetoatele which the people of Aana and Tuamasaga had asked for, as he would not give them a Tui title. However he had destroyed these lesser titles when he created the TuiAana title at his malae, at the last Tofiga of Kings with the Tui Manua present. This was the last Samoan Tui created.     This was for services rendered to him by the people of Aaana in a war against Tuamasaga. This was over the theft of the Pua tree and the people of Aana had located it with the Tuamasaga, and killed many to return it. They had piled the bodies of the Tuamasaga warriors as high as a tree, so the saying goes, piled as high as a tree. Then they returned it to Fogaa. Thereby the saying , take all good things to FGogaa.     Later the 2 lesser titles were used as womens names and these similar ones were passed off as the ancient original ones. These are the Natoitele, and Tamasoalii.     The Tui Manua was ended by the US govt. The bestowed TuiAtua ruled Samoa, but part of Samoa was taken over during the Tongan invasion.     Originally Samoans and Tongans were one people, but as numbers increased, Fiji and Tonga became separate and then made their own Tui titles, Tuifiti and TuiTonga. One of Leifis titles was Defender of Manua, and his island was Tutuila. Leifi fought off many waves of invasion from Fiji and Tonga.   Leifi became Fuataga , TuiAtua Faanofonofo , the Matua, . Leifi also created and bestowed the Tui Aana title and gave the people of Aana control and right to bestow it. There is an ancient saying All honours of Samoa come from Leifi .
