        Peter Sellers,  |CBE|Order_Of_The_British_Empire|   was an English film actor, comedian and singer. He performed in the BBC Radio comedy series  The Goon Show , featured on a number of hit comic songs, and became known to a worldwide audience through his many film roles, among them  |Chief_Inspector_Clouseau|Inspector_Clouseau|  in  The Pink Panther  series of films.     Born in  |Portsmouth|Portsmouth|  to a theatrical family, Sellers made his stage debut at the  |Kings_Theatre_Southsea|Kings_Theatre_Southsea| , when he was two weeks old. He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the  |Entertainments_National_Service_Association|Entertainments_National_Service_Association|  . He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in  |Ralph_Readers|Ralph_Reader|  wartime  |Gang_Show|Gang_Show|  entertainment troupe, which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in ShowTime, and eventually became a regular performer on various  |BBC_radio|Bbc_Radio|  shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with  |Spike_Milligan|Spike_Milligan| ,  |Harry_Secombe|Harry_Secombe| , and  |Michael_Bentine|Michael_Bentine| , took part in the successful radio series The Goon Show, which ended in 1960.     Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often  |parody|Parody| ing characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include  Im All Right Jack  ,  |Stanley_Kubricks|Stanley_Kubrick|   Lolita  and  Dr. Strangelove  ,  Whats New, Pussycat?  ,  Casino Royale  ,  The Party  ,  Being There  and five films of the Pink Panther series . Sellerss versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he often assumed multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles.  |Satire|Satire|  and  |black_humour|Black_Comedy|  were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an  |Academy_Award|Academy_Award| , twice for the  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor|Academy_Award_For_Best_Actor| , for his performances in Dr. Strangelove and Being There, and once for the  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Live_Action_Short_Film|Academy_Award_For_Best_Live_Action_Short_Film|  for  The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film  . He won the  |BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Leading_Role|Bafta_Award_For_Best_Actor_In_A_Leading_Role|  twice, for Im All Right Jack and for the original Pink Panther film, The Pink Panther and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the  |Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_–_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Actor_Nbsp_–_Motion_Picture_Musical_Or_Comedy|  for his role in Being There, and was previously nominated three times in the same category.  |Turner_Classic_Movies|Turner_Classic_Movies|  calls Sellers one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century .      In his personal life, Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities. An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played. His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive, and he frequently clashed with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s when his physical and mental health, together with his alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst. Sellers was married four times, and had three children from his first two marriages. He died from a heart attack aged 54, in 1980. English filmmakers the  |Boulting_brothers|Boulting_Brothers|  described Sellers as the greatest comic genius this country has produced since  |Charles_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin|  .                Sellers was born on 8 September 1925, in  |Southsea|Southsea| , a suburb of  |Portsmouth|Portsmouth| . His parents were  |Yorkshire|Yorkshire| -born William Bill Sellers and Agnes Doreen Peg . Both were variety entertainers; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe. Although christened Richard Henry, his parents called him Peter, after his elder brother, who was  |stillborn|Stillborn| . His parents had no other children. Peg Sellers was related to the  |pugilist|Pugilist| |_Daniel_Mendoza|Daniel_Mendoza|  , whom Sellers greatly revered, and whose engraving later hung in his office. At one time Sellers planned to use Mendozas image for his production companys logo.     Sellers was two weeks old when he was carried on stage by Dick Henderson, the headline act at the  |Kings_Theatre|Kings_Theatre_Southsea|  in Southsea: the crowd sang  |For_Hes_a_Jolly_Good_Fellow|For_Hes_A_Jolly_Good_Fellow|  , which caused the infant to cry. The family constantly toured, causing much upheaval and unhappiness in the young Sellers life.     Sellers maintained a very close relationship with his mother. His friend  |Spike_Milligan|Spike_Milligan|  later considered it unhealthy for a grown man. Sellerss agent, Dennis Selinger, recalled his first meeting with Peg and Peter Sellers, noting that Sellers was an immensely shy young man, inclined to be dominated by his mother, but without resentment or objection . As an only child, though, he spent much time alone.       In 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in  |Muswell_Hill|Muswell_Hill| . Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers attended the North London  |Roman_Catholic_school|Catholic_School| |_St_Aloysius_College|St_Aloysius_College_London| , run by the  |Brothers_of_Our_Lady_of_Mercy|Brothers_Of_Mercy_Of_Our_Lady_Of_Perpetual_Help| . The family was not rich, but Peg insisted on this expensive private schooling for her son. According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age, particularly Catholicism;  |Roger_Lewis|Roger_Lewis|  believed that soon after entering Catholic school, Sellers discovered he was a Jew—he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith . Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his fathers faith was according to the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , his mother was  |Jewish|Jewish| , and Jews take the faith of their mother.  According to Milligan, Sellers held a guilt complex about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once reduced to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur. Sellers became a top student at the school, excelling in drawing in particular. He was prone to laziness, but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers. Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: The Jewish boy knows his  |catechism|Catechism|  better than the rest of you!        Accompanying his family on the variety show circuit, Sellers learned  |stagecraft|Stagecraft| , but received conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Sellerss abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his sons talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Sellerss mother encouraged him continuously.     While at St Aloysius College, Sellers began to develop his improvisational skills. He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, both enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows. Connon remembers that Peter got endless pleasure imitating the people in  Monday Night at Eight . He had a gift for improvising dialogue. Sketches, too. Id be the straight man, the feed,  ... Id cue Peter and hed do all the radio personalities and chuck in a few voices of his own invention as well.        With the outbreak of the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  in 1939, St Aloysius College was  |evacuated|Evacuations_Of_Civilians_In_Britain_During_World_War_Ii|  to  |Cambridgeshire|Cambridgeshire| . Because his mother did not allow Sellers to go, his formal education ended at fourteen. Early in 1940, the family moved to the north  |Devon|Devon|  town of  |Ilfracombe|Ilfracombe| , where Sellerss maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre; Sellers got his first job at the theatre, aged fifteen, starting as a caretaker. He was steadily promoted, becoming a box office clerk, usher, assistant stage manager and lighting operator. He was also offered some small acting parts. Working backstage gave him a chance to study actors such as  |Paul_Scofield|Paul_Scofield| . He became close friends with Derek Altman, and together they launched Sellerss first stage act under the name Altman and Sellers , consisting of playing  |ukuleles|Ukulele| , singing, and telling jokes.     During his backstage theatre job, Sellers began practising on a set of drums that belonged to the band  |Joe_Daniels|Joe_Daniels|  and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellerss temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation. As the war progressed, Sellers continued to develop his drumming skills, and played with a series of touring bands, including those of  |Oscar_Rabin|Oscar_Rabin| ,  |Henry_Hall|Henry_Hall|  and  |Waldini|Waldini| , as well as his fathers quartet, before he left and joined a band from  |Blackpool|Blackpool| . Sellers became a member of the  |Entertainments_National_Service_Association|Entertainments_National_Service_Association|  , which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of  |George_Formby|George_Formby| , with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.     In September 1943, he joined the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force| , although it is unclear whether he volunteered or was conscripted; his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds. Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties. He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader  |Ralph_Readers|Ralph_Reader|  RAF  Gang Show  entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India. His tour also included  |Ceylon|Sri_Lanka|  and  |Burma|Myanmar| , although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers may have exaggerated its length. He also served in Germany and France after the war.   According to  |David_Lodge|David_Lodge| , who became friends with Sellers, he was one of the best performers ever on the drums and developed a fine ability to impersonate military officers during this period.     The Goon Show Jack and the Beanstalk at the  |Théâtre_Marigny|Théâtre_Marigny|  in Paris. He was posted back to England shortly afterwards to work at the Air Ministry, and  |demobilised|Demobilisation_Of_The_British_Armed_Forces_After_The_Second_World_War|  later that year. On resuming his theatrical career, Sellers could get only sporadic work. He was fired after one performance of a comedy routine in  |Peterborough|Peterborough| ; the headline act, Welsh vocalist  |Dorothy_Squires|Dorothy_Squires| , however, persuaded the management to reinstate him. Sellers also continued his drumming and was billed on his appearance at  |The_Hippodrome|The_Hippodrome_Aldershot|  in  |Aldershot|Aldershot|  as Britains answer to  |Gene_Krupa|Gene_Krupa|  . In March 1948 Sellers gained a six-week run at the  |Windmill_Theatre|Windmill_Theatre|  in London, which predominantly staged  |revue|Revue|  acts: he provided the comedy turns in between the nude shows on offer.     Sellers wrote to the  |BBC|Bbc|  in 1948, and was subsequently auditioned. As a result, he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in New To You. His act, largely based on impressions, was well received, and he returned the following week. Frustrated with the slow pace of his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be  |Kenneth_Horne|Kenneth_Horne| , star of the radio show  Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh . Speer called Sellers a cheeky young sod for his efforts, but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on ShowTime and subsequently to work on Rays a Laugh with comedian  |Ted_Ray|Ted_Ray| . In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Halls Guest Night and Its Fine To Be Young.     By the end of 1948, the  |BBC_Third_Programme|Bbc_Third_Programme|  began to broadcast the comedy series Third Division, which starred, among others,  |Harry_Secombe|Harry_Secombe| ,  |Michael_Bentine|Michael_Bentine|  and Sellers. One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the  |Hackney_Empire|Hackney_Empire| , where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan. The four met at Graftons public house near Victoria, owned by  |Jimmy_Grafton|Jimmy_Grafton| , who was also a BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him KOGVOS  Grafton later edited some of the first  |Goon_Shows|The_Goon_Show| .          In 1949, Sellers started to date Anne Howe, an Australian actress who lived in London. He proposed to her in April 1950 and the couple were married in London on 15 September 1951; their son,  |Michael|Michael_Sellers| , was born on 2 April 1954, and their daughter, Sarah, followed in 1958. Sellerss introduction to film work came in 1950, where he dubbed the voice of  |Alfonso_Bedoya|Alfonso_Bedoya|  in  The Black Rose . He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan, and Secombe. On 3 February 1951, he made a trial tape entitled The Goons, and sent it to the BBC producer Pat Dixon, who eventually accepted it.     The first Goon Show was broadcast on 28 May 1951. Against their wishes, they appeared under the name Crazy People. Sellers appeared in The Goons until the last programme of the ten-series run, broadcast on 28 January 1960. Sellers played four main characters— |Major_Bloodnok|Major_Bloodnok| ,  |Hercules_Grytpype_Thynne|Hercules_Grytpype_Thynne| ,  |Bluebottle|Bluebottle|  and  |Henry_Crun|Henry_Crun_And_Minnie_Bannister| —and seventeen minor ones. Starting with 370,000 listeners, the show eventually reached up to seven million people in Britain, and was described by one newspaper as probably the most influential comedy show of all time .  For Sellers, the BBC considers it had the effect of launching his career on the road to stardom .      In 1951 the Goons made their feature film debut in  Penny Points to Paradise .  Sellers and Milligan then penned the script to  Lets Go Crazy , the earliest film to showcase Sellerss ability to portray a series of different characters within the same film, and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co-stars in the 1952 flop,  Down Among the Z Men . In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite  |Sid_James|Sid_James| ,  |Tony_Hancock|Tony_Hancock| ,  |Raymond_Huntley|Raymond_Huntley| ,  |Donald_Pleasence|Donald_Pleasence|  and  |Eric_Sykes|Eric_Sykes|  in the  |British_Lion_Film_Corporation|British_Lion_Film_Corporation|  comedy production,  Orders Are Orders .  |John_Grierson|John_Grierson|  believes that this was Sellerss breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock.     Im All Right Jack and early years in film  John and Julie  . He accepted a larger part in the 1955  |Alexander_Mackendrick|Alexander_Mackendrick| -directed  |Ealing_comedy|Ealing_Comedies|   The Ladykillers  in which he starred opposite  |Alec_Guinness|Alec_Guinness| ,  |Herbert_Lom|Herbert_Lom|  and  |Cecil_Parker|Cecil_Parker|  as Harry Robinson, the  |Teddy_Boy|Teddy_Boy| ; biographer Peter Evans considers this Sellerss first good role. The Ladykillers was a success in both Britain and the US,  and the film was nominated for an  |Academy_Award|Academy_Award|  for  |Best_Original_Screenplay|Academy_Award_For_Best_Writing| .  The following year Sellers appeared in a further three television series based on The Goons The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d ;  A Show Called Fred ; and  Son of Fred . The shows aired on Britains new  |ITV|Itv|  channel. In 1957 film producer  |Michael_Relph|Michael_Relph|  became impressed with Sellerss portrayal of an elderly character in Idiot Weekly, and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in  |Basil_Deardens|Basil_Dearden|   The Smallest Show on Earth , supporting  |Bill_Travers|Bill_Travers| ,  |Virginia_McKenna|Virginia_Mckenna|  and  |Margaret_Rutherford|Margaret_Rutherford| . The film was a commercial success and is now thought of as a minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war era. Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  to the BAFTA award winning film  The Man Who Never Was . Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in  |Mario_Zampis|Mario_Zampi|  offbeat black comedy  The Naked Truth , opposite  |Terry_Thomas|Terry_Thomas| ,  |Peggy_Mount|Peggy_Mount| ,  |Shirley_Eaton|Shirley_Eaton|  and  |Dennis_Price|Dennis_Price| .       Sellerss difficulties in getting his film career to take off, and increasing problems in his personal life, prompted him to seek periodic consultations with astrologer  |Maurice_Woodruff|Maurice_Woodruff| , who held considerable sway over his later career. After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s, Sellers became convinced that the  |music_hall|Music_Hall|  comedian  |Dan_Leno|Dan_Leno| , who died in 1904, haunted him and guided his career and life-decisions.  Sellers was a member of the  |Grand_Order_of_Water_Rats|Grand_Order_Of_Water_Rats| , the same exclusive theatrical fraternity founded by Leno in 1890. In 1958 Sellers starred with  |David_Tomlinson|David_Tomlinson| ,  |Wilfrid_Hyde_White|Wilfrid_Hyde_White| , David Lodge and  |Lionel_Jeffries|Lionel_Jeffries|  as a  |chief_petty_officer|Chief_Petty_Officer|  in  |Val_Guests|Val_Guest|   Up the Creek . Guest later claimed that he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers, and thus had started Sellerss film career. To practice his voice, Sellers purchased a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The film received critical acclaim in the United States  and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers. Next, Sellers featured with Terry-Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in  |George_Pals|George_Pal|   Tom Thumb  , a musical fantasy film, opposite  |Russ_Tamblyn|Russ_Tamblyn| ,  |Jessie_Matthews|Jessie_Matthews|  and  |Peter_Butterworth|Peter_Butterworth| . Terry-Thomas later said that my part was perfect, but Peters was bloody awful. He wasnt difficult about it, but he knew it . The performance was a landmark in Sellerss career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry.     Sellers released his first studio album in 1958 called The Best of Sellers; a collection of sketches and comic songs, which were undertaken in a variety of comic characters. Produced by  |George_Martin|George_Martin|  and released on  |Parlophone|Parlophone| , the album reached number three in the  |UK_Albums_Chart|Uk_Albums_Chart| ; The same year, Sellers made his first film with  |John_and_Roy_Boulting|Boulting_Brothers|  in  Carlton-Browne of the F.O. , a comedy in which he played a supporting role for the films lead, Terry-Thomas. Before the release of that film, the Boultings, along with Sellers and Thomas in the cast, started filming  Im All Right Jack , which became the highest grossing film at the British box office in 1960. In preparation for his role as Fred Kite, Sellers watched footage of union officials.  The role earned him a  |BAFTA|13Th_British_Academy_Film_Awards| , and the critic for  The Manchester Guardian  believed it was Sellerss best screen performance to date. In between Carlton-Browne of the F.O. and Im All Right Jack, Sellers starred in  The Mouse That Roared , a film in which  |Jean_Seberg|Jean_Seberg|  also appeared, and was directed by  |Jack_Arnold|Jack_Arnold| . He played three leading and distinct roles: the elderly Grand Duchess, the ambitious Prime Minister and the innocent and clumsy farm boy selected to lead an invasion of the United States. The film received high praise from critics.       After completing Im All Right Jack, Sellers returned to record a new series of The Goon Show. Over the course of two weekends, he took his 16mm cine-camera to Totteridge Lane in London and filmed himself, Spike Milligan,  |Mario_Fabrizi|Mario_Fabrizi| ,  |Leo_McKern|Leo_Mckern|  and  |Richard_Lester|Richard_Lester| . Originally intended as a private film, the eleven-minute short film  The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film  was screened at the 1959  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh_International_Film_Festival|  and  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco_International_Film_Festival|  film festivals. It won the award for best fiction short in the latter festival, and received an Academy Award nomination for  |Best_Short_Subject_|Academy_Award_For_Best_Live_Action_Short_Film| .   In 1959 Sellers released his second album, Songs For Swinging Sellers, which—like his first record—reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. Sellerss last film of the fifties was  The Battle of the Sexes ; a comedy directed by  |Charles_Crichton|Charles_Crichton| .      The Millionairess, Lolita, The Pink Panther and divorce  |Anthony_Asquiths|Anthony_Asquith|  romantic comedy  The Millionairess , a film based on a  |George_Bernard_Shaw|George_Bernard_Shaw|  play  |of_the_same_name|The_Millionairess| . Sellers was not interested in accepting the role until he learned that  |Sophia_Loren|Sophia_Loren|  was to be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters I dont normally act with romantic, glamorous women  ... shes a lot different from Harry Secombe.  Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask: Do you think I should divorce your mummy?  Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that hed play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, hed be an Indian in his real life.  The film inspired the George Martin-produced  |novelty|Novelty_Song|  hit single  |Goodness_Gracious_Me|Goodness_Gracious_Me|  , with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the  |UK_Singles_Chart|Uk_Singles_Chart|  in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, Bangers and Mash , reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, Peter & Sophia, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart.     In 1961 Sellers made his directorial debut with  Mr. Topaze , in which he also starred.  The film was based on the  |Marcel_Pagnol|Marcel_Pagnol|  play Topaze. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellerss directorial abilities received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike, and Sellers rarely referred to it again.   The same year he starred in the  |Sidney_Gilliat|Sidney_Gilliat| -directed  Only Two Can Play , a film based on the novel  That Uncertain Feeling  by  |Kingsley_Amis|Kingsley_Amis| . He was nominated for the  |Best_British_Actor|Bafta_Award_For_Best_Actor_In_A_Leading_Role|  award at the  |16th_British_Academy_Film_Awards|16Th_British_Academy_Film_Awards|  for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz , and his long-suffering wife Jean .          In 1962 Sellers played a retired British army general in  |John_Guillermins|John_Guillermin|   Waltz of the Toreadors , based on the  |play_of_the_same_name|The_Waltz_Of_The_Toreadors| . The film was widely criticised for its slapstick cinematic adaption, and director Guillermin himself considered the film an amateurish effort. However, Sellers won the  |San_Sebastián_International_Film_Festival_Award_for_Best_Actor|Silver_Shell_For_Best_Actor|  and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by the critics.   |Stanley_Kubrick|Stanley_Kubrick|  asked Sellers to play the role of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film  Lolita , opposite  |James_Mason|James_Mason|  and  |Shelley_Winters|Shelley_Winters| . Kubrick had seen Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes and listened to the album The Best of Sellers, and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was according to Sellers a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist . Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he often reached a state of comic ecstasy . Kubrick had American jazz producer  |Norman_Granz|Norman_Granz|  record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career. Writing in  The Sunday Times ,  |Dilys_Powell|Dilys_Powell|  noted that Sellers gave a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy . Towards the end of 1962, Sellers appeared in  The Dock Brief , a legal satire directed by  |James_Hill|James_Hill|  and co-starring  |Richard_Attenborough|Richard_Attenborough| .      Sellerss behaviour towards his family worsened in 1962; according to his son Michael, Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah who we love more, our mother or him. Sarah, to keep the peace, said, I love you both equally. I said, No, I love my mum. This prompted Sellers to throw both children out, saying that he never wanted to see them again. At the end of 1962, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader Pearly Gates in  |Cliff_Owens|Cliff_Owen|   The Wrong Arm of the Law ,  followed by his portrayal of a vicar in  Heavens Above!            After his fathers death in October 1962, Sellers decided to leave England and was approached by director  |Blake_Edwards|Blake_Edwards|  who offered him the role of  |Inspector_Clouseau|Inspector_Clouseau|  in  The Pink Panther , after  |Peter_Ustinov|Peter_Ustinov|  had backed out of the film. Edwards later recalled his feelings as desperately unhappy and ready to kill, but as fate would have it, I got Mr. Sellers instead of Mr. Ustinov—thank God!  Sellers accepted a fee of £90,000  for five weeks work on location in Rome and Cortina. The film starred  |David_Niven|David_Niven|  in the principal role, with two other actors— |Capucine|Capucine|  and  |Claudia_Cardinale|Claudia_Cardinale| —having more prominent roles than Sellers. However, Sellerss performance is regarded as being on par with that of Charlie Chaplin and  |Buster_Keaton|Buster_Keaton| , according to biographer Peter Evans. Although the Clouseau character was in the script, Sellers created the personality, devising the costume, accent, make-up, moustache and trench coat.     The Pink Panther was released in the UK in January 1964  and received a mixed reception from the critics, although  |Penelope_Gilliatt|Penelope_Gilliatt| , writing in  The Observer , remarked that Sellers had a flawless sense of mistiming in a performance that was one of the most delicate studies in accident-proneness since the silents . Despite the views of the critics, the film was one of the top ten grossing films of the year. The role earned Sellers a nomination for the  |Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_–_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Actor_Nbsp_–_Motion_Picture_Musical_Or_Comedy|  at the  |22nd_Golden_Globe_Awards|22Nd_Golden_Globe_Awards| ,  and for a Best British Actor award at the  |18th_British_Academy_Film_Awards|18Th_British_Academy_Film_Awards| .     Dr. Strangelove, health problems, a second marriage and Casino Royale    In 1963, Stanley Kubrick cast Sellers to appear in  Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb  alongside  |George_C_Scott|George_C_Scott| ,  |Sterling_Hayden|Sterling_Hayden| ,  |Keenan_Wynn|Keenan_Wynn|  and  |Slim_Pickens|Slim_Pickens| . Sellers and Kubrick got on famously during the films production and had the greatest of respect for each other, also sharing a love of photography. The director asked Sellers to play three roles: US President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF. Sellers was initially hesitant about taking on these divergent characters, but Kubrick prevailed. According to some accounts, Sellers was also invited to play the part of General Buck Turgidson, but turned it down because it was too physically demanding. Kubrick later commented that the idea of having Sellers in so many of the films key roles was that everywhere you turn there is some version of Peter Sellers holding the fate of the world in his hands . Sellers was especially anxious about successfully enacting the role of Kong and accurately affecting a Texan accent. Kubrick requested screenwriter  |Terry_Southern|Terry_Southern|  to record in his natural accent a tape of Kongs lines. After practising with Southerns recording, Sellers got sufficient control of the accent, and started shooting the scenes in the aeroplane.     After the first days shooting, Sellers sprained his ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work in the cramped cockpit set. Kubrick then re-cast Slim Pickens as Kong. The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct, variegated, complex and refined , and critic Alexander Walker considered that these roles showed his genius at full stretch . Sellers played Muffley as a bland, placid intellectual in the mould of  |Adlai_Stevenson|Adlai_Stevenson_Ii| ; he played Mandrake as an unflappable Englishman; and Dr. Strangelove, a character influenced by pre-war German cinema, as a wheelchair-bound fanatic. The critic for  The Times  wrote that the film includes, three remarkable performances from Mr. Peter Sellers, masterly as the President, diverting as a revue-sketch ex-Nazi US Scientist  ... and acceptable as an RAF officer,  although the critic from The Guardian thought his portrayal of the RAF officer alone was, worth the price of an admission ticket .  For his performance in all three roles, Sellers was nominated for an  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor|Academy_Award_For_Best_Actor|  at the  |37th_Academy_Awards|37Th_Academy_Awards| ,  and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.     Between November 1963 and February 1964, Sellers began filming  A Shot in the Dark , an adaptation of a French play,  LIdiote  by  |Marcel_Achard|Marcel_Achard| . Sellers found the part and the director,  |Anatole_Litvak|Anatole_Litvak| , uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak. Together with writer  |William_Peter_Blatty|William_Peter_Blatty| , they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as  |Commissioner_Dreyfus|The_Pink_Panther|  and  |Burt_Kwouk|Burt_Kwouk|  as  |Cato|The_Pink_Panther| . During filming, Sellerss relationship with Edwards became strained; the two often stopped speaking to each other during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes. Sellerss personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors. Upon its release in late June 1964,  |Bosley_Crowther|Bosley_Crowther|  noted the joyously free and facile way in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique.           Towards the end of filming, in early February 1964, Sellers met  |Britt_Ekland|Britt_Ekland| , a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film  Guns at Batasi . On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their first meeting, the couple married. Sellers soon showed signs of insecurity and paranoia; he became highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Ekland starred opposite attractive men.   Shortly after the wedding, Sellers started filming on location in  |Twentynine_Palms_California|Twentynine_Palms_California|  for  |Billy_Wilders|Billy_Wilder|   Kiss Me, Stupid , opposite  |Dean_Martin|Dean_Martin|  and  |Kim_Novak|Kim_Novak| . The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Ekland, Sellers inhaled  |amyl_nitrites|Amyl_Nitrite|   as a sexual stimulant in his search for the ultimate orgasm , and suffered a series of eight  |heart_attacks|Myocardial_Infarction|  over the course of three hours as a result. His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of Kiss Me, Stupid and he was replaced by  |Ray_Walston|Ray_Walston| . Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks, saying that you have to have a heart before you can have an attack .     After some time recovering, Sellers returned to filming in October 1964, playing King of the Individualists alongside Ekland in  A Carol for Another Christmas , a feature-length United Nations special broadcast in the United States on the  |ABC|American_Broadcasting_Company|  channel on 28 December 1964. Sellers had been concerned that his heart attacks might have caused brain damage and that he would be unable to remember his lines, but he was reassured that his memory and abilities were unimpaired after the experience of filming. Sellers followed this with the role of the perverted Austrian psychoanalyst Doctor Fritz Fassbender in  |Clive_Donners|Clive_Donner|   Whats New Pussycat? , appearing alongside  |Peter_OToole|Peter_Otoole| ,  |Romy_Schneider|Romy_Schneider| , Capucine,  |Paula_Prentiss|Paula_Prentiss|  and  |Ursula_Andress|Ursula_Andress| . The film was the first screenwriting and acting credit for  |Woody_Allen|Woody_Allen| , and featured Sellers in a love triangle.  Because of Sellerss poor health, producer  |Charles_K_Feldman|Charles_K_Feldman|  insured him at a cost of $360,000 .      Sellers became a close friend of  |Antony_Armstrong_Jones_1st_Earl_of_Snowdon|Antony_Armstrong_Jones_1St_Earl_Of_Snowdon| , a photographer who was then married to  |Princess_Margaret|Princess_Margaret| . Snowdon shared a love of women, photography, fine wine and fast cars with Sellers; both were also prone to bouts of depression.  They spent many weekends together with their wives and went on several holidays on board Sellerss yacht Bobo in Sardinia. On 20 January 1965, Sellers and Ekland announced the birth of a daughter,  |Victoria|Victoria_Sellers| . They moved to Rome in May to film  After the Fox , an Anglo-Italian production in which they were both to appear. The film was directed by  |Vittorio_De_Sica|Vittorio_De_Sica| , whose English Sellers struggled to understand. Sellers attempted to have De Sica fired, causing tensions on the set. Sellers also became unhappy with his wifes performance, straining their relationship and triggering open arguments during one of which Sellers threw a chair at Ekland. Despite these conflicts, the script was praised for its wit.       Following the commercial success of Whats New Pussycat?, Charles Feldman again brought together Sellers and Woody Allen for his next project,  Casino Royale , which also starred  |Orson_Welles|Orson_Welles| ; Sellers signed a $1  million contract for the film . Seven screenwriters worked on the project, and filming was chaotic. To make matters worse, according to Ekland, Sellers was so insecure, he wont trust anyone . A poor working relationship quickly developed between Sellers and Welles: Sellers eventually demanded that the two should not share the same set. Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agents part was then written for  |Terence_Cooper|Terence_Cooper| , to cover Sellerss departure.     Shortly after leaving Casino Royale, Sellers was appointed a  |Commander_of_the_Most_Excellent_Order_of_the_British_Empire|Order_Of_The_British_Empire|  in honour of his career achievements.  The day before the investiture at  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace| , Sellers and Ekland argued, with Ekland scratching his face in the process; Sellers had a make-up artist cover the marks. Ekland later reported that although the couple argued, Sellers never hit her. During his next film,  The Bobo , which again co-starred Ekland, the couples marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, Sellers told director  |Robert_Parrish|Robert_Parrish|  to fire his wife, saying Im not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set . Ekland later stated that the marriage was an atrocious sham at this stage. In the midst of filming The Bobo, Sellerss mother had a heart attack; Parrish asked Sellers if he wanted to visit her in hospital, but Sellers remained on set. She died within days, without Sellers having seen her. He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her. Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and Sellerss friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram. Upon its release in September 1967, The Bobo was poorly received.      Sellerss first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the  |fish_out_of_water|Wikt_Fish_Out_Of_Water|  comedy  |The_Party|The_Party| , in which he starred alongside  |Claudine_Longet|Claudine_Longet|  and  |Denny_Miller|Denny_Miller| . He appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party. His character, according to Sellerss biographer Peter Evans, was clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in The Millionairess . Roger Lewis notes that like a number of Sellerss characters, he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner. He followed it later that year with  |Hy_Averbacks|Hy_Averback|   I Love You, Alice B. Toklas , playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a  |hippie|Hippie| .  |Roger_Ebert|Roger_Ebert|  of the  Chicago Sun-Times  gave the film three stars, remarking that Sellers was back doing what he does best , although he also said that in Sellerss previous films he had been at his worst recently .      In 1969 Sellers starred opposite  |Ringo_Starr|Ringo_Starr|  in the  |Joseph_McGrath|Joseph_Mcgrath| -directed film  The Magic Christian . Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate  |practical_jokes|Practical_Joke|  on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a proto- |Pythonesque|Monty_Python|  adaption of Terry Southerns semi-free-form short novel , and one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britains royal family . The film, a satire on human nature, was in general viewed negatively by critics.  |Roger_Greenspun|Roger_Greenspun|  of The New York Times believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a brutal satire .      Pink Panther films      After a cameo appearance in  A Day at the Beach  ,  and a serious role later in 1970 as an aging businessman who seduces  |Sinéad_Cusack|Sinéad_Cusack|  in  Hoffman ,  Sellers starred in  |Roy_Boultings|Roy_Boulting|   Theres a Girl in My Soup  opposite  |Goldie_Hawn|Goldie_Hawn| . According to The Times, the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970.  Andrew Spicer, writing for the  |British_Film_Institutes|British_Film_Institute| |_Screenonline|Screenonline| , considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario  he played in Theres a Girl in My Soup .  The film was seen as a small revival of his career.     Sellerss next films, including  |Rodney_Amateaus|Rodney_Amateau|   Where Does It Hurt?   and Peter Medaks  Ghost in the Noonday Sun  , were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny.  Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in  |Anthony_Simmonss|Anthony_Simmons|   The Optimists of Nine Elms .    Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion . This was echoed by Sellerss biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only Theres a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the twenty-three-year-old model  |Miranda_Quarry|Miranda_Countess_Of_Stockton| . The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellerss private doubts—expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger—about his decision to re-marry.     On 20 April 1972, Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record  The Last Goon Show of All , which was broadcast on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers went to the theatre to watch  |Liza_Minnelli|Liza_Minnelli|  perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnellis current betrothal to  |Desi_Arnaz_Jr_|Desi_Arnaz_Jr_| , and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellerss friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction. Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on  |Michael_Parkinsons|Michael_Parkinson| |_eponymous_chat_show|Parkinson|  in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that I just cant walk on as myself . When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the  |Gestapo|Gestapo| . After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity . In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.     In 1974, Sellers portrayed a sexually voracious  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria|  in  |Joseph_McGraths|Joseph_Mcgrath|  comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet  |William_McGonagall|William_Mcgonagall| ,  The Great McGonagall , starring opposite Milligan and  |Julia_Foster|Julia_Foster| .  However, the film was a critical failure, and Sellerss career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of £100,000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the £1 million he had once commanded per film. In 1973, he appeared in a  |Benson_Hedges|Benson_Hedges|  cinema commercial; in 1975, he appeared in a series of advertisements for  |Trans_World_Airlines|Trans_World_Airlines| , in which he played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy Piggy Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito. Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles,  although the airline campaign failed commercially.     A turning point in Sellerss flailing career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make  The Return of the Pink Panther , starring alongside  |Christopher_Plummer|Christopher_Plummer| , Herbert Lom and  |Catherine_Schell|Catherine_Schell| . The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellerss career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status.  The film earned Sellers a nomination for the  |Best_Actor_–_Musical_or_Comedy|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Actor_Nbsp_–_Motion_Picture_Musical_Or_Comedy|  award at the  |33rd_Golden_Globe_Awards|33Rd_Golden_Globe_Awards| .  In 1976, he followed it with  The Pink Panther Strikes Again . During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actors mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, thats what Peter had become. He was certifiable.  With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a volatile and perplexing character left a trail of misery in his private life . He also noted that Sellers had a compulsive personality and an eccentric hypochondriac who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work. Despite Sellerss deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium. Sellerss performance earned him a further nomination at the  |34th_Golden_Globe_Awards|34Th_Golden_Globe_Awards| .           In March 1976 Sellers began dating actress  |Lynne_Frederick|Lynne_Frederick| , whom he married on 18 February 1977. Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of all of Sellerss wives, Frederick was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, a relationship that oscillated from ardour to hatred, reconciliation and remorse.  Peter Evans claims that Milligan detested his friends choice of partner and believed she was to blame for his increasing alcohol and cocaine dependency. On 20 March 1977, Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; he was subsequently fitted with a  |pacemaker|Artificial_Pacemaker| .  Sellers returned from his illness to undertake  Revenge of the Pink Panther ; although it was a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau. Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest itself in the sluggish pace of the film, describing it as a laboured, stunt-heavy hotchpotch of half-baked ideas and rehashed gags . Sellers too had become tired of the role, saying after production, Ive honestly had enough of Clouseau—Ive got nothing more to give .  |Steven_Bach|Steven_Bach| , the senior vice-president and head of worldwide productions for  |United_Artists|United_Artists| , who worked with Sellers on Revenge of the Pink Panther, considered that Sellers was deeply unbalanced, if not committable: that was the source of his genius and his truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric.  He refused to seek professional help for his mental issues.      Sellers claimed that he had no personality and was almost unnoticeable, which meant that he needed a strongly defined character to play.  He made similar references throughout his life: when he appeared on  The Muppet Show  in 1978, a guest appearance that earned him an  |Emmy|Emmy|  nomination for Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Variety or Music,  he chose not to appear as himself, instead appearing in a variety of costumes and accents. When  |Kermit_the_Frog|Kermit_The_Frog|  told Sellers he could relax and be himself, Sellers replied:          Being There, Fu Manchu and marital problems  |Lionel_Jeffries|Lionel_Jeffries|  and  |Elke_Sommer|Elke_Sommer|  in  |Richard_Quines|Richard_Quine|   The Prisoner of Zenda . He portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V—rulers of the fictional small nation of Ruritania—and Syd Frewin, Rudolf Vs half-brother. Upon its release in May 1979, the film was well received;  |Janet_Maslin|Janet_Maslin|  of The New York Times observed how Sellers divided his energies between a serious character and a funny one, but that it was his serious performance which was more impressive .  However,  |Philip_French|Philip_French| , for The Observer, was unimpressed by the film, describing it as a mess of porridge and stating that Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental .     Later in 1979, Sellers starred opposite  |Shirley_MacLaine|Shirley_Maclaine| ,  |Melvyn_Douglas|Melvyn_Douglas|  and  |Jack_Warden|Jack_Warden|  in the  |black_comedy|Black_Comedy|   Being There  as Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful. In a BBC interview in 1971, Sellers had said that more than anything else, he wanted to play the role, and successfully persuaded the author of the book,  |Jerzy_Kosinski|Jerzy_Kosinski| , to allow him and director  |Hal_Ashby|Hal_Ashby|  to make the film, provided Kosinski could write the script.  During filming, to remain in character, Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors. Sellers considered Chances walking and voice the characters most important attributes, and in preparing for the role worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife, and then with Ashby, to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal the childlike mind behind the words . Sellers described his experience of working on the film as so humbling, so powerful , and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers a dream to work with. Sellers performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the crowning triumph of Peter Sellerss remarkable career . Critic  |Frank_Rich|Frank_Rich|  wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role, with a schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique  ... A lesser actor would have made the characters mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic  ... intelligence was always deeper, his onscreen confidence greater, his technique much more finely honed : in achieving this, Sellers makes the films fantastic premise credible . The film earned Sellers a  |Best_Actor|National_Board_Of_Review_Award_For_Best_Actor|  award at the  |51st_National_Board_of_Review_Awards|National_Board_Of_Review_Awards_1979| ;  the  |London_Critics_Circle_Film_Awards|London_Critics_Circle_Film_Awards|  Special Achievement Award, the  |Best_Actor|New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Award_For_Best_Actor|  award at the  |45th_New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards|1979_New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards| ;  and the  |Best_Actor_–_Musical_or_Comedy|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Actor_Nbsp_–_Motion_Picture_Musical_Or_Comedy|  award at the  |37th_Golden_Globe_Awards|37Th_Golden_Globe_Awards| .  Additionally, Sellers was nominated for the  |Best_Actor|Academy_Award_For_Best_Actor|  award at the  |52nd_Academy_Awards|52Nd_Academy_Awards|   and the  |Best_Actor_in_a_Leading_Role|Bafta_Award_For_Best_Actor_In_A_Leading_Role|  award at the  |34th_British_Academy_Film_Awards|34Th_British_Academy_Film_Awards| .      In March 1980, Sellers asked his 15-year-old daughter Victoria what she thought about Being There His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I wont tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father.      Sellerss last film was  The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu , a comedic re-imagining of the  |eponymous_adventure_novels|Fu_Manchu|  by  |Sax_Rohmer|Sax_Rohmer| ; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside  |Helen_Mirren|Helen_Mirren|  and  |David_Tomlinson|David_Tomlinson| . The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors— |Richard_Quine|Richard_Quine|  and  |John_Avildsen|John_Avildsen| —fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director  |Piers_Haggard|Piers_Haggard|  led to Haggards firing at Sellerss instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences.  |Tom_Shales|Tom_Shales|  of  The Washington Post  described the film as an indefensibly inept comedy , adding that it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. Manchu will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as Tell Me Where It Hurts, The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda .     Sellerss final performances were a series of advertisements for  |Barclays_Bank|Barclays_Bank| . Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played Monty Casino, a Jewish con-man. Four adverts were scheduled, but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems. After two days in care—and against the advice of his doctors—he travelled to the  |Cannes_Film_Festival|Cannes_Film_Festival| , where Being There was in competition. Sellers was again ill in Cannes, returning to his residence in  |Gstaad|Gstaad|  to work on the script for his next project,  Romance of the Pink Panther . At the urging of his friends, he made an appointment to undergo an  |angiogram|Angiography|  at the  |Cedars_Sinai_Medical_Center|Cedars_Sinai_Medical_Center|  in Los Angeles on 30 July 1980, to see if he was able to undergo open-heart surgery. Spike Milligan later considered that Sellerss heart condition had lasted for over 15 years and had made life difficult for him and had a debilitating effect on his personality. Sellerss fourth marriage to Frederick collapsed soon after.     Sellers recently started to rebuild his relationship with his son Michael after the failure of the latters marriage. Michael later said that it marked the beginning of an all-too-brief closeness between us. Sellers admitted to his son that he hated so many things he had done, including leaving his first wife Anne and his infatuation with Sophia Loren. In lighter moments, Sellers had joked that his epitaph should read Star of stage, screen and alimony.             On 21 July 1980 Sellers arrived in London from Geneva. He checked into  |the_Dorchester|The_Dorchester|  hotel, before visiting  |Golders_Green_Crematorium|Golders_Green_Crematorium|  for the first time to see the location of his parents ashes. He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his Goon Show partners Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July. On the day of the dinner, Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from yet another heart attack. He was taken to the  |Middlesex_Hospital|Middlesex_Hospital| , London, and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980, aged 54.     Following Sellerss death, fellow actor  |Richard_Attenborough|Richard_Attenborough|  said that Sellers had the genius comparable to Chaplin , while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment.  |Burt_Kwouk|Burt_Kwouk| , who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain  ... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything . Director Blake Edwards thought that Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing . Sellerss friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellerss death, and fellow Goon Harry Secombe said Im shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him ; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, Anything to avoid paying for dinner . Secombe later declared to journalists Bluebottle is deaded now . Milligan later said that its hard to say this, but he died at the right time.  The Daily Mail described Sellers as the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness , a flawed genius who, once he latched on to a comic idea, loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes .     A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by Sellerss old friend, Canon John Hester. Sellerss final joke was the playing of  |In_the_Mood|In_The_Mood|  by  |Glenn_Miller|Glenn_Miller| , a tune all the goons hated. He knew they would have to sit there in silence and listen to it. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at the Crematorium. After her death in 1994, the ashes of his widow Lynne Frederick were co-interred with his. A memorial service was held at  |St_Martin_in_the_Fields|St_Martin_In_The_Fields|  on 8 September 1980—what would have been Sellerss 55th birthday. Close friend  |Lord_Snowdon|Anthony_Armstrong_Jones_1St_Earl_Of_Snowdon|  read the  |twenty_third_Psalm|Psalm_23| , Harry Secombe sang  |Bread_of_Heaven|Bread_Of_Heaven|  and the eulogy was read by David Niven.     Although Sellers was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from his will a week before he died, she inherited almost his entire estate worth an estimated £4.5 million  while his children received £800 each . Spike Milligan appealed to her on behalf of Sellerss three children, but she refused to increase the amount. Sellerss only son, Michael, died of a heart attack at 52 during surgery on 24 July 2006, twenty-six years to the day after his fathers death.     After his death,  |Metro_Goldwyn_Mayer|Metro_Goldwyn_Mayer|  tried to continue with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to  |Dudley_Moore|Dudley_Moore| , who turned it down. The studio subsequently returned to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain that no one could adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released  Trail of the Pink Panther , which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million , plus 3.15 per cent of the films profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.              |Vincent_Canby|Vincent_Canby|  of The New York Times wrote of the Pink Panther films: Im not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic self-absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny.  Film critic  |Elvis_Mitchell|Elvis_Mitchell|  wrote that Sellers was one of the few comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life.      A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching.      His  |biographer|Biographer| , Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are.  Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that As low and high comedy rolled into one, its the performative counterpoint to  |Edwardian_sophisticated_naturalism|Nineteenth_Century_Theatrenaturalism_And_Realism|  . This combination of high and low , exemplified by Clouseaus attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was the sole representative of humanity .
