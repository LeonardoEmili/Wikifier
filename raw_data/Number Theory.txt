      Number theory  is a branch of  |pure_mathematics|Pure_Mathematics|  devoted primarily to the study of the  |integers|Integer|  and  |integer_valued_functions|Arithmetic_Function| . German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.  Number theorists study  |prime_numbers|Prime_Number|  as well as the properties of objects made out of integers  or defined as generalizations of the integers .     Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations . Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of  |analytical|Complex_Analysis|  objects  that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion . One may also study  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated by the latter .     The older term for number theory is arithmetic. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by number theory . Already in 1921,  |T_L_Heath|T_L_Heath|  had to explain: By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.   The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence. Take, for example, . In 1952,  |Davenport|Harold_Davenport|  still had to specify that he meant The Higher Arithmetic.  |Hardy|G_H_Hardy|  and Wright wrote in the introduction to  An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers  : We proposed at one time to change to An introduction to arithmetic, a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book.  In particular, arithmetical is preferred as an adjective to number-theoretic.              The earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet  |Plimpton_322|Plimpton_322|   contains a list of  |Pythagorean_triples|Pythagorean_Triples|  , that is, integers such that a2+b2c2 .   The triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by  |brute_force|Brute_Force_Method| . The heading over the first column reads: The takiltum of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width... . The term takiltum is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up... .     The tables layout suggests . Other sources give the modern formula . Van der Waerden gives both the modern formula and what amounts to the form preferred by Robson. that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity     :   + 1       which is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises. If some other method was used, Neugebauer  discusses the table in detail and mentions in passing Euclids method in modern notation . the triples were first constructed and then reordered by c/a , presumably for actual use as a table , for example, with a view to applications.     It is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any;  |Babylonian_astronomy|Babylonian_Astronomy| , for example, truly came into its own only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems. . This is controversial. See  |Plimpton_322|Plimpton_322| . Robsons article is written polemically  with a view to perhaps knocking off its pedestal ; at the same time, it settles to the conclusion that the question how was the tablet calculated? does not have to have the same answer as the question what problems does the tablet set? The first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second by some sort of right-triangle problems .   Robson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced Plimpton 322 could have been motivated by his own idle curiosity in the absence of a market for new mathematics .     While Babylonian number theory—or what survives of  |Babylonian_mathematics|Babylonian_Mathematics|  that can be called thus—consists of this single, striking fragment, Babylonian algebra was exceptionally well developed. Late Neoplatonic sources  |Iamblichus|Iamblichus| , Life of Pythagoras, cited in . See also  |Porphyry|Porphyry| , Life of Pythagoras, paragraph 6, in    Van der Waerden  sustains the view that Thales knew Babylonian mathematics. state that  |Pythagoras|Pythagoras|  learned mathematics from the Babylonians. Much earlier sources Herodotus and Isocrates , cited in: . On Thales, see Eudemus ap. Proclus, 65.7,  cited in: . Proclus was using a work by  |Eudemus_of_Rhodes|Eudemus_Of_Rhodes|  , the Catalogue of Geometers. See also introduction,  on Procluss reliability. state that  |Thales|Thales|  and  |Pythagoras|Pythagoras|  traveled and studied in  |Egypt|Egypt| .      |Euclid|Euclid|  IX 21–34 is very probably Pythagorean; , cited in: . it is very simple material , but it is all that is needed to prove that        is  |irrational|Irrational_Number| . Pythagorean mystics gave great importance to the odd and the even.   The discovery that   is irrational is credited to the early Pythagoreans . Plato, Theaetetus, p. 147 B, , cited   in See also  |Spiral_of_Theodorus|Spiral_Of_Theodorus| . By revealing that numbers could be irrational, this discovery seems to have provoked the first foundational crisis in mathematical history; its proof or its divulgation are sometimes credited to  |Hippasus|Hippasus_Of_Metapontum| , who was expelled or split from the Pythagorean sect. This forced a distinction between numbers , on the one hand, and lengths and proportions , on the other hand.     The Pythagorean tradition spoke also of so-called  |polygonal|Polygonal_Number|  or  |figurate_numbers|Figurate_Numbers| . While square numbers, cubic numbers, etc., are seen now as more natural than triangular numbers, pentagonal numbers, etc., the study of the sums   of triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful in the early modern period .     We know of no clearly arithmetical material in  |ancient_Egyptian|Egyptian_Mathematics|  or  |Vedic|Vedic|  sources, though there is some algebra in both. The  |Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese_Remainder_Theorem|  appears as an exercise Sunzi Suanjing, Chapter 3, Problem 26. This can be found in , which contains a full translation of the Suan Ching . See also the discussion in . in  Sunzi Suanjing  The date of the text has been narrowed down to 220–420 CE or 280–473 CE through internal evidence . See .      There is also some numerical mysticism in Chinese mathematics, See, for example, Sunzi Suanjing, Ch. 3, Problem 36, in AnswerMethod |magic_squares|Magic_Squares|  have passed from superstition into recreation.            Aside from a few fragments, the mathematics of Classical Greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period. In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, Plato and Euclid, respectively.     While Asian mathematics influenced Greek and Hellenistic learning, it seems to be the case that Greek mathematics is also an indigenous tradition.      |Eusebius|Eusebius| , PE X, chapter 4 mentions of  |Pythagoras|Pythagoras|      Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, Metaphysics, 1.6.1 and Cicero repeats this claim: Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia . Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.      |Plato|Plato|  had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation.  It is through one of Platos dialogues—namely,  |Theaetetus|Theaetetus| —that we know that  |Theodorus|Theodorus_Of_Cyrene|  had proven that         are irrational.  |Theaetetus|Theaetetus_Of_Athens|  was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodoruss; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of  |incommensurables|Commensurability| , and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of  |number_systems|Number_Systems| .       |Euclid|Euclid|  devoted part of his Elements to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it . In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers  and the first known proof of the  |infinitude_of_primes|Infinitude_Of_Primes|  .     In 1773,  |Lessing|Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing|  published an  |epigram|Epigram|  he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by  |Archimedes|Archimedes|  to  |Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes| . The epigram proposed what has become known as    |Archimedess_cattle_problem|Archimedess_Cattle_Problem| ; its solution requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation . As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the  |Indian_school|Āryabhaṭa_Brahmagupta_Bhāskara| . It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.            Very little is known about  |Diophantus_of_Alexandria|Diophantus_Of_Alexandria| ; he probably lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantuss  Arithmetica  survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The Arithmetica is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form fz2 or fw2 . Thus, nowadays, we speak of Diophantine equations when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.     One may say that Diophantus was studying rational points, that is, points whose coordinates are rational—on  |curves|Curve|  and  |algebraic_varieties|Algebraic_Variety| ; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form   f0 , his aim was to find three  |rational_functions|Rational_Functions|  g1, g2, g3 such that, for all values of r and s , setting   xi gi for i1,2,3 gives a solution to f0.     Diophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves  by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry   , his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point.     While Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that  |every_integer_is_the_sum_of_four_squares|Lagranges_Four_Square_Theorem|  .       While Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry, it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition; Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural . in particular, there is no evidence that Euclids Elements reached India before the 18th century.      |Āryabhaṭa|Aryabhata|  showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences n  a1   m1 , n  a2   m2 could be solved by a method he called kuṭṭaka, or pulveriser; Āryabhaṭa, Āryabhatīya, Chapter 2, verses 32–33, cited in: . See also . A slightly more explicit description of the kuṭṭaka was later given in  |Brahmagupta|Brahmagupta| , Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, XVIII, 3–5 . this is a procedure close to the  |Euclidean_algorithm|Euclidean_Algorithm| , which was probably discovered independently in India. Āryabhaṭa seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations.      |Brahmagupta|Brahmagupta|  started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations—in particular, the misnamed  |Pell_equation|Pells_Equation| , in which  |Archimedes|Archimedes|  may have first been interested, and which did not start to be solved in the West until the time of Fermat and Euler. Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmaguptas technical terminology. A general procedure  for solving Pells equation was finally found by Jayadeva ; the earliest surviving exposition appears in  |Bhāskara_IIs|Bhāskara_Ii|  Bīja-gaṇita .     Indian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century; Brahmagupta and Bhāskaras work was translated into English in 1817 by  |Henry_Colebrooke|Henry_Thomas_Colebrooke| .                 In the early ninth century, the caliph  |Al_Mamun|Al_Mamun|  ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work .   Diophantuss main work, the Arithmetica, was translated into Arabic by  |Qusta_ibn_Luqa|Qusta_Ibn_Luqa|  .   Part of the treatise al-Fakhri  builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karajīs contemporary  |Ibn_al_Haytham|Ibn_Al_Haytham|  knew what would later be called  |Wilsons_theorem|Wilsons_Theorem| .       Other than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by  |Fibonacci|Fibonacci| —who traveled and studied in north Africa and Constantinople—no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus  Arithmetica .  |Bachet|Claude_Gaspard_Bachet_De_Méziriac| , 1621, following a first attempt by  |Xylander|Guilielmus_Xylander| , 1575                 |Pierre_de_Fermat|Pierre_De_Fermat|  never published his writings; in particular, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes. He wrote down nearly no proofs in number theory; he had no models in the area. . This was more so in number theory than in other areas . Bachets own proofs were ludicrously clumsy .     One of Fermats first interests was  |perfect_numbers|Perfect_Number|   and  |amicable_numbers|Amicable_Numbers| ; Perfect and especially amicable numbers are of little or no interest nowadays. The same was not true in medieval times—whether in the West or the Arab-speaking world—due in part to the importance given to them by the Neopythagorean  |Nicomachus|Nicomachus_Of_Gerasa|  , who wrote a primitive but influential  |Introduction_to_Arithmetic|Introduction_To_Arithmetic|  . See . these topics led him to work on integer  |divisors|Divisor| , which were from the beginning among the subjects of the   correspondence that put him in touch with the mathematical community of the day. . The initial subjects of Fermats correspondence included divisors and many subjects outside number theory; see the list in the letter from Fermat to Roberval, 22.IX.1636, , cited in .     Fermats work in arithmetic includes the following.     In 1638, Fermat claimed, without proof, that all whole numbers can be expressed as the sum of four squares or fewer.     |Fermats_little_theorem|Fermats_Little_Theorem|  , , Letter XLVI from Fermat to Frenicle, 1640,   cited in  stating that, if a is not divisible by a prime p, then a   1   p. Here, as usual, given two integers a and b and a non-zero integer m, we write a   b   m  to mean that m divides a  −  b, or, what is the same, a and b leave the same residue when divided by m. This notation is actually much later than Fermats; it first appears in section 1 of  |Gausss|Gauss| |_Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae|Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae| . Fermats little theorem is a consequence of the  |fact|Lagranges_Theorem|  that the  |order|Order|  of an element of a  |group|Group|  divides the  |order|Order|  of the  |group|Group| . The modern proof would have been within Fermats means , even though the modern concept of a group came long after Fermat or Euler. ; this fact  was familiar to Fermat thanks to its rediscovery by  |Bachet|Claude_Gaspard_Bachet_De_Méziriac|  . Weil goes on to say that Fermat would have recognised that Bachets argument is essentially Euclids algorithm.   If a and b are coprime, then a2 + b2 is not divisible by any prime congruent to −1 modulo 4; , cited in . All of the following citations from Fermats Varia Opera are taken from . The standard Tannery & Henry work includes a revision of Fermats posthumous Varia Opera Mathematica originally prepared by his son . and every prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 can be written in the form a2 + b2 . These two statements also date from 1640; in 1659, Fermat stated to Huygens that he had proven the latter statement by the  |method_of_infinite_descent|Proof_By_Infinite_Descent| .  Fermat considered their solution valid, but pointed out they had provided an algorithm without a proof . He states that a proof can be found by descent.   Fermat states and proves in the appendix to Observations on Diophantus  that x + y z has no non-trivial solutions in the integers. Fermat also mentioned to his correspondents that x3 + y3 z3 has no non-trivial solutions, and that this could be proven by descent. The first known proof is due to Euler .     Fermats claim  to have shown there are no solutions to   xn + yn zn for all n  3 appears only in his annotations on the margin of his copy of Diophantus.            The interest of  |Leonhard_Euler|Leonhard_Euler|  in number theory was first spurred in 1729, when a friend of his, the amateur Up to the second half of the seventeenth century, academic positions were very rare, and most mathematicians and scientists earned their living in some other way . . Notice, however, that Goldbach published some works on mathematics and sometimes held academic positions.  |Goldbach|Christian_Goldbach| , pointed him towards some of Fermats work on the subject. This has been called the rebirth of modern number theory, after Fermats relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries attention for the subject.  and  Eulers work on number theory includes the following:  and      Proofs for Fermats statements. This includes  |Fermats_little_theorem|Fermats_Little_Theorem|  ; the fact that p x2 + y2 if and only if p  1   4 ; initial work towards a proof that every integer is the sum of four squares ; the lack of non-zero integer solutions to x4 + y4 z2 .    Pells equation , first misnamed by Euler. . Euler was generous in giving credit to others , not always correctly. He wrote on the link between continued fractions and Pells equation. First steps towards analytic number theory . In his work of sums of four squares,  |partitions|Partition_Function_Partition_Function| ,  |pentagonal_numbers|Pentagonal_Numbers| , and the  |distribution|Distribution|  of prime numbers, Euler pioneered the use of what can be seen as analysis in number theory. Since he lived before the development of  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis| , most of his work is restricted to the formal manipulation of  |power_series|Power_Series| . He did, however, do some very notable early work on what would later be called the  |Riemann_zeta_function|Riemann_Zeta_Function| . ; see also chapter III.   Quadratic forms. Following Fermats lead, Euler did further research on the question of which primes can be expressed in the form x2 + N y2 , some of it prefiguring  |quadratic_reciprocity|Quadratic_Reciprocity| .  Diophantine equations. Euler worked on some Diophantine equations of genus 0 and 1. In particular, he studied  |Diophantuss|Diophantus|  work; he tried to systematise it, but the time was not yet ripe for such an endeavour—algebraic geometry was still in its infancy. He did notice there was a connection between Diophantine problems and  |elliptic_integrals|Elliptic_Integral| , whose study he had himself initiated.             |Joseph_Louis_Lagrange|Joseph_Louis_Lagrange|  was the first to give full proofs of some of Fermats and Eulers work and observations—for instance, the  |four_square_theorem|Lagranges_Four_Square_Theorem|  and the basic theory of the misnamed Pells equation  He also studied  |quadratic_forms|Quadratic_Form|  in full generality —defining their equivalence relation, showing how to put them in reduced form, etc.      |Adrien_Marie_Legendre|Adrien_Marie_Legendre|  was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also   conjectured what amounts to the  |prime_number_theorem|Prime_Number_Theorem|  and  |Dirichlets_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions|Dirichlets_Theorem_On_Arithmetic_Progressions| . He gave a full treatment of the equation a x2 + b y2 + c z2 0  and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss. In his old age, he was the first to prove Fermats last theorem for n5 .          In his  Disquisitiones Arithmeticae  ,  |Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|  proved the law of  |quadratic_reciprocity|Quadratic_Reciprocity|  and developed the theory of quadratic forms . He also introduced some basic notation  and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests. The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between  |roots_of_unity|Roots_Of_Unity|  and number theory:   The theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong   by itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic. From the preface of Disquisitiones Arithmeticae; the translation is taken from      In this way, Gauss arguably made a first foray towards both  |Évariste_Galoiss|Évariste_Galois|  work and  |algebraic_number_theory|Algebraic_Number_Theory| .               Starting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:     The rise to self-consciousness of number theory  as a field of study. See the discussion in section 5 of . Early signs of self-consciousness are present already in letters by Fermat: thus his remarks on what number theory is, and how Diophantuss work does not really belong to .   The development of much of modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number theory:  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis| ,  |group_theory|Group_Theory| ,  |Galois_theory|Galois_Theory| —accompanied by greater rigor in analysis and abstraction in algebra.   The rough subdivision of number theory into its modern subfields—in particular,  |analytic|Analytic_Number_Theory|  and  |algebraic_number_theory|Algebraic_Number_Theory| .     Algebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and  |cyclotomy|Root_Of_Unity| , but truly came into its own with the development of  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra|  and early ideal theory and  |valuation|Valuation|  theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is  |Dirichlets_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions|Dirichlets_Theorem_On_Arithmetic_Progressions|  ,  whose proof introduced  |L_functions|L_Functions|  and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable. See the proof in  The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually   goes back to Euler ,  who used formal power series and non-rigorous limiting arguments. The use of complex analysis in number theory comes later: the work of  |Bernhard_Riemann|Bernhard_Riemann|  on the  |zeta_function|Riemann_Zeta_Function|  is the canonical starting point;  |Jacobis_four_square_theorem|Jacobis_Four_Square_Theorem|  , which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory . See the comment on the importance of modularity in      The history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.         The term  elementary  generally denotes a method that does not use  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis| . For example, the  |prime_number_theorem|Prime_Number_Theorem|  was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by  |Erdős|Paul_Erdős|  and  |Selberg|Atle_Selberg| . The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex  |Tauberian_theorems|Tauberian_Theorem|   are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.     Number theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics. See, for example, the initial comment in .                    Analytic number theory may be defined     in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis; or   in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities. good approximations.     Some subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example,  |sieve_theory|Sieve_Theory| , Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance,  or  are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis, This is the case for small sieves  rather than for  |large_sieves|Large_Sieve| ; the study of the latter now includes ideas from  |harmonic|Harmonic_Analysis|  and  |functional_analysis|Functional_Analysis| . yet it does belong to analytic number theory.     The following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the  |prime_number_theorem|Prime_Number_Theorem| , the  |Goldbach_conjecture|Goldbach_Conjecture|  , the  |Waring_problem|Waring_Problem|  and the  |Riemann_hypothesis|Riemann_Hypothesis| . Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the  |circle_method|Circle_Method| ,  |sieve_methods|Sieve_Theory|  and  |L_functions|L_Functions|  . The theory of  |modular_forms|Modular_Form|   also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory. See the remarks in the introduction to  |algebraic_numbers|Algebraic_Number| , and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define  |prime_ideals|Prime_Ideals|   and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question  |can_be_answered|Landau_Prime_Ideal_Theorem|  by means of an examination of  |Dedekind_zeta_functions|Dedekind_Zeta_Function| , which are generalizations of the  |Riemann_zeta_function|Riemann_Zeta_Function| , a key analytic object at the roots of the subject. , p. 1.            An  algebraic number  is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation f0 with rational coefficients; for example, every solution x of x5 + x3 - 7 x2 + 9 0 is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called  algebraic number field s, or shortly  number field s. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields. , p. 2. Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.     It could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in Disquisitiones arithmeticae can be restated in terms of  |ideals|Ideal|  and    |norms|Norm|  in quadratic fields.    For that matter, the 11th-century  |chakravala_method|Chakravala_Method|  amounts—in modern terms—to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither  |Bhāskara|Bhāskara_Ii|  nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.     The grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ideal numbers, the theory of ideals and valuation theory were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers  seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws, that is, generalisations of  |quadratic_reciprocity|Quadratic_Reciprocity| .     Number fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field L is said to be an extension of a field K if L contains K.      Classifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions—that is, extensions L of K such that the  |Galois_group|Galois_Group|  The Galois group of an extension K/L consists of the operations  that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.   Thus, for instance, Gal consists of two elements: the identity element    and complex conjugation   .   The Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with  |Évariste_Galois|Évariste_Galois| ; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation f    0 can be solved by radicals    if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation f    0 has a Galois group that is  |solvable|Solvable_Group|    in the sense of group theory. Gal of L over K is an  |abelian_group|Abelian_Group| —are relatively well understood.   Their classification was the object of the programme of  |class_field_theory|Class_Field_Theory| , which was initiated in the late 19th century  and carried out largely in 1900–1950.     An example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is  |Iwasawa_theory|Iwasawa_Theory| . The  |Langlands_program|Langlands_Program| , one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.            The central problem of Diophantine geometry is to determine when a  |Diophantine_equation|Diophantine_Equation|  has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.     For example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a  |curve|Algebraic_Curve| , a  |surface|Algebraic_Surface|  or some other such object in n-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any  rational points  or   integral points on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is if there are finitely   or infinitely many rational points on a given curve .     In the  |Pythagorean_equation|Pythagorean_Theorem|  x2+y2 1,   we would like to study its rational solutions, that is, its solutions   such that   x and y are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions   to a2 + b2 c2 ; any solution to the latter equation gives   us a solution x a/c , y b/c to the former. It is also the   same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve   described by x2 + y2 1 .          The rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve—that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation f0 , where f is a polynomial in two variables—turns out to depend crucially on the genus of the curve. The genus can be defined as follows: If we want to study the curve y2 x3 + 7 . We allow x and y to be complex numbers: 2 3 + 7 . This is, in effect, a set of two equations on four variables, since both the real   and the imaginary part on each side must match. As a result, we get a surface in four-dimensional space. After we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface , we can   plot the resulting projection, which is a surface in ordinary three-dimensional space. It   then becomes clear that the result is a  |torus|Torus| , loosely speaking, the surface of a doughnut . A doughnut has one hole; hence the genus is 1. allow the variables in f0 to be complex numbers; then f0 defines a 2-dimensional surface in 4-dimensional space . If we count the number of holes in the surface; we call this number the genus of f0 . Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial.
