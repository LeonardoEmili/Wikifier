               Silicon is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Si and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  14. It is a hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre; and it is a  |tetravalent|Tetravalence| |metalloid|Metalloid|  and  |semiconductor|Semiconductor| . It is a member of  |group_14|Carbon_Group|  in the periodic table:  |carbon|Carbon|  is above it; and  |germanium|Germanium| ,  |tin|Tin| , and  |lead|Lead|  are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that  |Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|  was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form.  Its melting and boiling points of 1414  °C and 3265  °C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by  |boron|Boron| . Silicon is the eighth most  |common_element|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earths crust. It is most widely distributed in  |dusts|Dust| ,  |sands|Sand| ,  |planetoids|Planetoids| , and  |planets|Planet|  as various forms of  |silicon_dioxide|Silicon_Dioxide|  or  |silicates|Silicate| . More than 90% of the Earths crust is composed of  |silicate_minerals|Silicate_Minerals| , making silicon the  |second_most_abundant_element|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  in the Earths crust after  |oxygen|Oxygen| .     Most silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with  |clays|Clays| ,  |silica_sand|Silica_Sand| , and  |stone|Stone| . Silicates are used in  |Portland_cement|Portland_Cement|  for  |mortar|Mortar|  and  |stucco|Stucco| , and mixed with silica sand and  |gravel|Gravel|  to make  |concrete|Concrete|  for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware  |ceramics|Ceramic|  such as  |porcelain|Porcelain| , and in traditional  |quartz|Quartz| -based  |soda-lime_glass|Soda-Lime_Glass|  and many other specialty  |glass|Glass| es. Silicon compounds such as  |silicon_carbide|Silicon_Carbide|  are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called  |silicones|Silicone| .     The late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age  due to elemental silicon having a large impact on the modern world economy. The relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in  |semiconductor_electronics|Semiconductor_Electronics|  .
