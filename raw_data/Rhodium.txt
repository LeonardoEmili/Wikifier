           Rhodium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Rh and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard,  |corrosion-resistant|Corrosion| , and chemically  |inert|Chemically_Inert| |transition_metal|Transition_Metal| . It is a  |noble_metal|Noble_Metal|  and a member of the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group| . It has only one naturally occurring  |isotope|Isotope| , 103 Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as free metal, as an alloy with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as  |bowieite|Bowieite|  and  |rhodplumsite|Rhodplumsite| . It is one of the rarest and most valuable  |precious_metals|Precious_Metal| .     Rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores together with the other members of the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group|  metals. It was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in 1803 by  |William_Hyde_Wollaston|William_Hyde_Wollaston|  in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds.     The elements major use is as one of the  |catalysts|Catalyst|  in the  |three-way_catalytic_converters|Catalytic_Converterthree-Way|  in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually  |alloy|Alloy| ed with  |platinum|Platinum|  or  |palladium|Palladium|  and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings.  |White_gold|Colored_Goldwhite_Gold|  is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while  |sterling_silver|Sterling_Silver|  is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance. Rhodium is sometimes used to cure silicones, a two part silicone where one part contains a silicon hydride and the other containing a vinyl terminated silicone are mixed. One of these liquids contains a rhodium complex. Armin Fehn and Juergen Weidinger, Wacker Chemie AG, US patent US7129309B2     Rhodium detectors are used in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor|  to measure the  |neutron_flux_level|Neutron_Detection| . Other uses of rhodium include asymmetric hydrogenation used to form drug precursors and the processes for the production of  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid| .          Rhodium  was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in 1803 by  |William_Hyde_Wollaston|William_Hyde_Wollaston| ,  soon after his discovery of  |palladium|Palladium| .    He used crude  |platinum|Platinum|  ore presumably obtained from  |South_America|South_America| .  His procedure involved dissolving the ore in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia|  and neutralizing the acid with  |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  . He then precipitated the platinum as  |ammonium_chloroplatinate|Ammonium_Chloroplatinate|  by adding  |ammonium_chloride|Ammonium_Chloride|  . Most other metals like  |copper|Copper| ,  |lead|Lead| ,  |palladium|Palladium|  and rhodium were precipitated with  |zinc|Zinc| . Diluted  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  dissolved all but palladium and rhodium. Of these, palladium dissolved in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia|  but rhodium did not,  and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride|  as . After being washed with ethanol, the rose-red precipitate was reacted with zinc, which  |displaced|Displacement_Reaction|  the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal.      After the discovery, the rare element had only minor applications; for example, by the turn of the century, rhodium-containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to 1800   oC.   They have exceptionally good stability in the temperature range of 1300 to 1800 oC J.V. Pearce, F. Edler, C.J. Elliott, A. Greenen, P.M. Harris, C.G. Izquierdo, Y.G. Kim, M.J. Martin, I.M. Smith, D. Tucker and R.I. Veitcheva, A systematic investigation of the thermoelectric stability of Pt-Rh thermocouples between 1300 degrees C and 1500 degrees C, METROLOGIA, 2018, Volume: 55 Issue: 4 Pages: 558-567     The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating.  The introduction of the three-way  |catalytic_converter|Catalytic_Converter|  by  |Volvo|Volvo|  in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of  |NO_x|Nox|  in the exhaust.               Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable metal that has a high  |reflectance|Reflectance| . Rhodium metal does not normally form an  |oxide|Oxide| , even when heated.   |Oxygen|Oxygen|  is absorbed from the  |atmosphere|Atmosphere|  only at the  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  of rhodium, but is released on solidification.  Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower  |density|Density|  than  |platinum|Platinum| . It is not attacked by most  |acids|Acid| : it is completely insoluble in  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  and dissolves slightly in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| .          Rhodium belongs to  |group_9|Group_9_Element|  of the periodic table, but the configuration of electrons in the outermost shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements,  |niobium|Niobium|  ,  |ruthenium|Ruthenium|  , and  |palladium|Palladium|  .          The common  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  of rhodium is +3, but oxidation states from 0 to +6 are also observed.      Unlike  |ruthenium|Ruthenium|  and  |osmium|Osmium| , rhodium forms no volatile oxygen compounds. The known stable oxides include , , , ,  and .  Halogen compounds are known in nearly the full range of possible oxidation states.  |Rhodium_chloride|Rhodium_Chloride| , rhodium fluoride, rhodium fluoride and  |rhodium_fluoride|Rhodium_Hexafluoride|  are examples. The lower oxidation states are stable only in the presence of ligands. Griffith, W. P. The Rarer Platinum Metals, John Wiley and Sons: New   York, 1976, p. 313.     The best-known rhodium-halogen compound is the  |Wilkinsons_catalyst|Wilkinsons_Catalyst|  chlorotrisrhodium. This catalyst is used in the  |hydroformylation|Hydroformylation|  or  |hydrogenation|Hydrogenation|  of  |alkenes|Alkene| .             Naturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one  |isotope|Isotope| , 103 Rh. The most stable  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  are 101 Rh with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 3.3 years, 102 Rh with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 207 days, 102m Rh with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 2.9 years, and 99 Rh with a half-life of 16.1 days. Twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with  |atomic_weights|Atomic_Weight|  ranging from 92.926  |u|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  to 116.925 u . Most of these have half-lives shorter than an hour, except 100 Rh and 105 Rh . Rhodium has numerous  |meta_states|Meta_State| , the most stable being 102m Rh with a half-life of about 2.9 years and 101m Rh with a half-life of 4.34 days .      In isotopes weighing less than 103 , the primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  is  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  and the primary  |decay_product|Decay_Product|  is  |ruthenium|Ruthenium| . In isotopes greater than 103, the primary decay mode is  |beta_emission|Beta_Emission|  and the primary product is  |palladium|Palladium| . David R. Lide , Norman E. Holden in CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 85th Edition CRC Press. Boca Raton, Florida . Section 11, Table of the Isotopes.       Rhodium is one of the  |rarest_elements_in_the_Earths_crust|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust| , comprising an estimated 0.0002  |parts_per_million|Parts-Per_Notation|  . Barbalace, Kenneth,  . Environmental Chemistry.com; retrieved 2007-04-14. Its rarity affects its price and its use in commercial applications. The concentration of rhodium in  |nickel_meteorites|Nickel_Meteorites|  is typically 1  |parts_per_billion|Parts-Per_Notation| . D.E.Ryan, J.Holzbecher and R.R.Brooks, Chemical Geology, Volume 85, Issues 3–4, 30 July 1990, Pages 295-303 Rhodium is present in  |potato|Potato| es in a range between 109 ppb to 7 ppt. Orecchio and Amorello, Foods, 2019, volume 8, issue 2,           The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex because the ores are mixed with other metals such as  |palladium|Palladium| ,  |silver|Silver| ,  |platinum|Platinum| , and  |gold|Gold|  and there are very few rhodium-bearing  |minerals|Mineral| . It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the  |Ural_Mountains|Ural_Mountains| ; and in North America, including the  |copper|Copper| - |nickel_sulfide|Nickel_Sulfide|  mining area of the  |Sudbury|Greater_Sudbury| ,  |Ontario|Ontario| , region. Although the rhodium abundance at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.     The main exporter of rhodium is South Africa followed by Russia. The annual world production is 30  |tonnes|Tonne| . The price of rhodium is highly variable. In 2007, rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold, 450 times more than silver, and 27,250 times more than copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce . The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ; the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 , but in late 2013, the prices were less than $1000.     Political and financial problems led to very low oil prices and oversupply, causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per  |Troy_ounce|Troy_Ounce|  in late November 2015.           Rhodium is a fission product of  |uranium-235|Uranium-235| |Used_nuclear_fuel|Used_Nuclear_Fuel|  is therefore a potential source of rhodium, but the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope , or about 10 years. These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.          The primary use of this element is in automobiles as a  |catalytic_converter|Catalytic_Converter| , changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases. Of 30,000  kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2012, 81% went into this application, and 8,060  kg was recovered from old converters. About 964  kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry, mostly for production of fiberglass and flat-panel glass, and 2,520  kg was used in the chemical industry.        Rhodium is preferable to the other platinum metals in the  |reduction|Redox|  of  |nitrogen_oxides|Nitrogen_Oxides|  to  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  and  |oxygen|Oxygen|      : 2  → x  +      Rhodium  |catalysts|Catalyst|  are used in a number of industrial processes, notably in catalytic carbonylation of  |methanol|Methanol|  to produce  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid|  by the  |Monsanto_process|Monsanto_Process| .  It is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular  |double_bonds|Double_Bond| , a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers.  Rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce  |benzene|Benzene|  to  |cyclohexane|Cyclohexane| .      The complex of a rhodium ion with  |BINAP|Binap|  is a widely used chiral catalyst for  |chiral_synthesis|Chiral_Synthesis| , as in the synthesis of  |menthol|Menthol| .  ,.       Rhodium finds use in  |jewelry|Jewelry|  and for decorations. It is  |electroplated|Electroplated|  on  |white_gold|White_Gold|  and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating  |sterling_silver|Sterling_Silver|  to protect against tarnish . Solid rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication than because of the high price.  The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an  |electroplate|Electroplating| .   Rhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status, when more commonly used metals such as silver, gold or platinum were deemed insufficient. In 1979 the  Guinness Book of World Records  gave  |Paul_McCartney|Paul_Mccartney|  a rhodium-plated disc for being historys all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.        Rhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance of  |platinum|Platinum|  and  |palladium|Palladium| . These alloys are used in furnace windings, bushings for glass fiber production,  |thermocouple|Thermocouple|  elements,  |electrodes|Electrode|  for aircraft  |spark_plugs|Spark_Plug| , and laboratory crucibles.  Other uses include:    |Electrical_contacts|Switchcontacts| , where it is valued for small  |electrical_resistance|Electrical_Resistance| , small and stable  |contact_resistance|Contact_Resistance| , and great  |corrosion|Corrosion|  resistance.    Rhodium plated by either  |electroplating|Electroplating|  or evaporation is extremely hard and useful for optical instruments.    Filters in  |mammography|Mammography|  systems for the characteristic X-rays it produces.    Rhodium neutron detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels – this method requires a digital filter to determine the current neutron flux level, generating three separate signals: immediate, a few seconds delay, and a minute delay, each with its own signal level; all three are combined in the rhodium detector signal. The three  |Palo_Verde|Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station|  nuclear reactors each have 305 rhodium neutron detectors, 61 detectors on each of five vertical levels, providing an accurate 3D picture of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to consume the nuclear fuel most economically.      In automobile manufacturing, Rhodium is also used in the construction of headlight reflectors. Stwertka, Albert. A Guide to the Elements, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 125.     Being a  |noble_metal|Noble_Metal| , pure rhodium is inert. However, chemical complexes of rhodium can be reactive.  |Median_lethal_dose|Median_Lethal_Dose|  for rats is 198  mg of rhodium chloride  per kilogram of body weight.  Like the other noble metals, all of which are too inert to occur as chemical compounds in nature, rhodium has not been found to serve any biological function. In elemental form, the metal is harmless.      People can be exposed to rhodium in the workplace by inhalation. The  |Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration|Occupational_Safety_And_Health_Administration|  has specified the legal limit  for rhodium exposure in the workplace at 0.1  mg/m 3 over an 8-hour workday, and the  |National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health|National_Institute_For_Occupational_Safety_And_Health|  has set the  |recommended_exposure_limit|Recommended_Exposure_Limit|  , at the same level. At levels of 100  mg/m 3 , rhodium is  |immediately_dangerous_to_life_or_health|Immediately_Dangerous_To_Life_Or_Health| .  For soluble compounds, the PEL and REL are both 0.001  mg/m 3 .
