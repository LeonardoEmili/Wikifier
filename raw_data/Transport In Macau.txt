        Transport in Macau includes road, sea and air transport.  |Road|Road|  transport is the primary mode of transport within  |Macau|Macau|  as there are no  |railways|Railways| . The main forms of public transport are  |buses|Buses|  and  |taxis|Taxi| . A  |light_rail|Macau_Light_Rail_Transit|  system is currently under construction.     Modes of transport out of Macau include  |ferries|Ferries|  to  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong|  and  |mainland_China|Mainland_China|  from two ferry terminals, as well as  |helicopter|Helicopter|  service to Hong Kong. International flights are available from  |Macau_International_Airport|Macau_International_Airport| .                        Buses and taxis are the major modes of public transport in Macau.  |Bus|Transmac|  services are frequent and inexpensive,  linking the  |Macau_peninsula|Macau_Peninsula| ,  |Taipa|Taipa| ,  |Cotai|Cotai|  and  |Coloane|Coloane| .  |Transmac|Transmac| ,  |Transportas_Companhia_de_Macau|Transportas_Companhia_De_Macau|  and the newly established Macau Nova Era de Autocarros Públicos, replaced former  |Reolian_Public_Transport_Co.|Reolian_Public_Transport_Co.| , are the sole operators of Macaus bus services. Most hotels and gaming venues operate their own fleet of shuttle bus service between the  |Hong_Kong-Macau_Ferry_Terminal|Hong_Kong-Macau_Ferry_Pier,_Macau| ,  |Taipa_Ferry_Terminal|Taipa_Temporary_Ferry_Terminal|  or Portas do Cerco and their premises.     Taxis are plentiful near the airport/Taipa ferry terminal, the Hong Kong-Macau and Taipa ferry terminal, and major gaming venues/hotels in the city  though it is harder to get one during rush hours on the streets. Most of Macaus taxis have a black body with cream color top livery. Radio taxis are available for the black cabs.       In order to enhance the quality of taxi services, such as eliminate the language barrier between  |taxi|Taxicab|  drivers and passengers, the Tourist Office has provided most taxis with a destination guide which includes the names of the most requested destinations in  |Chinese|Chinese_Language| ,  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  and  |English|English_Language| .     The  |trishaw|Cycle_Rickshaw| , a hybrid of the  |tricycle|Tricycle|  and the  |rickshaw|Pulled_Rickshaw| , is a unique mode of transport in Macau, though it is mainly for sightseeing purposes but they were a type of mainly used transportation system before the 1970s because of their cheap price. They can easily be found next to Hotel Lisboa and the Macau ferry terminal waiting for passengers.               There are no railways in Macau , but the  |Macau_Light_Rail_Transit|Macau_Light_Rail_Transit|  system is under construction, with the opening of the first phase targeted for 2019. Similar to the  |Singapore_Light_Rapid_Transit|Light_Rapid_Transit|  system, the tracks will be a mix of  |elevated|Elevated_Railway|  guideways and tunnels, ensuring a dedicated right-of-way separated from road traffic. When completed it will serve passengers on Macau Peninsula, Taipa island, the Cotai reclamation area and Macau International Airport.     Proposals have been put forward to link Macau to the Chinese railway network by extending the Guangzhou Railway  to Cotai through  |Hengqin_Island|Hengqin| .  Macau - Meeting Point: a Legacy for the Future , published by the Comissão Territorial de Macau para es Comemorações does Descobrimentos Portugueses, p.6. However, no decisions have yet been made so far.      |Zhuhai_Railway_Station|Zhuhai_Railway_Station|  of the  |Guangzhou–Zhuhai_Intercity_Railway|Guangzhou–Zhuhai_Intercity_Railway|  terminates adjacent to the northern border entrance into Macau at  |Portas_do_Cerco|Portas_Do_Cerco| .       The Macau Maritime Museum   used to have two sailing vessels serving for touring trips between the inner and outer harbours. Along the trip, the crew would introduce the general lifestyle and customs of the local boat dwellers. However, due to the  |land_reclamation|Land_Reclamation|  works in the harbour and the maintenance of the boats, all trips have been suspended.                 Over 150 sea-crossing services are scheduled daily between Macau and Hong Kong,  and the  |Outer_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal|Outer_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal,_Macau|  serves as the major terminal for Macaus passenger traffic by sea. The route is served by high speed  |catamarans|Catamaran|  and  |jetfoils|Jetfoil|  and the journey takes approximately one hour. There are also daily scheduled ferry services between Macau and  |Shenzhen|Shenzhen| . At present the services are operated by  |TurboJET|Turbojet|  from  |Sheung_Wan|Hong_Kong-Macau_Ferry_Terminal,_Hong_Kong| ,  |Tsim_Sha_Tsui|China_Hong_Kong_City|  and  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Skypier| .  |Cotai_Water_Jet|Cotai_Water_Jet|  also operates services between  |Taipa_Ferry_Terminal|Taipa_Ferry_Terminal|  and the  |Sheung_Wan|Hong_Kong_–_Macau_Ferry_Terminal,_Hong_Kong| , Tsim Sha Tsui and Hong Kong International Airport. Apart from the sea routes there are also regular scheduled helicopter services between Hong Kong and Macau, which are operated by  |Sky_Shuttle|Sky_Shuttle| . The trip takes approximately 20 minutes.     A sea-crossing service has been launched by  |TurboJET|Turbojet|  which travels between the  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Hong_Kong_International_Airport|  and Macau. This differs from the above Macau-Hong Kong route since travelers who arrive in Hong Kong by air do not have to go through Hong Kong immigrations passport control and can board a direct ferry to Macau through a special transfer terminal within the airport. On the return trip, travelers can directly reach the  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Hong_Kong_International_Airport|  by ferry and arrive at the airport without going through Hong Kong immigrations passport control, though airline check-in has to be done for some airlines within the airport prior to boarding a plane. Later on, the Cotai Water Jet launched the same service linking Hong Kong Airport and Macau but mostly embarked at Taipa Ferry Terminal.     A new ferry terminal, which is adjacent to the  |Macau_International_Airport|Macau_International_Airport| , is under construction and upon completion some of the passenger traffic by sea will be diverted to the new facility. It is expected to act as a major hub for passenger transfer between the  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Hong_Kong_International_Airport|  and the Macau International Airport.     From  |Inner_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal|Inner_Harbour_Ferry_Terminal|  , ferry services were available between Macau and Wanzai,  |Zhuhai|Zhuhai|  until January, 2016 due to safety issues at the  |Wanzai_Ferry_Terminal|Wanzai_Ferry_Terminal| .             Air service in Macau began in the 1930s with  |Pan_American_Airways|Pan_American_Airways|  operating  |seaplanes|Seaplane|  from Macau to Hong Kong and lasted until 1941. , China Briefing, July 15, 2008 In 1948  |Cathay_Pacific_Airways|Cathay_Pacific_Airways|  commenced Hong Kong to Macau seaplane service under their subsidiary  |Macau_Air_Transport_Company|Macau_Air_Transport_Company|  . MATCO operated from the Outer Harbour Terminal along Avenida da Amizade to  |Kai_Tak_Airport|Kai_Tak_Airport|  in  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| . The scheduled passenger service continued until 1961 when MATCO ceased operations.     The  |Macau_International_Airport|Macau_International_Airport| , located at Taipa, serves as the terminal for Macaus international air traffic. It was inaugurated on 9 November 1995 and has since established a number of regular flights between Macau and major cities in Northeast and Southeast Asia, such as  |Bangkok|Bangkok| ,  |Beijing|Beijing| ,  |Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung| ,  |Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala_Lumpur| ,  |Manila|Manila| ,  |Osaka|Osaka| ,  |Seoul|Seoul| ,  |Shanghai|Shanghai| ,  |Singapore|Singapore| , and  |Taipei|Taipei| .     Passengers who would like to enter mainland China by land can use the Two Customs, One Checkpoint service provided by the Macau International Airport. Passengers can request the Express Link service at the check-in counter of their respective airlines. When arriving at the Macau International Airport, they can simply follow the Express Link signs and board the Air-to-Land transfer. Passengers do not have to go through Macaus immigration and customs checkpoint until they reach the border of mainland China.     Owing to its relatively low landing fees and the business opportunities brought by the booming gaming industry in Macau, the airport has attracted several Asias  |low-cost_carriers|Low-Cost_Carrier|  such as  |AirAsia|Airasia| ,  |Tigerair|Tigerair| ,  |Cebu_Pacific|Cebu_Pacific| , etc. to establish regular flights between Macau and several major cities in Southeast Asia. As a result, it has been gradually developing into a major hub for low-cost air travel within the region. Other traditional carriers, such as the local flag carrier  |Air_Macau|Air_Macau| , the Taiwanese carrier  |EVA_Air|Eva_Air| , and even carriers which operate similar routes from Hong Kong, are facing potential challenges from these newcomers.     Due to a lack of intercontinental flights from Macau, air passengers are also served by  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Hong_Kong_International_Airport|  and  |Shenzhen_Baoan_International_Airport|Shenzhen_Baoan_International_Airport| . Passengers can take ferries from the Outer Harbor and Taipa terminals to the  |Skypier|Skypier|  in Hong Kong, .  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Hong_Kong_International_Airport| .

Macau has 321 kilometres of public roads, three bridges linking the Macau Peninsula and Taipa, and a tunnel through the Guia Hill linking the Horta e Costa area and the New Port Area . The three bridges are the  |Friendship_Bridge|Ponte_De_Amizade| ; the  |Macau-Taipa_Bridge|Ponte_Governador_Nobre_De_Carvalho| ; and the  |Sai_Van_Bridge|Ponte_De_Sai_Van| .     The  |Lotus_Bridge|Lotus_Bridge|  links Cotai with  |Hengqin_New_Area|Hengqin_New_Area|  of Zhuhai. Unlike  |mainland_China|Mainland_China| , where traffic drives on the right, traffic in Macau and Hong Kong drives on the left, therefore a special design has been used to build this bridge to facilitate the change in driving directions.     Roads are generally narrow at the heart of the city and parked cars are always found on both sides of the road. Traffic congestion has been a major problem throughout the day owing to the lack of efficient mass transit system and a relatively high car to population ratio.     There are three cross-border checkpoints, Portas do Cerco, Parque Industrial Transfronteiri, located at Ilha Verde, and Cotai for connection Mainland China. Except Portas do Cerco, operation time from 06:00 to 01:00, the others are in 24-hour operation.     The recent opening of the  |Hong_Kong–Zhuhai–Macau_Bridge|Hong_Kong–Zhuhai–Macau_Bridge| , opened in October 2018 has formed the first single road link between  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| ,  |Macau|Macau|  and the chinese mainland at  |Zhuhai|Zhuhai| . This 50  km link consists of a series of bridges and tunnels crossing the  |Lingdingyang|Lingdingyang|  channel, that connects these three major cities on the  |Pearl_River_Delta|Pearl_River_Delta|  in  |China|China| .        |Macau_Container_Port|Macau_Container_Port| , located at the Inner Harbour area on the west side of the  |Macau|Macau|  peninsula    |Ká_Hó_Port|Kai_Ho_Port| , located on the  |Coloane|Coloane|.
