        Welcome to the Pleasuredome is the title track to the 1984  |debut_album|Welcome_To_The_Pleasuredome|  by  |Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood|Frankie_Goes_To_Hollywood| . The lyrics of the song were inspired by the poem  Kubla Khan  by  |Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge|Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge| .     In March 1985, the album track was substantially abridged and remixed for release as the groups fourth UK single.     While criticized at the time of release and afterward for being a song that glorifies debauchery, the lyrics make clear that the point of the song, just as Coleridges poem, is about the dangers of this kind of lifestyle. This song, along with  |Relax|Relax|  , made Frankie Goes to Hollywood even more controversial than they already were.       Despite the groups record label  pre-emptively promoting the single as their fourth number one , an achievement that would have set a new UK record for consecutive number one singles by a debuting artist, Welcome to the Pleasuredome peaked at number two in the UK singles chart, being kept off the top spot by the  |Phil_Collins|Phil_Collins| / |Philip_Bailey|Philip_Bailey|  duet  |Easy_Lover|Easy_Lover|  . The single spent a total of eleven weeks on the UK chart.     It was the first release by the group not to reach number one and, despite representing a creditable success in its own right, it symbolically confirmed the end of the chart invincibility that the group had enjoyed during 1984. Frankie Goes to Hollywood would not release another record for seventeen months, and they would ultimately fail to emulate their past glories upon their return.     The spoken-word introductions to both  |12-inch|12-Inch_Single|  mixes are adapted from  |Walter_Kaufmanns|Walter_Kaufmann|  1967 translation of  |Friedrich_Nietzsches|Friedrich_Nietzsche|   The Birth of Tragedy . The recitation on the first 12-inch is by Gary Taylor, whilst that on the second 12-inch and the cassette is by actor  |Geoffrey_Palmer|Geoffrey_Palmer| . It is unknown whether Palmers concluding Welcome To The Pleasuredrome was a genuine mistake or a deliberately scripted one.     This is the only single from the group that was not released on a CD single at that time, the other being Watching The Wildlife . Relax ,  |Two_Tribes|Two_Tribes|  , The Power of Love and  |Rage_Hard|Rage_Hard| + all saw a CD-maxi release in Germany at the end of the 80s. Welcome to the Pleasuredome was not given such a release. However, the 7 vinyl single was released in two different mixes, and it was purely random as to which one you ended up with, as both mixes were in identical sleeve designs and carried the same catalogue number. Not only that, but the subtitle used to identify different mixes was identical on both record labels, with only the matrix number on the run out groove giving the game away. The first 7 carried the normal 7 single mix, which was guitar driven. However, the secret alternative mix was quite different, and featured on the Apple shaped Picture Disc. The subtitle for that disc was alternative reel but on the 7 single the subtitle remained unchanged as altered real.   In fact, although appearing to be identical sleeves, the two mixes were actually released in slightly different ones. The standard 7 mix came in a thick paper sleeve, whereas the secret one came in a thin paper sleeve.            All releases featured an edited version of Get It On , originally recorded for a  |BBC_Radio_1|Bbc_Radio_1|  session in 1983 , plus a faded or full length version of Happy Hi! , a non-album track.     Both  |Relax|Relax|  and  |Born_To_Run|Born_To_Run|  are live recordings , based on an actual live appearance on  The Tube s Europe A-Go-Go in  |Newcastle|Newcastle_Upon_Tyne|  during early January 1985.       The video, by  |Bernard_Rose|Bernard_Rose| , features the group stealing a car, going to a carnival and encountering all manner of deceptively pleasureable activities. The audio soundtrack of the video was included as part of the  |cassette_single|Cassette_Single| .       In 1984, a few months prior to the albums release, an early instrumental version of the album track was issued as a promotional 12-inch single, entitled Welcome to the Pleasuredome , along with a similar early instrumental of The Only Star in Heaven . These tracks were subsequently given wider release as part of the B-side to the second 12-inch of  |The_Power_of_Love|The_Power_Of_Love|  single.     Welcome to the Pleasuredome was also used on several promotional records in the USA during 1985, featuring the following tracks in various combinations:   The second UK 7-inch mix of the track , labeled  |Trevor_Horn|Trevor_Horn|  Re-mix Edit .   An edited version of the album track created by the  |Sacramento|Sacramento,_California|  radio station KZAP, and known as Welcome to the Pleasuredome   A version of the second UK 7-inch mix with a new introduction added, and known as Welcome to the Pleasuredome . This is on the  |Bang!|Bang!|  Japanese album and CD, alongside the digital Fruitness single.   A slightly edited version of Relax         |Peter_Gill|Peter_Gill| / |Holly_Johnson|Holly_Johnson| / |Brian_Nash|Brian_Nash| / |Mark_OToole|Mark_Otoole| , unless otherwise noted.

Also issued in Australia without Get It On .       Welcome to the Pleasuredome – 9:42   Get It On – 3:28   Happy Hi! – 4:04   Relax — 4:51   Get It On is the same as the UK 7 edit.   Relax was rereleased in 2012 on CD  |Sexmix|Sexmix|  Disk 1, Track 6 in a very slightly edited version.          ; A : Fruitness   Welcome to the Pleasuredome – 12:15   ; B : Fruitness and light   Get It On – 2:32   Happy Hi! – 4:04   Born to Run – 4:49   Fruitness is commonly referred as The Alternative by fans.   Born to Run was recorded live in Newcastle in January 1985 on the Europe A Go Go tour. On other releases this version is labeled as Born to Run       Welcome to the Pleasuredome - 9:47   Get It On - 2:32   Happy Hi! - 4:02   Relax - 4:51   A-side is actually the Real Altered mix.

A 11:40 version of the regular Real Altered appears on the digital release and  |Sexmix|Sexmix| .   This complete cassette was slightly edited rereleased in 2012 on CD  |Sexmix|Sexmix|  Disk 1, Tracks 1–5. By mistake, the rerelease was originally printed in  |Monaural|Monaural|  and was corrected via a mail-in replacement campaign.       The track has periodically been reissued as a single, including during 1993 and 2000. Although these releases have some admirers, and have usefully made available various original mixes on CD for the first time, the accompanying A-side remixes by contemporary DJs have tended on the whole to bear little or no comparison to the spirit of the originals.     Reissues in the groups name have also tended to shun any overt reference to the identity of the original artists, and the reissue artwork has notably featured no images of the group. It has been suggested that this situation may relate to Johnsons successful but acrimonious court case against ZTT in 1989, which freed him from their unfair contract with the label.     1993 reissues       Welcome To The Pleasuredome – 4:22   Welcome To The Pleasuredome – 14:36   Welcome To The Pleasuredome – 6:06   Welcome To The Pleasuredome – 9:41     Track 4 is mislabeled.
