      Lawrencium is a  |synthetic|Synthetic_Element| |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Lr and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  103. It is named in honor of  |Ernest_Lawrence|Ernest_Lawrence| , inventor of the  |cyclotron|Cyclotron| , a device that was used to discover many artificial  |radioactive|Radioactive|  elements. A radioactive  |metal|Metal| , lawrencium is the eleventh  |transuranic_element|Transuranic_Element|  and is also the final member of the  |actinide|Actinide|  series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator|  by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve  |isotopes_of_lawrencium|Isotopes_Of_Lawrencium|  are currently known; the most stable is 266 Lr with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 11  hours, but the shorter-lived 260 Lr is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.     Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier  |homolog|Homology|  to  |lutetium|Lutetium|  in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , and is a  |trivalent|Valence|  element. It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th-period  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| : however, its  |electron_configuration|Electron_Configuration|  is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an  |s_2_p|Atomic_Orbital|  configuration instead of the s 2 d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more  |volatile|Volatility|  than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of  |lead|Lead| .     In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and the  |United_States|United_States| . The priority of the discovery and therefore the  |naming_of_the_element_was_disputed|Element_Naming_Controversy|  between Soviet and American scientists, and while the  |International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry|  initially established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the elements name.          In 1958, scientists at the  |Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|  claimed the discovery of element 102, now called  |nobelium|Nobelium| . At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same  |curium|Curium|  target used with  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| -14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with  |decay_energy|Decay_Energy|  around  and half-life around   s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257 Lr , the evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of the strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103.   Later, in 1960, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252  |Cf|Californium|  with 10 B and 11 B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.     The first important work on element 103 was carried out at Berkeley by the  |nuclear-physics|Nuclear_Physics|  team of  |Albert_Ghiorso|Albert_Ghiorso| , Torbjørn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, Robert M. Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961. The first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly produced by bombarding a three- |milligram|Milligram|  target consisting of three isotopes of the element  |californium|Californium|  with  |boron|Boron| -10 and boron-11  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus|  from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator .  The Berkeley team reported that the  |isotope|Isotope|  257 103 was detected in this manner, and that it decayed by emitting an 8.6  MeV  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle|  with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of . This identification was later corrected to be 258 103, as later work proved that 257 Lr did not have the properties detected, but 258 Lr did. This was considered at the time to be convincing proof of the synthesis of element 103: while the mass assignment was less certain and proved to be mistaken, it did not affect the arguments in favor of element 103 having been synthesized. Scientists at the  |Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research|Joint_Institute_For_Nuclear_Research|  in  |Dubna|Dubna|   raised several criticisms: all but one were answered adequately. The exception was that 252 Cf was the most common isotope in the target, and in the reactions with 10 B, 258 Lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons, and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five. This would lead to a narrow yield curve, not the broad one reported by the Berkeley team. A possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element 103. This was an important intermediate step to the unquestioned discovery of element 103, although the evidence was not completely convincing. The Berkeley team proposed the name lawrencium with symbol Lw , after  |Ernest_Orlando_Lawrence|Ernest_Orlando_Lawrence| , inventor of the  |cyclotron|Cyclotron| . The IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry accepted the name, but changed the symbol to Lr .  This acceptance of the discovery was later characterized as being hasty by the Dubna team.     : +  →   + 5      The first work at Dubna on element 103 came in 1965, when they reported to have created 256 103 in 1965 by bombarding 243  |Am|Americium|  with 18  |O|Oxygen| , identifying it indirectly from its  |granddaughter|Decay_Product| |fermium|Fermium| -252. The half-life they reported was somewhat too high, possibly due to background events. Later 1967 work on the same reaction identified two decay energies in the ranges 8.35–8.50  MeV and 8.50–8.60  MeV: these were assigned to 256 103 and 257 103. Despite repeated attempts, they were unable to confirm assignment of an alpha emitter with a half-life of eight seconds to 257 103.     :Translated in  The Russians proposed the name rutherfordium for the new element in 1967: this name was later used for  |element_104|Rutherfordium| .     : +  →   + 5      Further experiments in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an  |actinide|Actinide|  chemistry for the new element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide.  In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255 103 with half-life 20  s and alpha decay energy 8.38  MeV. However, it was not until 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, Silva, pp. 1641–2  that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeleys group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257 103 instead of the probably correct 258 103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of  |X-rays|X-Ray|  emitted from 258 103 were measured.        In 1971, the IUPAC granted the discovery of lawrencium to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, even though they did not have ideal data for the elements existence. However, in 1992, the  |IUPAC|Iupac|  Trans-fermium Working Group officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium, concluding that while the 1961 Berkeley experiments were an important step to lawrenciums discovery, they were not yet completely convincing; and while the 1965, 1968, and 1970 Dubna experiments came very close to the needed level of confidence taken together, only the 1971 Berkeley experiments, which clarified and confirmed previous observations, finally resulted in complete confidence in the discovery of element 103. Because the name lawrencium had been in use for a long time by this point, it was retained by IUPAC, and in August 1997, the  |International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry|  ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol Lr during a meeting in  |Geneva|Geneva| .           Lawrencium is the final member of the  |actinide|Actinide|  series and is sometimes considered to be a  |group_3_element|Group_3_Element| , along with  |scandium|Scandium| ,  |yttrium|Yttrium| , and  |lutetium|Lutetium| , as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the  |7th-period|Period_7_Element| |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| . In the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , it is located to the right of the actinide  |nobelium|Nobelium| , to the left of the 6d transition metal  |rutherfordium|Rutherfordium| , and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a  |hexagonal_close-packed|Hexagonal_Close-Packed|  crystal structure , similar to its lighter  |congener|Congener|  lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The  |enthalpy|Enthalpy|  of  |sublimation|Sublimation|  of lawrencium is estimated to be 352  kJ/mol, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons  |delocalized|Delocalized_Electron| , a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of  |heat_of_vaporization|Heat_Of_Vaporization| ,  |bulk_modulus|Bulk_Modulus| , and  |atomic_volume|Atomic_Volume|  of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Silva, p. 1644 Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily  |oxidized|Redox|  by air,  |steam|Steam| , and  |acids|Acid| ,  and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent  |metallic_radius|Metallic_Radius|  of 171   |pm|Picometer| . It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6  g/cm 3 . It is also predicted to have a  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  of around 1900   |K|Kelvin|  , not far from the value for lutetium .           In 1949,  |Glenn_T._Seaborg|Glenn_T._Seaborg| , who devised the actinide concept that elements  |89|Actinium|  to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements  |57|Lanthanum|  to 71, predicted that element 103 should be its final member and that the Lr 3+ ion should be about as stable as Lu 3+ in  |aqueous_solution|Aqueous_Solution| . It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed. Silva, pp. 1644–7     1969 studies on the element showed that lawrencium reacted with  |chlorine|Chlorine|  to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl 3 . Its  |volatility|Volatility|  was found to be similar to that of the chlorides of  |curium|Curium| ,  |fermium|Fermium| , and  |nobelium|Nobelium|  and much less than that of  |rutherfordium|Rutherfordium|  chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500  atoms of the isotope 256 Lr, comparing it with divalent , trivalent , and tetravalent  elements. It was found that lawrencium  |coextracted|Extraction|  with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the 256 Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it  |eluted|Elution|  ahead of  |Md_3+|Mendelevium|  in the elution sequence. Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr 3+ ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium  |fluoride|Fluoride|  and  |hydroxide|Hydroxide|  should both be insoluble in water. Due to the  |actinide_contraction|Lanthanide_Contraction| , the  |ionic_radius|Ionic_Radius|  of Lr 3+ should be smaller than that of Md 3+ , and it should elute ahead of Md 3+ when  |ammonium_α-hydroxyisobutyrate|Ammonium_Α-Hydroxyisobutyrate|  is used as an eluant. Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope 260 Lr confirmed lawrenciums trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as  |erbium|Erbium| , and found that lawrenciums ionic radius was , larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trend| . Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to  and calculated an  |enthalpy_of_hydration|Enthalpy_Of_Hydration|  value of . It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.     It has been speculated that the 7s electrons are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p 1/2 electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr + ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr 3+ to Lr 2+ or Lr + in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the  |standard_electrode_potential|Standard_Electrode_Potential|  of the E° couple was calculated to be less than −1.56   |V|Volt| , indicating that the existence of Lr + ions in aqueous solution was unlikely. The upper limit for the E° couple was predicted to be −0.44  V: the values for E° and E° are predicted to be −2.06  V and +7.9  V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as  |Rf|Rutherfordium|  IV & gt;  |Db|Dubnium|  V & gt;  |Sg|Seaborgium|  VI , and lawrencium continues the trend with Lr III being more stable than Rf IV .      In the molecule lawrencium dihydride , which is predicted to be  |bent|Bent_Molecular_Geometry| , the 6d orbital of lawrencium is not expected to play a role in the bonding, unlike that of  |lanthanum_dihydride|Lanthanum_Dihydride|  . LaH 2 has La–H bond distances of 2.158  Å, while LrH 2 should have shorter Lr–H bond distances of 2.042  Å due to the relativistic contraction and stabilization of the 7s and 7p orbitals involved in the bonding, in contrast to the core-like 5f subshell and the mostly uninvolved 6d subshell. In general, molecular LrH 2 and LrH are expected to resemble the corresponding  |thallium|Thallium|  species more than the corresponding  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  species.  The electron configurations of Lr + and Lr 2+ are expected to be 7s 2 and 7s 1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides which tend to be 5d 1 as Ln 2+ . However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr 3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH 3 than LrH, and Lr |CO|Metal_Carbonyl|  is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ 2 π 1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl 3 just as it is for LuCl 3 and more generally all the LnCl 3 , and the complex anion − is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d 1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be  |its_highest_occupied_molecular_orbital|Homo/Lumo| .          A lawrencium atom has 103 electrons, of which three can act as  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron| . In 1970, it was predicted that the ground-state  |electron_configuration|Electron_Configuration|  of lawrencium was f 14 6d 1 7s 2 , following the  |Aufbau_principle|Aufbau_Principle|  and conforming to the f 14 5d 1 6s 2 configuration of lawrenciums lighter homolog lutetium. Silva, pp. 1643–4 However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous f 14 7s 2 7p 1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results,  more recent studies and calculations confirm the s 2 p suggestion.   1974  |relativistic|Relativistic_Quantum_Chemistry|  calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s 2 p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p 1/2  |orbitals|Atomic_Orbital|  are nearest to the  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.     In 1988, a team of scientists led by Eichler calculated that lawrenciums  |enthalpy_of_adsorption|Enthalpy_Of_Adsorption|  on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrenciums electron configuration. The s 2 p configuration was expected to be more  |volatile|Volatility|  than the s 2 d configuration, and be more similar to that of the  |p-block|P-Block|  element  |lead|Lead| . No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on  |quartz|Quartz|  or  |platinum|Platinum|  was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s 2 p configuration.     In 2015, the first ionization energy of lawrencium was measured, using the isotope 256 Lr.  The measured value, , agreed very well with the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4.963  eV, and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the  |transactinides|Transactinide| . This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides, and supports the s 2 p configuration as the 7p 1/2 electron is expected to be only weakly bound. This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements , and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the  |alkali_metals|Alkali_Metal| |sodium|Sodium|  and  |potassium|Potassium|  in some ways.  Given that the s 2 p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the  |IUPAC|Iupac|  definition ,  unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and the  |group_3_elements|Group_3_Element| , with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified.  It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to  |curium|Curium| , which has an f 7 6d 1 7s 2 configuration, and show the expected f 14 6d 1 7s 2 configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.             Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are known, with  |mass_numbers|Mass_Number|  252–262 and 266; all are radioactive. Silva, p. 1642  Additionally, one  |nuclear_isomer|Nuclear_Isomer|  is known, with mass number 253. The longest-lived lawrencium isotope, 266 Lr, has a half-life of ten hours and is one of the longest lived  |superheavy|Superheavy_Element|  isotopes known to date, suggesting that it is perhaps on the shore of the  |island_of_stability|Island_Of_Stability|  of superheavy nuclei.  However, shorter-lived isotopes are usually used in chemical experiments because 266 Lr currently can only be produced as a final  |decay_product|Decay_Product|  of even heavier and harder-to-synthesize elements: it was discovered in 2014 in the  |decay_chain|Decay_Chain|  of 294  |Ts|Tennessine| . The isotope 256 Lr was used in the first chemical studies on lawrencium: currently, the slightly longer lived isotope 260 Lr is usually used for this purpose. After 266 Lr, the longest-lived lawrencium isotopes are 262 Lr , 261 Lr , 260 Lr , 256 Lr , and 255 Lr .   All other known lawrencium isotopes have half-lives under 20  seconds, and the shortest-lived of them has a half-life of only 390  milliseconds. The undiscovered isotopes with mass numbers 263 to 265 are expected to have longer half-lives . The half-lives of lawrencium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 252 Lr to 266 Lr, with a dip from 257 Lr to 259 Lr.       While the lightest and heaviest lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of  |dubnium|Dubnium|   isotopes, the middle isotopes can all be produced by bombarding actinide  targets with light ions . The two most important isotopes, 256 Lr and 260 Lr, are both in this range. 256 Lr can be produced by bombarding  |californium|Californium| -249 with 70  MeV  |boron|Boron| -11 ions , while 260 Lr can be produced by bombarding  |berkelium|Berkelium| -249 with  |oxygen|Oxygen| -18 . Silva, pp. 1642–3     Both 256 Lr and 260 Lr have half-lives too short to allow a complete chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256 Lr therefore used rapid  |solvent_extraction|Solvent_Extraction| , with the  |chelating_agent|Chelating_Agent| |thenoyltrifluoroacetone|Thenoyltrifluoroacetone|  dissolved in  |methyl_isobutyl_ketone|Methyl_Isobutyl_Ketone|  as the  |organic_phase|Organic_Phase| , and with the  |aqueous_phase|Aqueous_Phase|  being buffered  |acetate|Acetate|  solutions. Ions of different charge will then extract into the organic phase under different  |pH|Ph|  ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256 Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24  MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB to take place in enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260 Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05  M   |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid|.
