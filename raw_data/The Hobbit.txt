                    The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a  |childrens_fantasy_novel|Juvenile_Fantasy|  by English author  |J._R._R._Tolkien|J._R._R._Tolkien| . It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the  |Carnegie_Medal|Carnegie_Medal|  and awarded a prize from the  New York Herald Tribune  for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in childrens literature.     The Hobbit is set within Tolkiens  |fictional_universe|Fictional_Universe|  and follows the quest of home-loving  |Bilbo_Baggins|Bilbo_Baggins| , the titular  |hobbit|Hobbit| , to win a share of the treasure guarded by  |Smaug|Smaug|  the  |dragon|Dragon| . Bilbos journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.     The story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkiens geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the  |Battle_of_Five_Armies|Battle_Of_Five_Armies| , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.     Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view  |Tolkiens_own_experiences_during_World_War_I|J._R._R._Tolkienfirst_World_War|  as instrumental in shaping the story. The authors scholarly knowledge of  |Germanic_philology|Germanic_Philology|  and interest in mythology and  |fairy_tales|Fairy_Tales|  are often noted as influences.     The publisher was encouraged by the books critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkiens work progressed on the successor  The Lord of the Rings , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkiens changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.     The work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.        |Bilbo_Baggins|Bilbo_Baggins| , the titular protagonist, is a respectable, reserved  |hobbit|Hobbit| .   During his adventure, Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at  |home|Bag_End|  and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a  |magic_ring|One_Ring| , he is more baggage than help.  |Gandalf|Gandalf| , an itinerant  |wizard|Wizard| ,  introduces Bilbo to a company of  |thirteen_dwarves|List_Of_The_Hobbit_Charactersthorins_Company| . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story.  |Thorin_Oakenshield|Thorin_Oakenshield| , the proud, pompous   head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the  |Lonely_Mountain|Lonely_Mountain| , makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble, but proves himself a mighty warrior.  |Smaug|Smaug|  is a  |dragon|Dragon|  who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorins grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.     The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as the  |twelve_other_dwarves_of_the_company|Characters_In_The_Hobbitthorins_Company| ; two types of  |elves|Elf| |puckish|Puck|  and more serious  |warrior_types|Aos_Sí| ;   |Men|Man| ; man-eating  |trolls|Troll| ; boulder-throwing giants; evil cave-dwelling  |goblins|Orc| ; forest-dwelling  |giant_spiders|Giant_Spider|  who can speak; immense and heroic  |eagles|Eagle|  who also speak; evil wolves, or  |Wargs|Warg| , who are allied with the goblins;  |Elrond|Elrond|  the sage;  |Gollum|Gollum| , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake;  |Beorn|Beorn| , a man who can assume bear form; and  |Bard_the_Bowman|Bard_The_Bowman| , a grim but honourable archer of  |Lake-town|Esgaroth| .         |Gandalf|Gandalf|  tricks  |Bilbo_Baggins|Bilbo_Baggins|  into hosting a party for  |Thorin_Oakenshield|Thorin_Oakenshield|  and his band of  |dwarves|Dwarf| , who sing of reclaiming the  |Lonely_Mountain|Lonely_Mountain|  and its vast treasure from the dragon  |Smaug|Smaug| . When the music ends, Gandalf unveils  |Thrórs_map|Thrors_Map|  showing a  |secret_door|Secret_Door|  into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expeditions burglar . The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.     The group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from  |trolls|Troll|  and leads them to  |Rivendell|Rivendell| , where  |Elrond|Elrond|  reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross the  |Misty_Mountains|Misty_Mountains|  they are caught by  |goblins|Orc|  and driven  |deep_underground|Goblin_Town| . Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across  |a_mysterious_ring|One_Ring|  and then encounters  |Gollum|Gollum| , who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of  |the_ring|One_Ring| , which confers  |invisibility|Invisibility| , Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and  |Wargs|Warg|  give chase, but the company are saved by  |eagles|Eagles|  before resting in the house of  |Beorn|Beorn| .     The company enters the black forest of  |Mirkwood|Mirkwood|  without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from  |giant_spiders|Giant_Spider|  and then from the dungeons of the  |Wood-elves|Silvan_Elves| . Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of  |Lake-town|Esgaroth| , who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaugs demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragons lair, stealing a great cup and espying a gap in Smaugs armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A  |thrush|Thrush|  had overheard Bilbos report of Smaugs vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender  |Bard|Bard_The_Bowman| . Bards arrow finds the hollow spot and slays the dragon.     When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the  |Arkenstone|Arkenstone| , an heirloom of Thorins dynasty, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-towns destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the  |Iron_Hills|Iron_Hills| , reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.     Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic  |Battle_of_Five_Armies|Battle_Of_Five_Armies| . Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.     Bilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns  |home|Bag_End|  a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he left.              In the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as  |Rawlinson_and_Bosworth_Professor_of_Anglo-Saxon|Rawlinson_And_Bosworth_Professor_Of_Anglo-Saxon| , with a fellowship at  |Pembroke_College|Pembroke_College,_Oxford| . Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet Oxford Poetry Blackwells and  The Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked , Yorkshire Poetry, Leeds, vol. 2, no. 19, October–November 1923 a reworking of the  |nursery_rhyme|Nursery_Rhyme|   Hey Diddle Diddle . His creative endeavours at this time also included  |letters_from_Father_Christmas|The_Father_Christmas_Letters|  to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring  |gnomes|Gnome|  and  |goblins|Goblin| , and a helpful  |polar_bear|Polar_Bear| —alongside the creation of  |elven_languages|Elvish_Languages|  and an attendant mythology, including the  |Book_of_Lost_Tales|Book_Of_Lost_Tales| , which he had been creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.      In a 1955 letter to  |W._H._Auden|W._H._Auden| , Tolkien recollects that he began work on The Hobbit one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking  |School_Certificate|School_Certificate|  papers. He found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including  |C._S._Lewis|C._S._Lewis|   and a student of Tolkiens named Elaine Griffiths.  In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher  |George_Allen_&_Unwin|Allen_&_Unwin| , she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien.  In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to  |Stanley_Unwin|Stanley_Unwin| , who then asked his 10-year-old son  |Rayner|Rayner_Unwin|  to review it. Rayners favourable comments settled Allen & Unwins decision to publish Tolkiens book.        The setting of The Hobbit, as described on its original dust jacket, is  ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men  in an unnamed  |fantasy_world|Fantasy_World| . The world is shown on the endpaper map as Western Lands westward and  |Wilderland|Wilderland|  as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work on  The Lord of the Rings , he decided these stories could fit into the  |legendarium|Tolkiens_Legendarium|  he had been working on privately for decades. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings became the end of the  |Third_Age|Third_Age|  of  |Middle_Earth|Middle_Earth|  within  |Arda|Arda| . Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published as  The Silmarillion  and other posthumous works.       One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century  |Arts_and_Crafts|Arts_And_Crafts_Movement|  polymath  |William_Morris|William_Morris| . Tolkien wished to imitate Morriss prose and poetry romances,  following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris.  Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by  |Samuel_Rutherford_Crocketts|Samuel_Rutherford_Crockett|  historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer— |Sauron|Sauron| —on its villain,  |Gilles_de_Retz|Gilles_De_Retz| .  Incidents in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar in narrative and style to the novel,  and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.      Tolkiens portrayal of goblins in The Hobbit was particularly influenced by  |George_MacDonalds|George_Macdonald|   The Princess and the Goblin .  However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith.           Tolkien scholar Mark T. Hooker has catalogued a lengthy series of parallels between The Hobbit and  |Jules_Vernes|Jules_Verne|   Journey to the Center of the Earth . These include, among other things, a hidden runic message and a celestial alignment that direct the adventurers to the goals of their quests.      Tolkiens works show much influence from  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| , reflecting his lifelong passion for those stories and his academic interest in  |Germanic_philology|Germanic_Philology| .  The Hobbit is no exception to this; the work shows influences from northern European literature, myths and languages, especially from the  Poetic Edda  and the  Prose Edda . Examples include the names of characters,  such as Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur,  |Bombur|List_Of_Middle-Earth_Dwarvesbombur| , Dori, Nori, Dwalin,  |Balin|Balin| , Dain, Nain, Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf .  But while their names are from Old Norse, the characters of the dwarves are more directly taken from fairy tales such as  Snow White  and  Snow-White and Rose-Red  as collected by the  |Brothers_Grimm|Brothers_Grimm| . The latter tale may also have influenced the character of Beorn.      Tolkiens use of descriptive names such as  Misty Mountains  and  Bag End  echoes the names used in Old Norse  |sagas|Saga| .  The names of the dwarf-friendly ravens, such as Roäc, are derived from Old Norse words for raven and rook ,  but their peaceful characters are unlike the typical carrion birds from Old Norse and Old English literature.  Tolkien is not simply skimming historical sources for effect: the juxtaposition of old and new styles of expression is seen by Shippey as one of the major themes explored in The Hobbit. Maps figure in both saga literature and The Hobbit. Several of the authors illustrations incorporate  |Anglo-Saxon_runes|Anglo-Saxon_Runes| , an English adaptation of the Germanic  |runic_alphabets|Runic_Alphabets| .     Themes from  |Old_English_literature|Old_English_Literature| , and specifically from  Beowulf , shape the ancient world Bilbo stepped into. Tolkien, a scholar of Beowulf, counted the epic among his most valued sources for The Hobbit.  Tolkien was one of the first critics to treat Beowulf as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, and his 1936 lecture  Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics  is still required in some Old English courses. Tolkien borrowed several elements from Beowulf, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon.  Certain descriptions in The Hobbit seem to have been lifted straight out of Beowulf with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders.  Likewise, Tolkiens descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in Beowulf. Other specific plot elements and features in The Hobbit that show similarities to Beowulf include the title thief, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaugs personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.  Tolkien refines parts of Beowulf plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragons intellect and personality.      Another influence from Old English sources is the appearance of named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade  |Sting|Sting|  we see Bilbos acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.  This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragons hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, The episode of the theft arose naturally from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same.     The name of the wizard  |Radagast|Radagast|  is widely recognized to be taken from the name of the  |Slavic_deity|Slavic_Deity| |Rodegast|Radegast| .      The representation of the dwarves in The Hobbit was influenced by his own selective reading of medieval texts regarding the  |Jewish_people|Jews|  and their history.  The dwarves characteristics of being dispossessed of their ancient homeland at the Lonely Mountain, and living among other groups whilst retaining their own culture are all derived from the medieval image of Jews,  whilst their warlike nature stems from accounts in the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| . The Dwarvish calendar invented for The Hobbit reflects the Jewish calendar in beginning in late autumn. And although Tolkien denied allegory, the dwarves taking Bilbo out of his complacent existence has been seen as an eloquent metaphor for the impoverishment of Western society without Jews.               George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews.  This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed the  |dust_jacket|Dust_Jacket|  as well.  |Houghton_Mifflin|Houghton_Mifflin|  of Boston and New York reset type for an American edition, to be released early in 1938, in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.  Despite the books popularity, paper  |rationing_due_to_World_War_II|Rationing_In_The_United_Kingdom_During_And_After_World_War_Ii|  and not ending until 1949 meant that the Allen & Unwin edition of the book was often unavailable during this period.      Subsequent  |editions|Edition|  in English were published in 1951, 1966, 1978 and 1995. Numerous  |English-language_editions_of_The_Hobbit|English-Language_Editions_Of_The_Hobbit|  have been produced by several publishers. In addition, The Hobbit has been  |translated_into_over_forty_languages|Translations_Of_The_Hobbit| , with more than one published version for some languages.        In December 1937 The Hobbit publisher, Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel. In response Tolkien provided drafts for The Silmarillion, but the editors rejected them, believing that the public wanted more about hobbits .  Tolkien subsequently began work on The New Hobbit, which would eventually become  The Lord of the Rings , a course that would not only change the context of the original story, but lead to substantial changes to the character of  |Gollum|Gollum| .     In the first edition of The Hobbit, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably. In the second edition edits, to reflect the new concept of the  |One_Ring|One_Ring|  and its corrupting abilities, Tolkien made Gollum more aggressive towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring. The encounter ends with Gollums curse, Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever! This presages Gollums portrayal in The Lord of the Rings.     Tolkien sent this revised version of the chapter Riddles in the Dark to Unwin as an example of the kinds of changes needed to bring the book into conformity with The Lord of the Rings, but he heard nothing back for years. When he was sent  |galley_proofs|Galley_Proof|  of a new edition, Tolkien was surprised to find the sample text had been incorporated.  In The Lord of the Rings, the original version of the riddle game is explained as a lie made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring, whereas the revised version contains the true account.  The revised text became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and the US.      Tolkien began a new version in 1960, attempting to adjust the tone of The Hobbit to its sequel. He abandoned the new revision at chapter three after he received criticism that it just wasnt The Hobbit, implying it had lost much of its light-hearted tone and quick pace.      After an unauthorized paperback edition of The Lord of the Rings appeared from  |Ace_Books|Ace_Books|  in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and  |Ballantine|Ballantine_Books|  asked Tolkien to refresh the text of The Hobbit to renew the US copyright.  This text became the 1966 third edition. Tolkien took the opportunity to align the narrative even more closely to The Lord of the Rings and to cosmological developments from his still unpublished  Quenta Silmarillion  as it stood at that time.  These small edits included, for example, changing the phrase elves that are now called Gnomes from the first, and second editions, on page 63, to High Elves of the West, my kin in the third edition. Tolkien had used  |gnome|Gnome|  in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the  |High_Elves|Calaquendi| —the  |Noldor|Noldor|  —thinking gnome , derived from the Greek gnosis , was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of its common denotation of a  |garden_gnome|Garden_Gnome| , derived from the 16th-century  |Paracelsus|Paracelsus| , Tolkien abandoned the term.  He also changed tomatoes to pickles but retained other anachronisms, such as clocks and tobacco. In The Lord of the Rings, he has  |Merry|Meriadoc_Brandybuck|  explain that tobacco had been brought from the West by the  |Númenóreans|Numenoreans| .       Since the authors death, two editions of The Hobbit have been published with commentary on the creation, emendation and development of the text. In The Annotated Hobbit, Douglas Anderson provides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of  |The_Quest_of_Erebor|The_Quest_Of_Erebor|  . Andersons commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is also accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them work by  |Tove_Jansson|Tove_Jansson| . An example, alongside other illustrations can be seen at:  The edition also presents a number of little-known texts such as the 1923 version of Tolkiens poem Iumonna Gold Galdre Bewunden .     With  The History of The Hobbit , published in two parts in 2007,  |John_D._Rateliff|John_D._Rateliff|  provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkiens scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkiens text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.       Tolkiens correspondence and publishers records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.           Even the maps, of which Tolkien originally proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished  Thrors Map  to be tipped in at first mention in the text, and with the moon letter  |Cirth|Cirth|  on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thrors map, and the Map of Wilderland , both printed in black and red on the papers cream background.      Originally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkiens first tendered sketches so charmed the publishers staff that they opted to include them without raising the books price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: The Hill: Hobbiton -across-the-Water, The Trolls , The Mountain Path, The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate ,  Beorn s Hall,  Mirkwood ,  The Elvenking s Gate,  Lake Town , The Front Gate , and The Hall at Bag-End . All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.      Satisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic  |transliteration|Transliteration|  of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher.  The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.      The publishers production staff designed a binding, but Tolkien objected to several elements. Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the authors. The spine shows runes: two  |þ|Thurisaz|   runes and one  |d|Dagaz|  . The front and back covers were mirror images of each other, with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkiens style stamped along the lower edge, and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge.      Once illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece  in colour and the addition of new colour plates: Rivendell, Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes, Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves and Conversation with Smaug , which features a  |dwarvish|Dwarf|  curse written in Tolkiens invented script  |Tengwar|Tengwar| , and signed with two þ runes.  The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes.      Different editions have been illustrated in diverse ways. Many follow the original scheme at least loosely, but many others are illustrated by other artists, especially the many translated editions. Some cheaper editions, particularly paperback, are not illustrated except with the maps. The Childrens Book Club edition of 1942 includes the black-and-white pictures but no maps, an anomaly.      Tolkiens use of runes, both as decorative devices and as magical signs within the story, has been cited as a major cause for the popularization of runes within  |New_Age|New_Age|  and  |esoteric|Esotericism|  literature,  stemming from Tolkiens popularity with the elements of  |counter-culture|Counterculture_Of_The_1960S|  in the 1970s.        The Hobbit takes cues from narrative models of  |childrens_literature|Childrens_Literature| , as shown by its  |omniscient_narrator|Third-Person_Omniscient_Narrative|  and characters that young children can relate to, such as the small, food-obsessed, and morally ambiguous Bilbo. The text emphasizes the relationship between time and narrative progress and it openly distinguishes safe from dangerous in its geography. Both are key elements of works intended for children,    as is the home-away-home  plot structure typical of the  |Bildungsroman|Bildungsroman| .  While Tolkien later claimed to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly,  the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel.  Emer OSullivan, in her Comparative Childrens Literature, notes The Hobbit as one of a handful of childrens books that have been accepted into mainstream literature, alongside  |Jostein_Gaarders|Jostein_Gaarder|   Sophies World  and  |J._K._Rowlings|J._K._Rowling|   Harry Potter  series .      Tolkien intended The Hobbit as a fairy-story and wrote it in a tone suited to addressing children  although he said later that the book was not specifically written for children but had rather been created out of his interest in mythology and legend.  Many of the initial reviews refer to the work as a fairy story. However, according to  |Jack_Zipes|Jack_Zipes|  writing in The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales, Bilbo is an atypical character for a fairy tale.  The work is much longer than Tolkiens ideal proposed in his essay On Fairy-Stories. Many fairy tale motifs, such as the repetition of similar events seen in the dwarves arrival at Bilbos and Beorns homes, and folklore themes, such as  |trolls|Troll|  turning to stone, are to be found in the story.      The book is popularly called a  |fantasy_novel|Fantasy_Novel| , but like  Peter Pan and Wendy  by  |J._M._Barrie|J._M._Barrie|  and  The Princess and the Goblin  by  |George_MacDonald|George_Macdonald| , both of which influenced Tolkien and contain fantasy elements, it is primarily identified as being childrens literature.   The two genres are not mutually exclusive, so some definitions of  |high_fantasy|High_Fantasy|  include works for children by authors such as  |L._Frank_Baum|L._Frank_Baum|  and  |Lloyd_Alexander|Lloyd_Alexander|  alongside the works of  |Gene_Wolfe|Gene_Wolfe|  and  |Jonathan_Swift|Jonathan_Swift| , which are more often considered adult literature. The Hobbit has been called the most popular of all twentieth-century fantasies written for children .   |Jane_Chance|Jane_Chance| , however, considers the book to be a childrens novel only in the sense that it appeals to the child in an adult reader.  Sullivan credits the first publication of The Hobbit as an important step in the development of high fantasy, and further credits the 1960s paperback debuts of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as essential to the creation of a mass market for fiction of this kind as well as the fantasy genres current status.       Tolkiens prose is unpretentious and straightforward, taking as given the existence of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such as  |Richard_Adams|Richard_Adams|   Watership Down  and  |Peter_Beagles|Peter_Beagle|   The Last Unicorn , accepts readers into the  |fictional_world|Fictional_Universe| , rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality.  While The Hobbit is written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides , has his own linguistic style separate from those of the main characters.      The basic form of the story is that of a  |quest|Quest| ,  told in episodes. For the most part of the book, each chapter introduces a different denizen of the Wilderland, some helpful and friendly towards the protagonists, and others threatening or dangerous. However the general tone is kept light-hearted, being interspersed with songs and humour. One example of the use of song to maintain tone is when Thorin and Company are kidnapped by goblins, who, when marching them into the underworld, sing:        This  |onomatopoeic|Onomatopoeia|  singing undercuts the dangerous scene with a sense of humour. Tolkien achieves balance of humour and danger through other means as well, as seen in the foolishness and  |Cockney_dialect|Cockney_Speech|  of the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors. The general form—that of a journey into strange lands, told in a light-hearted mood and interspersed with songs—may be following the model of The Icelandic Journals by  |William_Morris|William_Morris| , an important literary influence on Tolkien.            The evolution and maturation of the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is central to the story. This journey of maturation, where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world, may be seen as a  |Bildungsroman|Bildungsroman|  rather than a traditional quest.  The  |Jungian|Carl_Jung|  concept of  |individuation|Individuation|  is also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author contrasting Bilbos personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves.  Thus, while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on, it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party, a fact the dwarves could not bear to acknowledge.  The analogue of the  |underworld|Underworld|  and the hero returning from it with a boon that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic  |archetypes|Archetype|  regarding initiation and male  |coming-of-age|Coming_Of_Age|  as described by  |Joseph_Campbell|Joseph_Campbell| .  Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from the  Ancrene Wisse  and a Christian understanding of  Beowulf .      The overcoming of greed and selfishness has been seen as the central moral of the story.  Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters simple desire for food or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels,  it is only by the Arkenstones influence upon Thorin that greed, and its attendant vices coveting and malignancy , come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and at your services he had previously bestowed.  In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the Silmarillion, and there are connections between the words Arkenstone and  |Silmaril|Silmaril|  in Tolkiens invented etymologies.      The Hobbit employs themes of  |animism|Animism| . An important concept in  |anthropology|Anthropology|  and  |child_development|Child_Development| , animism is the idea that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants—possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the  |Doctor_Dolittle|Doctor_Dolittle|  Theme in The History of the Hobbit, and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkiens other works, and mentions the roots of mountains and feet of trees in The Hobbit as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate.  Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: ...The first men to talk of trees and stars saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was myth-woven and elf-patterned.        As in plot and setting, Tolkien brings his literary theories to bear in forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern  |anachronism|Anachronism|  exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example,  |Gollums|Gollum|  riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.       |Smaug|Smaug|  is the main antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of  Beowulf , and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence. Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend of  |St._George|Saint_George_And_The_Dragon| .  Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of  |Pandæmonium|Pandæmonium|  with its Belched fire and rolling smoke in  |Miltons|John_Milton|   Paradise Lost .  Of all the characters, Smaugs speech is the most modern, using  |idioms|Idiom|  such as Dont let your imagination run away with you!     Just as Tolkiens literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkiens experiences. The Hobbit may be read as Tolkiens parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far-off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile.  The tale as such explores the theme of heroism. As Janet Croft notes, Tolkiens literary reaction to war at this time differed from most post-war writers by eschewing irony as a method for distancing events and instead using mythology to mediate his experiences.  Similarities to the works of other writers who faced  |the_Great_War|World_War_I|  are seen in The Hobbit, including portraying warfare as anti- |pastoral|Pastoral| |Battle_of_Five_Armies|Battle_Of_Five_Armies|  later are described as barren, damaged landscapes.  The Hobbit makes a warning against repeating the tragedies of World War I,  and Tolkiens attitude as a veteran may well be summed up by Bilbos comment: Victory after all, I suppose! Well, it seems a very gloomy business.       On first publication in October 1937, The Hobbit was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in the UK and the US, including  The Times ,  Catholic World  and  New York Post .  |C._S._Lewis|C._S._Lewis| , friend of Tolkien , writing in The Times reports:     The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholars with the poets grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib originality.     Lewis compares the book to  Alice in Wonderland  in that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongside  Flatland ,  Phantastes , and  The Wind in the Willows .   |W._H._Auden|W._H._Auden| , in his review of the sequel  The Fellowship of the Ring  calls The Hobbit one of the best childrens stories of this century .  Auden was later to correspond with Tolkien, and they became friends. The Hobbit was nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the  New York Herald Tribune  for best juvenile fiction of the year .  More recently, the book has been recognized as Most Important 20th-Century Novel in the Childrens Books of the Century poll in Books for Keeps.      Publication of the sequel The Lord of the Rings altered many critics reception of the work. Instead of approaching The Hobbit as a childrens book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of The Hobbit as being a prelude , relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a  |presentist|Presentism|  interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the originals value as a childrens book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the books influence on these genres.  Commentators such as Paul Kocher,  John D. Rateliff  and C. W. Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately, both because The Hobbit was conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers expectations of tone and style.         The Lord of the RingsThe Hobbit has been adapted and elaborated upon in many ways, its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often claimed to be its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novels main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground ; they engage another group of elves ; they traverse a desolate region ; they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men ; they fight in a massive battle ; their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak ; a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne ; and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition .        The Lord of the Rings contains several more supporting scenes, and has a more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not. Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children, and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkiens concept of  |Middle-earth|Middle-Earth|  was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.        The style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works of  |Dickens|Charles_Dickens|  and  |Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare| . By contrast, offering advanced younger readers modern teenage-oriented fiction may not exercise their reading skills, while the material may contain themes more suited to adolescents.  As one of several books that have been recommended for 11- to 14-year-old boys to encourage literacy in that demographic, The Hobbit is promoted as the original and still the best fantasy ever written.      Several teaching guides and books of study notes have been published to help teachers and students gain the most from the book. The Hobbit introduces literary concepts, notably  |allegory|Allegory| , to young readers, as the work has been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting the life and times of the author. Meanwhile, the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work.  This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of  |New_Criticism|New_Criticism| , and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as  |sublimation|Sublimation| , in approaching literary works.      Another approach to critique taken in the classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist. While Bilbo may be seen as a literary symbol of small folk of any gender,  a gender-conscious approach can help students establish notions of a socially symbolic text where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work.  By this interpretation, it is ironic that the first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls school.             The first authorized adaptation of The Hobbit appeared in March 1953, a stage production by  |St._Margarets_School,_Edinburgh|St._Margarets_School,_Edinburgh| .  The Hobbit has since been adapted for other media many times.     The first motion picture adaptation of The Hobbit, a 12-minute film of cartoon stills, was commissioned from  |Gene_Deitch|Gene_Deitch|  by  |William_L._Snyder|William_L._Snyder|  in 1966, as related by Deitch himself.   This film was publicly screened in New York City.  In 1969 , Tolkien sold the film and merchandising rights to The Hobbit to  |United_Artists|United_Artists|  under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of £10,000   plus a 7.5% royalty after costs, payable to Allen & Unwin and the author.  In 1976 United Artists sold the rights to  |Saul_Zaentz|Saul_Zaentz|  Company, who trade as  |Tolkien_Enterprises|Tolkien_Enterprises| . Since then all authorized adaptations have been signed-off by Tolkien Enterprises. In 1997 Tolkien Enterprises licensed the film rights to Miramax, which assigned them in 1998 to  |New_Line_Cinema|New_Line_Cinema| .    The heirs of Tolkien, including his son  |Christopher_Tolkien|Christopher_Tolkien| , filed suit against  |New_Line_Cinema|New_Line_Cinema|  in February 2008 seeking payment of profits and to be entitled to cancel... all future rights of New Line... to produce, distribute, and/or exploit future films based upon the Trilogy and/or the Films... and/or... films based on The Hobbit.   In September 2009, he and New Line reached an undisclosed settlement, and he has withdrawn his legal objection to  |The_Hobbit_films|The_Hobbit| .      The  |BBC_Radio_4|Bbc_Radio_4|  series  The Hobbit  radio drama was an adaptation by  |Michael_Kilgarriff|Michael_Kilgarriff| , broadcast in eight parts from September to November 1968. It starred  |Anthony_Jackson|Anthony_Jackson|  as narrator,  |Paul_Daneman|Paul_Daneman|  as Bilbo and  |Heron_Carvic|Heron_Carvic|  as Gandalf. The series was released on  |audio_cassette|Compact_Cassette|  in 1988 and on CD in 1997.       The Hobbit , an animated version of the story produced by  |Rankin/Bass|Rankin/Bass| , debuted as a television movie in the United States in 1977. In 1978,  |Romeo_Muller|Romeo_Muller|  won a  |Peabody_Award|Peabody_Award|  for his  |teleplay|Teleplay|  for The Hobbit. The film was also nominated for the  |Hugo_Award_for_Best_Dramatic_Presentation|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Dramatic_Presentation| , but lost to  Star Wars . The adaptation has been called execrable and confusing for those not already familiar with the plot.        A childrens opera was written and premiered in 2004. Composer and librettist  |Dean_Burry|Dean_Burry|  was commissioned by the  |Canadian_Childrens_Opera_Chorus|Canadian_Childrens_Opera_Chorus| , who produced the premiere in Toronto, Ontario, and subsequently toured it to the Maritime provinces the same year.  The opera has since been produced several times in North America including in Tulsa, Sarasota and Toronto.     In Decembers of 2012,  2013,  and 2014,   |Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|  and  |New_Line_Cinema|New_Line_Cinema|  released one part each of a three-part  |live-action_film_version|The_Hobbit|  produced and directed by  |Peter_Jackson|Peter_Jackson| . The titles were  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ,  The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug , and  The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies .     A three-part  |comic_book|Comic_Book|  adaptation with script by  |Chuck_Dixon|Chuck_Dixon|  and Sean Deming and illustrated by  |David_Wenzel|David_Wenzel|  was published by  |Eclipse_Comics|Eclipse_Comics|  in 1989. In 1990 a one-volume edition was released by Unwin Paperbacks. The cover was artwork by the original illustrator David Wenzel. A reprint collected in one volume was released by  |Del_Rey_Books|Del_Rey_Books|  in 2001. Its cover, illustrated by  |Donato_Giancola|Donato_Giancola| , was awarded the Association of Science Fiction Artists Award for Best Cover Illustration in 2002.      In 1999, The Hobbit: A 3-D Pop-Up Adventure was published, with illustrations by John Howe and paper engineering by  |Andrew_Baron|Andrew_Baron| .       |ME_Games_Ltd|Middle-Earth_Play-By-Mail|  , which has won several  |Origins_Awards|Origins_Award| , uses the Battle of Five Armies as an introductory scenario to the full game and includes characters and armies from the book.      Several computer and video games, both licensed and unlicensed, have been based on the story. One of the most successful was  The Hobbit , an award-winning computer game published in 1982 by  |Beam_Software|Beam_Software|  and published by  |Melbourne_House|Melbourne_House|  with compatibility for most computers available at the time. A copy of the novel was included in each game package.  The game does not retell the story, but rather sits alongside it, using the books narrative to both structure and motivate gameplay.  The game won the  |Golden_Joystick|Golden_Joystick|  Award for Strategy Game of the Year in 1983  and was responsible for popularizing the phrase, Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.        While reliable figures are difficult to obtain, estimated global sales of The Hobbit run between 35 and 100  million copies since 1937. In the UK The Hobbit has not retreated from the top 5,000 bestselling books measured by  |Nielsen_BookScan|Nielsen_Bookscan|  since 1998, when the index began,  achieving a three-year sales peak rising from 33,084 to 142,541 , 126,771 and 61,229 , ranking it at the 3rd position in Nielsens Evergreen book list.  The enduring popularity of The Hobbit makes early printings of the book attractive collectors items. The first printing of the first English-language edition can sell for between £6,000 and £20,000 at auction,  .
