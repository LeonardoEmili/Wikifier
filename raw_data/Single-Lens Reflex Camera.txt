     A single-lens reflex camera  is a  |camera|Camera|  that typically uses a mirror and prism system that permits the photographer to view through the lens and see exactly what will be captured. With  |twin_lens_reflex|Twin_Lens_Reflex|  and  |rangefinder_cameras|Rangefinder_Cameras| , the viewed image could be significantly different from the final image. When the shutter button is pressed on most SLRs, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the light receptor and the image to be captured.         |Medium_format|Medium_Format|  SLR by  |Hasselblad|Hasselblad| |Bronica|Bronica|  , Japan. Bronicas later model—the Bronica EC—was the first medium format SLR camera to use an electrically operated  |focal-plane_shutter|Focal-Plane_Shutter| |Asahiflex|Asahiflex| ,  |Japan|Japan| |Contaflex|Contaflex| |Nikon_F|Nikon_F| , 1959, the worlds second single-lens reflex  |system_camera|System_Camera| . The first was  |Kamera-Werkes|Kamera-Werkstätten| |Canon|Canon| |Pellix|Canon_Pellix| |Pentax|Pentax| |Olympus|Olympus_Corporation|  The 35  mm film-based  |Olympus_OM-2|Olympus_Om-2| |Casio|Casio| |Nikon_F5|Nikon_F5| |Digital_SLR|Digital_Photography|  Nikon D200 and a Nikon  |film_scanner|Film_Scanner|     Prior to the development of SLR, all cameras with viewfinders had two optical light paths: one path through the lens to the film, and another path positioned above  or to the side . Because the viewfinder and the film lens cannot share the same optical path, the viewing lens is aimed to intersect with the film lens at a fixed point somewhere in front of the camera. This is not problematic for pictures taken at a middle or longer distance, but  |parallax|Parallax|  causes framing errors in close-up shots. Moreover, focusing the lens of a fast reflex camera when it is opened to wider  |apertures|Aperture|  is not easy.     Most SLR cameras permit upright and laterally correct viewing through use of a  |roof_pentaprism|Pentaprism|  situated in the optical path between the reflex mirror and viewfinder. Light, which comes both horizontally and vertically inverted after passing through the lens, is reflected upwards by the reflex mirror, into the pentaprism where it is reflected several times to correct the inversions caused by the lens, and align the image with the  |viewfinder|Viewfinder| . When the  |shutter|Shutter|  is released, the mirror moves out of the light path, and the light shines directly onto the film . The Canon Pellix, along with several special purpose high speed cameras, were an exception to the moving mirror system, wherein the mirror was a fixed  |beamsplitting|Beam_Splitter| |pellicle|Pellicle_Mirror| .     Focus can be adjusted manually by the photographer or automatically by an  |autofocus|Autofocus|  system. The viewfinder can include a matte  |focusing|Focus|  screen located just above the mirror system to diffuse the light. This permits accurate viewing, composing and focusing, especially useful with interchangeable lenses.     Up until the 1990s, SLR was the most advanced photographic preview system available, but the recent development and refinement of digital imaging technology with an on-camera live LCD preview screen has overshadowed SLRs popularity. Nearly all inexpensive compact digital cameras now include an LCD preview screen allowing the photographer to see what the CCD is capturing. However, SLR is still popular in high-end and professional cameras because they are  |system_cameras|System_Camera|  with interchangeable parts, allowing customization. They also have far less  |shutter_lag|Shutter_Lag| , allowing photographs to be timed more precisely. Also the  |pixel|Pixel|  resolution,  |contrast_ratio|Contrast_Ratio| ,  |refresh_rate|Refresh_Rate| , and color  |gamut|Gamut|  of an LCD preview screen cannot compete with the clarity and shadow detail of a direct-viewed optical SLR viewfinder.      |Large_format|Large_Format|  SLR cameras were probably first marketed with the introduction of C.R. Smiths Monocular Duplex . One was patented in 1861 , but it is not clear if a second example was ever produced; Calvin Rae Smiths design of a Patent Monocular Duplex camera was advertised and sold. Spira, The History of Photography, 119. SLRs for smaller exposure formats were launched in the 1920s by several camera makers. The first  |35mm|35Mm_Format|  SLR available to the mass market, Leicas PLOOT reflex housing along with a 200mm f4.5 lens paired to a  |35mm|35Mm_Format|  rangefinder camera body, debuted in 1935. The  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  Спорт ,  |A._O._Gelgars_Sport|:Ru:Спорт|  also a 24mm by 36mm image size, was prototyped in 1934 and went to market in 1937. K. Nüchterleins  |Kine_Exakta|Kine_Exakta|  was the first integrated  |35mm|35Mm_Format|  SLR to enter the market. Additional  |Exakta|Exakta|  models, all with waist-level finders, were produced up to and during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Another ancestor of the modern SLR camera was the Swiss-made  |Alpa|Alpa| , which was innovative, and influenced the later Japanese cameras. The first eye-level SLR viewfinder was patented in  |Hungary|Hungary|  on August 23, 1943 by Jenő Dulovits, who then designed the first 35  mm camera with one, the  |Duflex|Duflex| , which used a system of mirrors to provide a laterally correct, upright image in the eye-level viewfinder. The Duflex, which went into serial production in 1948, was also the worlds first SLR with an instant-return mirror.     The first commercially produced SLR that employed a roof  |pentaprism|Pentaprism|  was the Italian  |Rectaflex|Rectaflex|  A.1000, shown in full working condition on Milan fair April 1948 and produced from September the same year, thus being on the market one year before the east German  |Zeiss_Ikon_VEB_Contax_S|Contax| , announced on May 20, 1949, produced from September.     The  |Japan|Japan| ese adopted and further developed the SLR. In 1952,  |Asahi|Pentax|  developed the  |Asahiflex|Asahiflex|  and in 1954, the  |Asahiflex_IIB|Asahiflex_Iib| . In 1957, the  |Asahi_Pentax|Asahi_Pentax|  combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb wind lever.  |Nikon|Nikon_Corporation| ,  |Canon|Canon_Inc.|  and  |Yashica|Yashica|  introduced their first SLRs in 1959 .          As a small matter of history, the first 35  mm camera to feature through the lens light metering may have been Nikon, with a prototype rangefinder camera, the SPX. According to the website below, the camera used Nikon S type rangefinder lenses.      Through-the-lens light metering is also known as behind-the-lens metering . In the SLR design scheme, there were various placements made for the metering cells, all of which used CdS  photocells. The cells were either located in the pentaprism housing, where they metered light transmitted through the focusing screen; underneath the reflex mirror glass itself, which was Topcons design; or in front of the shutter mechanism, which was the design used by Canon with their Canon Pellix.     Pentax was the first manufacturer to show an early prototype 35  mm behind-the-lens metering SLR camera, which was named the  Pentax Spotmatic . The camera was shown at the  |1960_photokina|Photokina_1960|  show. However, the first  |Through-the-lens|Through-The-Lens| |light_meter|Light_Meter| ing SLR on the market was the 1963  |Topcon_RE_Super|Topcon_Re_Super| , which had the CdS metering cell placed behind the reflex mirror. The mirror had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell providing  |average_metering|Average_Metering| . Late in the following year, a production model of the Pentax Spotmatic was shown whose CdS light meter cells were on the pentaprism, reading the light off the focusing screen providing average reading, yet keeping the Spotmatic name, but now written in one word. Another clever design appeared in 1965, the Canon Pellix employing a  |pellicle_mirror|Pellicle_Mirror|  that is semi-transparent, placing the meter cell on an arm swinging into the lightpass behind the mirror for meter reading.     Mamiya Sekor came out with cameras such as the Mamiya Sekor TL and various other versions. Yashica introduced the TL Super. Both of these cameras used M42 screw thread lenses as did the Pentax Spotmatic. Later on Fujica introduced their ST-701, then ST-801 and ST-901 cameras. The ST-701 was the first SLR to use a silicon cell photodiode, which was more sensitive than CdS and was immune to the memory effect that the CdS cell suffered from in bright sunlight. Gradually, other 35  mm SLR camera manufacturers changed their behind-the-lens meters from CdS cells to Silicon Diode photocells.     Other manufacturers responded and introduced their own behind-the-lens metering cameras. Nikon and Miranda, at first, simply upgraded their interchangeable pentaprisms to include behind-the-lens metering and these manufacturers also bought out other camera models with built-in behind-the-lens metering capability, such as the Nikkormat FT and the Miranda Sensorex . Minolta introduced the SRT-101, which used Minoltas proprietary system they referred to as CLC , which was an acronym for contrast light compensation , which metered differently from an average metering behind-the-lens camera.     Some German manufacturers also introduced cameras such as the  |Zeiss_Ikon_Contarex|Contarex|  family, which was one of very few 35  mm SLR to use interchangeable film backs.     Inexpensive leaf-shutter cameras also benefited from behind-the-lens metering as, Topcon introduced the Auto 100 with front-mount interchangeable lenses designed only for that camera, and one of the Zeiss Ikon Contaflex leaf shutter cameras. Kowa manufactured their SET-R, which had similar specifications.     Within months, manufacturers decided to bring out models that provided limited area metering, such as Nikons Photomic Tn finder, which concentrated 60% of the CdS cells sensitivity on the inner circle of the focusing screen and 30% on the surrounding area. Canon used spot metering in the unusual Canon Pellix camera, which also had a stationary mirror system that allowed approximately 70% of the light to travel to the film plane and 30% to the photographers eye. This system, unfortunately, degraded the native resolution of the attached lens and provided less illumination to the eyepiece. It did have the advantage of having less vibration than other SLR cameras but this was not sufficient to attract professionals to the camera in numbers.       While auto-exposure was commonly used in the early 1960s with various 35  mm fixed lens rangefinder cameras such as the Konica Auto S, and other cameras such as the Polaroid Land cameras whose early models used selenium cell meters, auto-exposure for interchangeable lens SLRs was a feature that was largely absent, except for a few early leaf-shutter SLRs such as the Kowa SE-R and Topcon Auto 100.     The types of automation found in some of these cameras consisted of the simple programmed shutter, whereby the cameras metering system would select a mechanically set series of apertures with shutter speeds, one setting of which would be sufficient for the correct exposure. In the case of the above-mentioned Kowa and Topcon, automation was semi-automatic, where the cameras CDs meter would select the correct aperture only.     Autoexposure, technically known as semi-automatic exposure, where the cameras metering system chooses either the shutter speed or the aperture, was finally introduced by the Savoyflex and popularized by  |Konishiroku|Konica|  in the 1965  |Konica|Konica|  Auto-Reflex. This camera was of the shutter-priority type automation, which meant that the camera selected the correct aperture automatically. This model also had the interesting ability to photograph in 35  mm full-frames or half-frames, all selected by a lever.     Other SLRs soon followed, but because of limitations with their lens mounts, the manufacturers of these cameras had to choose aperture-priority automation, where the cameras metering system selects the correct shutter speed. As one example, Pentax introduced the Electro Spotmatic, which was able to use the then considerable bulk of 42  mm screw-mount lenses produced by various manufacturers. Yashica, another screw-mount camera manufacturer, soon followed.     Canon, which produced the  |FD_lens_mount|Fd_Mount|  introduced their shutter priority 35  mm SLR, the Canon EF in 1976 or so. This cameras build quality was almost the equal of their flagship camera, the Canon F1, and featured a copal-square vertically travelling focal plane shutter that could synchronize electronic flash at shutter speeds up to and including 1/125 of a second, thus making this a good second-body camera for the professional photographer.     Nikon at first produced an aperture-priority camera, but later made subtle changes on the inside of their bayonet mount, which allowed for shutter-priority automation without obsoleting the photographers lenses.            Full-program auto-exposure soon followed with the advent of the Canon A-1 in 1978. This SLR had a P mode on the shutter speed dial, and a lock on the aperture ring to allow the lens to be put on Auto mode. Other manufacturers soon followed with Nikon introducing the FA, Minolta introducing the X-700 in 1981,  and Pentax introducing the Super Program. Olympus, however, continued with aperture-priority automation in their OM system line.     The 1970s and 1980s saw steadily increasing use of electronics, automation, and miniaturization, including integrated  |motor_drive|Motor_Drive| n film advance with the  |Konica_FS-1|Konica_Fs-1|  in 1979,  and motor rewind functions.          The first  |autofocus|Autofocus|  35  mm SLR was the  |Pentax_ME-F|Pentax_Me_F|  released in 1981.      The  |Minolta_Maxxum_7000|Minolta_Maxxum_7000| , released in 1985, was the first 35  mm SLR with integrated autofocus and motorized film-advance winder, which became the standard configuration for SLR cameras from then on. This development had significant impact on the photographic industry.     Some manufacturers discarded their existing lens systems to compete with other manufacturers autofocus capability in their new cameras. This was the case for Canon, with its new EOS lens line. Other manufacturers chose to adapt their existing lens systems for autofocus capability, as was the case with Nikon and Pentax. This allowed photographers to continue using their existing lenses, which greatly reduced the cost of upgrading. For example, almost all Nikon lenses from the 1960s and later still function on the current Nikon bodies, only lacking autofocus. Still some manufacturers, notably Leica with its  |R-system|Leica_R|  lenses, and Contax with its Zeiss lenses, decided to keep their lens mounts non-autofocus.        From the late 1980s competition and technical innovations made 35  mm camera systems more versatile and sophisticated by adding more advanced light metering capabilities such as spot-metering; limited area metering such as used by Canon with the F1 series; matrix metering as used by Nikon, exposure communication with dedicated electronic flash units. The user interface also changed on many cameras, replacing meter needle displays that were galvanometer-based and thereby fragile, with  |light-emitting_diodes|Light-Emitting_Diodes|  and then with more comprehensive  |liquid_crystal_displays|Liquid_Crystal_Display|  both in the SLR viewfinder and externally on the cameras top plate using an LCD screen. Wheels and buttons replaced the shutter dial on the camera and the aperture ring on the lens on many models, although some photographers still prefer shutter dials and aperture rings. Some manufacturers introduced  |image_stabilization|Image_Stabilization|  on certain lenses to combat camera shake and to allow longer hand-held exposures without using a tripod. This feature is especially useful with long telephoto lenses.          Canon, Nikon and  |Pentax|Pentax|  have all developed digital SLR cameras using the same lens mounts as on their respective film SLR cameras.   Konica Minolta did the same, and after having bought Konica Minoltas camera division in 2006 Sony continue using the Minolta AF lens mount in their DSLRs, including cameras built around  |a_semi-transparent_fixed_mirror|Sony_Slt_Camera| . Samsung builds DSLRs based on the  |Pentax|Pentax|  lens mount.  |Olympus|Olympus| , on the other hand, chose to create a new digital-only  |Four_Thirds_System|Four_Thirds_System|  SLR standard, adopted later by Panasonic and Leica.     Contax came out with a DSLR model, the  |Contax_N-Digital|Contax_N_Digital| . This model was too late and too expensive to be competitive with other camera manufacturers. The Contax N-digital was the last Contax to use that makers lens system, and the camera, while having impressive features such as a full-frame sensor, was expensive and lacked sufficient write-speed to the memory card for it to be seriously considered by some professional photographers.     The digital single-lens reflex camera have largely replaced film SLRs design in convenience, sales and popularity at the start of 21st century.               A cross-section  of the optical components of a typical SLR camera shows how the light passes through the lens assembly , is reflected by the mirror  placed at a 45-degree angle, and is projected on the matte  |focusing_screen|Focusing_Screen|  . Via a condensing lens  and internal reflections in the roof pentaprism  the image appears in the eyepiece . When an image is taken, the mirror moves upwards from its resting position in the direction of the arrow, the focal plane shutter  opens, and the image is projected onto the  |film|Photographic_Film|  or  |sensor|Charge-Coupled_Device|   in exactly the same manner as on the focusing screen.     This feature distinguishes SLRs from other cameras as the photographer sees the image composed exactly as it will be captured on the film or  |sensor|Charge-Coupled_Device|  .          Most 35  mm SLRs use a roof  |pentaprism|Pentaprism|  or penta-mirror to direct the light to the eyepiece, first used on the 1948  |Duflex|Duflex|   constructed by  |Jenő_Dulovits|Jenő_Dulovits|  and patented August 1943 . With this camera also appeared the first  |Instant-return_mirror|Instant-Return_Mirror| .   The first Japanese pentaprism SLR was the 1955  |Miranda_T|Miranda_T| , followed by the Asahi Pentax, Minolta SR-2, Zunow, Nikon F and the  |Yashica|Yashica|  Pentamatic. Some SLRs offered removable pentaprisms with optional viewfinder capabilities, such as the  |waist-level_finder|Waist-Level_Finder| , the interchangeable sports finders used on the Canon F1 and F1n; the  |Nikon|Nikon|  F, F2, F3, F4 and F5; and the Pentax LX.     Another prism design was the  |porro_prism|Porro_Prism|  system used in the  |Olympus_Pen_F|Olympus_Pen_F| , the Pen FT, the Pen FV half-frame 35  mm SLR cameras. This was later used on the  |Olympus_EVOLT_E-3x0|Olympus_E-300|  series, the  |Leica|Leica_Camera|  Digilux 3 and the  |Panasonic_DMC-L1|Panasonic_Lumix_Dmc-L1| .     A right-angle finder is available that slips onto the eyepiece of most SLRs and D-SLRs and allows viewing through a waist-level viewfinder. There is also a finder that provides EVF remote capability.                 Almost all contemporary SLRs use a  |focal-plane_shutter|Focal-Plane_Shutter|  located in front of the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the shutter is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane shutters. Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening shutter curtain followed by a closing shutter curtain. During fast shutter speeds, the focal-plane shutter would form a slit whereby the second shutter curtain was closely following the first opening shutter curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material , but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon Kōgaku , for example, used  |titanium|Titanium|  foil shutters for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the  |Nikon_F|Nikon_F| ,  |F2|Nikon_F2| , and  |F3|Nikon_F3| .     Other focal-plane shutter designs, such as the  |Copal|Nidec_Copal_Corporation|  Square, travelled vertically  — the shorter travelling distance of 24 millimetres meant that minimum exposure and flash synchronisation times could be reduced. These shutters are usually manufactured from metal, and use the same moving-slit principle as horizontally travelling shutters. They differ, though, in usually being formed of several slats or blades, rather than single curtains as with horizontal designs, as there is rarely enough room above and below the frame for a one-piece shutter. Vertical shutters became very common in the 1980s  .
