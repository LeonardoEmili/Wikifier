                   A monarchy is a  |form_of_government|Form_Of_Government|  in which a  |natural_person|Natural_Person| , the  |monarch|Monarch| , is  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  until death or  |abdication|Abdication| . The governing power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic , to restricted , to fully  |autocratic|Autocracy|  , combining  |executive|Executive| ,  |legislative|Legislature|  and  |judicial|Judiciary|  power.     In most cases, the  |succession|Order_Of_Succession|  of monarchies is  |hereditary|Hereditary_Monarchy| , but there are also  |elective|Elective_Monarchy|  Stuart Berg Flexure and Lenore Carry Hack, editors, Random House Unabridged Dictionary, 2nd Ed., Random House, New York and  |self-proclaimed|Self-Proclaimed_Monarchy|  monarchies, often forming  |dynastic_periods|Dynasty|  and  |association|Dynastic_Union| , which is sometimes  |challenged|War_Of_Succession|  by diverging  |lineage|Lineage|  and  |legitimism|Legitimists| .  |Aristocrats|Aristocracy| , though not inherent to monarchies, often serve as the pool of persons to draw the monarch from and fill the constituting institutions , giving many monarchies  |oligarchic|Oligarchy|  elements.     A monarchy can be a  |polity|Polity|  through  |unity|Unitary_State| ,  |personal_union|Personal_Union| ,  |vassalage|Vassal_State|  or  |federation|Federal_Monarchy| . Its authorities are  |proclaimed|Proclamation|  and recognized through the different seats,  |insignia|Insignia|  and  |titles|Title|  that a monarch can occupy and be  |invested|Investiture|  with. For example, monarchs can carry titles such as  |king|King| ,  |queen|Queen_Regnant| ,  |emperor|Emperor| ,  |khan|Khan| ,  |caliph|Caliph| ,  |tsar|Tsar| , or  |sultan|Sultan| , and can be bound to  |territories|Territory|   or  |peoples|Popular_Monarchy|  .     The  |republican|Republic|  form of government  |has_been_established|Monarchyhistory|  as the opposing and main alternative to monarchy.    Republics though have seen  |infringements|President_For_Lifesimilarity_To_A_Monarch|  through lifelong or even hereditary heads of state. Republics’ heads of state are often styled  |President|President|  or a variant thereof.     Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 20th century. Forty-five sovereign nations in the world have a  |monarch|List_Of_Current_Sovereign_Monarchs|  as head of state, including sixteen  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realm|  that each have Queen  |Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii|  . Most modern monarchs are  |constitutional_monarchs|Constitutional_Monarch| , who retains a unique legal and ceremonial role but exercise limited or no political power under the nations constitution. In some nations, however, such as  |Brunei|Brunei| ,  |Morocco|Morocco| ,  |Oman|Oman| ,  |Qatar|Qatar| ,  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| ,  |Eswatini|Eswatini|  and  |Thailand|Thailand| , the hereditary monarch has more political influence than any other single source of authority in the nation, either by tradition or by a constitutional mandate.     Historically, monarchies pre-dated such  |polities|Polity|  as  |nation_states|Nation_State|   and even  |territorial_states|Territorial_State| . A  |nation|Nation|  or constitution is not necessary in a monarchy since a person, the monarch, binds the separate territories and  |political_legitimacy|Legitimacy|  together.           The word monarch  comes from the  |Ancient_Greek|Greek_Language|  word  , derived from   and   compare  . It referred to a single at least nominally absolute ruler. In current usage the word monarchy usually refers to a traditional system of hereditary rule, as elective monarchies are quite rare.          The form of societal hierarchy known as  |chiefdom|Chiefdom|  or  |tribal_kingship|Tribal_Kingship|  is prehistoric. The Greek term  is classical, used by  |Herodotus|Herodotus|  .  |Polybius|Polybius|  identified it as one of three benign basic forms of government , opposed to the three malignant basic forms of government . The monarch in classical antiquity is often identified as  |king|King|  or ruler  or as  |queen|Queen_Regnant|  . From earliest historical times, with the  |Egyptian|Pharaoh|  and  |Mesopotamian|Lugal|  monarchs as well as in reconstructed  |Proto-Indo-European_religion|Proto-Indo-European_Religion| , the king held  |sacral_functions|Sacral_Kingship|  directly connected to  |sacrifice|Sacrifice|  or was considered by their people to have  |divine_ancestry|Imperial_Cult| .     The role of the Roman emperor as the protector of  |Christianity|State_Church_Of_The_Roman_Empire|  was conflated with the sacral aspects held by the  |Germanic_kings|Germanic_King|  to create the notion of the  |divine_right_of_kings|Divine_Right_Of_Kings|  in the Christian Middle Ages. The  |Japanese|Japanese_Emperor|  and  |Nepalese|Kingdom_Of_Nepal|  monarchs continued to be considered  |living_Gods|List_Of_People_Who_Have_Been_Considered_Deities|  into the modern period.     Polybius originally understood monarchy as a component of republics, but since antiquity monarchy has contrasted with forms of republic, where executive power is wielded by free citizens and their assemblies. In antiquity, some monarchies were  |abolished|Abolished_Monarchy|  in favour of such assemblies in  |Rome|Ancient_Rome|  , and  |Athens|Ancient_Athens|  .     In  |Germanic_antiquity|Germanic_Antiquity| ,  |kingship|Germanic_King|  was primarily a sacral function. The king was directly hereditary for some tribes, while for others he was elected from among eligible members of royal families by the  |thing|Thing| .      Such ancient parliamentarism declined during the European Middle Ages but survived in forms of regional assemblies .     The modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the  |English_monarchy|English_Monarchy|  by the  |Parliament_of_England|Parliament_Of_England|  in 1649, followed by the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution|  of 1776 and the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  of 1789. One of many opponents of that trend was  |Elizabeth_Dawbarn|Elizabeth_Dawbarn| , whose anonymous Dialogue between Clara Neville and Louisa Mills, on Loyalty features silly Louisa, who admires liberty,  |Tom_Paine|Tom_Paine|  and the USA, lectured by Clara on Gods approval of monarchy and on the influence women can exert on men. The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, , p. 272. Much of 19th-century politics featured a division between anti-monarchist  |Radicalism|Radicalism|  and monarchist  |Conservatism|Conservatism| .     Many countries  |abolished_monarchy|Abolished_Monarchy|  in the 20th century and became  |republics|Republic| , especially in the wake of  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Advocacy of republics is called  |republicanism|Republicanism| , while the advocacy of monarchies is called  |monarchism|Monarchism| . In the modern era, monarchies are more prevalent in small states than in large ones. W. Veenendaal, Monarchy and Democracy in Small States: An Ambiguous Symbiosis, in S. Wolf, ed., State Size Matters: Politik und Recht Im Kontext von Kleinstaatlichkeit und Monarchie , pp. 183–198, , .             Monarchies are associated with  |hereditary_reign|Hereditary_Monarchy| , in which monarchs reign for life and the responsibilities and power of the position pass to their child or another member of their family when they die. Most monarchs, both historically and in the modern-day, have been born and brought up within a  |royal_family|Royal_Family| , the centre of the  |royal_household|Royal_Household|  and  |court|Noble_Court| . Growing up in a royal family ,  |future_monarchs|Heir_Apparent|  are often trained for their expected future responsibilities as monarch.     Different systems of hereditary  |succession|Order_Of_Succession|  have been used, such as  |proximity_of_blood|Proximity_Of_Blood| ,  |primogeniture|Primogeniture| , and  |agnatic_seniority|Agnatic_Seniority|  . While most monarchs in history have been male, many female monarchs also have reigned. The term  |queen_regnant|Queen_Regnant|  refers to a ruling monarch, while  |queen_consort|Queen_Consort|  refers to the wife of a reigning king. Rule may be hereditary in practice without being considered a monarchy: there have been some  |family_dictatorships|Family_Dictatorship|    in many  |democracies|Democracy| .     The principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership .     Some monarchies are not hereditary. In an  |elective_monarchy|Elective_Monarchy| , monarchs are  |elected|Election|  or appointed by some body  for life or a defined period. Four elective monarchies exist today:  |Cambodia|Cambodia| ,  |Malaysia|Malaysia|  and the  |United_Arab_Emirates|United_Arab_Emirates|  are 20th-century creations, while one  is ancient.      A  |self-proclaimed_monarchy|Self-Proclaimed_Monarchy|  is established when a person claims the monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty. There are examples of republican leaders who have proclaimed themselves monarchs:  |Napoleon_I_of_France|Napoleon_I_Of_France|  declared himself  |Emperor_of_the_French|List_Of_French_Monarchs|  and ruled the  |First_French_Empire|First_French_Empire|  after having held the title of  |First_Consul|First_Consul|  of the  |French_Republic|First_French_Republic|  for five years from his seizing power in the coup of  |18_Brumaire|18_Brumaire| . President  |Jean-Bédel_Bokassa|Jean-Bédel_Bokassa|  of the  |Central_African_Republic|Central_African_Republic|  declared himself Emperor of the  |Central_African_Empire|Central_African_Empire|  in 1976.   |Yuan_Shikai|Yuan_Shikai| , the first formal President of the  |Republic_of_China|Republic_Of_China| , crowned himself Emperor of the short-lived  |Empire_of_China|Empire_Of_China|  a few years after the Republic of China was founded. Spence, Jonathan D. The Search for Modern China, W.W. Norton and Company. p. 274. .         |absolute_monarchy|Absolute_Monarchy| , the monarch rules as an  |autocrat|Autocracy| , with absolute power over the state and government—for example, the right to  |rule_by_decree|Rule_By_Decree| , promulgate  |laws|Law| , and impose  |punishments|Punishment| . Absolute monarchies are not necessarily  |authoritarian|Authoritarianism| .     In a  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , the monarch’s power is subject to a  |constitution|Constitution| . In most current constitutional monarchies, the monarch is mainly a ceremonial  |figurehead|Figurehead| |symbol|Symbol|  of national unity and state continuity. Although nominally  |sovereign|Sovereignty| , the electorate  exercises political sovereignty. Constitutional monarchs  |political_power|Political_Power|  is limited. Typical monarchical powers include granting  |pardons|Pardon| , granting  |honours|Honour_System| , and  |reserve_powers|Reserve_Power| , e.g. to dismiss the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister| , refuse to dissolve parliament, or  |veto|Veto|  legislation . They often also have privileges of inviolability and  |sovereign_immunity|Sovereign_Immunity| . A monarchs powers and influence will depend on tradition, precedent, popular opinion, and  |law|Law| .    |Semi-constitutional_monarchies|Semi-Constitutional_Monarchy|  exhibit fewer parliamentary powers or simply monarchs with more authority.  The term  |parliamentary_monarchy|Parliamentary_Monarchy|  may be used to differentiate from semi-constitutional monarchies.     Monarchical reign has often been linked with  |military_authority|Military_Dictatorship| . In the late  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , the  |Praetorian_Guard|Praetorian_Guard|  several times deposed  |Roman_Emperors|Roman_Emperor|  and installed new emperors. Similarly, in the  |Abbasid_Caliphate|Abbasid_Caliphate| , the  |Ghilmans|Ghilman|  deposed Caliphs once they became prominent, allowing new ones to come to power. The Hellenistic kings of  |Macedon|Macedon|  and of  |Epirus|Epirus|  were elected by the army, which was similar in composition to the  ecclesia  of  |democracies|Democracies| , the council of all free citizens; military service was often linked with citizenship among the male members of the royal house. The military has dominated the monarch in modern  |Thailand|Thailand|  and in  |medieval_Japan|Medieval_Japan|  . In  |Fascist_Italy|Italian_Fascism| , the  |Savoy|House_Of_Savoy|  monarchy under King  |Victor_Emmanuel_III|Victor_Emmanuel_Iii|  coexisted with the  |Fascist|Italian_Fascist_Party|  single-party rule of  |Benito_Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini| ;  |Romania|Kingdom_Of_Romania|  under the  |Iron_Guard|Iron_Guard|  and  |Greece|Kingdom_Of_Greece|  during the first months of the  |Colonels_regime|Greek_Military_Junta_Of_1967–1974|  were similar.  |Spain_under_Francisco_Franco|Spain_Under_Franco|  was officially a monarchy, although there was no monarch on the throne. Upon his death, Franco was succeeded as head of state by the  |Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon|  heir,  |Juan_Carlos_I|Juan_Carlos_I_Of_Spain| , and  |Spain_became_a_democracy|Spanish_Transition_To_Democracy|  with the king as a figurehead constitutional monarch.            Most monarchies only have a single person acting as monarch at any given time, although two monarchs have ruled simultaneously in some countries, a situation known as  |diarchy|Diarchy| . Historically this was the case in the ancient  |Greek_city-state|Greek_City-State|  of  |Sparta|Sparta|  and also in 17th-century Russia. There are examples of joint sovereignty of spouses, parent and child or other relatives .      |Andorra|Andorra|  currently is the worlds only constitutional diarchy, a co-principality. Located in the  |Pyrenees|Pyrenees|  between  |Spain|Spain|  and  |France|France| , it has two co-princes: the  |bishop_of_Urgell|Bishop_Of_Urgell|  in Spain  and the  |president_of_France|President_Of_France|  . It is the only situation in which an independent countrys monarch is  |democratically|Democracy|  elected by the citizens of another country.     In a  |personal_union|Personal_Union| , separate independent states share the same person as monarch, but each realm retains separate laws and government. The sixteen separate  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realm|  are sometimes described as being in a personal union with Queen Elizabeth II as monarch; however, they can also be described as being in a shared monarchy.     A  |regent|Regent|  may rule when the monarch is a  |minor|Minor| , absent, or debilitated.     A  |pretender|Pretender|  is a claimant to an abolished throne or a throne already occupied by somebody else.      |Abdication|Abdication|  is the act of formally giving up ones monarchical power and status.     Monarchs may mark the ceremonial beginning of their reigns with a  |coronation|Coronation|  or  |enthronement|Enthronement| .       Monarchy, especially absolute monarchy, is sometimes linked to  |religious|Religion|  aspects; many monarchs once claimed the right to rule by the will of a  |deity|Deity|  , or a special connection to a deity , or even purported to be divine kings, or  |incarnations|Incarnation|  of deities themselves . Many European monarchs have been styled  Fidei defensor  ; some hold official positions relating to the  |state_religion|State_Religion|  or established church.     In the Western political tradition, a morally based, balanced monarchy was stressed as the ideal form of government, and little attention was paid to modern-day ideals of egalitarian democracy: e.g.  |Saint_Thomas_Aquinas|Saint_Thomas_Aquinas|  unapologetically declared: Tyranny is wont to occur not less but more frequently on the basis of polyarchy than on the basis of monarchy. . However, Thomas Aquinas also stated that the ideal monarchical system would also have at lower levels of government both an aristocracy and elements of democracy in order to create a balance of power. The monarch would also be subject to both natural and divine law, and to the  |Church|Catholic_Church|  in matters of religion.     In  |Dante_Alighieris|Dante_Alighieri|  De Monarchia, a spiritualised, imperial Catholic monarchy is strongly promoted according to a  |Ghibelline|Ghibelline|  world-view in which the royal religion of  |Melchizedek|Melchizedek|  is emphasised against the priestly claims of the rival papal ideology.     In  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| , the  |king|King_Of_Saudi_Arabia|  is a head of state who is both the absolute monarch of the country and the  |Custodian_of_the_Two_Holy_Mosques|Custodian_Of_The_Two_Holy_Mosques|  of Islam .          Monarchs can have various  |titles|Title| . Common European titles of monarchs are  |emperor|Emperor|  or  |empress|Empress|  ,  |king|King|  or  |queen|Queen_Regnant| ,  |grand_duke|Grand_Duke|  or  |grand_duchess|Grand_Duchess| ,  |prince|Prince|  or  |princess|Princess| ,  |duke|Duke|  or  |duchess|Duchess| . Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982 vol.1 p21 Some  |early_modern|Early_Modern|  European titles included  |elector|Prince-Elector|  ,  |margrave|Margrave|  , and  |burgrave|Burgrave|  . Lesser titles include  |count|Count|  and  |princely_count|Princely_Count| . Slavic titles include  |knyaz|Knyaz|  and  |tsar|Tsar|  or  |tsaritsa|Tsarina|  , a word derived from the  |Roman_imperial|Roman_Empire|  title  Caesar .     In the  |Muslim_world|Muslim_World| , titles of monarchs include  |caliph|Caliph|  ,  |padishah|Padishah|  ,  |sultan|Sultan|  or  |sultana|Sultana| ,  |shâhanshâh|Shah|  ,  |shah|Shah| ,  |malik|Malik|  or  |malik|Malik| ah ,  |emir|Emir|  or  |emir|Emir| a ,  |sheikh|Sheikh|  or  |sheikh|Sheikh| a,  |imam|Imam|  . East Asian titles of monarchs include  |huángdì|Emperor_Of_China|  ,  |tiānzǐ|Son_Of_Heaven|  ,  tennō  or  josei tennō  ,  wang  or yeowang ,  hwangje  or  yeohwang  . South Asian and South East Asian titles included  mahārāja  or maharani ,  raja  and  rana  or  rani  and ratu . Historically,  |Mongolic|Mongolic_Languages|  and  |Turkic|Turkic_Languages|  monarchs have used the title  khan  and  khagan  or  khatun  and  khanum ;  |Ancient_Egyptian|Ancient_Egypt|  monarchs have used the title  pharaoh  for men and women. In  |Ethiopian_Empire|Ethiopian_Empire| , monarchs used title  nəgusä nägäst  or  |nəgəstä_nägäst|Emperor_Of_Ethiopia|  .     Many monarchs are addressed with particular  |styles|Style|  or manners of address, like  |Majesty|Majesty|  ,  |Royal_Highness|Royal_Highness|  ,  |By_the_Grace_of_God|By_The_Grace_Of_God|  ,  Amīr al-Muminīn  ,  Hünkar-i Khanedan-i Âl-i Osman , Sovereign of the Sublime House of Osman   |Majesty|Majesty| |Majesty|Majesty|  literally His Majesty the heavenly sovereign  Bottom of the Steps for example,  |English_claims_to_the_French_throne|English_Claims_To_The_French_Throne| |antipope|Antipope| sthe  |King_of_Portugal|King_Of_Portugal|  was given the hereditary title  |Duke_of_Braganza|Duke_Of_Braganza| see  |vassals|Vassal| ,  |suzerainty|Suzerainty| ,  |puppet_state|Puppet_State| ,  |hegemony|Hegemony| see  Terra salica usually their eldest sonfull cognaticsuch as the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  in 1983,  |Norway|Norway|  in 1990,  |Belgium|Belgium|  in 1991,  |Denmark|Denmark|  in 2009, and  |Luxembourg|Luxembourg|   .
