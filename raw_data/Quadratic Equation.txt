      In  |algebra|Algebra| , a quadratic equation  is any equation having the form   : ax2 + bx + c 0,   where  represents an unknown, and , , and  represent known numbers, with . If , then the equation is  |linear|Linear_Equation| , not quadratic, as there is no ax2 term. The numbers , , and  are the  coefficient s of the equation and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term. Protters & Morrey: Calculus and Analytic Geometry. First Course .     The values of  that satisfy the equation are called  solutions  of the equation, and  roots  or  zeros  of its left-hand side. A quadratic equation has at most two solutions. If there is no  |real|Real_Number|  solution, there are two  |complex|Complex_Number|  solutions. If there is only one solution, one says that it is a  |double_root|Double_Root| . So a quadratic equation has always two roots, if complex roots are considered, and if a double root is counted for two.   If the two solutions are denoted  and  , one has   : ax2+bx+ca.   Thus, the process of solving a quadratic equation is also called  factorizing  or factoring.  |Completing_the_square|Completing_The_Square|  is the standard method for that, which results in the  |quadratic_formula|Quadratic_Formula| , which express the solutions in terms of , , and .  |Graphing|Graph_Of_A_Function|  may also be used for getting an approximate value of the solutions. Solutions to problems that may be expressed in terms of quadratic equations were known as early as 2000 BC.     Because the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called  |univariate|Univariate|  . The quadratic equation only contains  |powers|Exponentiation|  of  that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a  |polynomial_equation|Polynomial_Equation| . In particular, it is a  |second-degree|Degree_Of_A_Polynomial|  polynomial equation, since the greatest power is two.          A quadratic equation with  |real|Real_Number|  or  |complex|Complex_Number| |coefficients|Coefficients|  has two solutions, called roots. These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may or may not be real.       It may be possible to express a quadratic equation  as a product . In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of p, q, r, and s that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the Zero Factor Property states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if  or . Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.     For most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed.   If one is given a quadratic equation in the form , the sought factorization has the form , and one has to find two numbers  and  that add up to  and whose product is  . As an example,  factors as . The more general case where  does not equal  can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.     Except for special cases such as where  or , factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.              The process of completing the square makes use of the algebraic identity   : x2+2hx+h2 2,   which represents a well-defined  |algorithm|Algorithm|  that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.  Starting with a quadratic equation in standard form,    Divide each side by , the coefficient of the squared term.   Subtract the constant term  from both sides.   Add the square of one-half of , the coefficient of , to both sides. This completes the square , converting the left side into a perfect square.   Write the left side as a square and simplify the right side if necessary.   Produce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.   Solve the two linear equations.     We illustrate use of this algorithm by solving    : 1.
