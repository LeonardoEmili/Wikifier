       Statistics  is a field of inquiry that studies the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of  |data|Data| . It is applicable to a wide variety of  |academic_disciplines|List_Of_Academic_Disciplines| , from the physical and social  |sciences|Science|  to the  |humanities|Humanities| ; it is also used and  |misused|Misuse_Of_Statistics|  for making informed decisions in all areas of  |business|Business|  and  |government|Government| .            Statistics can be described as all of the following:     An  |academic_discipline|Academic_Discipline|    widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.   A  |formal_science|Formal_Science|    branch of knowledge concerned with formal systems.   A  |mathematical_science|Mathematical_Sciences|    field of science that is primarily mathematical in nature but may not be universally considered subfields of mathematics proper. Statistics, for example, is mathematical in its methods but grew out of political arithmetic which merged with inverse probability and grew through applications in the social sciences and some areas of physics and  |biometrics|Biometrics|  to become its own separate, though closely allied, field.        |History_of_statistics|History_Of_Statistics| |Founders_of_statistics|Founders_Of_Statistics|
