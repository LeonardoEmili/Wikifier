He was  |educated_at_home|Educated_At_Home|  by a  |private_tutor|Private_Tutor|  until the age of 16.

Cassells Old and New EDinburgh vol. III p.18     He is buried in the Home-Drummond plot at Kincardine-in-Menteith just west of  |Blair_Drummond|Blair_Drummond| .       Home wrote much about the importance of property to society. In his Essay Upon Several Subjects Concerning British Antiquities, written just after the  |Jacobite_rising_of_1745|Jacobite_Rising_Of_1745|  he described how the  |politics_of_Scotland|Politics_Of_Scotland|  were not based on loyalty to Kings or Queens as Jacobites had said but on royal land grants given in return for loyalty.     In Historical Law Tracts and later in Sketches on the History of Man he described human history as having four distinct stages. The first was as a  |hunter_gatherer|Hunter_Gatherer|  where people avoided each other out of competition. The second stage he described was a  |herder|Herder|  of domestic animals which required forming larger societies. No laws were needed at these stages except those given by the head of the family or society.  |Agriculture|Agriculture|  was the third stage requiring greater cooperation and new relationships to allow for trade or employment . He argued that the intimate union among a multitude of individuals, occasioned by agriculture required a new set of rights and obligations in society. This requires laws and law enforcers. A fourth stage moves from villages and farms to  |seaports_and_market_towns|Civilization|  requiring yet more laws and complexity but also much to benefit from. Kames could see these stages within Scotland itself,  How the Scots Invented the Modern World , by Arthur Hermann,  with the pastoral/agricultural highlands, the agricultural/industrial lowlands and the growing commercial towns of Glasgow and Edinburgh.     Home was a  |polygenist|Polygenist| , he believed God had created different races on earth in separate regions. In his book Sketches of the History of Man, in 1774, Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.

Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 39â€“41     The above studies created the genre of the story of civilization and defined the fields of  |anthropology|Anthropology|  and  |sociology|Sociology|  and therefore the modern study of history for two hundred years.     In the popular book Elements of Criticism Home interrogated the notion of fixed or arbitrary rules of literary composition, and endeavoured to establish a new theory based on the principles of human nature. The late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental writing was associated with his notion that the genuine rules of criticism are all of them derived from the human heart. Vol. 1, p. 16. Prof Neil Rhodes has argued that Lord Kames played a significant role in the development of English as an academic discipline in the Scottish Universities.
