On March 12, 2010, a team of French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation, during which the soldiers had arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold... currently worth about $22,317 . Garimpeiros returned to retrieve the lost loot and colleagues. The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber flash balls but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500  grammes of gold. The violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of 617 grammes of gold, about 20 percent of the quantity seized in 2009 during the battle against illegal mining , said Phillipe Duporge, the director of French Guianas border police, at a press conference the next day.
