Presburger arithmetic is the  |first_order_theory|First_Order_Predicate_Calculus|  of the  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number|  with  |addition|Addition| , named in honor of  |Mojżesz_Presburger|Mojżesz_Presburger| , who introduced it in 1929. The  |signature|Signature|  of Presburger arithmetic contains only the addition operation and  |equality|Equality| , omitting the  |multiplication|Multiplication|  operation entirely. The axioms include a schema of  |induction|Mathematical_Induction| .     Presburger arithmetic is much weaker than  |Peano_arithmetic|Peano_Arithmetic| , which includes both addition and multiplication operations. Unlike Peano arithmetic, Presburger arithmetic is a  |decidable_theory|Decidability| . This means it is possible to algorithmically determine, for any sentence in the language of Presburger arithmetic, whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of Presburger arithmetic. The asymptotic running-time  |computational_complexity|Analysis_Of_Algorithms|  of this  |decision_problem|Decision_Problem|  is at least  |doubly_exponential|Double_Exponential_Function| , however, as shown by .       The language of Presburger arithmetic contains constants 0 and 1 and a binary function +, interpreted as addition. In this language, the axioms of Presburger arithmetic are the  |universal_closures|Universal_Closure|  of the following:   ¬   x + 1 y + 1 → x y   x + 0 x   x +   + 1   Let P be a  |first_order_formula|First_Order_Logic|  in the language of Presburger arithmetic with a free variable x . Then the following formula is an axiom:   :: & rarr; & forall;y P.     is an  |axiom_schema|Axiom_Schema|  of  |induction|Mathematical_Induction| , representing infinitely many axioms. These cannot be replaced by any finite number of axioms, that is, Presburger arithmetic is not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic.     Presburger arithmetic cannot formalize concepts such as  |divisibility|Divisibility|  or  |primality|Primality| . Generally, any number concept leading to multiplication cannot be defined in Presburger arithmetic, since that leads to incompleteness and undecidability. However, it can formulate individual instances of divisibility; for example, it proves for all x, there exists y :  ∨  . This states that every number is either even or odd.          |Mojżesz_Presburger|Mojżesz_Presburger|  proved Presburger arithmetic to be:    |consistent|Consistency_Proof| |complete|Completeness| |decidable|Decidability| |algorithm|Algorithm|  which decides whether any given statement in Presburger arithmetic is a theorem or a nontheorem.     The decidability of Presburger arithmetic can be shown using  |quantifier_elimination|Quantifier_Elimination| , supplemented by reasoning about arithmetical congruence .      |Peano_arithmetic|Peano_Arithmetic| , which is Presburger arithmetic augmented with multiplication, is not decidable, as a consequence of the negative answer to the  |Entscheidungsproblem|Entscheidungsproblem| . By  |Gödels_incompleteness_theorem|Gödels_Incompleteness_Theorem| , Peano arithmetic is incomplete and its consistency is not internally provable .     The decision problem for Presburger arithmetic is an interesting example in  |computational_complexity_theory|Computational_Complexity_Theory|  and  |computation|Computation| . Let n be the length of a statement in Presburger arithmetic. Then  |Fischer|Michael_J_Fischer|  and  |Rabin|Michael_O_Rabin|  proved that any decision algorithm for Presburger arithmetic has a worst-case runtime of at least 2 , for some constant c  sub /sub sub /sub is considered to be quantifier-free; here, bounded quantifiers are counted as quantifiers.   PA is in P, while PA is NP-complete.   For i  .
