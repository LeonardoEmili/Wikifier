Biostatistics are the development and application of  |statistical|Statistical|  methods to a wide range of topics in  |biology|Biology| . It encompasses the design of biological  |experiments|Experiment| , the collection and analysis of data from those experiments and the interpretation of the results.           Biostatistical modeling forms an important part of numerous modern biological theories.  |Genetics|Genetics|  studies, since its beginning, used statistical concepts to understand observed experimental results. Some genetics scientists even contributed with statistical advances with the development of methods and tools.  |Gregor_Mendel|Gregor_Mendel|  started the genetics studies investigating genetics segregation patterns in families of peas and used statistics to explain the collected data. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of Mendels Mendelian inheritance work, there were gaps in understanding between genetics and evolutionary Darwinism.  |Francis_Galton|Francis_Galton|  tried to expand Mendels discoveries with human data and proposed a different model with fractions of the heredity coming from each ancestral composing an infinite series. He called this the theory of  |Law_of_Ancestral_Heredity|Francis_Galton|  . His ideas were strongly disagreed by  |William_Bateson|William_Bateson| , who followed Mendels conclusions, that genetic inheritance were exclusively from the parents, half from each of them. This led to a vigorous debate between the biometricians, who supported Galtons ideas, as  |Walter_Weldon|Walter_Weldon| ,  |Arthur_Dukinfield_Darbishire|Arthur_Dukinfield_Darbishire|  and  |Karl_Pearson|Karl_Pearson| , and Mendelians, who supported Batesons ideas, such as  |Charles_Davenport|Charles_Davenport|  and  |Wilhelm_Johannsen|Wilhelm_Johannsen| . Later, biometricians could not reproduce Galton conclusions in different experiments, and Mendels ideas prevailed. By the 1930s, models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis.     Solving these differences also allowed to define the concept of population genetics and brought together genetics and evolution. The three leading figures in the establishment of  |population_genetics|Population_Genetics|  and this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.      |Ronald_Fisher|Ronald_Fisher|  developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work studying the crop experiments at  |Rothamsted_Research|Rothamsted_Research| , including in his books  |Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers|Statistical_Methods_For_Research_Workers|  end  |The_Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection|The_Genetical_Theory_Of_Natural_Selection|  . He gave many contributions to genetics and statistics. Some of them include the  |ANOVA|Anova| ,  |p-value|P-Value|  concepts,  |Fishers_exact_test|Ronald_Fisher|  and  |Fishers_equation|Ronald_Fisher|  for  |population_dynamics|Population_Dynamics| . He is credited for the sentence “Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability”.     |Sewall_G._Wright|Sewall_G._Wright|  developed  |F-statistics|F-Statistics|  and methods of computing them and defined  |inbreeding_coefficient|Inbreeding_Coefficient| .    |J._B._S._Haldanes|J._B._S._Haldane|  book, The Causes of Evolution, reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics. Also developed the theory of  |primordial_soup|Primordial_Soup| .     These and other biostatisticians,  |mathematical_biologists|Mathematical_Biology| , and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together  |evolutionary_biology|Evolutionary_Biology|  and  |genetics|Genetics|  into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be  |quantitative|Statistics| ly modeled.     In parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of  |DArcy_Thompson|Darcy_Thompson|  in On Growth and Form also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.     Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not  |qualitatively|Qualitative_Data|  apparent. One anecdote describes  |Thomas_Hunt_Morgan|Thomas_Hunt_Morgan|  banning the  |Friden_calculator|Friden,_Inc.|  from his department at  |Caltech|Caltech| , saying Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, Im not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in  |placer_mining|Placer_Mining| .          Any research in  |life_sciences|Life_Sciences|  is proposed to answer a  |scientific_question|Scientific_Question|  we might have. To answer this question with a high certainty, we need  |accurate|Accuracy_And_Precision|  results. The correct definition of the main  |hypothesis|Hypothesis|  and the research plan will reduce errors while taking a decision in understanding a phenomenon. The research plan might include the research question, the hypothesis to be tested, the  |experimental_design|Experimental_Design| ,  |data_collection|Data_Collection|  methods,  |data_analysis|Data_Analysis|  perspectives and costs evolved. It is essential to carry the study based on the three basic principles of experimental statistics:  |randomization|Randomization| ,  |replication|Replication| , and local control.         The research question will define the objective of a study. The research will be headed by the question, so it needs to be concise, at the same time it is focused on interesting and novel topics that may improve science and knowledge and that field. To define the way to ask the  |scientific_question|Scientific_Question| , an exhaustive  |literature_review|Literature_Review|  might be necessary. So, the research can be useful to add value to the  |scientific_community|Scientific_Community| .          Once the aim of the study is defined, the possible answers to the research question can be proposed, transforming this question into a  |hypothesis|Hypothesis| . The main propose is called  |null_hypothesis|Null_Hypothesis|  and is usually based on a permanent knowledge about the topic or an obvious occurrence of the phenomena, sustained by a deep literature review. We can say it is the standard expected answer for the data under the situation in  |test|Experiment| . In general, H O assumes no association between treatments . On the other hand, the  |alternative_hypothesis|Alternative_Hypothesis|  is the denial of H O . It assumes some degree of association between the treatment and the outcome. Although, the hypothesis is sustained by question research and its expected and unexpected answers.     As an example, consider groups of similar animals under two different diet systems. The research question would be: what is the best diet? In this case, H 0 would be that there is no difference between the two diets in mice  |metabolism|Metabolism|  and the  |alternative_hypothesis|Alternative_Hypothesis|  would be that the diets have different effects over animals metabolism .     The  |hypothesis|Hypothesis|  is defined by the researcher, according to his/her interests in answering the main question. Besides that, the  |alternative_hypothesis|Alternative_Hypothesis|  can be more than one hypothesis. It can assume not only differences across observed parameters, but their degree of differences .         Usually, a study aims to understand an effect of a phenomenon over a  |population|Population| . In  |biology|Biology| , a  |population|Population|  is defined as all the  |individuals|Individuals|  of a given  |species|Species| , in a specific area at a given time. In biostatistics, this concept is extended to a variety of collections possible of study. Although, in biostatistics, a  |population|Population|  is not only the  |individuals|Individuals| , but the total of one specific component of their  |organisms|Organisms| , as the whole  |genome|Genome| , or all the sperm  |cells|Cell| , for animals, or the total leaf area, for a plant, for example.     It is not possible to take the  |measures|Measurement|  from all the elements of a  |population|Population| . Because of that, the  |sampling|Sampling|  process is very important for  |statistical_inference|Statistical_Inference| .  |Sampling|Sampling|  is defined as to randomly get a representative part of the entire population, to make posterior inferences about the population. So, the  |sample|Sample|  might catch the most  |variability|Statistical_Variability|  across a population.  The  |sample_size|Sample_Size|  is determined by several things, since the scope of the research to the resources available. In  |clinical_research|Clinical_Research| , the trial type, as  |inferiority|Inferiority| ,  |equivalence|Equivalence| , and  |superior|Superior| ity is a key in determining sample  |size|Size| .        |Experimental_designs|Experimental_Designs|  sustain those basic principles of  |experimental_statistics|Design_Of_Experiments| . There are three basic experimental designs to randomly allocate  |treatments|Treatment_Group|  in all  |plots|Quadrat|  of the  |experiment|Experiment| . They are  |completely_randomized_design|Completely_Randomized_Design| ,  |randomized_block_design|Randomized_Block_Design| , and  |factorial_designs|Factorial_Designs| . Treatments can be arranged in many ways inside the experiment. In  |agriculture|Agriculture| , the correct  |experimental_design|Experimental_Design|  is the root of a good study and the arrangement of  |treatments|Treatment_Group|  within the study is essential because  |environment|Environment|  largely affects the  |plots|Quadrat|  . These main arrangements can be found in the literature under the names of “ |lattices|Lattice_Model| ”, “incomplete blocks”, “ |split_plot|Split_Plot| ”, “augmented blocks”, and many others. All of the designs might include  |control_plots|Scientific_Control| , determined by the researcher, to provide an  |error_estimation|Estimation_Theory|  during  |inference|Inference| .     In  |clinical_studies|Clinical_Studies| , the  |samples|Sample|  are usually smaller than in other biological studies, and in most cases, the  |environment|Environment|  effect can be controlled or measured. It is common to use  |randomized_controlled_clinical_trials|Randomized_Controlled_Trial| , where results are usually compared with  |observational_study|Observational_Study|  designs such as  |case–control|Case–Control|  or  |cohort|Cohort| .          Data collection methods must be considered in research planning, because it highly influences the sample size and experimental design.     Data collection varies according to type of data. For  |qualitative|Qualitative_Data|  data, collection can be done with structured questionnaires or by observation, considering presence or intensity of disease, using score criterion to categorize levels of occurrence.  For  |quantitative_data|Quantitative_Data| , collection is done by measuring numerical information using instruments.     In agriculture and biology studies, yield data and its components can be obtained by  |metric_measures|Metric_Measure| . However, pest and disease injuries in plats are obtained by observation, considering score scales for levels of damage. Especially, in genetic studies, modern methods for data collection in field and laboratory should be considered, as high-throughput platforms for phenotyping and genotyping. These tools allow bigger experiments, while turn possible evaluate many plots in lower time than a human-based only method for data collection.   Finally, all data collected of interest must be stored in an organized data frame for further analysis.                Data can be represented through  |tables|Table|  or  |graphical|Chart|  representation, such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plot. Also,  |measures_of_central|Central_Tendency|  tendency and  |variability|Statistical_Dispersion|  can be very useful to describe an overview of the data. Follow some examples:     Frequency tables     One type of tables are the  |frequency|Frequency|  table, which consists of data arranged in rows and columns, where the frequency is the number of occurrences or repetitions of data. Frequency can be:      Absolute     Relative     In the next example, we have the number of genes in ten  |operons|Operon|  of the same organism.     Genes 2,3,3,4,5,3,3,3,3,4    Line graph           |Line_graphs|Line_Graph|  represent the variation of a value over another metric, such as time. In general, values are represented in the vertical axis, while the time variation is represented in the horizontal axis.      Bar chart     A  |bar_chart|Bar_Chart|  is a graph that shows categorical data as bars presenting heights or widths proportional to represent values. Bar charts provide an image that could also be represented in a tabular format.     In the bar chart example, we have the birth rate in  |Brazil|Brazil|  for the December months from 2010 to 2016. The sharp fall in December 2016 reflects the outbreak of  |Zika_virus|Zika_Virus|  in the birth rate in  |Brazil|Brazil| .     Histograms     The  |histogram|Histogram|  is a graphical representation of a dataset tabulated and divided into uniform or non-uniform classes. It was first introduced by  |Karl_Pearson|Karl_Pearson| .      Scatter Plot     A  |scatter_plot|Scatter_Plot|  is a mathematical diagram that uses Cartesian coordinates to display values of a dataset. A scatter plot shows the data as a set of points, each one presenting the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and another variable on the vertical axis.  They are also called scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram.      Mean        The  |arithmetic_mean|Arithmetic_Mean|  is the sum of a collection of values divided by the number of items of this collection .               Median        The  |median|Median|  is the value in the middle of a dataset.     Mode        The  |mode|Mode|  is the value of a set of data that appears most often.     Box Plot      |Box_plot|Box_Plot|  is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data. The maximum and minimum values are represented by the lines, and the interquartile range represent 25–75% of the data.  |Outliers|Outlier|  may be plotted as circles.     Correlation Coefficients     Although correlations between two different kinds of data could be inferred by graphs, such as scatter plot, is necessary validate this though numerical information. For this reason, correlation coefficients are required. They provide a numerical value that reflects the strength of an association.     Pearson Correlation Coefficient      |Pearson_correlation_coefficient|Pearson_Correlation_Coefficient|  is a measure of association between two variables, X and Y. This coefficient, usually represented by ρ for the population and r for the sample, assumes values between −1 and 1, where ρ 1 represents a perfect positive correlation, ρ -1 represents a perfect negative correlation, and ρ 0 is no linear correlation.            It is used to make  |inferences|Inference|   about an unknown population, by estimation and/or hypothesis testing. In other words, it is desirable to obtain parameters to describe the population of interest, but since the data is limited, it is necessary to make use of a representative sample in order to estimate them. With that, it is possible to test previously defined hypotheses and apply the conclusions to the entire population. The  |standard_error_of_the_mean|Standard_Error|  is a measure of variability that is crucial to do inferences.      |Hypothesis_testing|Statistical_Hypothesis_Testing|      Hypothesis testing is essential to make inferences about populations aiming to answer research questions, as settled in Research planning section. Authors defined four steps to be set:     The hypothesis to be tested |null_hypothesis|Null_Hypothesis|  , that is going to be tested, and an  |alternative_hypothesis|Alternative_Hypothesis| . But they must be defined before the experiment implementation.   Significance level and decision rule |level_of_significance|Significance_Level| , or in other words, the acceptable error rate . It is easier to think that we define a critical value that determines the statistical significance when a  |test_statistic|Test_Statistic|  is compared with it. So, α also has to be predefined before the experiment.   Experiment and statistical analysis |experimental_design|Design_Of_Experiments| , data is collected and the more suitable statistical tests are evaluated.   Inference |null_hypothesis|Null_Hypothesis|  is rejected or not rejected, based on the evidence that the comparison of  |p-values|P-Value|  and α brings. It is pointed that the failure to reject H 0 just means that there is not enough evidence to support its rejection, but not that this hypothesis is true.      |Confidence_intervals|Confidence_Intervals|      A confidence interval is a range of values that can contain the true real parameter value in given a certain level of confidence. The first step is to estimate the best-unbiased estimate of the population parameter. The upper value of the interval is obtained by the sum of this estimate with the multiplication between the standard error of the mean and the confidence level. The calculation of lower value is similar, but instead of a sum, a subtraction must be applied.             When testing a hypothesis, there are two types of statistic errors possible:  |Type_I_error|Type_I_Error|  and  |Type_II_error|Type_Ii_Error| . The type I error or  |false_positive|False_Positives_And_False_Negatives|  is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis and the type II error or  |false_negative|False_Positives_And_False_Negatives|  is the failure to reject a false  |null_hypothesis|Null_Hypothesis| . The  |significance_level|Significance_Level|  denoted by α is the type I error rate and should be chosen before performing the test. The type II error rate is denoted by β and  |statistical_power_of_the_test|Statistical_Power|  is 1 − β.         The  |p-value|P-Value|  is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as or more extreme than those observed, assuming the  |null_hypothesis|Null_Hypothesis|  is true. It is also called the calculated probability. It is common to confuse the p-value with the  |significance_level|Statistical_Significance| , but, the α is a predefined threshold for calling significant results. If p is less than α, the null hypothesis is rejected.          In multiple tests of the same hypothesis, the probability of the occurrence of  |falses_positives|False_Positives_And_False_Negatives|   increase and some strategy are used to control this occurrence. This is commonly achieved by using a more stringent threshold to reject null hypotheses. The  |Bonferroni_correction|Bonferroni_Correction|  defines an acceptable global significance level, denoted by α and each test is individually compared with a value of α α/m. This ensures that the familywise error rate in all m tests, is less than or equal to α. When m is large, the Bonferroni correction may be overly conservative. An alternative to the Bonferroni correction is to control the  |false_discovery_rate|False_Discovery_Rate| . The FDR controls the expected proportion of the rejected  |null_hypotheses|Null_Hypothesis|  that are false . This procedure ensures that, for independent tests, the false discovery rate is at most q. Thus, the FDR is less conservative than the Bonferroni correction and have more power, at the cost of more false positives. Benjamini, Y. & Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B 57, 289–300 .         The main hypothesis being tested is often accompanied by other technical assumptions that are also part of the null hypothesis. When the technical assumptions are violated in practice, then the null may be frequently rejected even if the main hypothesis is true. Such rejections are said to be due to model mis-specification.  Verifying whether the outcome of a statistical test does not change when the technical assumptions are slightly altered is the main way of combating mis-specification.          |Model_criteria_selection|Model_Selection|  will select or model that more approximate true model. The  |Akaikes_Information_Criterion|Model_Selection|  and The  |Bayesian_Information_Criterion|Model_Selection|  are examples of asymptotically efficient criteria.            Recent developments have made a large impact on biostatistics. Two important changes have been the ability to collect data on a high-throughput scale, and the ability to perform much more complex analysis using computational techniques. This comes from the development in areas as  |sequencing|Dna_Sequencing|  technologies,  |Bioinformatics|Bioinformatics|  and  |Machine_learning|Machine_Learning|  .         New biomedical technologies like  |microarrays|Dna_Microarray| ,  |next-generation_sequencers|Dna_Sequencing|  and  |mass_spectrometry|Mass_Spectrometers|  generate enormous amounts of data, allowing many tests to be performed simultaneously.  Careful analysis with biostatistical methods is required to separate the signal from the noise. For example, a microarray could be used to measure many thousands of genes simultaneously, determining which of them have different expression in diseased cells compared to normal cells. However, only a fraction of genes will be differentially expressed.       |Multicollinearity|Multicollinearity|  often occurs in high-throughput biostatistical settings. Due to high intercorrelation between the predictors , the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. It could be that only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. In such a case, one could apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction . Classical statistical techniques like linear or  |logistic_regression|Logistic_Regression|  and  |linear_discriminant_analysis|Linear_Discriminant_Analysis|  do not work well for high dimensional data  sup /sup  ref  /ref  ref name :4  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  and NCBI.      Nowadays, increase in size and complexity of molecular datasets leads to use of powerful statistical methods provided by computer science algorithms which are developed by  |machine_learning|Machine_Learning|  area. Therefore, data mining and machine learning allow detection of patterns in data with a complex structure, as biological ones, by using methods of  |supervised|Supervised_Learning|  and  |unsupervised_learning|Unsupervised_Learning| , regression, detection of  |clusters|Cluster_Analysis|  and  |association_rule_mining|Association_Rule_Learning| , among others. To indicate some of them,  |self-organizing_maps|Self-Organizing_Map|  and  |k-means|K-Means_Clustering|  are examples of cluster algorithms;  |neural_networks|Artificial_Neural_Network|  implementation and  |support_vector_machines|Support_Vector_Machine|  models are examples of common machine learning algorithms.     Collaborative work among molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, statisticians and computer scientists is important to perform an experiment correctly, going from planning, passing through data generation and analysis, and ending with biological interpretation of the results.         On the other hand, the advent of modern computer technology and relatively cheap computing resources have enabled computer-intensive biostatistical methods like  |bootstrapping|Bootstrapping|  and  |re-sampling|Re-Sampling|  methods.     In recent times,  |random_forests|Random_Forests|  have gained popularity as a method for performing  |statistical_classification|Statistical_Classification| . Random forest techniques generate a panel of decision trees. Decision trees have the advantage that you can draw them and interpret them . Random Forests have thus been used for clinical decision support systems.               |Public_health|Public_Health| , including  |epidemiology|Epidemiology| ,  |health_services_research|Health_Services_Research| ,  |nutrition|Nutrition| ,  |environmental_health|Environmental_Health|  and health care policy & management. In these  |medicine|Medicine|  contents, its important to consider the design and analysis of the  |clinical_trials|Clinical_Trial| . As one example, there is the assessment of severity state of a patient with a prognosis of an outcome of a disease.     With new technologies and genetics knowledge, biostatistics are now also used for  |Systems_medicine|Systems_Medicine| , which consists in a more personalized medicine. For this, is made an integration of data from different sources, including conventional patient data, clinico-pathological parameters, molecular and genetic data as well as data generated by additional new-omics technologies.          The study of  |Population_genetics|Population_Genetics|  and  |Statistical_genetics|Statistical_Genetics|  in order to link variation in  |genotype|Genotype|  with a variation in  |phenotype|Phenotype| . In other words, it is desirable to discover the genetic basis of a measurable trait, a quantitative trait, that is under polygenic control. A genome region that is responsible for a continuous trait is called  |Quantitative_trait_locus|Quantitative_Trait_Locus|  . The study of QTLs become feasible by using  |molecular_markers|Molecular_Marker|  and measuring traits in populations, but their mapping needs the obtaining of a population from an experimental crossing, like an F2 or  |Recombinant_inbred_strains|Recombinant_Inbred_Strain| /lines . To scan for QTLs regions in a genome, a  |gene_map|Gene_Map|  based on linkage have to be built. Some of the best-known QTL mapping algorithms are Interval Mapping, Composite Interval Mapping, and Multiple Interval Mapping.      However, QTL mapping resolution is impaired by the amount of recombination assayed, a problem for species in which it is difficult to obtain large offspring. Furthermore, allele diversity is restricted to individuals originated from contrasting parents, which limit studies of allele diversity when we have a panel of individuals representing a natural population.  For this reason, the  |Genome-wide_association_study|Genome-Wide_Association_Study|  was proposed in order to identify QTLs based on  |linkage_disequilibrium|Linkage_Disequilibrium| , that is the non-random association between traits and molecular markers. It was leveraged by the development of high-throughput  |SNP_genotyping|Snp_Genotyping| .      In  |animal|Animal_Breeding|  and  |plant_breeding|Plant_Breeding| , the use of markers in  |selection|Selective_Breeding|  aiming for breeding, mainly the molecular ones, collaborated to the development of  |marker-assisted_selection|Marker-Assisted_Selection| . While QTL mapping is limited due resolution, GWAS does not have enough power when rare variants of small effect that are also influenced by environment. So, the concept of Genomic Selection arises in order to use all molecular markers in the selection and allow the prediction of the performance of candidates in this selection. The proposal is to genotype and phenotype a training population, develop a model that can obtain the genomic estimated breeding values of individuals belonging to a genotyped and but not phenotyped population, called testing population.  This kind of study could also include a validation population, thinking in the concept of  |cross-validation|Cross-Validation| , in which the real phenotype results measured in this population are compared with the phenotype results based on the prediction, what used to check the accuracy of the model.     As a summary, some points about the application of quantitative genetics are:   This has been used in agriculture to improve crops  and  |livestock|Livestock|  .   In biomedical research, this work can assist in finding candidates  |gene|Gene| |alleles|Allele|  that can cause or influence predisposition to diseases in  |human_genetics|Human_Genetics|          Studies for differential expression of genes from  |RNA-Seq|Rna-Seq|  data, as for  |RT-qPCR|Real-Time_Polymerase_Chain_Reaction|  and  |microarrays|Microarrays| , demands comparison of conditions. The goal is to identify genes which have a significant change in abundance between different conditions. Then, experiments are designed appropriately, with replicates for each condition/treatment, randomization and blocking, when necessary. In RNA-Seq, the quantification of expression uses the information of mapped reads that are summarized in some genetic unit, as  |exons|Exon|  that are part of a gene sequence. As  |microarray|Microarray|  results can be approximated by a normal distribution, RNA-Seq counts data are better explained by other distributions. The first used distribution was the  |Poisson|Poisson_Distribution|  one, but it underestimate the sample error, leading to false positives. Currently, biological variation is considered by methods that estimate a dispersion parameter of a  |negative_binomial_distribution|Negative_Binomial_Distribution| .  |Generalized_linear_models|Generalized_Linear_Model|  are used to perform the tests for statistical significance and as the number of genes is high, multiple tests correction have to be considered.  Some examples of other analysis on  |genomics|Genomics|  data comes from microarray or  |proteomics|Proteomics|  experiments.   Often concerning diseases or disease stages.           |Ecology|Ecology| ,  |ecological_forecasting|Ecological_Forecasting| |sequence_analysis|Sequence_Analysis| |Systems_biology|Systems_Biology|  for gene network inference or pathways analysis.     |Population_dynamics|Population_Dynamics| , especially in regards to  |fisheries_science|Fisheries_Science| .    |Phylogenetics|Phylogenetics|  and  |evolution|Evolution|          There are a lot of tools that can be used to do statistical analysis in biological data. Most of them are useful in other areas of knowledge, covering a large number of applications . Here are brief descriptions of some of them:      |ASReml|Asreml|  that can be used also in R environment as a package. It is developed to estimate variance components under a general linear mixed model using  |restricted_maximum_likelihood|Restricted_Maximum_Likelihood|  . Models with fixed effects and random effects and nested or crossed ones are allowed. Gives the possibility to investigate different  |variance-covariance|Covariance_Matrix|  matrix structures.   CycDesigN:  A computer package developed by VSNi that helps the researchers create experimental designs and analyze data coming from a design present in one of three classes handled by CycDesigN. These classes are resolvable, non-resolvable, partially replicated and  |crossover_designs|Crossover_Study| . It includes less used designs the Latinized ones, as t-Latinized design.     |Orange|Orange| |R|R| |S|S|  language maintained by CRAN.  In addition to its functions to read data tables, take descriptive statistics, develop and evaluate models, its repository contains packages developed by researchers around the world. This allows the development of functions written to deal with the statistical analysis of data that comes from specific applications. In the case of Bioinformatics, for example, there are packages located in the main repository and in others, as  |Bioconductor|Bioconductor| . It is also possible to use packages under development that are shared in hosting-services as  |GitHub|Github| .    |SAS|Sas| , it uses  |SAS_language|Sas_Language|  for programming.   PLA 3.0:  Is a biostatistical analysis software for regulated environments which supports Quantitative Response Assays and Dichotomous Assays . It also supports weighting methods for combination calculations and the automatic data aggregation of independent assay data.    |Weka|Weka| |Java|Java|  software for  |machine_learning|Machine_Learning|  and  |data_mining|Data_Mining| , including tools and methods for visualization, clustering, regression, association rule, and classification. There are tools for cross-validation, bootstrapping and a module of algorithm comparison. Weka also can be run in other programming languages as Perl or R.         Almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at  |postgraduate|Postgraduate|  level. They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture, or as a focus of application in departments of statistics.     In the United States, where several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as  |epidemiology|Epidemiology| . Thus, departments carrying the name biostatistics may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on  |bioinformatics|Bioinformatics|  and  |computational_biology|Computational_Biology| , whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of  |public_health|Public_Health| , will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and  |clinical_trials|Clinical_Trial|  as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities around the world, where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics program is twofold: statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry , business and  |economics|Economics|  and biological areas other than medicine.
