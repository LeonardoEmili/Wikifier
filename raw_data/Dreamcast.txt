        The   is a  |home_video_game_console|Home_Video_Game_Console|  released by  |Sega|Sega|  on November 27, 1998 in Japan, September 9, 1999 in North America, and October 14, 1999 in Europe. It was the first in the  |sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles|History_Of_Video_Game_Consoles| , preceding Sonys  |PlayStation_2|Playstation_2| , Nintendos  |GameCube|Gamecube|  and Microsofts  |Xbox|Xbox| . The Dreamcast was Segas final home console, marking the end of the companys 18 years in the console market.     In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful  |Sega_Saturn|Sega_Saturn| , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components, including a  |Hitachi|Hitachi| |_SH_4|Superh| |_CPU|Central_Processing_Unit|  and an  |NEC|Nec| |_PowerVR|Powervr| 2  |GPU|Graphics_Processing_Unit| . Released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Segas expectations despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher. 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide.     Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited  |third_party|Third_Party_Developer|  support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative, including  Crazy Taxi ,  Jet Set Radio  and  Shenmue , as well as high-quality  |ports|Porting|  from Segas  |NAOMI_arcade_system_board|Sega_Naomi| . The Dreamcast was also the first console to include a built-in  |modem|Modem|  for internet support and  |online_play|Online_Game| .           Released in 1988, the  |Sega|Sega| |_Genesis|Sega_Genesis|  was Segas entry into the  |fourth_generation|History_Of_Video_Game_Consoles|  of video game consoles.  Selling 30.75 million units worldwide, the Genesis was the most successful console Sega ever released.  The successor to the Genesis, the  |Sega_Saturn|Sega_Saturn| , was released in Japan in 1994.  The Saturn was a  |CD_ROM|Cd_Rom| -based console that displayed both  |2D|2D_Computer_Graphics|  and  |3D|3D_Computer_Graphics|  computer graphics, but its complex dual- |CPU|Central_Processing_Unit|  architecture made it more difficult to program for than its chief competitor, the  |Sony|Sony| |_PlayStation|Playstation| . Although the Saturn debuted before the PlayStation in both Japan and the United States,   its surprise U.S. launch—which came four months earlier than originally scheduled  —was marred by a lack of distribution, which remained a continuing problem for the system.  Moreover, Segas early release was undermined by Sonys simultaneous announcement that the PlayStation would retail for US$299—compared to the Saturns initial price of $399.   |Nintendos|Nintendo|  long delay in releasing a competing 3D console and the damage done to Segas reputation by poorly supported  |add_ons|Video_Game_Accessory|  for the Genesis  allowed Sony to establish a foothold in the market.  The PlayStation was immediately successful in the U.S., in part due to a massive advertising campaign and strong third-party support engendered by Sonys excellent development tools and liberal $10 licensing fee. Sonys success was further aided by a  |price_war|Price_War|  in which Sega lowered the price of the Saturn from $399 to $299 and then from $299 to $199 in order to match the price of the PlayStation–even though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture and the PlayStation enjoyed a larger software library.  Losses on the Saturn hardware contributed to Segas financial problems, which saw the companys revenue decline between 1992 and 1995 as part of an industry-wide slowdown. Furthermore, Segas focus on the Saturn over the Genesis prevented it from fully capitalizing on the continued strength of the 16-bit market.      Due to long-standing disagreements with Sega of Japan,   Sega of America CEO  |Tom_Kalinske|Tom_Kalinske|  became less interested in his position. On July 16, 1996, Sega announced that  |Shoichiro_Irimajiri|Shoichiro_Irimajiri|  had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America, while Kalinske would be leaving Sega after September 30 of that year.  Sega also announced that Sega Enterprises cofounder  |David_Rosen|David_Rosen|  and Sega of Japan CEO  |Hayao_Nakayama|Hayao_Nakayama|  had resigned from their positions as chairman and co-chairman of Sega of America, though both men remained with the company.  |Bernie_Stolar|Bernie_Stolar| , a former executive at  |Sony_Computer_Entertainment|Sony_Computer_Entertainment|  of America,   was named Sega of Americas executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations.    Stolar did not support the Saturn due to his belief that the hardware was poorly designed and publicly announced at E3 1997 that The Saturn is not our future. After the launch of the  |Nintendo_64|Nintendo_64| , sales of the Saturn and Segas 32-bit software were sharply reduced. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47 percent of the console market,  |Nintendo|Nintendo|  controlled 40 percent, and Sega controlled only 12 percent. Neither price cuts nor high-profile games were proving helpful to the Saturns success. Due to the Saturns poor performance in North America, Sega of America laid off 60 of its 200 employees in the fall of 1997.     As a result of the companys deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to become CEO and president of Sega of America.  Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the  |Tokyo_Stock_Exchange|Tokyo_Stock_Exchange| .  Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales , the company reported a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion .  Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. This decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year.  Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released.       As early as 1995, reports surfaced that Sega would collaborate with  |Lockheed_Martin|Lockheed_Martin| ,  |The_3DO_Company|The_3Do_Company| ,  |Matsushita|Panasonic| , or Alliance Semiconductor to create a new  |graphics_processing_unit|Graphics_Processing_Unit| , which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit Saturn 2 or an add-on peripheral.   cf.  cf.  Development of the Dreamcast was wholly unrelated to this rumored project. In light of the Saturns poor market performance, Irimajiri decided to start looking outside of the companys internal hardware development division to create a new console. In 1997, Irimajiri enlisted the services of  |IBMs|Ibm|  Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an 11-man team to work on a secret hardware project in the United States, which was referred to as Blackbelt . Accounts vary on how an internal team led by  |Hideki_Sato|Hideki_Sato|  also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega of Japan tasked both teams, while another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiris choice to begin development externally and chose to have his hardware team begin development.  Sato and his group chose the  |Hitachi|Hitachi| |_SH_4|Superh|  processor architecture and the  |VideoLogic|Imagination_Technologies| |_PowerVR2|Powervrseries_2|  graphics processor, manufactured by  |NEC|Nec| , in the production of their  |mainboard|Mainboard| . Initially known as Whitebelt ,  this project was later codenamed Dural , after the  |metallic_female_fighter|Dural|  from Segas  Virtua Fighter  series.      Yamamotos group opted to use  |3dfx|3Dfx| |_Voodoo_2|Voodoo_2|  and  |Voodoo_Banshee|Voodoo_Banshee|  graphics processors alongside a  |Motorola_PowerPC_603e|Powerpc_600| |_central_processing_unit|Central_Processing_Unit|  , but Sega management later asked them to also use the SH-4 chip. Both processors have been described as  |off_the_shelf|Commercial_Off_The_Shelf|  components. In 1997, 3dfx began its  |IPO|Initial_Public_Offering| , and as a result of legal obligations unveiled its contracts with Sega, including the development of the new console.  This angered Sega of Japan executives, who eventually decided to use the Dural chipset and cut ties with 3dfx. According to former Sega of America vice president of communications and former NEC brand manager Charles Bellfield, presentations of games using the NEC solution showcased the performance and low cost delivered by the SH-4 and PowerVR architecture. He further stated that Segas relationship with NEC, a Japanese company, probably made a difference too. Stolar, on the other hand, felt the U.S. version, the 3Dfx version, should have been used. Japan wanted the Japanese version, and Japan won. As a result, 3dfx filed a lawsuit against both Sega and NEC claiming breach of contract, which would eventually be settled out of court. The choice to use the PowerVR architecture concerned  |Electronic_Arts|Electronic_Arts|  , a longtime developer for Segas consoles. EA had invested in 3dfx but was unfamiliar with the selected architecture, which was reportedly less powerful. As recounted by Shiro Hagiwara and Ian Oliver , the SH-4 was chosen while it was still in development and following a lengthy deliberation process because it was the only available processor that could adapt to deliver the 3D geometry calculation performance necessary. By February 1998, Sega had renamed the Dural Katana , although certain hardware specifications such as  |random_access_memory|Random_Access_Memory|  were not yet finalized.      Knowing that the Sega Saturn had been set back by its high production costs and complex hardware, Sega took a different approach with the Dreamcast. Like previous Sega consoles, the Dreamcast was designed around intelligent  |subsystems|System|  working in parallel with one another,  but the selections of hardware were more in line with what was common in personal computers than video game consoles, reducing the systems cost. According to Damien McFerran, the motherboard was a masterpiece of clean, uncluttered design and compatibility. Chinese economist and future Sega.com CEO Brad Huang convinced Sega chairman  |Isao_Okawa|Isao_Okawa|  to include a  |modem|Modem|  with every Dreamcast despite significant opposition from Okawas staff over the additional $15 cost per unit.   To account for rapid changes in home data delivery, Sega designed the Dreamcasts modem to be  |modular|Modularity| . Sega selected the  |GD_ROM|Gd_Rom|  media format for the system.  The GD-ROM, which was jointly developed by Sega and  |Yamaha_Corporation|Yamaha_Corporation| , could be mass-produced at a similar price to a normal CD-ROM, thus avoiding the greater expense of  |DVD_ROM|Dvd_Rom|  technology. As the GD-ROM format can hold about 1  |GB|Gigabyte|  of data,  |illegally_copying|Copyright_Infringement|  Dreamcast games onto a 650  |MB|Megabyte|  CD-ROM sometimes required the removal of certain game features, although this did not prevent copying of Dreamcast software.   |Microsoft|Microsoft|  developed a custom Dreamcast version of  |Windows_CE|Windows_Ce|  with  |DirectX|Directx| |_API|Application_Programming_Interface|  and  |dynamic_link_libraries|Dynamic_Link_Library| , making it easy to port PC games to the platform, although programmers would ultimately favor Segas development tools over those from Microsoft.     Sega held a public competition to name its new system and considered over 5,000 different entries before choosing Dreamcast —a portmanteau of dream and broadcast . According to Katsutoshi Eguchi, Japanese game developer  |Kenji_Eno|Kenji_Eno|  submitted the name and created the Dreamcasts spiral logo, but this claim has not been verified by Sega.  The Dreamcasts start-up sound was composed by the Japanese musician  |Ryuichi_Sakamoto|Ryuichi_Sakamoto| .  Because the Saturn had tarnished Segas reputation, the company planned to remove its name from the console entirely and establish a new gaming brand similar to Sonys  |PlayStation|Playstation| , but Irimajiris management team ultimately decided to retain Segas logo on the Dreamcasts exterior. Sega spent  |US_|United_States_Dollar| 50–80 million on hardware development, $150–200 million on software development, and $300 million on worldwide promotion—a sum which Irimajiri, a former  |Honda|Honda|  executive, humorously compared to the investments required to design new automobiles.        Despite taking massive losses on the Saturn, including a 75 percent drop in half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders. Sega announced that  Sonic Adventure , the next game starring company mascot  |Sonic_the_Hedgehog|Sonic_The_Hedgehog| , would arrive in time for the Dreamcasts launch and promoted the game with a large-scale public demonstration at the  |Tokyo_Kokusai_Forum_Hall|Tokyo_International_Forum| .    However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcasts Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process.  As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out by the end of the day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of  Virtua Fighter 3 , the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Key Dreamcast games Sonic Adventure and  Sega Rally Championship 2 , which had been delayed, arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Segas attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcasts survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software.  Seaman , released in July 1999, was considered the Dreamcasts first major hit in Japan.   Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales. The price reduction and release of  |Namcos|Namco|   Soulcalibur  helped Sega to gain 17 percent on its shares.     Prior to the Dreamcasts release, Sega was dealt a blow when EA—the largest third-party video game publisher—announced it would not develop games for the system. EA chief creative officer  |Bing_Gordon|Bing_Gordon|  said that Sega had flip-flopped on the configuration and because the Dreamcast became the system that EA developers least wanted to work on the in the history of systems at EA, that was pretty much it. In the end, it felt like Sega was not acting like a competent hardware company . Gordon also claimed couldnt afford to give us the same kind of license that EA has had over the last five years . Stolar had a different account of the breakdown in negotiations with EA, recalling that EA president Larry Probst specifically wanted exclusive rights to be the only sports brand on Dreamcast , which Stolar could not accept due to Segas recent $10 million purchase of  |sports_game|Sports_Game|  developer  |Visual_Concepts|Visual_Concepts| . While EAs  |Madden_NFL|Madden_Nfl|  series did have established brand power, Stolar regarded  |NFL_2K|Nfl_2K|  as far superior and providing a breakthrough experience to launch the Dreamcast. While the Dreamcast would have none of EAs popular sports games, Sega Sports games developed mainly by Visual Concepts helped to fill that void.        Working closely with  |Midway_Games|Midway_Games|  and taking advantage of the ten months following the Dreamcasts release in Japan, Sega of America worked to ensure a more successful U.S. launch with a minimum of 15 launch games. Despite lingering bitterness over the Saturns early release, Stolar successfully managed to repair relations with major U.S. retailers, with whom Sega presold 300,000 Dreamcast units. In addition, a pre-launch promotion enabled consumers to rent the system from Hollywood Video in the months preceding its September launch.  Sega of Americas senior vice president of marketing  |Peter_Moore|Peter_Moore| , a fan of the attitude previously associated with Segas brand, worked with  |Foote_Cone_Belding|Fcb|  and Access Communications to develop the Its Thinking campaign of 15-second television commercials, which emphasized the Dreamcasts hardware power.  According to Moore, We needed to create something that would really intrigue consumers, somewhat apologize for the past, but invoke all the things we loved about Sega, primarily from the Genesis days. On August 11, Sega of America confirmed  that Stolar had been fired, leaving Moore to direct the launch.   cf.      The Dreamcast launched in North America on September 9, 1999 at a price of $199—which Segas marketing dubbed 9/9/99 for $199 .  Eighteen launch games were available for the Dreamcast in the U.S.   Sega set a new sales record by selling more than 225,132 Dreamcast units in 24 hours, earning the company $98.4 million in what Moore called the biggest 24 hours in entertainment retail history . Within two weeks, U.S. Dreamcast sales exceeded 500,000. By Christmas, Sega held 31 percent of the North American video game marketshare.  Significant launch games included Soul Calibur, an arcade  |fighting_game|Fighting_Game|  that was graphically enhanced for the system and went on to sell one million units, and Visual Concepts high-quality football simulation  NFL 2K .  On November 4, Sega announced it had sold over one million Dreamcast units. Nevertheless, the launch was marred by a glitch at one of Segas manufacturing plants, which produced defective GD-ROMs.      Sega released the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999, at a price of  |GB£|Pound_Sterling| 200. By November 24, 400,000 consoles had been sold in Europe.  By Christmas of 1999, Sega of Europe reported selling 500,000 units, placing it six months ahead of schedule. Sales did not continue at this pace, and by October 2000, Sega had sold only about 1 million units in Europe.  As part of Segas promotions of the Dreamcast in Europe, the company sponsored four European  |football|Association_Football|  clubs:  |Arsenal_F_C_|Arsenal_F_C_|  ,   |AS_Saint_Étienne|As_Saint_Étienne|  ,   |U_C_Sampdoria|U_C_Sampdoria|  ,  and  |Deportivo_de_La_Coruña|Deportivo_De_La_Coruña|  .           Though the Dreamcast launch had been successful, Sony still held 60 percent of the overall video game market share in North America with the PlayStation at the end of 1999. On March 2, 1999, in what one report called a highly publicized,  |vaporware|Vaporware| -like announcement  Sony revealed the first details of its next generation PlayStation , which  |Ken_Kutaragi|Ken_Kutaragi|  claimed would allow video games to convey unprecedented emotions. The center of Sonys marketing plan and the upcoming PlayStation 2 itself was a new CPU  jointly developed by Sony and  |Toshiba|Toshiba| —the  |Emotion_Engine|Emotion_Engine|  —which Kutaragi announced would feature a graphics processor with 1,000 times more bandwidth than contemporary PC graphics processors and a floating-point calculation performance of 6.2  |gigaflops|Flops| , rivaling most supercomputers.  Sony, which invested $1.2 billion in two  |large_scale_integration|Large_Scale_Integration| |semiconductor_fabrication_plants|Semiconductor_Fabrication_Plant|  to manufacture the PlayStation 2s Emotion Engine and Graphics Synthesizer , designed the machine to push more raw polygons than any video game console in history.   Sony claimed the PlayStation 2 could render 75 million raw polygons per second with absolutely no effects, and 38 million without accounting for features such as  |textures|Texture_Mapping| ,  |artificial_intelligence|Artificial_Intelligence| , or  |physics|Game_Physics| .  With such effects, Sony estimated the PlayStation 2 could render 7.5 million ,  |SCEE|Sony_Computer_Entertainment_Europe| , 2003 to 16 million polygons per second, whereas independent estimates ranged from 3 million to 20 million,  compared to Segas estimates of more than 3 million to 6 million for the Dreamcast. The system would also utilize the  |DVD_ROM|Dvd_Rom|  format, which could hold substantially more data than the Dreamcasts GD-ROM format. Because it could connect to the Internet while playing movies, music, and video games, Sony hyped PlayStation 2 as the future of home entertainment.  Rumors spread that the PlayStation 2 was a supercomputer capable of guiding missiles and displaying  Toy Story -quality graphics, while Kutaragi boasted its online capabilities would give consumers the ability to jack into ‘ The Matrix ’!    cf.  cf.  In addition, Sony emphasized that the PlayStation 2 would be backwards compatible with hundreds of popular PlayStation games.  Sonys specifications appeared to render the Dreamcast obsolete months before its U.S. launch, although reports later emerged that the PlayStation 2 was not as powerful as expected and distinctly difficult to program games for.  The same year, Nintendo announced that its  |next_generation_console|Gamecube|  would meet or exceed anything on the market, and Microsoft began development of  |its_own_console|Xbox| .      Segas initial momentum proved fleeting as U.S. Dreamcast sales—which exceeded 1.5 million by the end of 1999  —began to decline as early as January 2000. Poor Japanese sales contributed to Segas ¥42.88 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 2000, which followed a similar loss of ¥42.881 billion the previous year and marked Segas third consecutive annual loss.   Although Segas overall sales for the term increased 27.4%, and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded the companys expectations, this increase in sales coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan. At the same time, increasingly poor market conditions reduced the profitability of Segas Japanese arcade business, prompting the company to close 246 locations.  Knowing that they have to fish where the fish are biting , Sega of America president Peter Moore and Sega of Japans developers focused on the U.S. market to prepare for the upcoming launch of the PS2. To that end, Sega of America launched its own Internet service provider, Sega.com, led by CEO Brad Huang.  On September 7, 2000, Sega.com launched  |SegaNet|Seganet| , the Dreamcasts  |Internet_gaming|Online_Games|  service, at a subscription price of $21.95 per month.   Although Sega had previously released only one Dreamcast game in the U.S. that featured online multiplayer , the launch of SegaNet combined with  NFL 2K1  was intended to increase demand for the Dreamcast in the U.S. market.  The service would later support games including  Bomberman Online ,  Quake III Arena , and  Unreal Tournament . The September 7 launch coincided with a new advertising campaign to promote SegaNet, including via the  |MTV_Video_Music_Awards|Mtv_Video_Music_Awards|  of the same day, which Sega sponsored for the second consecutive year.  Sega employed aggressive pricing strategies with relation to online gaming. In Japan, every Dreamcast sold included a free year of Internet access, which Okawa personally paid for.  Prior to the launch of SegaNet, Sega had already offered a $200 rebate to any Dreamcast owner who purchased two years of Internet access from Sega.com.   To increase SegaNets appeal in the U.S., Sega dropped the price of the Dreamcast to $149 and offered a rebate for the full $149 price of a Dreamcast with every 18-month SegaNet subscription.           Moore stated that the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 million units in the U.S. by the end of 2000 in order to remain a viable platform, but Sega ultimately fell short of this goal with some 3 million units sold.  Moreover, Segas attempts to spur increased Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses.  Instead of an expected profit, for the six months ending September 2000, Sega posted a ¥17.98 billion loss, with the company projecting a year-end loss of ¥23.6 billion.  This estimate was more than doubled to ¥58.3 billion,  and in March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of ¥51.7 billion .  While the PS2s October 26 U.S. launch was marred by shortages—with only 500,000 of a planned 1 million units shipped due to a manufacturing glitch—this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected, as many disappointed consumers continued to wait for a PS2—while the PSone, a remodeled version of the original PlayStation, was the best-selling console in the U.S. at the start of the 2000 holiday season.   According to Moore, the PlayStation 2 effect that we were relying upon did not work for us  ... people will hang on for as long as possible  ... What effectively happened is the PlayStation 2 lack of availability froze the marketplace . Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the U.S. video game market, respectively, while Sega held only 15 percent. According to Bellfield, Dreamcast software sold at an 8-to-1 ratio with the hardware, but this ratio on a small install base didnt give us the revenue  ... to keep this platform viable in the medium to long term.        On May 22, 2000, Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega. Okawa had long advocated that Sega abandon the console business. His sentiments were not unique; Sega co-founder David Rosen had always felt it was a bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware , and Stolar had previously suggested that Sega should have sold their company to Microsoft.  In September 2000, in a meeting with Segas Japanese executives and the heads of the companys major Japanese game development studios, Moore and Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business and focus on software—prompting the studio heads to walk out.     Nevertheless, on January 31, 2001, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a platform-agnostic third-party developer.  The decision was Moores. Sega also announced a Dreamcast price reduction to $99 to eliminate its unsold inventory, which was estimated at 930,000 units as of April 2001.  After a further reduction to $79, the Dreamcast was cleared out of stores at $49.95.   The final Dreamcast unit manufactured was autographed by the heads of all nine of Segas internal game development studios as well as the heads of Visual Concepts and  |Wave_Master|Wave_Master|  and given away with 55 first-party Dreamcast games through a competition organized by  GamePro  magazine.  Okawa, who had previously loaned Sega $500 million in the summer of 1999, died on March 16, 2001; shortly before his death, he forgave Segas debts to him and returned his $695 million worth of Sega and CSK stock, helping the company survive the third-party transition.  As part of this restructuring, nearly one-third of Segas Tokyo workforce was laid off in 2001.      9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide. After the Dreamcasts discontinuation, commercial games were still developed and released for the system, particularly in Japan. In the United States, game releases continued until the end of the first half of 2002. Sega of Japan continued to repair Dreamcast units until 2007.  As of 2014, the console is still supported through various  |MIL_CD|Mil_Cd|  independent releases.  After five consecutive years of financial losses, Sega finally posted a profit for the fiscal year ending March 2003.      Reasons cited for the failure of the Dreamcast include hype for the PS2;   a lack of support from EA and  |Squaresoft|Square_Enix| , considered the most popular third-parties in the U.S. and Japan respectively;  disagreement among Sega executives over the companys future, and Okawas lack of commitment to the product; Segas lack of advertising money, with Bellfield doubting that Sega spent even half the $100 million it had pledged to promote the Dreamcast in the U.S.;  that the market was not yet ready for online gaming;  Segas focus on hardcore gamers over the mainstream consumer; and poor timing. Perhaps the most frequently cited reason is the damage to Segas reputation caused by several previous poorly supported Sega platforms.   Writing for GamePro, Blake Snow stated that the much beloved console launched years ahead of the competition but ultimately struggled to shed the negative reputation had gained during the Saturn, Sega 32X, and  |Sega_CD|Sega_Cd|  days. As a result, casual gamers and jaded third-party developers doubted Segas ability to deliver.  |Eurogamers|Eurogamer|  Dan Whitehead noted that the wait and see approach of consumers and the lack of support from EA were symptoms rather the cause of Segas decline, concluding Segas misadventures during the 1990s had left both gamers and publishers wary of any new platform bearing its name. According to  |1UP_coms|1Up_Com|  Jeremy Parish, While it would be easy to point an accusatory finger at Sony and blame them for killing the Dreamcast by overselling the PS2  ... theres a certain level of intellectual dishonesty in such a stance  ... poor U.S. support for hardware like the Sega CD, the 32X, and the Saturn made gamers gun shy. Many consumers felt burned after investing in expensive Sega machines and finding the resulting libraries comparatively lacking .     The announcement of Segas third-party transition was met with widespread enthusiasm. According to IGNs Travis Fahs, Sega was a creatively fertile company with a rapidly expanding stable of properties to draw from. It seemed like they were in a perfect position to start a new life as a developer/publisher. Former  |Working_Designs|Working_Designs|  president Victor Ireland wrote that Its actually a good thing  ... because now Sega will survive, doing what they do best: software. The staff of  Newsweek  remarked From Sonic to Shenmue, Segas programmers have produced some of the most engaging experiences in the history of interactive media  ... Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can do what they do best for any machine on the market .  Rosen predicted they have the potential to catch Electronic Arts .  Game Informer , commenting on Segas tendency to produce under-appreciated  |cult_classics|Cult_Classics| , stated: Let us rejoice in the fact that Sega is making games equally among the current console crop, so that history will not repeat itself.             Physically, the Dreamcast measures  and weighs . The Dreamcasts main CPU is a  |two_way|Symmetric_Multiprocessing|  360   |MIPS|Instructions_Per_Second| |_superscalar|Superscalar|  Hitachi  |SH_4|Superh| |_32_bit|32_Bit| |_RISC|Risc|   clocked at 200  MHz with an 8  |Kbyte|Kilobyte| |_instruction_cache|Cpu_Cache|  and 16 Kbyte data cache and a 128-bit graphics-oriented  |floating_point_unit|Floating_Point_Unit|  delivering 1.4   |GFLOPS|Gigaflops| . Its 100  MHz  |NEC_PowerVR2|Powervrseries2|  rendering engine, integrated with the systems  |ASIC|Application_Specific_Integrated_Circuit| , is capable of drawing more than 3 million polygons per second and of  |deferred_shading|Deferred_Shading| . Sega estimated that the Dreamcast was theoretically capable of rendering 7 million raw polygons per second, or 6 million with textures and lighting, but noted that game logic and physics reduce peak graphic performance. Graphics hardware effects include  |trilinear_filtering|Trilinear_Filtering| ,  |gouraud_shading|Gouraud_Shading| ,  |z_buffering|Z_Buffering| ,  |spatial_anti_aliasing|Spatial_Anti_Aliasing| ,  |per_pixel_translucency_sorting|Order_Independent_Transparency|  and  |bump_mapping|Bump_Mapping| . The system can  |output|Color_Depth|  approximately  |16_77_million_colors|24_Bit_Color|  simultaneously and displays  |interlaced|Interlaced_Video|  or  |progressive_scan|Progressive_Scan|  video at 640  ×  480  |video_resolution|Video_Resolution| . Its 67  MHz Yamaha AICA sound processor, with a 32-bit  |ARM7|Arm_Architecture|  RISC CPU core, can generate 64 voices with  |PCM|Pulse_Code_Modulation|  or  |ADPCM|Adaptive_Differential_Pulse_Code_Modulation| , providing ten times the performance of the Saturns sound system. The Dreamcast has 16  |MB|Megabyte|  main RAM, along with an additional 8 MB of RAM for graphic textures and 2 MB of RAM for sound. The system reads media using a 12x speed Yamaha GD-ROM Drive. In addition to Windows CE, the Dreamcast supports several Sega and  |middleware|Middleware| |application_programming_interfaces|Application_Programming_Interface| . In most regions, the Dreamcast included a removable modem for online connectivity, which was modular for future upgrades. The original Japanese model and all PAL models had a transfer rate of 33.6  kbit/s, while consoles sold in the US and in Japan after September 9, 1999 featured a  |56_kbit_s|56_Kbit_S_Line|  dial-up modem.              Sega constructed numerous Dreamcast models, most of which were exclusive to Japan. A refurbished Dreamcast known as the R7 was originally used as a network console in Japanese pachinko parlors. Another model, the Divers 2000 CX-1, possesses a shape similar to Sonics head and includes a television and software for teleconferencing. A  Hello Kitty  version, limited to 2000 units produced, was targeted at Japanese female gamers. Special editions were created for Seaman  and  Resident Evil Code: Veronica .  Color variations were sold through a service called Dreamcast Direct in Japan.   |Toyota|Toyota|  also offered special edition Dreamcast units at 160 of its dealers in Japan.  In North America, a limited edition black Dreamcast was released with a Sega Sports logo on the lid, which included matching Sega Sports-branded black controllers and two games.           The Dreamcast controller includes both an analog stick and a digital pad, four action buttons, and two analog triggers. The system has four ports for controller inputs, although it was bundled with only one controller. The design of the Dreamcasts controller, described by the staff of  Edge  as an ugly evolution of  |Saturns_3D_controller|Nights_Into_Dreams_Release| , was called that great by 1UP.coms Sam Kennedy and lame by Game Informer s Andy McNamara.  The staff of  |IGN|Ign|  wrote that unlike most controllers, Segas pad forces the users hands into an uncomfortable parallel position.  In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal backup memory, the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte  |memory_card|Memory_Card|  called the  |VMU|Vmu|  for data storage. The VMU features a small  |LCD|Liquid_Crystal_Display|  screen, audio output from a one-channel  |PWM|Pulse_Width_Modulation|  sound source,   |non_volatile_memory|Non_Volatile_Memory| , a directional pad, and four buttons.  The VMU can present game information, be used as a minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines.  For example, players use the VMU to call plays in NFL 2K or raise virtual pets in Sonic Adventure.   Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented effective implementation of many types of games in the past. After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controllers design, Segas engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. This slot was generally used for vibration packs providing  |force_feedback|Haptic_Technology|  like Segas Jump Pack and Performances Tremor Pack , although it could also be used for other peripherals including a microphone enabling voice control and player communication. Various third-party cards provide storage, and some contain the LCD screen addition.  |Iomega|Lenovoemc|  announced a Dreamcast-compatible  |zip_drive|Zip_Drive|  that could store up to 100 MB of data on removable discs, but it was never released.     Various third-party controllers from companies like  |Mad_Catz|Mad_Catz|  include additional buttons and other extra features; third-parties also manufactured arcade-style joysticks for fighting games, such as Agetechs Arcade Stick and Interacts Alloy Arcade Stick. Mad Catz and Agetec created racing wheels for racing games. Sega decided against releasing its official light gun in the U.S.,   but some third party light guns were available. The Dreamcast supports a Sega fishing reel and rod  |motion_controller|Motion_Controller|  and a keyboard for text entry. Although it was designed for fishing games such as  Sega Bass Fishing , Soul Calibur was playable with the fishing controller, which translated vertical and horizontal movements into on-screen swordplay in a manner that was retroactively cited as a predecessor to the  |Wii_Remote|Wii_Remote| . The Japanese Dreamcast port of Segas  Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram  supported a Twin Sticks peripheral, but the games American publisher,  |Activision|Activision| , opted not to release it in the U.S.  The Dreamcast could connect to  |SNKs|Snk_Playmore| |_Neo_Geo_Pocket_Color|Neo_Geo_Pocket_Color| , predating Nintendos  |GameCube–Game_Boy_Advance_link_cable|Nintendo_Gamecube–Game_Boy_Advance_Link_Cable| . Sega also produced the  |Dreameye|Dreameye| , a digital camera that could be connected to the Dreamcast and used to exchange pictures and participate in  |video_chat|Videotelephony|  over the systems Internet connection. Sega hoped developers would use the Dreameye for future software, as some later did with Sonys similar  |EyeToy|Eyetoy|  peripheral.  In addition, Sega investigated systems that would have allowed users to make telephone calls with the Dreamcast, and discussed with  |Motorola|Motorola|  the development of an Internet-enabled cell phone that would have used technology from the console to enable quick downloads of games and other data.      The console can supply video through several different accessories. The console came with  |A_V_cables|Rca_Connector| , considered at the time to be the standard for video and audio connectivity. Sega and various third parties also manufactured  |RF_modulator|Rf_Modulator|  connectors and  |S_Video|S_Video|  cables. A  |VGA_adapter|Dreamcast_Vga|  allows Dreamcast games to be played on  |computer_displays|Visual_Display_Unit|  or  |enhanced_definition_television|Enhanced_Definition_Television|  sets in  |480p|480P| .               Before the launch of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega announced the release of its  |New_Arcade_Operation_Machine_Idea|Sega_Naomi|  arcade board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the  |Sega_Model_3|Sega_Model_3| .  NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and a 160 Mbyte  |flash_ROM_board|Flash_Memory|  in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical  |home_conversions|Porting|  of  |arcade_games|Arcade_Game| . Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including  |Capcom|Capcom|  ,  |Tecmo|Tecmo|  ,  |Treasure|Treasure|  , and Sega itself .     In what has been called a brief moment of remarkable creativity , in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the companys top designers.  Studios included  |United_Game_Artists|United_Game_Artists|  ,  |Hitmaker|Sega_Am3|  ,  |Smilebit|Sega_Sports_R_D|  ,  |Overworks|Overworks|  ,  |Sega_AM2|Sega_Am2|  , and  |Sonic_Team|Sonic_Team|  . The others were  |Wow_Entertainment|Sega_Am3| , headed by Rikiya Nakagawa;  |Amusement_Vision|Amusement_Vision| , headed by  |Toshihiro_Nagoshi|Toshihiro_Nagoshi| ; and  |Sega_Rosso|Sega_Rosso| , headed by Kenji Sasaki. Visual Concepts was led by Greg Thomas and Segas audio studio,  |Wave_Master|Wave_Master| , was led by Yukifumi Makino. See  Segas design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process, resulting in games such as  Rez  ,     The Typing of the Dead  ,    Seaman ,  cf.   and  Segagaga  .  cf.  Sega also revived franchises from the Genesis era, such as  Ecco the Dolphin . Segas internal studios were consolidated starting in 2003, with Mizuguchi leaving the company following the merger of UGA with Sonic Team.  cf.  On July 22, 2003, Sega announced the merger of Sonic Team with UGA, Hitmaker with Sega Rosso, and Smilebit with Amusement Vision. See      UGA created the  |music_game|Music_Video_Game|   Space Channel 5 , in which players help a female outer space news reporter named Ulala fight aliens with groove energy by dancing. Intended for a female casual audience, Space Channel 5 is considered one of Segas most daring and beloved original properties, combining a defiantly retro and uplifting soundtrack with dazzling and colorful visual presentation—despite a lack of real gameplay substance.  Neither Space Channel 5 nor UGAs Rez were commercially successful, and Rez was only available in the U.S. market through a PS2 port released in limited quantities. Hitmakers arcade ports included Crazy Taxi—an  |open_world|Open_World|  arcade  |racing_game|Racing_Game|  known for its addictive gameplay, which sold over one million copies and has been frequently cited as one of the best Dreamcast games  —and  Virtua Tennis —which revitalized the tennis game genre with a simple two-button control scheme and use of minigames to test the players technique.  cf.  cf.  cf.  cf.   Smilebits  Jet Set Radio —in which players control a Tokyo-based gang of youthful, rebellious  |inline_skaters|Inline_Skating|  called the GGs , who use  |graffiti|Graffiti|  to claim territory from rival gangs while evading an oppressive police force—has been cited as a major example of Segas commitment to original game concepts during the Dreamcasts lifespan. Lauded for composer  |Hideki_Naganumas|Hideki_Naganuma|  punchy, psychedelic soundtrack incorporating elements of  |J_pop|J_Pop|  and  |electro_funk|Boogie|  as well as its message of self-expression and  |non_violent_dissent|Nonviolent_Resistance|  ,  the game also popularized  |cel_shaded|Cel_Shading|  graphics.  Despite wide praise for its style, some criticized Jet Set Radio s gameplay as mediocre, and it failed to meet Segas sales expectations.  cf.  cf.   Produced by  |Rieko_Kodama|Rieko_Kodama| ,  the Overworks-developed traditional  |role_playing_game|Role_Playing_Game|   Skies of Arcadia  was acclaimed for its surreal  |Jules_Verne|Jules_Verne| -inspired fantasy world of floating islands and sky pirates, charming protagonists, unique emphasis on the environmental properties of weapons, exciting airship battles, and memorable plot .  cf.  cf.  cf.       AM2 developed what Sega hoped would be the Dreamcasts  |killer_app|Killer_Application| ,  Shenmue , a revenge epic in the tradition of  |Chinese_cinema|Cinema_Of_China| .  The  |action_adventure|Action_Adventure_Game|  game involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his fathers murder,  but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of  |Yokosuka|Yokosuka_Kanagawa| , which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a  |simulated|Simulation_Video_Game|  day/night cycle with variable weather,  |non_player_characters|Non_Player_Character|  with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects , Shenmue went over budget and was rumored In 2011, Suzuki stated that the actual cost of Shenmue was $47 million: See  to have cost Sega over $50 million.  Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only  |one_sequel|Shenmue_Ii|  was ever released.  While Shenmue was lauded for its innovation, visuals and music, its critical reception was mixed; points of criticism included invisible walls which limited the players sense of freedom, boredom caused by the inability to progress without waiting for events scheduled to occur at specific times, excessive in-game cutscenes and a lack of challenge.  cf.  cf.  cf.  In a 2009 retrospective, IGNs then senior vice-president of content Peer Schneider, among others, criticized IGNs contemporary coverage of Shenmue, stating: Im as amazed today as I was back in 2000 when we gave it a 9.7. See  The game was defended by IGN UKs Martin Robinson: Shenmue s stupendously large canvas, its superlative evocation of a time and place that to date remains alien territory to videogames and its unfading beauty all ensure it classic status  ... the sweetest memory came just this year, when on a trip to Japan with my girlfriend I convinced her to come with me to Yokosuka, the port town that stars in the original game and is only an hours ride from central Tokyo. Its the ultimate Dreamcast fanboys pilgrimage, and as I took my first steps down Dobuita Street and recognized locations Id walked past countless times before—Kuritas Military Store, Marys Embroidery Store and the parking lot where Ryo honed his fighting skills—I couldnt help but go a little dewy eyed. According to Moore, Shenmue sold extremely well , but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcasts limited installed base. Shenmue II was completed for a much more reasonable sum , while Sato defended Shenmue as an investment will someday be recouped because the development advances we learned  ... can be applied to other games .  In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGNs Travis Fahs stated that the era wasnt as kind to as earlier years —citing F355 Challenge as an acclaimed arcade game that didnt do much at home , and  |Genkis|Genki|  port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors. cf.  For an alternative perspective, see  cf.  cf.  cf.  The Virtua Fighter series would experience a tremendous comeback with the universally acclaimed  Virtua Fighter 4 —which saw a console release exclusively on PS2.  cf.  cf.           As the first fully 3D  |platforming_game|Platform_Game|  starring Segas mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Teams Sonic Adventure was considered the centerpiece of the launch . Adventure garnered criticism for technical problems including erratic camera angles and glitches,   but was praised for its luscious  visuals, vast, twisting environments and iconic set pieces —including a segment in which Sonic runs down the side of a skyscraper —and has been described as the Sonic series creative apex.  However, it failed to catch on with players in nearly the way that  Mario 64  had done , perhaps due to a perceived lack of gameplay depth.  While  Sonic Adventure 2  was positively reviewed, the extent of its improvements over the original have been debated. See  cf.  cf.  Distinguished by its innovative use of multiple storylines with varied forms of play,  Adventure sold 2.5 million copies, making it the Dreamcasts best-selling game.  Sonic Team also developed the Dreamcasts first online game—ChuChu Rocket!—which was widely complimented for its addictive puzzle gameplay and frantic multiplayer matches,   cf.  cf.  and the critically successful music game  Samba de Amigo , which was noted for its expensive maracas peripheral and colorful aesthetic.  cf.  cf.   For a negative review, see  cf.  Perhaps the most influential of Sonic Teams Dreamcast releases was  Phantasy Star Online , the first online console RPG. Developed after Okawa requested an online game from Sonic Team, PSO was heavily influenced by the PC  |action_RPG|Action_Role_Playing_Game|   Diablo , but refined and simplified its style of gameplay to appeal to console audiences.   cf.  cf.      In sports, Visual Concepts  NFL 2K  football series and its  NBA 2K  basketball series were critically acclaimed.  cf.  cf.  cf.  NFL 2K was considered an outstanding launch game for its high-quality visuals  cf.  and insightful, context-friendly, and, yes, even funny  |commentary|Sports_Commentator|  , while NFL 2K1 featured groundbreaking online multiplayer earlier than its chief competitor, EAs  Madden NFL  series. Madden and 2K continued to compete on other platforms through 2004—with the 2K series introducing innovations such as a  |first_person_perspective|First_Person|  new to the genre,  and eventually launching  ESPN NFL 2K5  at the aggressively low price point of $19.95—until EA signed an exclusive agreement with the  |National_Football_League|National_Football_League| , effectively putting every other pro-football game out of business.   After Sega sold Visual Concepts for $24 million in 2005, the NBA 2K series continued with publisher  |Take_Two_Interactive|Take_Two_Interactive| .  During the Dreamcasts lifespan, Visual Concepts also collaborated with  Sonic the Hedgehog  level designer  |Hirokazu_Yasuhara|Hirokazu_Yasuhara|  on the action-adventure game  Floigan Bros.   cf.  and developed the critically successful  |action_game|Action_Game|   Ooga Booga .      To appeal to the European market, Sega formed a French affiliate called  |No_Cliché|No_Cliché| , which developed games such as  Toy Commander . cf.  cf.  Sega Europe also approached  |Bizarre_Creations|Bizarre_Creations|   to develop the critically successful racing game  Metropolis Street Racer , which featured detailed recreations of London, Tokyo, and San Francisco—complete with consistent  |time_zones|Time_Zone|  and fictional  |radio_stations|Radio_Broadcasting| —and 262 individual  |race_tracks|Race_Tracks| .  cf.  cf.       Although  |Acclaim|Acclaim_Entertainment| , SNK,  |Ubisoft|Ubisoft| , Midway, Activision,  |Infogrames|Infogrames| , and Capcom supported the system during its first year, third-party developer support proved difficult to obtain due to the failure of the Sega Saturn and the profitability of publishing for the PlayStation. Namcos Soul Calibur, for example, was released for the Dreamcast because of the relative unpopularity of the  Soul  series at the time; Namcos more successful  Tekken  franchise was associated with the PlayStation console and PlayStation-based arcade boards. Nevertheless, Soul Calibur received overwhelming critical acclaim  and has been frequently described as one of the best games for the system. Capcom produced a number of fighting games for the system, including the  Power Stone  series, in addition to a temporary exclusive in the popular  Resident Evil  series called Resident Evil Code: Veronica.   The Dreamcast is also known for several  |shoot_em_ups|Shoot_Em_Up| , most notably Treasures  Bangai-O  and Ikaruga.      In January 2000, three months after the systems North American launch,  Electronic Gaming Monthly  offered praise for the game library, stating, ...with triple-A stuff like Soul Calibur, NBA 2K, and soon Crazy Taxi to kick around, we figure youre happy you took the 128-bit plunge.  In a retrospective,  PC Magazine  s Jeffrey L. Wilson referred to Dreamcasts killer library and emphasized Segas creative influence and visual innovation as being at its peak during the lifetime of the system. The staff of  Edge  agreed with this assessment on Dreamcasts original games, as well as Segas arcade conversions, stating that the system delivered the first games that could meaningfully be described as arcade perfect. GamePro writer Blake Snow referred to the library as being much celebrated . Damien McFerran of  Retro Gamer  praised Dreamcasts NAOMI arcade ports, opining The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again.  |Nick_Montfort|Nick_Montfort|  and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, argued that the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of videogame development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as  |avant_garde|Avant_Garde|   ... it is hard to imagine a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have. 1UP.coms Jeremy Parish favorably compared Segas Dreamcast output, which included some of the most varied, creative, and fun the company had ever produced , with its enervated status as a third-party. Fahs noted The Dreamcasts life was fleeting, but it was saturated with memorable titles, most of which were completely new properties. According to author  |Steven_L_Kent|Steven_L_Kent| , From Sonic Adventure and Shenmue to Space Channel 5 and Seaman, Dreamcast delivered and delivered and delivered.        In December 1999,  Next Generation  rated the Dreamcast 4 out of 5 stars and stated, If you want the most powerful system available now, showcasing the best graphics at a reasonable price, this system is for you. However, Next Generation rated the Dreamcasts future prognosis as 3 stars out of 5 in the same article, noting that Sony would ship a superior hardware product in the PlayStation 2 in the next year, and that Nintendo had said it would do the same with the GameCube.  At the beginning of 2000, Electronic Gaming Monthly had five reviewers score the Dreamcast 8.5, 8.5, 8.5, 8.0, and 9.0 out of 10 points.  By 2001, the reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Dreamcast scores of 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, and 9.5 out of 10.   BusinessWeek  recognized the Dreamcast as one of the best products of 1999.      In 2009, IGN named the Dreamcast the 8th greatest video game console of all time, giving credit to the innovations and software for the system. According to IGN, The Dreamcast was the first console to incorporate a built-in modem for online play, and while the networking lacked the polish and refinement of its successors, it was the first time users could seamlessly power on and play with users around the globe.  In 2010, PC Magazine s Jeffrey L. Wilson named the Dreamcast the greatest video game console, emphasizing that the system was gone too soon .  In 2013, Edge named the Dreamcast the 10th best console of the last 20 years, highlighting innovations that it added to console video gaming, including in-game voice chat, downloadable content, and second screen technology through the use of VMUs. Edge explained the systems poor performance by stating, Segas console was undoubtedly ahead of its time, and it suffered at retail for that reason... t its influence can still be felt today.  Writing in  1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die , Duncan Harris noted One of the reasons that older gamers mourned the loss of the Dreamcast was that it signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture  ... Segas console gave hope that things were not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games.  Parish, writing for  |USgamer|Usgamer| , contrasted the Dreamcasts diverse library with the suffocating sense of conservatism that pervaded the gaming industry in the following decade.  Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, discussing the Dreamcasts portrayal as a small, square, white plastic  |JFK|John_F_Kennedy|  , commented that the systems short lifespan may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever : Nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise . According to IGNs Travis Fahs, Many hardware manufacturers have come and gone, but its unlikely any will go out with half as much class as Sega.
