Shearer was born December 23, 1943, in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , the son of Dora Warren , a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer. His parents were  |Jew|Jew| ish emigrants from Austria and Poland.   Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a childrens agent, since she knew people in the business through her daughters work. The teacher asked Shearers parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearers parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show  The Jack Benny Program . Shearer received the role when he was seven years old.  He described  |Jack_Benny|Jack_Benny|  as very warm and approachable ... He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy. Shearer said in an interview that one person who took him under his wing and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor  |Mel_Blanc|Mel_Blanc| , who voiced many animated characters, including  |Bugs_Bunny|Bugs_Bunny| ,  |Daffy_Duck|Daffy_Duck|  and  |Barney_Rubble|Barney_Rubble| .  Shearer made his film debut in the film  Abbott and Costello Go to Mars  , in which he had a small part, and appeared in  The Robe  . Throughout his childhood and teenage years he worked in television, film, and radio.  In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the  |Eddie_Haskell|Eddie_Haskell|  character in the pilot episode of the television series  Leave It to Beaver . After the filming, Shearers parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.     Shearer attended  |UCLA|University_Of_California_Los_Angeles|  as a political science major in the early 1960s and decided to quit show business to become a serious person . However, he says this lasted approximately a month, and he joined the staff of the  Daily Bruin , UCLAs school newspaper, during his first year. He was editor of the college humor magazine , including the June 1964 parody Preyboy.  He also worked as a newscaster at  |KRLA|Krdc_Krla| , a top 40 radio station in Pasadena, during this period. According to Shearer, after graduating, he had a very serious agenda going on, and it was Stay Out of the Draft. He attended  |graduate_school|Graduate_School|  at  |Harvard_University|Harvard_University|  for one year and worked at the state legislature in  |Sacramento|Sacramento| . In 1967 and 1968, he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following disagreements with the administration .     From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of  |The_Credibility_Gap|The_Credibility_Gap| , a radio comedy group that included  |David_Lander|David_Lander| ,  |Richard_Beebe|Richard_Beebe|  and  |Michael_McKean|Michael_Mckean| .  The group consisted of a bunch of newsmen at  |KRLA_1110|Krdc_Krla| , the number two station in Los Angeles. They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. He found out he was hired that same day. The groups radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by  |KPPC_FM|Kppc_Fm| , so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues. While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed  |Creedence_Clearwater_Revival|Creedence_Clearwater_Revival|  for the  Pop Chronicles  music documentary.  In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on  How Time Flys , an album by  |The_Firesign_Theatres|The_Firesign_Theatre| |_David_Ossman|David_Ossman| . The Credibility Gap broke up in 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom  Laverne & Shirley . Shearer started working with  |Albert_Brooks|Albert_Brooks| , producing one of Brooks albums and co-writing the film  Real Life  . Shearer also started writing for  |Martin_Mulls|Martin_Mull|  television series  Fernwood 2 Night . In the mid-1970s, he started working with  |Rob_Reiner|Rob_Reiner|  on a pilot for  |ABC|American_Broadcasting_Company| . The show, which starred  |Christopher_Guest|Christopher_Guest| ,  |Tom_Leopold|Tom_Leopold|  and McKean, was not picked up.       Saturday Night Live Saturday Night Live , one of the first additions to the cast, and an unofficial replacement for  |John_Belushi|John_Belushi|  and  |Dan_Aykroyd|Dan_Aykroyd| , who were both leaving the show.   |Al_Franken|Al_Franken|  recommended Shearer to Saturday Night Live creator  |Lorne_Michaels|Lorne_Michaels| .  Shearer describes his experience on the show as a living hell and not a real pleasant place to work. He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer.  Michaels left Saturday Night Live at the end of the fifth season, taking the entire cast with him.  Shearer told new executive producer  |Jean_Doumanian|Jean_Doumanian|  that he was not a fan of Lornes and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.           In 1984, while promoting the film  This Is Spinal Tap , Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean performed on Saturday Night Live. All three members were offered the chance to join the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he didnt realize that guests are treated better than the regulars.  Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994.  |Dick_Ebersol|Dick_Ebersol| , who replaced Lorne Michaels as the shows producer, said that Shearer was a gifted performer but a pain in the butt. Hes just so demanding on the preciseness of things and hes very, very hard on the working people. Hes just a nightmare-to-deal-with person.  In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because he felt he was not being used enough.   |Martin_Short|Martin_Short|  said Shearer wanted to be creative and Dick wanted something else. ... I think he felt his voice wasnt getting represented on the show. When he wouldnt get that chance, it made him very upset.        Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in  |Rob_Reiners|Rob_Reiner|  film  This Is Spinal Tap  . Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest received a deal to write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what they wanted to do. It was eventually greenlighted by  |Norman_Lear|Norman_Lear|  and  |Jerry_Perenchio|Jerry_Perenchio|  at  |Embassy_Pictures|Embassy_Pictures| . The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of  |hard_rock|Hard_Rock|  and  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music|  bands, as well as the  |hagiographic|Hagiography|  tendencies of  |rockumentaries|Rockumentary|  of the time. The three core members of the band  |Spinal_Tap|Spinal_Tap| — |David_St_Hubbins|David_St_Hubbins| ,  |Derek_Smalls|Derek_Smalls|  and  |Nigel_Tufnel|Nigel_Tufnel| —were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed. It was filmed in 25 days.     Shearer said in an interview that The animating impulse was to do rock n roll right. The four of us had been around rock n roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right. When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, No, this is a story thats pretty familiar to people. Were not introducing them to anything they dont really know, so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and developed a  |cult_following|Cult_Following| , after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the  |American_Film_Institutes|American_Film_Institute| |_list_of_the_top_100_comedy_movies_in_American_cinema|Afis_100_Years_100_Laughs|   and it was selected for preservation in the United States  |National_Film_Registry|National_Film_Registry|  by the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress|  as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant .      Shearer, Guest and McKean have since worked on several projects as their Spinal Tap characters. They released three albums:  This Is Spinal Tap  ,  Break Like the Wind  and  Back from the Dead  .  In 1992, Spinal Tap appeared in an episode of The Simpsons called  |The_Otto_Show|The_Otto_Show|  .  The band has played several concerts, including at  |Live_Earth|Live_Earth|  in London on July 7, 2007. In anticipation of the show, Rob Reiner directed a short film entitled Spinal Tap.  In 2009, the band released Back from the Dead to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of the film.  The album features re-recorded versions of songs featured in This Is Spinal Tap and its soundtrack, and five new songs.   The band performed a one-date world tour at Londons  |Wembley_Arena|Wembley_Arena|  on June 30, 2009.  |The_Folksmen|The_Folksmen| , a mock band featured in the film  A Mighty Wind  that is also made up of characters played by Shearer, McKean and Guest, was the opening act for the show.      The SimpsonsThe Simpsons.  |Matt_Groening|Matt_Groening| , the creator of the show, was a fan of Shearers work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write.  Shearer was asked if he wanted to be in the series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble. He felt voice acting was not a lot of fun because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately. He was told that the actors would record their lines together and after three calls, executive producer  |James_L_Brooks|James_L_Brooks|  managed to convince Shearer to join the cast.  Shearers first impression of The Simpsons was that it was funny. Shearer, who thought it was a pretty cool way to work, found it peculiar that the members of the cast were adamant about not being known to the public as the people behind the voices.     Shearer provides voices for  |Principal_Skinner|Principal_Skinner| ,  |Kent_Brockman|Kent_Brockman| ,  |Mr_Burns|Mr_Burns| ,  |Waylon_Smithers|Waylon_Smithers| ,  |Ned_Flanders|Ned_Flanders| ,  |Reverend_Lovejoy|Reverend_Timothy_Lovejoy| ,  |Dr_Hibbert|Julius_Hibbert| ,  |Lenny_Leonard|Lenny_Leonard| ,  |Otto_Mann|Otto_Mann| ,  |Rainier_Wolfcastle|Rainier_Wolfcastle| ,  |Scratchy|The_Itchy_Scratchy_Show| ,  |Kang|Kang_And_Kodos| ,  |Dr_Marvin_Monroe|Dr_Marvin_Monroe| , and  |Judge_Snyder|Judge_Snyder| , among others. He has described all of his regular characters voices as easy to slip into. ... I wouldnt do them if they werent easy. Shearer modeled Mr. Burnss voice on the two actors  |Lionel_Barrymore|Lionel_Barrymore|  and  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan| .  Shearer says that Burns is the most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice.  He describes Burns as his favorite character, saying he like Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people make the mistake of diluting it. Never adulterate your evil.  Shearer is also the voice of Burns assistant  |Smithers|Waylon_Smithers| , and is able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. In the episode Barts Inner Child , Harry Shearer said wow in the voice of Otto, which was then used when Otto was seen jumping on a trampoline. Jean, Al .

Ned Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that  |Homer|Homer_Simpson|  was jealous of, but because Shearer used such a sweet voice for him, Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer.

Commentary for  |Some_Enchanted_Evening|Some_Enchanted_Evening|  , in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season 20th Century Fox.     In 2004, Shearer criticized what he perceived as the shows declining quality: I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so  |season_four|The_Simpsons|  looks very good to me now.  Shearer has also been vocal about  |The_Principal_and_the_Pauper|The_Principal_And_The_Pauper|  , one of the most controversial episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that  |Principal_Seymour_Skinner|Principal_Seymour_Skinner| , a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, Thats so wrong. Youre taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story weve done before with other characters. Its so arbitrary and gratuitous, and its disrespectful to the audience.  Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in  The Simpsons Ride , which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all.  In a 2010 interview on  The Howard Stern Show , Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.      Until 1998, Shearer was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.  The dispute was resolved a month later,  and Shearers pay rose to $250,000 per episode.  After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received $400,000 per episode.  Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30% pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.  On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made a statement from the producers saying the show must go on, but did not elaborate on what might happen to the characters Shearer voiced.  On July 7, 2015, Shearer agreed to continue with the show, on the same terms as the other voice actors.      Le Show and radio work     Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program  Le Show . The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the mega morons of the mighty media .  It is carried on many  |National_Public_Radio|National_Public_Radio|  and other public radio stations throughout the United States.  Since the merger of  |SIRIUS|Sirius_Satellite_Radio|  and  |XM|Xm_Public_Radio|  satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either.  . The show has also been made available as a  |podcast|Podcast|  on  |iTunes|Itunes|   and by  |WWNO|Wwno| . On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on the news of the day after the manner of  |Mort_Sahl|Mort_Sahl| , and performing original comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President  |George_W_Bush|George_W_Bush|  on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both  |Republicans|Republican|  and  |Democrats|Democrat|  equally, and also says that the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place  and that everyone else is just running around talking. They are the ones who are actually doing something, changing peoples lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls satirists dont work that way.      Since encountering satellite news feeds when he worked on Saturday Night Live, Shearer has been fascinated with the contents of the video that does not air. Shearer refers to these clips as  |found_objects|Found_Object| . I thought, wow, there is just an unending supply of this material, and its wonderful and fascinating and funny and sometimes haunting – but its always good, said Shearer. He collects this material and uses it on Le Show   and on his website.  In 2008, he assembled video clips of newsmakers from this collection into an art installation titled The Silent Echo Chamber which was exhibited at  |The_Aldrich_Contemporary_Art_Museum|The_Aldrich_Contemporary_Art_Museum|  in  |Ridgefield_Connecticut|Ridgefield_Connecticut| . The exhibit was also displayed in 2009 at Institut Valencià dArt Modern in  |Valencia_Spain|Valencia_Spain|    . and in 2010 at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center.      In 2006 Shearer appeared with  |Brian_Hayes|Brian_Hayes|  in four episodes of the  |BBC_Radio_4|Bbc_Radio_4|  sitcom  Not Today, Thank You , playing Nostrils, a man so ugly he cannot stand to be in his own presence.  He was originally scheduled to appear in all six episodes but had to withdraw from recording two due to a problem with his work permit.  On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category.           Shearers first feature film as director  Teddy Bears Picnic , which he also wrote, was released in 2002. The plot is based on  |Bohemian_Grove|Bohemian_Grove| , which hosts a three-week encampment of some of the most powerful men in the world. The film was not well received by critics. It garnered a 0% approval rating on  |Rotten_Tomatoes|Rotten_Tomatoes| , with all 19 reviews being determined as negative  and received a rating of 32 out of 100 on  |Metacritic|Metacritic|  from 10 reviews.  In 2003, he co-wrote J. Edgar! The Musical with  |Tom_Leopold|Tom_Leopold| , which spoofed  |J_Edgar_Hoovers|J_Edgar_Hoover|  relationship with  |Clyde_Tolson|Clyde_Tolson| .  It premiered at the  |U_S_Comedy_Arts_Festival|The_Comedy_Festival|  in  |Aspen_Colorado|Aspen_Colorado|  and starred  |Kelsey_Grammer|Kelsey_Grammer|  and  |John_Goodman|John_Goodman| .       Shearer, Guest and McKean starred in the  |folk_music|Folk_Music| |_mockumentary|Mockumentary|   A Mighty Wind  , portraying a band called The Folksmen. The film was written by Guest and  |Eugene_Levy|Eugene_Levy| , and directed by Guest. Shearer had a major role in the Guest-directed parody of Oscar politicking  For Your Consideration  released in 2006. He played Victor Allan Miller, a veteran actor who is convinced that he is going to be nominated for an  |Academy_Award|Academy_Award| .  He also appeared as a news anchor in  Godzilla  with fellow The Simpsons cast members  |Hank_Azaria|Hank_Azaria|  and  |Nancy_Cartwright|Nancy_Cartwright| .  His other film appearances include  The Right Stuff  ,  The Fisher King  ,  The Truman Show  ,  Small Soldiers  , and  EdTV  . He also directed and appeared in the television programme Portrait of a White Marriage , a sequel to  The History of White People in America .     Shearer has also worked as a columnist for the  Los Angeles Times Magazine , but decided that it became such a waste of time to bother with it. His columns have also been published in  Slate  and  Newsweek .  Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at  The Huffington Post .  Shearer has written three books. Man Bites Town, published in 1993, is a collection of columns that he wrote for The Los Angeles Times between 1989 and 1992. Published in 1999, Its the Stupidity, Stupid analyzed the hatred some people had for then-President  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton| .  Shearer believes that Clinton became disliked because he had an affair with the least powerful, least credentialed women cleared into his official compound. His most recent book is Not Enough Indians, his first novel. Published in 2006, it is a comic novel about Native Americans and gambling. Without the pleasures of collaboration and spontaneity and improvisation which characterize his other projects , Not Enough Indians was a struggle for Shearer to write. He said that the only fun thing about it was having written it. It was lonely, I had no deal for it and it took six years to do. It was a profoundly disturbing act of self-discipline.     Shearer has released five solo comedy albums: It Must Have Been Something I Said , Dropping Anchors , Songs Pointed and Pointless , Songs of the Bushmen and Greed and Fear .  His most recent CD, Greed and Fear is mainly about  |Wall_Street|Wall_Street|  economic issues, rather than politics like his previous albums. Shearer decided to make the album when he started getting amused by the language of the economic meltdown – when toxic assets suddenly became troubled assets, going from something poisoning the system to just a bunch of delinquent youth with dirty faces that needed not removal from the system but just ... understanding.  In May 2006, Shearer received an honorary doctorate from  |Goucher_College|Goucher_College| .      The Big Uneasy The Big Uneasy  , a documentary film about the impacts of  |Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane_Katrina|  on  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans| .

The film is critical of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its management of  |flood_protection|Flood_Protection| |_projects|Projects|  in Southern  |Louisiana|Louisiana| .      Shearer draws on numerous technical experts to maintain that Hurricane Katrinas ... tragic floods creating widespread damage were caused by manmade errors in engineering and judgment.
