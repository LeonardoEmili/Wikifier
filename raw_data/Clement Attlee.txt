                 Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee,   was a British politician who served as  |Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  from 1945 to 1951 and  |Leader_of_the_Labour_Party|Leader_Of_The_Labour_Party|  from 1935 to 1955. He was twice  |Leader_of_the_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition|  .     The son of a London  |solicitor|Solicitor| , Attlee was born into an upper-middle-class family. After attending private schools and the  |University_of_Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| , he practised as a  |barrister|Barristers_In_England_And_Wales| . The volunteer work he carried out in  |Londons_East_End|East_End_Of_London|  exposed him to poverty and his political views shifted leftwards thereafter. He joined the  |Independent_Labour_Party|Independent_Labour_Party| , gave up his legal career, and began lecturing at the  |London_School_of_Economics|London_School_Of_Economics| . His work was interrupted by service as an officer in the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . In 1919, he became mayor of  |Stepney|Stepney|  and in  |1922|1922_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  was elected  |Member_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  for  |Limehouse|Limehouse| . Attlee served in the  |first_Labour_minority_government|First_Macdonald_Ministry|  led by  |Ramsay_MacDonald|Ramsay_Macdonald|  in 1924, and then joined the Cabinet during  |MacDonalds_second_minority|Second_Macdonald_Ministry|  . After retaining his seat in Labours landslide defeat of  |1931|1931_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , he became the partys  |Deputy_Leader|Deputy_Leader_Of_The_Labour_Party| .  |Elected_Leader_of_the_Labour_Party|1935_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  in 1935, and at first advocating  |pacificism|Pacificism|  and opposing  |re-armament|British_Re-Armament| , he became a critic of  |Neville_Chamberlains|Neville_Chamberlain| |appeasement|Appeasement|  of  |Hitler|Hitler|  and  |Mussolini|Mussolini|  in the lead-up to the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| . Attlee took Labour into the  |wartime_coalition_government|Churchill_War_Ministry|  in 1940 and served under  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| , initially as  |Lord_Privy_Seal|Lord_Privy_Seal|  and then as  |Deputy_Prime_Minister|Deputy_Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  from 1942.     After the end of the war, the coalition was dissolved and Attlee led Labour to a landslide victory at the  |1945_general_election|1945_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , forming the  |first_Labour_majority_government|Attlee_Ministry| . His governments  |Keynesian_approach_to_economic_management|Keynesian_Economics|  aimed to maintain  |full_employment|Full_Employment| , a  |mixed_economy|Mixed_Economy|  and a greatly enlarged system of social services provided by the state. To this end, it undertook the  |nationalisation|Nationalisation|  of public utilities and major industries, and implemented wide-ranging social reforms, including the passing of the  |National_Insurance_Act_1946|National_Insurance_Act_1946|  and  |National_Assistance_Act|National_Assistance_Act_1948| , the foundation of the  |National_Health_Service|National_Health_Service|  and the enlargement of public subsidies for  |council_house|Council_House|  building. His government also reformed  |trade_union|Trade_Unions_In_The_United_Kingdom|  legislation, working practices and childrens services; it created the  |National_Parks|National_Parks_Of_England_And_Wales|  system, passed the  |New_Towns_Act_1946|New_Towns_Act_1946|  and established the  |town_and_country_planning_system|Town_And_Country_Planning_In_The_United_Kingdom| .     In foreign policy, Attlee delegated to  |Ernest_Bevin|Ernest_Bevin| , but oversaw the  |partition_of_India|Partition_Of_India|  , the independence of Burma and Ceylon, and the dissolution of the British mandates of  |Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine|  and  |Transjordan|Emirate_Of_Transjordan| . He and Bevin encouraged the United States to take a vigorous role in the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| ; unable to afford military intervention in Greece, he called on Washington to counter Communists there, establishing the  |Truman_Doctrine|Truman_Doctrine| . Bullock, Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary ch 8 He supported the  |Marshall_Plan|Marshall_Plan|  to rebuild Western Europe with American money and, in 1949, promoted the  |NATO|Nato|  military alliance against the  |Soviet_bloc|Soviet_Bloc| . After leading Labour to a narrow victory at the  |1950_general_election|1950_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , he sent British troops to fight in the  |Korean_War|Korean_War| .     Attlee had inherited a country close to bankruptcy after the Second World War and beset by food, housing and resource shortages; despite his social reforms and economic programme, these problems persisted throughout his premiership, alongside recurrent currency crises and dependence on US aid. His party was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives in the  |1951_general_election|1951_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , despite winning the most votes. He continued as Labour leader but retired after losing the  |1955_election|1955_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  and was elevated to the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords| ; after a long retirement, he died in 1967. In public, he was modest and unassuming, but behind the scenes his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. Often rated as one of the  |greatest_British_prime_ministers|Historical_Rankings_Of_Prime_Ministers_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , Attlees reputation among scholars has grown, thanks to his creation of the modern  |welfare_state|Welfare_State|  and involvement in building the coalition against  |Stalin|Stalin|  in the Cold War. He remains the longest-serving Labour leader in British history.       Attlee was born on 3 January 1883 in  |Putney|Putney| ,  |Surrey|Surrey|  , into a  |middle-class|Middle-Class|  family, the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee , a  |solicitor|Solicitor| , and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson , daughter of Thomas Simons Watson, secretary for the  |Art_Union_of_London|Art_Union_Of_London| . Davies, Edward J. The Ancestry of Clement Attlee , Genealogists Magazine, 31: 380–87. He was educated at Northaw School, a boys preparatory school near  |Pluckley|Pluckley|  in  |Kent|Kent| ;  |Haileybury_College|Haileybury_College| ; and  |University_College,_Oxford|University_College,_Oxford| , where in 1904 he graduated as a  |Bachelor_of_Arts|Bachelor_Of_Arts|  with  |second-class_honours|British_Undergraduate_Degree_Classification|  in  |modern_history|Modern_History| .     Attlee then trained as a  |barrister|Barrister|  at the  |Inner_Temple|Inner_Temple|  and was  |called_to_the_bar|Call_To_The_Bar|  in March 1906. He worked for a time at his fathers law firm Druces and Attlee but did not enjoy the work, and had no particular ambition to succeed in the legal profession. He also played football for  |non-League|Non-League_Football|  club  |Fleet|Fleet_Town_F.C.| .  Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2015       In 1906, he became a volunteer at Haileybury House, a charitable club for  |working-class|Working-Class|  boys in  |Stepney|Stepney|  in the  |East_End_of_London|East_End_Of_London|  run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the clubs manager. Until then, his political views had been more  |conservative|Conservative| . However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the  |slum|Slum|  children, he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and  |income_redistribution|Income_Redistribution|  by the state would have any serious effect. This sparked a process that caused him to convert to  |socialism|Socialism| . He subsequently joined the  |Independent_Labour_Party|Independent_Labour_Party|  in 1908 and became active in local politics. In 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ILP candidate for Stepney Borough Council.     He also worked briefly as a secretary for  |Beatrice_Webb|Beatrice_Webb|  in 1909, before becoming a secretary for  |Toynbee_Hall|Toynbee_Hall| . In 1911, he was employed by the  |UK_Government|Uk_Government|  as an official explainer —touring the country to explain  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| |David_Lloyd_Georges|David_Lloyd_George| |National_Insurance_Act|National_Insurance_Act| . He spent the summer of that year touring  |Essex|Essex|  and  |Somerset|Somerset|  on a bicycle, explaining the act at public meetings. A year later, he became a  |lecturer|Lecturer|  at the  |London_School_of_Economics|London_School_Of_Economics| .       Following the outbreak of the  |First_World_War|World_War_I|  in August 1914, Attlee applied to join the  |British_Army|British_Army| . Initially his application was turned down, as at age 31 he was seen as too old; however, he was finally allowed to join in September, and was commissioned London Gazette issue 28985, published 24 November 1914. Page 5 in the rank of  |Captain|Captain|  with the 6th Battalion,  |South_Lancashire_Regiment|South_Lancashire_Regiment| , part of the  |38th_Brigade|38Th_Brigade|  of the  |13th_Division|13Th_Division| , and was sent to fight in the  |Gallipoli_Campaign|Gallipoli_Campaign|  in  |Turkey|Ottoman_Empire| . His decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom, who, as a  |conscientious_objector|Conscientious_Objector| , spent much of the war in prison.     After a period fighting in Gallipoli, he collapsed after falling ill with  |dysentery|Dysentery|  and was put on a ship bound for  |England|England|  to recover. When he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in  |Malta|Malta|  where he stayed in hospital to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the  |Battle_of_Sari_Bair|Battle_Of_Sari_Bair| , which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the  |evacuation_of_Suvla|Gallipoli_Campaignevacuation| . As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from  |Suvla_Bay|Landing_At_Suvla_Bay| , the last being General  |Stanley_Maude|Stanley_Maude| .      The Gallipoli Campaign had been engineered by the  |First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty|First_Lord_Of_The_Admiralty| ,  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| . Although it was unsuccessful, Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been a success if it had been better implemented on the ground. This gave him an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, which would make their working relationship in later years productive.     He later served in the  |Mesopotamian_Campaign|Mesopotamian_Campaign|  in what is now  |Iraq|Iraq| , where in April 1916 he was badly wounded, being hit in the leg by  |shrapnel|Shrapnel_Shell|  while storming an enemy trench during the Battle of Hanna. He was sent firstly to  |India|British_India| , and then back to the UK to recover. In February 1917, he was promoted to the rank of  |Major|Major| , London Gazette Issue 30425, published 11 December 1917 leading him to be known as Major Attlee for much of the  |inter-war_period|Interwar_Period| . He would spend most of 1917 training soldiers at various locations in England. From 2 to 9 July 1917, he was the temporary commanding officer of the newly formed L Battalion, the  |Tank_Corps|Royal_Tank_Regiment|  at Bovington Camp,  |Dorset|Dorset| . From 9 July, he assumed command of 30th Company of the same battalion however he did not deploy to France with it in December 1917. The National Archive WO 95/101 War History of 10th Battalion, Tank Corps, pp. 1–2.     After fully recovering from his injuries, he was sent to France in June 1918 to serve on the  |Western_Front|Western_Front|  for the final months of the war. After being discharged from the Army in January 1919, he returned to  |Stepney|Stepney| , and returned to his old job lecturing part-time at the  |London_School_of_Economics|London_School_Of_Economics| .       Attlee met  |Violet_Millar|Violet_Attlee|  while on a long trip with friends to Italy in 1921. They bonded immediately Bew, John Citizen Clem, Riverrun, p. 115 and were soon engaged, marrying at  |Christ_Church,_Hampstead|Christ_Church,_Hampstead| , on 10 January 1922. It would come to be a devoted marriage, with Attlee providing protection and Violet providing a home that was an escape for Attlee from political turmoil. She died in 1964. Bew, Clement Attlee pp 115–18. They had four children:   Lady Janet Helen ,  she married Harold Shipton at  |Ellesborough|Ellesborough|  Parish Church in 1947.    Lady Felicity Ann , married John Harwood at  |Little_Hampden|Little_Hampden|  in 1955     |Martin_Richard,_Viscount_Prestwood,_later_2nd_Earl_Attlee|Martin_Attlee,_2Nd_Earl_Attlee|    Lady Alison Elizabeth ,  married Richard Davis at  |Great_Missenden|Great_Missenden|  in 1952.            Attlee returned to  |local_politics|Local_Government|  in the immediate  |post-war_period|Interwar_Period| , becoming mayor of the  |Metropolitan_Borough_of_Stepney|Metropolitan_Borough_Of_Stepney| , one of Londons most deprived inner-city boroughs, in 1919. During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle  |slum|Slum| |landlords|Landlord|  who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.     In 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, The Social Worker, which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30: In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community. , archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.     and went on to say at page 75: Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipients character, and terminable at his caprice. , archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.     In 1921,  |George_Lansbury|George_Lansbury| , the Labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of  |Poplar|Metropolitan_Borough_Of_Poplar| , and future Labour Party leader, launched the  |Poplar_Rates_Rebellion|Poplar_Rates_Rebellion| ; a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. Attlee, who was a personal friend of Lansbury, strongly supported this. However,  |Herbert_Morrison|Herbert_Morrison| , the Labour mayor of nearby  |Hackney|Metropolitan_Borough_Of_Hackney| , and one of the main figures in the  |London_Labour_Party|London_Labour_Party| , strongly denounced Lansbury and the rebellion. During this period, Attlee developed a lifelong dislike of Morrison. Howell, David. Attlee , Haus Publishing; .        At the  |1922_general_election|1922_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Attlee became the Member of Parliament for the  |constituency|Constituency|  of  |Limehouse|Limehouse|  in  |Stepney|Stepney| . At the time, he admired  |Ramsay_MacDonald|Ramsay_Macdonald|  and helped him get elected as Labour Party leader at the  |1922_leadership_election|1922_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election| . He served as MacDonalds  |Parliamentary_Private_Secretary|Parliamentary_Private_Secretary|  for the brief 1922 parliament. His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived  |first_Labour_government|First_Labour_Government| , led by MacDonald.     Attlee opposed the  |1926_General_Strike|Uk_General_Strike_1926| , believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike, he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee . The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay £300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.     In 1927, he was appointed a member of the multi-party  |Simon_Commission|Simon_Commission| , a  |royal_commission|Royal_Commission|  set up to examine the possibility of granting  |self-rule|Self-Governance|  to  |India|British_Raj| . Due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise MacDonald made to Attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the  |Second_Labour_Government|Second_Labour_Government| , which entered office after the  |1929_general_election|1929_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . Attlees service on the Commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders. By 1933 he argued that British rule was alien to India and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for Indias progress. He became the British leader most sympathetic to Indian independence , preparing him for his role in deciding on independence in 1947.      In May 1930, Labour MP  |Oswald_Mosley|Oswald_Mosley|  left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem, and Attlee was given Mosleys post of  |Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster|Chancellor_Of_The_Duchy_Of_Lancaster| . In March 1931, he became  |Postmaster_General|Postmaster_General_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , a post he held for five months until August, when the  |Labour_government_fell|History_Of_The_British_Labour_Partygreat_Depression_And_The_Split_Under_Macdonald| , after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression_In_The_United_Kingdom| . That month MacDonald and a few of his allies formed a  |National_Government|National_Government|  with the  |Conservatives|Conservative_Party|  and  |Liberals|Liberal_Party| , leading them to be expelled from Labour. MacDonald offered Attlee a job in the National Government, but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main Labour party.     After Ramsay MacDonald formed the National Government, Labour was deeply divided. Attlee had long been close to MacDonald and now felt betrayed—as did most Labour politicians. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with MacDonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography. He would write: ; accessed 26 July 2017.     In the old days I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine presence and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  seemed to mark him as a man of character. Despite his mishandling of the  |Red_Letter|Zinoviev_Letter|  episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.           The  |1931_general_election|1931_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  held later that year was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats, returning only 52 MPs to Parliament. The vast majority of the partys senior figures, including the Leader  |Arthur|Arthur_Henderson|  Henderson, lost their seats. Attlee, however, narrowly retained his Limehouse seat, with his majority being slashed from 7,288 to just 551. He was one of only three Labour MPs who had experience of government to retain their seats, along with  |George_Lansbury|George_Lansbury|  and  |Stafford_Cripps|Stafford_Cripps| . Accordingly Lansbury was elected Leader unopposed with Attlee as his deputy.     Most of the remaining Labour MPs after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates, Lansbury was in his 70s, and Stafford Cripps another main figure of the Labour front bench who had entered Parliament in 1931, was inexperienced. As one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining Labour MPs, Attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the National Government in the years 1931–35, during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before, such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government.     Attlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised Attlees public profile considerably. It was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced Attlee to quit politics altogether. His wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the  |Leader_of_the_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition| . On the verge of resigning from Parliament, he was persuaded to stay by Stafford Cripps, a wealthy socialist, who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until Lansbury could take over again.     During 1932–33 Attlee flirted with, and then drew back from radicalism, influenced by Stafford Cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly a member of the  |Socialist_League|Socialist_League| , which had been formed by former  |Independent_Labour_Party|Independent_Labour_Party|  members, who opposed the ILPs disaffiliation from the main Labour Party in 1932. At one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by Cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. He admired  |Oliver_Cromwells|Oliver_Cromwell|  strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control England. After looking more closely at Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and even his former colleague Oswald Mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in Britain, Attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the League, and argued instead that the Labour Party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against  |totalitarianism|Totalitarianism|  of either the left or right. He always supported the crown, and as Prime Minister was close to King George VI.          |George_Lansbury|George_Lansbury| , a committed  |pacifist|Pacifist| , resigned as the Leader of the Labour Party at the 1935 Party Conference on 8 October, after delegates voted in favour of sanctions against Italy for its  |aggression_against|Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War| |Abyssinia|Ethiopian_Empire| . Lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. Taking advantage of the disarray in the Labour Party, the Prime Minister  |Stanley_Baldwin|Stanley_Baldwin|  announced on 19 October that a general election would be held on 14 November. With no time for a leadership contest, the party agreed that Attlee should serve as interim leader, on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election. Attlee therefore led Labour through the  |1935_election|1935_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance, winning 38 per cent of the vote, the highest share Labour had won up to that point, and gaining over one hundred seats.     Attlee stood in the subsequent  |leadership_election|1935_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election| , held soon after, where he was opposed by  |Herbert_Morrison|Herbert_Morrison| , who had just re-entered parliament in the recent election, and  |Arthur_Greenwood|Arthur_Greenwood| |alcohol_problem|Alcoholism| . Attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. He went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected Leader of the Labour Party on 3 December 1935.     Throughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the Labour Partys official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and  |collective_security|Collective_Security|  under the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations| .  At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country . Talus, Your Alternative Government , p. 17. During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said We are told that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible .  Shortly after those comments,  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitlers speech, although containing unfavourable references to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , created A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position .      In April 1936, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain| , introduced a Budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces. Attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying:        In June 1936, the Conservative MP  |Duff_Cooper|Duff_Cooper|  called for an Anglo-French alliance against possible German aggression and called for all parties to support one. Attlee condemned this: We say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kind—an alliance in which one country is bound to another, right or wrong, by some overwhelming necessity—is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations, is contrary to the Covenant, is contrary to Locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken, and is contrary to the professed policy of this Government .  At the Labour Party conference at Edinburgh in October Attlee reiterated that There can be no question of our supporting the Government in its rearmament policy . Talus, p. 37.     However, with the rising threat from  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| , and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlains policy of  |appeasement|Appeasement| .     In 1938, Attlee opposed the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement| , in which Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|      At the end of 1937, Attlee and a party of three Labour MPs visited Spain and visited the  |British_Battalion|British_Battalion|  of the  |International_Brigades|International_Brigades|  fighting in the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War| . One of the companies was named the Major Attlee Company in his honour.     In 1937, Attlee wrote a book entitled The Labour Party in Perspective that sold fairly well in which he set out some of his views. He argued that there was no point in Labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success:     I find that the proposition often reduces itself to this – that if the Labour Party would drop its socialism and adopt a Liberal platform, many Liberals would be pleased to support it. I have heard it said more than once that if Labour would only drop its policy of  |nationalisation|Nationalisation|  everyone would be pleased, and it would soon obtain a majority. I am convinced it would be fatal for the Labour Party.     He also wrote that there was no point in watering down Labours socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith. On the contrary, I believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support . In the late 1930s, Attlee sponsored a Jewish mother and her two children, enabling them to leave Germany in 1939 and move to the UK. On arriving in Britain, Attlee invited one of the children into his home in  |Stanmore|Stanmore| , north-west London, where he stayed for several months.           Attlee remained as Leader of the Opposition when the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  broke out in September 1939. The ensuing disastrous  |Norwegian_Campaign|Norwegian_Campaign|  would result in a  |motion_of_no_confidence|Norway_Debate|  in  |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain| .  Although Chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged that it became clear a  |coalition_government|Coalition_Government|  would be necessary. Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  on 10 May 1940.     Attlee and Churchill quickly agreed that the  |War_Cabinet|War_Cabinetchurchill_War_Ministry|  would consist of three Conservatives  and two Labour members  and that Labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government. Attlee and Greenwood played a vital role in supporting Churchill during a series of  |War_Cabinet_debates|May_1940_War_Cabinet_Crisis|  over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with Hitler following the  |Fall_of_France|Fall_Of_France|  in May 1940; both supported Churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the War Cabinet to continue Britains resistance. Marr, Andrew. A History of Modern Britain , pp. xv–xvii     Only Attlee and Churchill remained in the War Cabinet from the formation of the Government of National Unity in May 1940 through to the election in May 1945. Attlee was initially the  |Lord_Privy_Seal|Lord_Privy_Seal| , before becoming Britains first ever  |Deputy_Prime_Minister|Deputy_Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in 1942, as well as becoming the  |Dominions_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Dominion_Affairs|  and the  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council| .     Attlee himself played a generally low key but vital role in the wartime government, working behind the scenes and in committees to ensure the smooth operation of government. In the  |coalition_government|Churchill_War_Ministry| , three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the  |War_Cabinet|War_Cabinet|  and the Defence Committee, with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the third body, the  |Lord_Presidents_Committee|Lord_Presidents_Committee| , which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. Attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with Churchills backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees. He also acted as a concilliator in the government, smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between Labour and Conservative Ministers.      Many Labour activists were baffled by the top leadership role for a man they regarded as having little charisma;  |Beatrice_Webb|Beatrice_Webb|  wrote in her diary in early 1940:   :He looked and spoke like an insignificant elderly clerk, without distinction in the voice, manner or substance of his discourse. To realise that this little nonentity is the Parliamentary Leader of the Labour Party... and presumably the future P.M. is pitiable . Quoted by Paul Addison in                           Following the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of the  |War_in_Europe|European_Theatre_Of_World_War_Ii|  in May 1945, Attlee and Churchill favoured the coalition government remaining in place until  |Japan|Empire_Of_Japan|  had been defeated. However,  |Herbert_Morrison|Herbert_Morrison|  made it clear that the Labour Party would not be willing to accept this, and Churchill was forced to tender his resignation as  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and call an immediate election.     The war had set in motion profound social changes within Britain, and had ultimately led to a widespread popular desire for  |social_reform|Reform_Movement| . This mood was epitomised in the  |Beveridge_Report|Beveridge_Report|  of 1942, by the Liberal economist  |William_Beveridge|William_Beveridge| . The Report assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of post-war governments, and that this would provide the basis for the  |welfare_state|Welfare_State| . Immediately on its release, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies. All major parties committed themselves to fulfilling this aim, but most historians say that Attlees Labour Party were seen by the electorate as the party most likely to follow it through. Steven Fielding, What did ‘the people’want?: the meaning of the 1945 general election . Historical Journal 353 : 623–639.      Labour campaigned on the theme of Let Us Face the Future , positioning themselves as the party best placed to rebuild Britain after the war,  and were widely viewed as having run a strong and positive campaign, while the Conservative campaign centred entirely around Churchill. Despite opinion polls indicating a strong Labour lead, opinion polls were then viewed as a novelty which had not proven their worth, and most commentators expected that Churchills prestige and status as a war hero would ensure a comfortable Conservative victory. Before polling day,  The Manchester Guardian  surmised that the chances of Labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority  ... are pretty remote . The  News of the World  predicted a working Conservative majority, while in  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  a pundit forecast the result as Conservatives 360, Labour 220, Others 60.  Churchill however made some costly errors during the campaign. In particular, his suggestion during one radio broadcast that a future Labour Government would require some form of a gestapo to implement their policies was widely regarded as being in very bad taste, and massively backfired.     When the results of the election were announced on 26 July, they came as a surprise to most, including Attlee himself. Labour had won power by a huge landslide, winning 47.7 per cent of the vote to the Conservatives 36 per cent. R. C. Whiting, Attlee, Clement Richard, first Earl Attlee , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004. This gave them 393 seats in the House of Commons, a working majority of 146. This was the first time in history that the Labour Party had won a majority in  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdom| .  When Attlee went to see  |King_George_VI|George_Vi|  at  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  to be appointed Prime Minister, the notoriously  |laconic|Wikt:Laconic|  Attlee and the famously tongue-tied King stood in silence; Attlee finally volunteered the remark, Ive won the election . The King replied I know. I heard it on the Six OClock News .         As  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , Attlee appointed  |Hugh_Dalton|Hugh_Dalton|  as  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| ,  |Ernest_Bevin|Ernest_Bevin|  as  |Foreign_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_And_Commonwealth_Affairs| , and  |Herbert_Morrison|Herbert_Morrison|  as  |Deputy_Prime_Minister|Deputy_Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , with overall responsibility for nationalisation. Additionally,  |Stafford_Cripps|Stafford_Cripps|  was made  |President_of_the_Board_of_Trade|President_Of_The_Board_Of_Trade| ,  |Aneurin_Bevan|Aneurin_Bevan|  became  |Minister_of_Health|Secretary_Of_State_For_Health| , and  |Ellen_Wilkinson|Ellen_Wilkinson| , the only woman to serve in Attlees government, was appointed  |Minister_of_Education|Secretary_Of_State_For_Education_And_Skills| . The  |Attlee_government|Attlee_Ministry|  proved itself to be a radical, reforming government. From 1945 to 1948, over 200 public  |Acts_of_Parliament|Acts_Of_Parliament|  were passed, with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone. Rachel Reeves, and Martin McIvor. Clement Attlee and the foundations of the British welfare state . Renewal: a Journal of Labour Politics 223/4 : 42.       Francis argues there was consensus both in the Labours national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement. The Attlee government was committed to rebuilding British society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. Labours ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Partys defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality. Francis, Martin. Economics and Ethics: The Nature of Labours Socialism, 1945–1951 , Twentieth Century British History 62, pp 220–43. On 5 July 1948, Clement Attlee replied to a letter dated 22 June from  |James_Murray|James_Murray|  and ten other MPs who raised concerns about West Indians who arrived on board the .  As for the prime minister himself, he was not much focused on economic policy, letting others handle the issues.           Attlees Health Minister,  |Aneurin_Bevan|Aneurin_Bevan| , fought hard against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, including the  |British_Medical_Association|British_Medical_Association| , by creating the  |National_Health_Service|National_Health_Service|  in 1948. This was a  |publicly_funded_healthcare_system|Publicly_Funded_Health_Care| , which offered treatment free of charge for all at the point of use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8 and a half million dental patients and dispensed more than 5  million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation. Jefferys, Kevin. The Attlee Governments, 1945–1951.       The government set about implementing the wartime plans of Liberal  |William_Beveridge|William_Beveridge|  for the creation of a cradle to grave  |welfare_state|Welfare_State| . It set in place an entirely new system of  |social_security|Social_Security| . Among the most important pieces of legislation was the  |National_Insurance_Act_1946|National_Insurance_Act_1946| , in which people in work were required to pay a flat rate of  |national_insurance|National_Insurance| . In return, they were eligible for a wide range of benefits, including pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for  |child_benefit|Child_Benefit|  and support for people with no other source of income. In 1949, unemployment, sickness and maternity benefits were exempted from tax.        The New Towns Act of 1946 set up development corporations to construct new towns, while the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 instructed county councils to prepare development plans and also provided compulsory purchase powers. The Attlee government also extended the powers of local authorities to requisition houses and parts of houses, and made the acquisition of land less difficult than before. Pritt, Denis Nowell. The Labour Government 1945–51. The Housing Act of 1949 provided grants of 75 per cent towards modernisation costs payable by Treasury to local authorities. Scottish Housing in the Twentieth Century     In 1949, local authorities were empowered to provide people suffering from poor health with  |public_housing|Public_Housing|  at  |subsidised_rents|Subsidized_Housing| .      To assist home ownership, the limit on the amount of money that people could borrow from their local authority to purchase or build a home was raised from £800 to £1,500 in 1945, and to £5,000 in 1949. Fifty Facts on Housing , published by the Labour Party, Transport House, Smith Square, London SW1, February 1951 Under the National Assistance act of 1948, local authorities had a duty to provide emergency temporary accommodation for families which become homeless through no fault of their own . Socially Deprived Families in Britain , first published in 1970 .     A large house-building programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with high-quality homes. A housing bill passed in 1946 increased Treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in England and Wales. Harmer, Harry. The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900–1998. Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, and subsidies kept down council rents. Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest-ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.       A number of reforms were embarked upon to improve conditions for women and children. In 1946, universal family allowances were introduced to provide financial support to households for raising children.   These benefits had been legislated for the previous year by Churchills  |Family_Allowances_Act_1945|Family_Allowances_Act_1945| , and was the first measure pushed through parliament by Attlees government.  Conservatives would later criticise Labour for having been too hasty in introducing family allowances.     A Married Women Act was passed in 1949 to equalise, to render inoperative any restrictions upon anticipation or alienation attached to the enjoyment of property by a woman , while the Married Women Act of 1949 was enacted with the intention of improving the adequacy and duration of financial benefits for married women.      The Criminal Law Act of 1950 amended an Act of 1885 to bring prostitutes within the law and safeguard them from abduction and abuse.  The Criminal Justice Act of 1948 restricted imprisonment for juveniles and brought improvements to the probation and remand centres systems, while the passage of the Justices of the Peace Act of 1949 led to extensive reforms of magistrates courts. The Longman Companion to the Labour Party, 1900–1998 by H.  J.  P. Harmer The Attlee government also abolished the marriage bar in the Civil Service, thereby enabling married women to work in that institution.      In 1946, the government set up a National Institute of Houseworkers as a means of providing a social democratic variety of domestic service. Francis, Martin. Ideas and Policies Under Labour, 1945–1951.     By late 1946, agreed standards of training were established, which was followed by the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional nine training centres in Wales, Scotland, and then throughout Great Britain. The National Health Service Act of 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required owing to the presence of any person who is ill, lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged or a child not over compulsory school age . Home help therefore included the provision of home-helps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with children under the age of five, and by 1952 some 20,000 women were engaged in this service.        Development rights were nationalised while the government attempted to take all development profits for the State. Strong planning authorities were set up to control land use, and issued manuals of guidance which stressed the importance of safeguarding agricultural land. A chain of regional offices was set up within its planning ministry to provide a strong lead in regional development policies. Labour and Inequality: Sixteen Fabian Essays .     Comprehensive Development Areas , a designation under the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947, allowed local authorities to acquire property in the designated areas using powers of compulsory purchase in order to re-plan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage.        Various measures were carried out to improve conditions in the workplace. Entitlement to sick leave was greatly extended, and sick pay schemes were introduced for local authority administrative, professional and technical workers in 1946 and for various categories of manual workers in 1948. Townsend, Peter. Poverty in the United Kingdom: A Survey of Household Resources and Standards of Living. Workers compensation was also significantly improved. Hicks, Alexander M. Social Democracy & Welfare Capitalism: A Century of Income Security Politics.     The Fair Wages Resolution of 1946 required any contractor working on a public project to at least match the pay rates and other employment conditions set in the appropriate collective agreement.    In 1946,  |purchase_tax|Purchase_Tax|  was removed completely from kitchen fittings and crockery, while the rate was reduced on various gardening items.     The  |Fire_Services_Act_1947|Fire_Services_Act_1947|  introduced a new pension scheme for fire-fighters,  while the  |Electricity_Act_1947|Electricity_Act_1947|  introduced better retirement benefits for workers in that industry.  A Workers Compensation Act was passed in 1948 that introduced benefits for workers with certain asbestos-related diseases which had occurred before 1948.  The Merchant Shipping Act of 1948 and the Merchant Shipping Act of 1949 were passed to improve conditions for seamen. The Shops Act of 1950 consolidated previous legislation which provided that no one could be employed in a shop for more than six hours without having a break for at least 20 minutes. The legislation also required a lunch break of at least 45 minutes for anyone for worked between 11:30  am and 2:30  pm and a half-hour tea break for anyone working between 4  pm and 7  pm.  The government also strengthened a Fair Wages Resolution, with a clause that required all employers getting government contracts to recognise the rights of their workers to join trade unions. Fraser, W. Hamish. A History of British Trade Unionism, 1700–1998.     The  |Trades_Disputes_Act_1927|Trade_Disputes_And_Trade_Unions_Act_1927|  was repealed, and a Dock Labour Scheme was introduced in 1947 to put an end to the casual system of hiring labour in the docks.  This scheme gave registered dockers the legal right to minimum work and decent conditions. Through the National Dock Labour Board the unions acquired control over recruitment and dismissal. Registered dockers laid off by employers within the Scheme had the right either to be taken on by another, or to generous compensation.  All dockers were registered under the Dock Labour Scheme, giving them a legal right to minimum work, holidays and sick pay.      Wages for members of the police force were significantly increased.  The introduction of a Miners Charter in 1946 instituted a five-day work week for miners and a standardised day wage structure, and in 1948 a Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme was approved, providing supplementary allowances to disabled coal-workers and their dependants.  Social security in Britain, Great Britain, Central Office of Information, Reference Division, H.M. Stationery Office In 1948, a pension scheme was set up to provide pension benefits for employees of the new NHS, as well as their dependents.  Under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Regulations of 1950, a pension scheme for mineworkers was established.  Improvements were also made in farmworkers wages, and the Agricultural Wages Board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels, but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation.      A number of regulations aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of people at work were also introduced during Attlees time in office. Regulations issued in February 1946 applied to factories involved with manufacturing briquettes or blocks of fuel consisting of coal, coal dust, coke or slurry with pitch as a binding substance , and concerned dust and ventilation, washing facilities and clothing accommodation, medical supervision and examination, skin and eye protection and messrooms .       Attlees government also carried out their manifesto commitment for  |nationalisation|Nationalisation|  of basic industries and public utilities. The  |Bank_of_England|Bank_Of_England|  and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946.  |Coal_mining|National_Coal_Board| , the  |railways|British_Railways| , road haulage, canals and  |Cable_and_Wireless|Cable_&_Wireless_Plc|  were nationalised in 1947, and electricity and gas followed in 1948. The  |steel_industry|Iron_And_Steel_Corporation_Of_Great_Britain|  was nationalised in 1951. By 1951 about 20 per cent of the British economy had been taken into  |public_ownership|Public_Ownership| .     Nationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked. It did, however, bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages, reduced working hours, Pelling, Henry. The Labour Governments, 1945–51. and improvements in working conditions, especially in regards to safety. Cawood, Ian. Britain in the Twentieth Century. As historian Eric Shaw noted of the years following nationalisation, the electricity and gas supply companies became impressive models of public enterprise in terms of efficiency, and the  |National_Coal_Board|National_Coal_Board|  was not only profitable, but working conditions for miners had significantly improved as well. Shaw, Eric. The Labour Party since 1945.     Within a few years of nationalisation, a number of progressive measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme , a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility. Kynaston, David. Austerity Britain 1945–1951.     The newly established  |National_Coal_Board|National_Coal_Board|  offered sick pay and holiday pay to miners.  As noted by Martin Francis:   Union leaders saw nationalisation as a means to pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict, rather than as an opportunity to replace the old adversarial form of industrial relations. Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace.       The Attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the  |Agriculture_Act_1947|Agriculture_Act_1947|  established a more generous subsidy system for farmers. Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.  Self, Peter & Herbert J. Storing. The State and the Farmer.     Attlees government made it possible for farm workers to borrow up to 90 per cent of the cost of building their own houses, and received a subsidy of £15 a year for 40 years towards that cost. Grants were also made to meet up to half the cost of supplying water to farm buildings and fields, the government met half the cost of bracken eradication and lime spreading, and grants were paid for bringing hill farming land into use that had previously been considered unfit for farming purposes.     In 1946, the National Agricultural Advisory Service was set up to supply agricultural advice and information. The Hill Farming Act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1948 enabled tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the Livestock Rearing Act of March 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 Hill Farming Act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.     At a time of world food shortages, it was vital that farmers produced the maximum possible quantities. The government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the National Agricultural Advisory Service provided expertise and price guarantees. As a result of the Attlee governments initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20 per cent increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while Britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.       The Attlee government ensured provisions of the Education Act 1944 were fully implemented, with free secondary education becoming a right for the first time. Fees in state grammar schools were eliminated, while new, modern secondary schools were constructed. Hopkins, Eric. Industrialisation and Society: A Social History, 1830–1951.     The school leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947, an accomplishment helped brought into fruition by initiatives such as the H.O.R.S.A. scheme and the S.F.O.R.S.A. scheme. University scholarships were introduced to ensure that no one who was qualified “should be deprived of a university education for financial reasons,” while a large school building programme was organised. A rapid increase in the number of trained teachers took place, and the number of new school places was increased.     Increased Treasury funds were made available for education, particularly for upgrading school buildings suffering from years of neglect and war damage. Jefferys, Kevin. The Labour Party since 1945. Prefabricated classrooms were built and 928 new primary schools were constructed between 1945 and 1950. The provision of free school meals was expanded, and opportunities for university entrants were increased. Hartley, Cathy. A Historical Dictionary of British Women. State scholarships to universities were increased, Pelling, Henry & Alastair J. Reid. A Short History of the Labour Party. and the government adopted a policy of supplementing university scholarships awards to a level sufficient to cover fees plus maintenance.     Many thousands of ex-servicemen were assisted to go through college who could never have contemplated it before the war. Free milk was also made available to all schoolchildren for the first time. Oddy, Derek J. From Plain Fare to Fusion Food: British Diet from the 1890s to the 1990s. In addition, spending on technical education rose, and the number of nursery schools was increased. Salaries for teachers were also improved, and funds were allocated towards improving existing schools.     In 1947, the Arts Council of Great Britain was set up to encourage the arts.     A Ministry of Education was established, and free County Colleges were set up for the compulsory part-time instruction of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 who were not in full-time education. Hodge, B. & W.  L. Mellor. Higher School Certificate History. An Emergency Training Scheme was also introduced which turned out an extra 25,000 teachers in 1945–1951. In 1947, Regional Advisory Councils were set up to bring together industry and education to find out the needs of young workers and advise on the provision required, and to secure reasonable economy of provision . Whitakers Almanack, J. Whitaker & Sons, 1987 That same year, thirteen Area Training Organisations were set up in England and one in Wales to coordinate teacher training.     Attlees government, however, failed to introduce the comprehensive education for which many socialists had hoped. This reform was eventually carried out by Harold Wilsons government. During its time in office, the Attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from £6.5  billion to £10  billion.       The most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the war effort had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth. Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the balance of trade . This resulted in strict rationing of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.     The abrupt end of the American Lend-Lease program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the Anglo-American loan , negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the pound fully convertible to the US dollar. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a currency crisis and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks. The UK benefited from the American Marshall Aid program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. Another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps , into devaluation of the pound.     Despite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlees government was the maintenance of near full employment . The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3 per cent of the total workforce. Labour shortages proved a more frequent problem. The inflation rate was also kept low during his term. The rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during Attlees time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. Both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened. Thompson, David. England in the Twentieth Century .     The government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan . The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee governments housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.     When the Attlee government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. The period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10 per cent each year. During that same period, the economy grew by 3 per cent a year, and by 1951 the UK had the best economic performance in Europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the United States . Ten Years of New Labour Careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels. In addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3  million to 5  million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before. A Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act was passed in 1948, which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies.       1947 proved a particularly difficult year for the government; an exceptionally cold winter that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production, creating widespread power cuts and food shortages. The Minister of Fuel and Power , Emanuel Shinwell was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. The Conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan Starve with Strachey and shiver with Shinwell .     The crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by Hugh Dalton to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with Ernest Bevin . Later that year Stafford Cripps tried to persuade Attlee to stand aside for Bevin. These plots petered out after Bevin refused to cooperate. Later that year, Hugh Dalton resigned as Chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist. He was replaced by Cripps.       thu and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference , 1945   thu upon his arrival at National Airport in Washington, 1945         In foreign affairs, the Attlee government was concerned with four main issues; post-war Europe, the onset of the Cold War, the establishment of the United Nations, and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin . Attlee also attended the later stages of the Potsdam Conference , where he negotiated with President Harry S. Truman and Joseph Stalin .     In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britains former war-time ally, Stalin and the Soviet Union . Ernest Bevin was a passionate anti-communist , based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevins initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile . Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at swords point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britains role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.     In an early good-will gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets to purchase, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR Trade Agreement , a total of 25 Rolls-Royce Nene jet engine s in September 1947 and March 1948. The agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes. The price was fixed under a commercial contract; a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the USSR in 1947. However, the Cold War intensified during this period and the Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, reverse-engineered the Nene and installed their own version in the MiG-15 interceptor. This was used to good effect against US-UK forces in the subsequent Korean War , as well as in several later MiG models. Gordon, Yefim. Mikoyan–Gurevich MIG-15: The Soviet Unions Long-Lived Korean War Fighter, Midland Press , .     After Stalin took political control of most of Eastern Europe, and began to subvert other governments in the Balkans, Attlees and Bevins worst fears of Soviet intentions were realised. The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful NATO defence alliance to protect Western Europe against any Soviet expansion. In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlees Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American Marshall Plan for the economic recovery of Europe. He called it, one of the most bold, enlightened and good-natured acts in the history of nations .     A group of Labour MPs, organised under the banner of Keep Left urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a third force of European powers to stand between the US and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, as well as Britains economic reliance on America following the Marshall Plan, steered policy towards supporting the US. In January 1947, fear of both Soviet and American nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britains independent nuclear deterrent , an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britains first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.     The London dock strike of July 1949, led by Communists, was suppressed when the Attlee government sent in 13,000 Army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. His response reveals Attlees growing concern that Soviet expansionism, supported by the British Communist Party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by Moscow. He noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances, but to help communist unions who were on strike in Canada. Attlee agreed with MI5 that he faced a very present menace .   thu with Attlee in 1945       Decolonisation was never a major election issue but Attlee gave the matter a great deal of attention and was the chief leader in planning and achieving the process of decolonisation of the British Empire , starting in Asia. Nicholas Owen, Attlee governments: The end of empire 1945–51 . Contemporary British History 34 : 12–16.     Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age pp 321–25. Attlee and the Labour leadership were sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru . During the Second World War Attlee was in charge of Indian affairs. He set up the Cripps Mission in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together. When the Congress called for passive resistance in the Quit India movement of 1942–1945, it was Attlee who ordered the arrest and internment for the duration of tens of thousands of Congress leaders and crushed the revolt. Bew, Clement Attlee p 433.     Labours election Manifesto in 1945 called for the advancement of India to responsible self-government , but did not mention independence. F.W.S. Craig, ed., British General Election Manifestos: 1918–1966 p 105. In 1942 the British Raj tried to enlist all major political factors parties in support of the war effort. Congress, led by Nehru and Gandhi, demanded immediate independence and full control by Congress of all of India. That demand was rejected by the British, and Congress opposed the war effort with its Quit India campaign . The Raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national, regional and local Congress leaders for the duration. Attlee did not object. Herman, Gandhi & Churchill p 486-95. By contrast, the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah , and also the Sikh community, strongly supported the war effort. They greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from London for their decision. Attlee retained a fondness for Congress and until 1946, accepted their thesis that they were a non-religious party that accepted Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and everyone else. Kenneth Harris, Attlee pp 362–64     thu   The Muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the Muslims of India, and by 1946 Attlee had come to agree with them.   With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. Viceroy Wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. No divisions were available; independence was the only option. David Chandler, The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army p. 331 Given the demands of the Muslim league, independence implied a partition that set off heavily Muslim Pakistan from the main portion of India. Harris, Attlee pp 367–69.     The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. Historian Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a national humiliation but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs. Andrew Roberts, Eminent Churchillians p 78. Churchill in 1940–1945 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, with Attlees approval. Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in the India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonisation. Kenneth Harris, Attlee pp 362–387. Attlee found that Churchills viceroy, Field Marshal Wavell , was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. Irial Glynn, ‘An Untouchable in the Presence of Brahmins’ Lord Wavells Disastrous Relationship with Whitehall During His Time as Viceroy to India, 1943–7 . Modern Asian Studies 413 : 639–663. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten , the dashing war hero and a cousin of the King. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus . Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Yasmin Khan, The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan pp 6, 83–103, 211. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu activist in January 1948. Gandhi Is Killed By A Hindu; India Shaken, World Mourns; 15 Die In Rioting In Bombay Three Shots Fired     The final result was two nations consisting of a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan . Both joined the Commonwealth.     Attlee also sponsored the peaceful transition to independence in 1948 of Burma and Ceylon .     Diplomacy & Statecraft 213 : 416–433.       The governments policies with regard to the other colonies, particularly those in Africa, focused on keeping them as strategic Cold War assets while modernising their economies. The Labour Party had long attracted aspiring leaders from Africa and had developed elaborate plans before the war. Implementing them overnight with an empty treasury proved too challenging. A major military base was built in Kenya, and the African colonies came under an unprecedented degree of direct control from London. Development schemes were implemented to help solve Britains post-war balance of payments crisis and raise African living standards. This new colonialism worked slowly and had failures such as the Tanganyika groundnut scheme .         The 1950 election gave Labour a massively reduced majority of five seats compared to the triple-digit majority of 1945. Although re-elected, the result was seen by Attlee as very disappointing, and was widely attributed to the effects of post-war austerity denting Labours appeal to middle-class voters. With such a small majority leaving him dependent on a small number of MPs to govern, Attlees second term was much tamer than his first. Some major reforms were nevertheless passed, particularly regarding industry in urban areas and regulations to limit air and water pollution. H. G. Nicholas, The British general election of 1950 .       By 1951, the Attlee government was exhausted, with several of its most senior ministers ailing or ageing, and with a lack of new ideas. Attlees record for settling internal differences in the Labour Party fell in April 1951, when there was a damaging split over an austerity Budget brought in by the Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell , to pay for the cost of Britains participation in the Korean War . Aneurin Bevan resigned to protest against the new charges for teeth and spectacles in the National Health Service introduced by that Budget, and was joined in this action by several senior ministers, including the future Prime Minister Harold Wilson , then the President of the Board of Trade . Thus escalated a battle between the left and right wings of the Party that continues today.     Finding it increasingly impossible to govern, Attlees only chance was to call a snap election in October 1951, in the hope of achieving a more workable majority and to regain authority.

Following the defeat in 1951, Attlee continued to lead the party as Leader of the Opposition. His last four years as leader were, however, widely seen as one of the Labour Partys weaker periods. Thorpe, Andrew. A History of the British Labour Party, Palgrave;     The period was dominated by infighting between the Labour Partys right wing, led by Hugh Gaitskell , and its left, led by Aneurin Bevan . Many Labour MPs felt that Attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed a younger man to lead the party. Bevan openly called for him to stand down in the summer of 1954. Williams, Charles. Harold Macmillan , p. 221 One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of Herbert Morrison , whom Attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons. At one time, Attlee had favoured Aneurin Bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after Bevan almost irrevocably split the party.     In an interview with the  |News_Chronicle|News_Chronicle|  columnist Percy Cudlipp in mid-September 1955, Attlee made clear his own thinking together with his preference for the leadership succession, stating:       Attlee, now aged 72, contested the 1955 general election against Anthony Eden , which saw Labour lose 18 seats, and the Conservatives increase their majority. He retired as Leader of the Labour Party on 7 December 1955, having led the party for twenty years, and on 14 December Hugh Gaitskell was elected as his replacement.       thu of the Earls Attlee   He subsequently retired from the House of Commons and was elevated to the peerage to take his seat in the House of Lords as Earl Attlee and Viscount Prestwood on 16 December 1955. He believed Eden had been forced into taking a strong stand on the Suez Crisis by his backbenchers. Bew, John Citizen Clem: A Biography of Attlee p. 538 In 1958, he was, along with numerous notables, to establish the Homosexual Law Reform Society . The society campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through Parliament nine years later.     In 1962, he spoke twice in the House of Lords against the British governments application for the UK to join the European Economic Community . In his second speech delivered in November, Attlee claimed that Britain had a separate parliamentary tradition from the Continental countries that composed the EEC. He also claimed that if Britain was a member, EEC rules would prevent the British government from planning the economy and that Britains traditional policy had been outward looking rather than Continental. in the House of Lords on the British application to join the Common Market .     He attended Winston Churchill s funeral in January 1965. He was elderly and frail by that time, and had to remain seated in the freezing cold as the coffin was carried, having tired himself out by standing at the rehearsal the previous day. He lived to see the Labour Party return to power under Harold Wilson in 1964, but also to see his old constituency of Walthamstow West fall to the Conservatives in a by-election in September 1967 . Beckett 2015, p.467       Attlee died peacefully in his sleep of pneumonia , at the age of 84 at Westminster Hospital on 8 October 1967. Two thousand people attended his funeral in November, including the then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson and the Duke of Kent , representing the Queen . He was cremated and his ashes were buried at Westminster Abbey .     Upon his death, the title passed to his son Martin Richard Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee . It is now held by Clement Attlees grandson John Richard Attlee, 3rd Earl Attlee . The third earl retained his seat in the Lords as one of the hereditary peer s to remain under an amendment to Labours 1999 House of Lords Act . http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2014-014/LLN-2014-014.pdf     Attlees estate was sworn for probate purposes at a value of £7,295, Attlee the rt hon Clement Richard of 1 Kings Bench Walk Temple London EC4 died 8 October 1967 Probate London 4 January £7295 in Probate Index for 1968 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 7 August 2016 a relatively modest sum for so prominent a figure, and only a fraction of the £75,394 in his fathers estate when he died in 1908.

Arnstein, Walter L. Britain Yesterday and Today: 1830 to the Present, Chapter 19, p. 363 Attlees modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. Attlee himself is said to have responded to critics with a limerick : There were few who thought him a starter, Many who thought themselves smarter. But he ended PM, CH and OM, an Earl and a Knight of the Garter . Kenneth Harris, Attlee     The journalist and broadcaster Anthony Howard called him the greatest Prime Minister of the 20th century . video on YouTube .     His leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. Christopher Soames , the British Ambassador to France during the Conservative government of Edward Heath and cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher , remarked that Mrs Thatcher was not really running a team. Every time you have a Prime Minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didnt. Thats why he was so damn good . Hennessy, Peter. The Prime Minister: The Office and its Holders since 1945, Chapter 7, p. 150     Thatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in Grantham to her victory at the 1979 general election , that she admired Attlee, writing: Of Clement Attlee, however, I was an admirer. He was a serious man and a patriot. Quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show .     Attlees government presided over the successful transition from a wartime economy to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of foreign currency , and adverse deficits in trade balances and government expenditure . Further domestic policies that he brought about included the creation of the National Health Service and the post-war Welfare State , which became key to the reconstruction of post-war Britain. Attlee and his ministers did much to transform the UK into a more prosperous and egalitarian society during their time in office with reductions in poverty and a rise in the general economic security of the population. Tanner, Duncan; Pat Thane & Nick Tiratsoo. Labours First Century.   thu   In foreign affairs, he did much to assist with the post-war economic recovery of Europe. He proved a loyal ally of the United States at the onset of the Cold War . Due to his style of leadership, it was not he, but Ernest Bevin who masterminded foreign policy. It was Attlees government that decided Britain should have an independent nuclear weapons programme, and work on it began in 1947.     Bevin, Attlees Foreign Secretary, famously stated that Weve got to have it and its got to have a bloody Union Jack on it . The first operational British A Bomb was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US McMahon Act , which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US–UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. British atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of Attlees own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain. Peter Hennessy, Cabinets and the Bomb, Oxford University Press, 2007.     Although a socialist , Attlee still believed in the British Empire of his youth. He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada , Australia , and New Zealand as a model, he continued the transformation of the empire into the modern-day British Commonwealth .     His greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was perhaps the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of Britain that all three major parties subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the late-1970s. Peter Clarke, Attlee: The Making of the Postwar Consensus in Peter Clarke, A Question of Leadership: Gladstone to Thatcher , pp. 193–21 In 2004, he was voted the most successful British Prime Minister of the 20th century by a poll of 139 academics organised by Ipsos MORI .     thu   A blue plaque unveiled in 1979 commemorates Attlee at 17 Monkhams Avenue, in Woodford Green in the London borough of Redbridge .     Attlee was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947 . Attlee was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of Queen Mary College on 15 December 1948. The Times, 16 December 1948, p.  3.       thu   On 30 November 1988, a bronze statue of Clement Attlee was unveiled by Harold Wilson outside Limehouse Library in Attlees former constituency. By then Wilson was the last surviving member of Attlees cabinet, and the unveiling of the statue would be one of the last public appearances by Wilson, who was by that point in the early stages of Alzheimers disease ; he died at the age of 79 in May 1995.     Limehouse Library was closed in 2003, after which the statue was vandalised. The council surrounded it with protective hoarding for four years, before eventually removing it for repair and recasting in 2009. In April 2011 the restored statue was unveiled by Peter Mandelson in its new position less than a mile away at the Queen Mary University of London s Mile End campus.     There is also a statue of Clement Attlee in the Houses of Parliament that was erected, instead of a bust, by parliamentary vote in 1979. The sculptor was Ivor Roberts-Jones .
