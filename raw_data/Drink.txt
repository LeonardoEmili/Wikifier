         A drink  is a  |liquid|Liquid|  intended for  |human|Human|  consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying  |thirst|Thirst| , drinks play important roles in human  |culture|Culture| . Common types of drinks include plain  |drinking_water|Drinking_Water| ,  |milk|Milk| ,  |coffee|Coffee| ,  |tea|Tea| ,  |hot_chocolate|Hot_Chocolate| ,  |juice|Juice|  and  |soft_drinks|Soft_Drink| . In addition,  |alcoholic_drinks|Alcoholic_Drink|  such as  |wine|Wine| ,  |beer|Beer| , and  |liquor|Liquor| , which contain the drug  |ethanol|Ethanol| , have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years.     Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as  |beer|Beer|  and  |wine|Wine| , but are made with less than .5 percent alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.       When the human body becomes dehydrated, it experiences  |thirst|Thirst| . This craving of fluids results in an instinctive need to drink. Thirst is regulated by the  |hypothalamus|Hypothalamus|  in response to subtle changes in the bodys  |electrolyte|Electrolyte|  levels, and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating. The complete elimination of drinks, that is, water, from the body will result in death faster than the removal of any other substance.  Water and milk have been basic drinks throughout history. As water is essential for life, it has also been the carrier of many diseases.      As society developed, techniques were discovered to create alcoholic drinks from the plants that were available in different areas. The earliest archaeological evidence of wine production yet found has been at sites in  |Georgia|Georgia|     and  |Iran|Iran|  .  Beer may have been known in  |Neolithic_Europe|Neolithic_Europe|  as far back as 3000 BCE,  Prehistoric brewing: the true story, 22 October 2001, Archaeo News. Retrieved 13 September 2008 and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.  The invention of beer has been argued to be responsible for humanitys ability to develop technology and build civilization.    Tea likely originated in  |Yunnan|Yunnan| , China during the  |Shang_Dynasty|Shang_Dynasty|  as a medicinal drink.            |Drinking|Drinking|  has been a large part of socialising throughout the centuries. In  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| , a social gathering for the purpose of drinking was known as a  |symposium|Symposium| , where watered down wine would be drunk. The purpose of these gatherings could be anything from serious discussions to direct indulgence. In  |Ancient_Rome|Ancient_Rome| , a similar concept of a convivium took place regularly.     Many early societies considered alcohol a gift from the gods,  leading to the creation of gods such as  |Dionysus|Dionysus| . Other religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic drinks for various reasons. In  |some_regions|List_Of_Countries_With_Alcohol_Prohibition|  with a dominant religion the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic drinks is forbidden to everybody, regardless of religion.      |Toasting|Toast|  is a method of honouring a person or wishing good will by taking a drink. Another tradition is that of the  |loving_cup|Loving_Cup| , at weddings or other celebrations such as sports victories a group will share a drink in a large receptacle, shared by everyone until empty.     In East Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in native religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the  |Ethiopian_Church|Ethiopian_Church|  banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor  |Menelik_II|Menelik_Ii| .  The drink was also banned in  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons  and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.       A drink is a form of liquid which has been prepared for human consumption. The preparation can include a number of different steps, some prior to transport, others immediately prior to consumption.          Water is the chief constituent in all drinks, and the primary ingredient in most. Water is purified prior to  |drinking|Drinking_Water| . Methods for purification include  |filtration|Filtration|  and the addition of chemicals, such as  |chlorination|Water_Chlorination| . The importance of purified water is highlighted by the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization| , who point out 94% of deaths from  |diarrhea|Diarrhea|  – the third biggest cause of infectious death worldwide at 1.8 million annually – could be prevented by improving the quality of the victims environment, particularly safe water.           Pasteurisation is the process of heating a liquid for a period of time at a specified temperature, then immediately cooling. The process reduces the growth of  |microorganisms|Microorganism|  within the liquid, thereby increasing the time before spoilage. It is primarily used on  |milk|Milk| , which prior to pasteurisation is commonly infected with  |pathogen|Pathogen| ic bacteria and therefore is more likely than any other part of the common diet in the developed world to cause illness.              The process of extracting juice from fruits and vegetables can take a number of forms. Simple crushing of most fruits will provide a significant amount of liquid, though a more intense pressure can be applied to get the maximum amount of juice from the fruit. Both crushing and pressing are processes used in the production of wine.          Infusion is the process of extracting flavours from plant material by allowing the material to remain suspended within water. This process is used in the production of  |teas|Tea| ,  |herbal_teas|Herbal_Teas|  and can be used to prepare  |coffee|Coffee|  .          The name is derived from the word  |percolate|Percolation|  which means to cause to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent.    In the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties.          Carbonation is the process of dissolving  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  into a liquid, such as water.            Fermentation is a  |metabolic|Metabolism|  process that converts  |sugar|Sugar|  to  |ethanol|Ethanol| . Fermentation has been used by humans for the production of drinks since the  |Neolithic_age|Neolithic_Age| . In  |winemaking|Winemaking| , grape juice is combined with yeast in an  |anaerobic|Hypoxia|  environment to allow the fermentation. Jeff Cox  From Vines to Wines: The Complete Guide to Growing Grapes and Making Your Own Wine  pgs 133–136 Storey Publishing 1999  The amount of sugar in the wine and the length of time given for fermentation determine the alcohol level and the  |sweetness_of_the_wine|Sweetness_Of_Wine| . D. Bird  Understanding Wine Technology  pg 67–73 DBQA Publishing 2005      When  |brewing|Brewing|  beer, there are four primary ingredients – water, grain, yeast and hops. The grain is encouraged to  |germinate|Germinate|  by soaking and drying in heat, a process known as  |malting|Malting| . It is then milled before soaking again to create the sugars needed for fermentation. This process is known as  |mashing|Mashing| . Hops are added for flavouring, then the yeast is added to the mixture  to start the fermentation process.              Distillation is a method of  |separating|Separation_Process| |mixtures|Mixture|  based on differences in  |volatility|Volatility|  of components in a boiling liquid mixture. It is one of the methods used in the purification of water. It is also a method of producing spirits from milder alcoholic drinks.          An  |alcoholic|Alcoholic_Drink| |_mixed_drink|Mixed_Drink|  that contains two or more ingredients is referred to as a cocktail. Cocktails were originally a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and  |bitters|Bitters| .  The term is now often used for almost any mixed drink that contains alcohol, including mixers, mixed shots, etc.  A cocktail today usually contains one or more kinds of spirit and one or more  |mixers|Drink_Mixer| , such as  |soda|Carbonated_Water|  or  |fruit_juice|Fruit_Juice| . Additional ingredients may be  |sugar|Sugar| ,  |honey|Honey| ,  |milk|Milk| ,  |cream|Cream| , and various  |herbs|Herb| .                  A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no  |alcohol|Ethanol| . This category includes  |low_alcohol_beer|Low_Alcohol_Beer| , non-alcoholic  |wine|Wine| , and  |apple_cider|Apple_Cider|  if they contain less than 0.5%  |alcohol_by_volume|Alcohol_By_Volume| . The term soft drink specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to hard drink and drink . The term drink is theoretically neutral, but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Drinks such as soda pop,  |sparkling_water|Sparkling_Water| ,  |iced_tea|Iced_Tea| ,  |lemonade|Lemonade| ,  |root_beer|Root_Beer| ,  |fruit_punch|Fruit_Punch| ,  |milk|Milk| ,  |hot_chocolate|Hot_Chocolate| ,  |tea|Tea| ,  |coffee|Coffee| ,  |milkshakes|Milkshake| , and  |tap_water|Tap_Water|  and  |energy_drinks|Energy_Drink|  are all soft drinks.          Water is the worlds most consumed drink,  however, 97% of water on Earth is non-drinkable salt water.  Fresh water is found in rivers, lakes, wetlands, groundwater, and frozen glaciers.  ,  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey| . Less than 1% of the Earths fresh water supplies are accessible through surface water and underground sources which are cost effective to retrieve.      In western cultures, water is often drunk cold. In the Chinese culture, it is typically drunk hot.           Regarded as one of the original drinks,  milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies. In many cultures of the world, especially the Western world, humans continue to consume dairy milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals  as a drink. Plant milk, a general term for any milk-like product that is derived from a plant source, also has a long history of consumption in various countries and cultures. The most popular varieties internationally are  |soy_milk|Soy_Milk| ,  |almond_milk|Almond_Milk| ,  |rice_milk|Rice_Milk|  and  |coconut_milk|Coconut_Milk| .          Carbonated drinks refer to drinks which have carbon dioxide dissolved into them. This can happen naturally through fermenting and in natural water spas or artificially by the dissolution of carbon dioxide under pressure. The first commercially available artificially carbonated drink is believed to have been produced by Thomas Henry in the late 1770s.    Cola, orange, various roots, ginger, and lemon/lime are commonly used to create non-alcoholic carbonated drinks; sugars and preservatives may be added later.      The most consumed carbonated soft drinks are produced by three major global brands:  |Coca_Cola|Coca_Cola| ,  |PepsiCo|Pepsico|  and the  |Dr_Pepper_Snapple_Group|Dr_Pepper_Snapple_Group| .               |Fruit|Fruit|  juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as  |orange_juice|Orange_Juice|  and  |tangerine|Tangerine|  juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while  |grapefruit_juice|Grapefruit_Juice| , pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common.  |Coconut_water|Coconut_Water|  is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces  |wine|Wine| .     Fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.     Vegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as  |carrots|Carrot| , tomatoes,  |cucumbers|Cucumber| ,  |celery|Celery|  and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of  |cardiovascular_disease|Cardiovascular_Disease|  and  |cancer|Cancer| .                   A sleep beverage,  |nightcap|Nightcap|  or  |relaxation_drink|Relaxation_Drink|  are considered consumable liquids taken shortly before bedtime to induce  |sleep|Sleep| . They are often formulated to help reduce stress, alleviate anxiety, improve focus, and promote better overall sleep. For example, a small  |alcoholic_drink|Alcoholic_Drink|  or a cup of  |warm_milk|Sleep_Induction|  can supposedly promote a good nights sleep. These consumable sleep supplements are an anomaly or antithesis of  |energy_drinks|Energy_Drink|  and have found a niche in the  |beverage_industry_|Drink_Industry|  Originally, a  |nightcap|Nightcap|  was understood to be an alcoholic liquid with purpose of warming the drinker up and helping them  |sleep|Sleep| . That changed in 1930, when the nonalcoholic   drink,  |Ovaltine|Ovaltine| , was advertised as the worlds best night-cap to ensure sound, natural sleep. An ingredient of  |Ovaltine|Ovaltine|  is  |magnesium|Magnesium|  which helps to induce relaxation. Likewise,  |warm_milk|Warm_Milk|  is often recommended as a  |nightcap|Nightcap|  for inducing  |sleep|Sleep| , because it contains both  |tryptophan|Tryptophan|  and  |calcium|Calcium| . Then, the flavor of the  |warm_milk|Warm_Milk|  was improved by adding a small amount of  |liqueur|Liqueur|  which may promote  |sleep|Sleep|  as well. Alternatively,  |honey|Honey|  or  |vanilla|Vanilla|  can improve the flavor too. The effectiveness of  |warm_milk|Warm_Milk|  for inducing sleep is disputed. Other drinks touted for inducing sleep and being effective sleep aids are  |hops_tea|Thelesperma_Megapotamicum| ,  |cherry_juice|Cherry_Juice|  ,  |coconut|Coconut_Water| |_water|Coconut_Water|  ,  |lemon_balm|Lemon_Balm|  tea, decaffeinated  |green_tea|Green_Tea|  ,  |valerian|Valerian|  tea, and  |chamomile|Chamomile|  tea. Today, however, most sleep beverages,  |nightcaps|Nightcap|  and  |relaxation_drinks|Relaxation_Drink|  are generally non-alcoholic beverages containing calming ingredients normally found in nature. They are considered functional beverages which serve to relax a person. Unlike other calming beverages, such as  |tea|Tea| ,  |warm_milk|Warm_Milk|  or  |milk|Milk|  with  |honey|Honey| ; sleep drinks almost universally contain more than one active ingredient.  |Melatonin|Melatonin|  is a common ingredient found in relaxation drinks which also carries some negative connotations due to the controversial effects from long term use. Sleep beverages,  |nightcaps|Nightcap| , and  |relaxation_drinks|Relaxation_Drink|  have been known to contain other natural ingredients and are usually free of  |caffeine|Caffeine|  and  |alcohol|Alcohol|  but some have claimed to contain  |marijuana|Cannabis| . Sleep beverages,  |nightcaps|Nightcap|  and  |relaxation_drinks|Relaxation_Drink|  started to reappear in  |Japan|Japan|  at the beginning of the 21st century and then began to make their way to the  |US_|United_States|  One major brand was called  |Drank|Drank| , a reference to an illicit concoction made out of cold medication. Others had names like  |Purple_Stuff|Purple_Drank|  and  |Lean|Lean| , which also hinted at vaguely narcotic effects. These brands were marketed towards a partying crowd, yet never managed to break into the mainstream. In the US, the  |Food_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  also moved in, shutting down brands for false health claims.          A drink is considered alcoholic if it contains  |ethanol|Ethanol| , commonly known as  |alcohol|Alcohol|  .  |Beer|Beer|  has been a part of human culture for 8,000 years.      In many countries, imbibing alcoholic drinks in a local  |bar|Bar|  or  |pub|Pub|  is a cultural tradition.           Beer is an  |alcoholic_drink|Alcoholic_Drink|  produced by the  |saccharification|Hydrolysis|  of  |starch|Starch|  and  |fermentation|Fermentation|  of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification  |enzymes|Enzyme|  are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly  |malt|Malt| ed barley and malted wheat. Barth, Roger. The Chemistry of Beer: The Science in the Suds, Wiley 2013: . Most beer is also flavoured with  |hops|Hops| , which  |add_bitterness|Bittering_Agent|  and act as a natural  |preservative|Preservative| , though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called  |brewing|Brewing| . Beer is the worlds most widely consumed  |alcoholic_drink|Alcoholic_Drink| ,  and is the third-most popular drink overall, after  |water|Drinking_Water|  and  |tea|Tea| . It is said to have been discovered by goddess  |Ninkasi|Ninkasi|  around 5300 BCE, when she accidentally discovered yeast after leaving grain in jars that were later rained upon and left for several days. Women have been the chief creators of beer throughout history due to its association with domesticity and it, throughout much of history, being brewed in the home for family consumption. Only in recent history have men began to dabble in the field.   It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented drink.   Joshua J. Mark . . Ancient History Encyclopedia.      Some of humanitys earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the  |Code_of_Hammurabi|Code_Of_Hammurabi|  included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,  and The Hymn to  |Ninkasi|Ninkasi|  , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.   Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant  |multinational_companies|Multinational_Corporation|  and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from  |brewpubs|Brewpubs|  to  |regional_breweries|Regional_Brewery| .        |Cider|Cider|  is a  |fermented|Fermentation| |_alcoholic_drink|Alcoholic_Drink|  made from  |fruit_juice|Fruit_Juice| , most commonly and traditionally  |apple_juice|Apple_Juice| , but also the juice of  |peach|Peach| es,  |pears|Pear|  or other fruit. Cider may be made from any variety of apple, but certain  |cultivars|Cultivar|  grown solely for use in cider are known as  |cider_apples|Cider_Apple| .  The  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world,  , the U.K. produces 600 million litres of cider each year .            |Wine|Wine|  is an  |alcoholic_drink|Alcoholic_Drink|  made from  |fermented|Fermentation| |grapes|Grape|  or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of  |sugars|Sugar| ,  |acids|Acid| ,  |enzymes|Enzyme| , water, or other  |nutrients|Nutrient| .   |Yeast_consumes_the_sugars|Yeast_In_Winemaking|  in the grapes and converts them into  |alcohol|Ethanol|  and  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| . Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation,  |terroir|Terroir|  and subsequent  |appellation|Appellation| , along with human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.     Wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced  and are generically called  |fruit_wine|Fruit_Wine| . The term wine can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified drinks having higher alcohol content, such as  |barley_wine|Barley_Wine| ,  |huangjiu|Huangjiu| , or  |sake|Sake| .     Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred   BC in  |Georgia|Georgia| .   It had reached the  |Balkans|Balkans|  by   BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient  |Greece|Ancient_Greece_And_Wine|  and  |Rome|Ancient_Rome_And_Wine| .     From its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion.  |Red_wine|Red_Wine|  was closely associated with  |blood|Blood|  by the  |ancient_Egyptians|Ancient_Egyptians| , who, according to  |Plutarch|Plutarch| , avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC  |Saite_dynasty|Saite_Dynasty| , thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods .  The  |Greek|Ancient_Greek_Religion| |_cult|Cult_Of_Dionysus|  and  |mysteries|Dionysian_Mysteries|  of  |Dionysus|Dionysus| , carried on by the  |Romans|Ancient_Romans|  in their  |Bacchanalia|Bacchanalia| , were the origins of western  |theater|Theater| .  |Judaism|Judaism|  incorporates it in the  |Kiddush|Kiddush|  and  |Christianity|Christianity|  in its  |Eucharist|Eucharist| , while alcohol consumption was forbidden in  |Islam|Islam| .          Spirits are  |distilled_beverages|Distilled_Beverage|  that contain no  |added_sugar|Added_Sugar|  and have at least 20%  |alcohol_by_volume|Alcohol_By_Volume|  . Popular spirits include  |borovička|Borovička| ,  |brandy|Brandy| ,  |gin|Gin| ,  |rum|Rum| ,  |slivovitz|Slivovitz| ,  |tequila|Tequila| ,  |vodka|Vodka| , and  |whisky|Whisky| . Brandy is a spirit created by distilling wine, whilst vodka may be distilled from any  |starch|Starch| - or  |sugar|Sugar| -rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from  |grains|Cereal|  such as  |sorghum|Sorghum| ,  |corn|Maize| ,  |rye|Rye|  or  |wheat|Wheat| .      Coffee       Coffee is a  |brewed|Drip_Brew|  drink prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an  |evergreen|Evergreen| |_shrub|Shrub|  of the  |genus|Genus|   Coffea . The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded  Coffea arabica , and the robusta form of the hardier  Coffea canephora . Coffee plants are cultivated in  |more_than_70_countries|List_Of_Countries_By_Coffee_Production| . Once ripe, coffee  |_berries_|Epigynous_Berries|  are picked, processed, and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.     Coffee is slightly  |acidic|Acidic|   and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its  |caffeine|Caffeine|  content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world.  It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies; however, results have varied in terms of coffees relative benefit.      Coffee cultivation first took place in southern  |Arabia|Arabia| ; the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the  |Sufi|Sufism|  shrines of  |Yemen|Yemen| .           Hot chocolate, also known as drinking chocolate or cocoa, is a heated drink consisting of shaved  |chocolate|Chocolate| , melted chocolate or  |cocoa_powder|Cocoa_Solids| , heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.      The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the  |Mayans|Maya_Civilization|  around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of  |Aztec|Aztec|  culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl.   The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the  |New_World|New_World|  and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.     Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including  |cafeterias|Cafeteria| ,  |fast_food_restaurants|Fast_Food_Restaurant| ,  |coffeehouses|Coffeehouse|  and  |teahouses|Teahouse| . Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at  |grocery_stores|Grocery_Store|  and  |online|Online| .             Tea, the second most consumed drink in the world, is produced from infusing dried leaves of the camellia sinensis shrub, in boiling water.  There are many ways in which tea is prepared for consumption: lemon or milk and sugar are among the most common additives worldwide. Other additions include butter and salt in  |Bhutan|Bhutan| ,  |Nepal|Nepal| , and  |Tibet|Tibet| ;  |bubble_tea|Bubble_Tea|  in  |Taiwan|Taiwan| ; fresh ginger in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; mint in North Africa and  |Senegal|Senegalese_Tea_Culture| ; cardamom in Central Asia; rum to make  |Jagertee|Jagertee|  in Central Europe; and coffee to make  |yuanyang|Yuanyang|  in Hong Kong. Tea is also served differently from country to country: in  |China|China|  and  |Japan|Japan|  tiny cups are used to serve tea; in Thailand and the United States tea is often served cold or with a lot of sweetener; Indians boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as  |masala_chai|Masala_Chai| ; tea is brewed with a  |samovar|Samovar|  in Iran,  |Kashmir|Kashmir| , Russia and Turkey; and in the Australian  |Outback|Outback|  it is traditionally brewed in a  |billycan|Billycan| .    Tea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different. Chinese yellow and green tea are steamed, roasted and dried; Oolong tea is semi-oxidised and appears green-black and black teas are fully oxidised.      Around the world, people refer to other herbal infusions as teas ; it is also argued that these were popular long before the Camellia sinensis shrub was used for tea making.  Leaves, flowers, roots or bark can be used to make a herbal infusion and can be bought fresh, dried or powdered.               Throughout history, people have come together in establishments to socialise whilst drinking. This includes cafés and  |coffeehouses|Coffeehouse| , focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| , and in  |West_Asia|West_Asia| n immigrant districts in the  |Western_world|Western_World| , offer shisha , flavored tobacco smoked through a  |hookah|Hookah| .  |Espresso_bars|Coffeehouseespresso_Bars|  are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving  |espresso|Espresso|  and espresso-based drinks.     In China and Japan, the establishment would be a  |tea_house|Tea_House| , were people would socialise whilst drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse for places of sharing ideas.     Alcoholic drinks are served in  |drinking_establishments|Drinking_Establishments| , which have different cultural connotations. For example,  |pubs|Pub|  are fundamental to the culture of  |Britain|British_Culture| ,  Britannica.com; Subscription Required. Retrieved 3 July 2008.   |Ireland|Culture_Of_Irelandfood_And_Drink| ,   |Australia|Australian_Culture| ,  Convict Creations.

In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of  |Samuel_Pepys|Samuel_Pepys|  describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so  |cask_ale|Cask_Ale|  or  |keg_beer|Keg_Beer|  may be a better value than wines and spirits.     In contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed dive bars , Todd Dayton,  to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide  |stools|Bar_Stool|  or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term bar is derived from the  |specialized_counter|Bar|  on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians,  |go_go_dancers|Go_Go_Dancing| , or  |strippers|Striptease| . Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the  |bartender|Bartender| , or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.              |Food|Food|  and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. M. Oldman Oldmans Guide to Outsmarting Wine pg 219-235 Penguin Books 2004  In recent years, food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.
