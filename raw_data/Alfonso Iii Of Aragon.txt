      Alfonso III , called the Liberal  or the Free , was the  |King_of_Aragon|King_Of_Aragon|  and  |Count_of_Barcelona|Count_Of_Barcelona|   from 1285. He conquered the  |Kingdom_of_Majorca|Kingdom_Of_Majorca|  between his succession and 1287.     He was a son of King  |Peter_III_of_Aragon|Peter_Iii_Of_Aragon|  and  |Constance|Constance_Of_Sicily,_Queen_Of_Aragon| , daughter and heiress of King  |Manfred_of_Sicily|Manfred_Of_Sicily| .     Soon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the  |Balearic_Islands|Balearic_Islands|  into the  |Kingdom_of_Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon|  - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather,  |James_I_of_Aragon|James_I_Of_Aragon| . Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle,  |James_II_of_Majorca|James_Ii_Of_Majorca| , and conquered both Majorca and Ibiza , effectively reassuming suzerainty over the  |Kingdom_of_Majorca|Kingdom_Of_Majorca| . He followed this with the conquest of  |Menorca|Menorca|  - until then, an autonomous  |Muslim|Muslim|  state within the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Menorcas national holiday.     He initially sought to maintain Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother,  |James_II_of_Aragon|James_Ii_Of_Aragon| . However, he later retracted the support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the  |Papal_States|Papal_States|  France.     His reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the  |Union_of_Aragon|Union_Of_Aragon|  - the so-called Magna Carta of Aragon , which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.     During his lifetime a dynastic marriage with  |Eleanor|Eleanor_Of_England| , daughter of King  |Edward_I_of_England|Edward_I_Of_England| , was arranged. However Alfonso died before meeting his bride. He died at the age of 25 in 1291, and was buried in the Franciscan convent in Barcelona; since 1852 his remains have been buried in Barcelona Cathedral.         |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri| , in  |the_Divine_Comedy|The_Divine_Comedy| , recounts that he saw Alfonsos spirit seated outside the gates of  |Purgatory|Purgatory|  with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of  |Europe|Europe|  during the 13th century.
