|_Myanmar|Myanmar|   is a  |unitary|Unitary_State| |_parliamentary_republic|Parliamentary_Republic|  under its  |constitution_of_2008|2008_Constitution_Of_Myanmar| .  The  |military_of_Burma|Military_Of_Burma|  holds a large amount of power in the government, despite the end of the last  |Burmese_military_dictatorship|Burmese_Military_Dictatorship| .        |Myanmar|Myanmar| , formerly called Burma, was a  |monarchy|Monarchy|  which was ruled by various dynasties prior to the 19th century. The British colonized Burma in the late 19th century, and it was part of  |British_India|British_India|  until 1937.     Burma was ruled as a British colony from 1824 until 1948. While the Bamar heartland was directly administered, first as a part of India and then, from 1937, as British Burma, ethnic regions outside the heartland were allowed some measure of self-rule along the lines of the  |Princely_States|Princely_States|  of India. This led to split loyalties among the various ethnic groups to outside powers in Burma either to the British or Japanese. The dominant ethnic group in Burma are the  |Bamar|Bamar| , who make up approximately sixty-eight percent of the population. During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , many members of the Bamar ethnic group volunteered to fight alongside the Japanese in hopes of overthrowing the occupying British forces.     Meanwhile, many other ethnic groups supported the Allied forces in combating the Japanese and Burman forces. This conflict would come to be very significant in the aftermath of World War Two when Burma was granted its independence from Great Britain in 1948. By granting independence to Burma, the British government gave the new ruler,  |Aung_San|Aung_San| , control over areas that were not traditionally controlled by the Bamar. This conglomeration of formerly British-owned land created a state that is home to over twenty distinct minority ethnic groups.     From the time of the signing of the Burmese Constitution in 1948, ethnic minorities have been denied Constitutional rights, access to land that was traditionally controlled by their people and participation in the government. The various ethnic minority groups have been consistently oppressed by the dominant Burman majority and have also suffered at the hands of warlords and regional ethnic alliances. Religion also plays a role in the ethnic conflicts that have taken place. Muslims, Hindus, Christians and Buddhists all live in Burma. These religious differences have led to several incidents that have affected hundreds of thousands of citizens that live in Burma.     The  |SPDC|State_Peace_And_Development_Council|  had been responsible for the displacement of several hundred thousand citizens, both inside and outside of Burma. The Karen, Karenni, and Mon ethnic groups have been forced to seek asylum in neighbouring Thailand, where they are also abused by an unfriendly and unsympathetic government. These groups are perhaps more fortunate than the Wa and Shan ethnic groups who have become Internally Displaced Peoples in their own state since being removed from lands by the military junta in 2000. There are reportedly 600,000 of these Internally Displaced Peoples living in Burma today. Many are trying to escape forced labour in the military or for one of the many state-sponsored drug cartels. This displacement of peoples has led to both human rights violations as well as the exploitation of minority ethnic groups at the hands of the dominant Burman group. The primary actors in these ethnic struggles include but are not limited to the Government of Burma , the  |Karen_National_Union|Karen_National_Union|  and the  |Mong_Tai_Army|Mong_Tai_Army| .         On 4 January 1948,  |Burma|Myanmar|  achieved independence from Britain, and became a democracy based on the  |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System| .     In late 1946 Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But on 19 July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members. On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent  |republic|Republic| , named the Union of Burma, with  |Sao_Shwe_Thaik|Sao_Shwe_Thaik|  as its first president and  |U_Nu|U_Nu|  as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies, it did not become a member of the  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| . A  |bicameral|Bicameral| |_parliament|Parliament|  was formed, consisting of a  |Chamber_of_Deputies|Chamber_Of_Deputies|  and a  |Chamber_of_Nationalities|Chamber_Of_Nationalities| .  The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma proper, which consisted of  |Lower_Burma|Lower_Burma|  and  |Upper_Burma|Upper_Burma| , and the  |Frontier_Areas|Frontier_Areas| , which had been administered separately by the British.        In 1961,  |U_Thant|U_Thant| , Burmas Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former secretary to the Prime Minister, was elected  |Secretary_General_of_the_United_Nations|Secretary_General_Of_The_United_Nations| ; he was the first non-Westerner to head any international organisation and would serve as UN Secretary-General for ten years.   Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was Secretary-General was a young  |Aung_San_Suu_Kyi|Aung_San_Suu_Kyi| .       In 1962, General  |Ne_Win|Ne_Win|  led a  |coup_détat|Coup_Détat|  and established a nominally socialist military government that sought to follow the Burmese Way to Socialism . The military expropriated private businesses and followed an economic policy of  |autarky|Autarky| , or economic isolation.     There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up demonstrations at  |Rangoon_University|Rangoon_University| , killing 15 students. In 1974, the military violently suppressed anti-government protests at the funeral of  |U_Thant|U_Thant| . Student protests in 1975, 1976 and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force.       The former  |Head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  was  |Senior_General_Than_Shwe|Than_Shwe|  who held the title of Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council . His appointed  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister|  was  |Khin_Nyunt|Khin_Nyunt|  until 19 October 2004, when he was forcibly deposed in favour of  |Gen_Soe_Win|Soe_Win| . Almost all  |cabinet|Cabinet|  offices are held by military officers.     US and European government sanctions against the military government, combined with consumer boycotts and shareholder pressure organised by Free Burma activists, have succeeded in forcing most western corporations to withdraw from Burma. However, some western oil companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions. For example, the French oil company  |Total_S_A_|Total_S_A_|  and the American oil company  |Chevron|Chevron_Corporation|  continue to operate the  |Yadana_natural_gas_pipeline|Yadana_Project|  from Burma to Thailand. Total is the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for alleged complicity in human rights abuses along the gas pipeline. Before it was acquired by Chevron,  |Unocal|Unocal|  settled a similar lawsuit for a reported multimillion-dollar amount.  Asian businesses, such as  |Daewoo|Daewoo| , continue to invest in Burma, particularly in natural resource extraction.     The United States and European clothing and shoe industry became the target of Free Burma activists for buying from factories in Burma that were wholly or partly owned by the government or the military. Many stopped sourcing from Burma after protests, starting with  |Levi_Strauss|Levi_Strauss|  in 1992. From 1992 to 2003, Free Burma activists successfully forced dozens of clothing and shoe companies to stop sourcing from Burma. These companies included  |Eddie_Bauer|Eddie_Bauer| ,  |Liz_Claiborne|Liz_Claiborne| ,  |Macys|Macys| ,  |J_Crew|J_Crew| ,  |JoS_A_Banks|Jos_A_Bank_Clothiers| ,  |Childrens_Place|Childrens_Place| ,  |Burlington_Coat_Factory|Burlington_Coat_Factory| ,  |Wal_Mart|Wal_Mart| , and  |Target|Target_Corporation| . The US government banned all imports from Burma as part of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Sanctions have been criticised for their adverse effects on the civilian population. However, Burmese democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly credited sanctions for putting pressure on the ruling military regime.        |Human_Rights_Watch|Human_Rights_Watch|  and  |Amnesty_International|Amnesty_International|  have documented egregious  |human_rights|Human_Rights|  abuses by the military government.  Civil liberties are severely restricted.  |Human_Rights_Defenders_and_Promoters|Human_Rights_Defenders_And_Promoters| , formed in 2002 to raise awareness among the people of Burma about their human rights, claims that on 18 April 2007, several of its members were met by approximately a hundred people led by a local  |USDA|Union_Solidarity_And_Development_Association|  Secretary U Nyunt Oo and beaten up. The HRDP believes that this attack was condoned by the authorities.     There is no independent  |judiciary|Judiciary|  in Burma  and the military government suppresses political activity. The government uses software-based filtering from US company  |Fortinet|Fortinet|  to limit the materials citizens can access on-line, including free email services, free web hosting and most political opposition and pro-democracy pages.      In 2001, the government permitted NLD office branches to re-open throughout Burma. However, they were shut down or heavily restricted beginning 2004, as part of a government campaign to prohibit such activities. In 2006, many members resigned from NLD, citing harassment and pressure from the  |Tatmadaw|Tatmadaw|  and the  |Union_Solidarity_and_Development_Association|Union_Solidarity_And_Development_Association| .     The military government placed  |Aung_San_Suu_Kyi|Aung_San_Suu_Kyi|  under house arrest again on 31 May 2003, following an attack on her convoy in northern Burma by a mob reported to be in league with the military. The regime extended her house arrest for yet another year in late November 2005. Despite a direct appeal by  |Kofi_Annan|Kofi_Annan|  to  |Than_Shwe|Than_Shwe|  and pressure from  |ASEAN|Asean| , the Burmese government extended Aung San Suu Kyis house arrest another year on 27 May 2006.   She was released in 2010.      The United Nations urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation, the restoration of democracy, and full respect for human rights.   27 May 2007. In December 2008, the  |United_Nations_General_Assembly|United_Nations_General_Assembly|  passed a resolution condemning the  |human_rights_situation_in_Burma|Human_Rights_In_Burma|  and calling for Aug San Suu Kyis release—80 countries voting for the resolution, 25 against and 45 abstentions. . Taipei Times. 26 December 2008 Other nations, such as China and Russia, have been less critical of the regime and prefer to co-operate on economic matters. . Daily Times of Pakistan. 25 March 2009      Facing increasing  |international_isolation|International_Isolation| , Burmas military government agreed to embark upon a  |programme_of_reform|Reforms_In_Burma| , including permitting multiple political parties to contest elections in 2010 and 2012 and the release of  |political_prisoners|Political_Prisoners| . However, organisations such as  |Human_Rights_Watch|Human_Rights_Watch|  allege continued human rights abuses in ongoing conflicts in border regions such as  |Kachin_State|Kachin_State| .        Myanmars army-drafted  |constitution|Constitution_Of_Burma|  was overwhelmingly approved on 10 May 2008 in the first phase of a  |two_stage_referendum|2008_Burmese_Constitutional_Referendum|  and  |Cyclone_Nargis|Cyclone_Nargis| . It was the first national vote since the  |1990_election|1990_Burmese_General_Election| . Multi-party  |elections_in_2010|2010_Burmese_General_Election|  would end 5 decades of military rule, as the new charter gives the military an automatic 25% of seats in parliament. NLD spokesman Nyan Win, inter alia, criticised the referendum: This referendum was full of cheating and fraud across the country. In some villages, authorities and polling station officials ticked the ballots themselves and did not let the voters do anything .           An election was held in 2010, with 40 parties approved to contest the elections by the Electoral Commission.  some of which are linked to  |ethnic_minorities|List_Of_Ethnic_Groups_In_Burma| . .  |Reuters|Reuters| .  2010 The  |National_League_for_Democracy|National_League_For_Democracy| , which overwhelmingly won the previous  |1990_elections|1990_Burmese_General_Election|  but were never allowed to take power, decided not to participate.     The military-backed  |Union_Solidarity_and_Development_Party|Union_Solidarity_And_Development_Party|  declared victory, winning 259 of the 330 contested seats. The United Nations and many Western countries have condemned the elections as fraudulent,  although the decision to hold elections was praised by China and Russia.            In by-elections held in 2012, the main opposition party  |National_League_for_Democracy|National_League_For_Democracy| , which was only re-registered for the by-elections on 13 December 2011 won in 43 of the 44 seats they contested . Significantly, international observers were invited to monitor the elections, although the government was criticised for placing too many restrictions on election monitors,  some of whom were denied visas.      The Union Solidarity and Development Party said it would lodge official complaints to the  |Union_Election_Commission|Union_Election_Commission|  on poll irregularities, voter intimidation, and purported campaign incidents that involved National League for Democracy members and supporters,  while the National League for Democracy also sent an official complaint to the commission, regarding ballots that had been tampered with.      However, President  |Thein_Sein|Thein_Sein|  remarked that the by-elections were conducted in a very successful manner ,  and many foreign countries have indicated willingness to lift or loosen sanctions on Burma and its military leaders.             Myanmar general elections were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since 1990. The results gave the  |National_League_for_Democracy|National_League_For_Democracy|  an  |absolute_majority|Absolute_Majority|  of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader  |Aung_San_Suu_Kyi|Aung_San_Suu_Kyi|  is constitutionally barred from the presidency.      The resounding victory of Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy in 2015 general elections has raised hope for a successful political transition from a closely held military rule to a free  |democratic_system|Democratic_System| . This transition is widely believed to be determining the future of Myanmar.           |President|President_Of_Myanmar| |_Win_Myint|Win_Myint| |_National_League_for_Democracy|National_League_For_Democracy| |_State_Counsellor|State_Counsellor_Of_Myanmar| |_Aung_San_Suu_Kyi|Aung_San_Suu_Kyi| |_National_League_for_Democracy|National_League_For_Democracy| |_Vice_President|Vice_President_Of_Myanmar| |_Myint_Swe|Myint_Swe| |_Union_Solidarity_and_Development_Party|Union_Solidarity_And_Development_Party| |_Vice_President|Vice_President_Of_Myanmar| |_Henry_Van_Thio|Henry_Van_Thio| |_National_League_for_Democracy|National_League_For_Democracy| |_anm|Anm| |anm|Anm| |anm|Anm| a Pyithu Hluttaw  Amyotha Hluttaw b |ief_justi|Ief_Justi| |torney_gener|Torney_Gener| Wareru seized Martaban in 1281 and obtained the recognition of China as the ruler of Lower Burma and founded a kingdom which lasted until 1539.
