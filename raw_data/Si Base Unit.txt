         The SI base units are seven  |units_of_measure|Unit_Of_Measurement|  defined by the  |International_System_of_Units|International_System_Of_Units|  as the basic set from which all other  |SI_units|Si_Units|  can be  |derived|Si_Derived_Unit| . The units and their physical quantities are the  |second|Second|  for  |time|Time| , the  |metre|Meter|  for measurement of  |length|Length| , the  |kilogram|Kilogram|  for  |mass|Mass| , the  |ampere|Ampere|  for  |electric_current|Electric_Current| , the  |kelvin|Kelvin|  for  |temperature|Temperature| , the  |mole|Mole|  for  |amount_of_substance|Amount_Of_Substance| , and the  |candela|Candela|  for  |luminous_intensity|Luminous_Intensity| .     The SI base units form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by  |dimensional_analysis|Dimensional_Analysis|  commonly employed in science and technology.     The names and symbols of SI base units are written in lowercase, except the symbols of those named after a person, which are written with an initial capital letter. For example, the metre  has the symbol m, but the  kelvin  has symbol K, because it is named after  |Lord_Kelvin|William_Thomson,_1St_Baron_Kelvin|  and the  ampere  with symbol A is named after  |André-Marie_Ampère|André-Marie_Ampère| .     A number of other units, such as the  |litre|Litre|  ,  |astronomical_unit|Astronomical_Unit|  and  |electronvolt|Electronvolt| , are not formally part of the SI, but are  |accepted_for_use_with_SI|Non-Si_Units_Mentioned_In_The_Si| .       On 20 May 2019, as the final act of the  |2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units|2019_Redefinition_Of_The_Si_Base_Units| , the  |BIPM|International_Bureau_Of_Weights_And_Measures|  officially introduced the following new definitions, replacing the  |preceding_definitions_of_the_SI_base_units|2005-2019_Definitions_Of_The_Si_Base_Units| .                        New definitions of the base units were approved on 16 November 2018, and took effect 20 May 2019. The definitions of the base units have been modified several times since the  |Metre_Convention|Metre_Convention|  in 1875, and new additions of base units have occurred. Since the redefinition of the metre in 1960, the kilogram had been the only base unit still defined directly in terms of a physical artefact, rather than a property of nature. This led to a number of the other SI base units being defined indirectly in terms of the mass of the same artefact; the  |mole|Mole| , the  |ampere|Ampere| , and the  |candela|Candela|  were linked through their definitions to the mass of the  |International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram|International_Prototype_Kilogram| , a roughly golfball-sized  |platinum|Platinum| – |iridium|Iridium|  cylinder stored in a vault near Paris.     It has long been an objective in  |metrology|Metrology|  to define the kilogram in terms of a  |fundamental_constant|Physical_Constant| , in the same way that the metre is now defined in terms of the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light| . The 21st  |General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures|General_Conference_On_Weights_And_Measures|  placed these efforts on an official footing, and recommended that national laboratories continue their efforts to refine experiments that link the unit of mass to fundamental or atomic constants with a view to a future redefinition of the kilogram . Two possibilities attracted particular attention: the  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant|  and the  |Avogadro_constant|Avogadro_Constant| .     In 2005, the  |International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures|International_Committee_For_Weights_And_Measures|  approved preparation of new definitions for the kilogram, the ampere, and the kelvin and it noted the possibility of a new definition of the mole based on the Avogadro constant. 94th Meeting of the  |International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures|International_Committee_For_Weights_And_Measures|  .   The 23rd CGPM decided to postpone any formal change until the next General Conference in 2011. 23rd  |General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures|General_Conference_On_Weights_And_Measures|  . .      In a note to the CIPM in October 2009,  Ian Mills, the President of the CIPM Consultative Committee – Units catalogued the uncertainties of the fundamental constants of physics according to the current definitions and their values under the proposed  |new_definition|New_Si_Definitions| . He urged the CIPM to accept the proposed changes in the definition of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole so that they are referenced to the values of the fundamental constants, namely the  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant|  , the  |electron_charge|Electron_Charge|  , the  |Boltzmann_constant|Boltzmann_Constant|  , and the  |Avogadro_constant|Avogadro_Constant|  .
