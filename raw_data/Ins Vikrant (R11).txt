                   INS Vikrant  was a  of the  |Indian_Navy|Indian_Navy| . The ship was  |laid_down|Keel_Laying|  as HMS Hercules for the British  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , but construction was put on hold when the war ended. India purchased the incomplete carrier in 1957, and construction was completed in 1961. Vikrant was  |commissioned|Ship_Commissioning|  as the first  |aircraft_carrier|Aircraft_Carrier|  of the Indian Navy and played a key role in enforcing the  |naval_blockade|Naval_Blockade|  of  |East_Pakistan|East_Pakistan|  during the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1971| .     In its later years, the ship underwent major refits to embark modern aircraft, before being  |decommissioned|Ship_Decommissioning|  in January 1997. She was preserved as a  |museum_ship|Museum_Ship|  in  |Cuffe_Parade|Cuffe_Parade| ,  |Mumbai|Mumbai|  until 2012. In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction and  |scrapped|Ship_Breaking|  in November 2014 after final clearance from the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_India| .            In 1943 the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  commissioned six  |light_aircraft_carriers|Light_Aircraft_Carrier|  in an effort to counter the  |German|Kriegsmarine|  and  |Japanese|Imperial_Japanese_Navy|  navies. The  |1942_Design_Light_Fleet_Carrier|1942_Design_Light_Fleet_Carrier| , commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized  |fleet_aircraft_carriers|Fleet_Aircraft_Carrier|  and the less expensive but limited-capability  |escort_carriers|Escort_Carrier| .     Sixteen light fleet carriers were ordered, and all were  |laid_down|Keel_Laying|  as what became the Colossus class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the Majestic class. The improvements from the Colossus class to the Majestic class included heavier displacement, armament,  |catapult|Aircraft_Catapult| ,  |aircraft_lifts|Elevatoraircraft_Elevators|  and aircraft capacity. Construction on the ships was suspended at the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navys peacetime requirements.   Instead, the carriers were modernized and sold to several  |Commonwealth_nations|Commonwealth_Nations| . The ships were similar, but each varied depending on the requirements of the country to which the ship was sold.     HMS Hercules, the fifth ship in the Majestic class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by  |Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrongs|  on the  |River_Tyne|River_Tyne| . After World War II ended with  |Japans_surrender|Japanese_Instrument_Of_Surrender|  on 2 September 1945, she was  |launched|Ship_Naming_And_Launching|  on 22 September, and her construction was suspended in May 1946.  At the time of suspension, she was 75 per cent complete. Her hull was preserved, and in May 1947 she was  |laid_up|:Wikt:Laid_Up|  in  |Gareloch|Gare_Loch| |off_the_Clyde|Firth_Of_Clyde| . In January 1957, she was purchased by India and was towed to  |Belfast|Belfast|  to complete her construction and modifications by  |Harland_and_Wolff|Harland_And_Wolff| . Several improvements to the original design were ordered by the Indian Navy, including an angled deck,  |steam_catapults|Steam_Catapult| , and a modified  |island|Aircraft_Carrierstructure| .         Vikrant displaced  at  |standard_load|Displacement_Standard_Displacement|  and  at  |deep_load|Deep_Load| . She had an  |overall_length|Length_Overall|  of , a  |beam|Beam|  of  and a mean deep  |draught|Draft|  of . She was powered by a pair of  |Parsons|Parsons_Marine_Steam_Turbine_Company| |geared_steam_turbines|Steam_Turbine| , driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by four  |Admiralty_three-drum_boilers|Three-Drum_Boileradmiralty_Boiler| . The turbines developed a total of  which gave a maximum speed of . Vikrant carried about  of fuel oil that gave her a range of  at , and  at . The air and ship crew comprised 1,110 officers and men.      The ship was armed with sixteen   |Bofors_anti-aircraft_guns|Bofors_40_Mm_Gun| , but these were later reduced to eight. At various times, its aircraft consisted of  |Hawker_Sea_Hawk|Hawker_Sea_Hawk|  and  |Sea_Harrier|Sea_Harrier| |jet_fighters|Jet_Fighter| ,  |Sea_King_Mk_42B|Westland_Sea_Kingindia|  and  |HAL_Chetak|Hal_Chetak| |helicopters|Helicopter| , and  |Breguet_Alizé|Breguet_Alizé|  Br.1050  |anti-submarine_aircraft|Anti-Submarine_Warfare| .  The carrier fielded between 21 and 23 aircraft of all types.  Vikrants  |flight_decks|Flight_Deck|  were designed to handle aircraft up to , but  remained the heaviest landing weight of an aircraft. Larger  lifts were installed.     The ship was equipped with one LW-05 air-search  |radar|Radar| , one ZW-06 surface-search radar, one LW-10 tactical radar and one Type 963 aircraft landing radar with other communication systems.       The Indian Navys first aircraft carrier was  |commissioned|Ship_Commissioning|  as INS Vikrant on 4 March 1961 in Belfast by  |Vijaya_Lakshmi_Pandit|Vijaya_Lakshmi_Pandit| , the  |Indian_High_Commissioner_to_the_United_Kingdom|List_Of_High_Commissioners_Of_India_To_The_United_Kingdom| . The name Vikrant was derived from the  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit|  word vikrānta meaning stepping beyond , courageous or bold . Captain Pritam Singh Mahindroo was the first commanding officer of the ship, which carried British Hawker Sea Hawk fighter-bombers and French Alizé anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on her deck. It was piloted by Lieutenant  |Radhakrishna_Hariram_Tahiliani|Radhakrishna_Hariram_Tahiliani| , who later served as admiral and  |Chief_of_the_Naval_Staff_of_India|Chief_Of_The_Naval_Staff|  from 1984 to 1987. Vikrant formally joined the Indian Navys fleet in Bombay  on 3 November 1961, when she was received at  |Ballard_Pier|Ballard_Pier|  by then  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_India| |Jawaharlal_Nehru|Jawaharlal_Nehru| .     In December of that year, the ship was deployed for  |Operation_Vijay|Annexation_Of_Goa|  off the coast of Goa with two  |destroyers|Destroyer| ,  and . Vikrant did not see action, and patrolled along the coast to deter foreign interference.  During the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1965| , Vikrant was in  |dry_dock|Dry_Dock|  refitting, and did not see any action.     In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the  |Naval_Dockyard|Naval_Dockyard| , Bombay, due to many internal  |fatigue_cracks|Fatigue|  and fissures in the water drums of her boilers that could not be repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.     The ship began preliminary  |sea_trials|Sea_Trial|  on 18 March and returned two days later. Trials were again conducted on 26–27 April. The navy decided to limit the boilers to a pressure of  and the propeller revolutions to 120 RPM ahead and 80 RPM astern, reducing the ships speed to . With the growing expectations of a  |war_with_Pakistan|Indo-Pakistani_Wars_And_Conflicts|  in the near future, the navy started to transfer its ships to strategically advantageous locations in Indian waters. The primary concern of Naval Headquarters about the operation was the serviceability of Vikrant. When asked his opinion regarding the involvement of Vikrant in the war, Fleet Operations Officer Captain  |Gulab_Mohanlal_Hiranandani|Gulab_Mohanlal_Hiranandani|  told the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral  |Sardarilal_Mathradas_Nanda|S._M._Nanda|      Nanda and Hiranandani proved to be instrumental in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the  |Pakistan_Navy|Pakistan_Navy|  posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14  |knots|Knot| .             As a part of preparations for the war, Vikrant was assigned to the  |Eastern_Naval_Command|Eastern_Naval_Command| , then to the Eastern Fleet. This fleet consisted of INS Vikrant, the two s  and , the two  |Petya_III-class|Arnala-Class_Corvette| |corvettes|Corvette|   and , and one submarine, . The main reason behind strengthening the Eastern Fleet was to counter the Pakistani maritime forces deployed in support of military operations in  |East_Bengal|East_Bengal| . A surveillance area of , confined by a triangle with a base of  and sides of  and , was set up in the  |Bay_of_Bengal|Bay_Of_Bengal| . Any ship in this area was to be challenged and checked. If found to be neutral, it would be escorted to the nearest Indian port, otherwise, it would be captured, and taken as a  |war_prize|War_Prize| .     In the meantime, intelligence reports confirmed that Pakistan was to deploy a US-built , . Ghazi was considered as a serious threat to Vikrant by the Indian Navy, as Vikrants approximate position would be known by the Pakistanis once she started operating aircraft. Of the four available surface ships, INS Kavaratti had no  |sonar|Sonar| , which meant that the other three had to remain in close vicinity  of Vikrant, without which the carrier would be completely vulnerable to attack by Ghazi.     On 23 July, Vikrant sailed off to  |Cochin|Cochin|  in company with the Western Fleet. En route, before reaching Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After the completion of the radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for  |Madras|Madras| , escorted by Brahmaputra and Beas. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an  |Alizé|Bréguet_1050_Alizé|  without compromising the speed restrictions. The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Alizé aircraft would have to land at close to  |stalling|Stall|  speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.          By the end of September, Vikrant and her escorts reached  |Port_Blair|Port_Blair| . En route to  |Visakhapatnam|Visakhapatnam| , tactical exercises were conducted in the presence of the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, Vikrant set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26–27 October at Vishakhapatnam. Vikrant then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the  |Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands|Andaman_And_Nicobar_Islands| . To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail Vikrant to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that Vikrant was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.     On 23 November, an emergency was declared in Pakistan after a clash of Indian and Pakistani troops in  |East_Pakistan|East_Pakistan|  two days earlier. On 2 December, the Eastern Fleet proceeded to its patrol area in anticipation of an attack by Pakistan. The Pakistan Navy had deployed Ghazi on 14 November with the explicit goal of targeting and sinking Vikrant, and Ghazi reached a location near Madras by the 23rd. In an attempt to deceive the Pakistan Navy and Ghazi, Indias Naval Headquarters deployed Rajput as a decoy—the ship sailed  off the coast of Vishakhapatnam and broadcast a significant amount of radio traffic, making her appear to be Vikrant.     Ghazi, meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances. On the night of 3–4 December, a muffled underwater explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a  |clearance_diving_team|Clearance_Diver|  was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that Ghazi had sunk in shallow waters.     The reason for Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navys official historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed the position of the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to  |periscope_depth|Periscopenaval_Use|  to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to  |crash_dive|Crash_Dive| , which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: on the night of the explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two  |depth_charges|Depth_Charge|  on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when Ghazi was laying  |mines|Naval_Mine|  on the day before hostilities broke out.     Vikrant was redeployed towards  |Chittagong|Chittagong|  at the outbreak of hostilities. On 4 December, the ships Sea Hawks struck shipping in Chittagong and  |Coxs_Bazar|Coxs_Bazar|  harbours, sinking or incapacitating most of the ships present. Later strikes targeted  |Khulna|Khulna|  and the  |Port_of_Mongla|Port_Of_Mongla| , which continued until 10 December, while other operations were flown to support a naval blockade of East Pakistan. On 14 December, the Sea Hawks attacked the  |cantonment|Cantonment|  area in Chittagong, destroying several Pakistani army barracks. Medium anti-aircraft fire was encountered during this strike. Simultaneous attacks by Alizés continued on Coxs Bazar. After this, Vikrants fuel levels dropped to less than 25 per cent, and the aircraft carrier sailed to  |Paradip|Paradip|  for refueling. The crew of INS Vikrant earned two  |Maha_Vir_Chakras|Maha_Vir_Chakra|  and twelve  |Vir_Chakra|Vir_Chakra|  gallantry medals for their part in the war.            Vikrant did not see much service after the war, and was given two major modernisation  |refits|Refit| —the first one from 1979 to 1981 and the second one from 1987 to 1989. In the first phase, her boilers, radars, communication systems and anti-aircraft guns were modernised, and facilities to operate Sea Harriers were installed. In the second phase, facilities to operate the new Sea Harrier Vertical/Short Take Off and Land fighter aircraft and the new Sea King Mk 42B Anti-Submarine Warfare helicopters were introduced. A 9.75-degree  |ski-jump_ramp|Aircraft_Ski-Jump|  was fitted. The  |steam_catapult|Steam_Catapult|  was removed during this phase. Again in 1991, Vikrant underwent a six-month refit, followed by another fourteen-month refit in 1992–94. She remained operational thereafter, flying Sea Harriers, Sea Kings and Chetaks until her final sea outing on 23 November 1994. In the same year, a fire was also recorded aboard. In January 1995, the navy decided to keep Vikrant in safe to float state. She was  |laid_up|Laid_Up|  and formally decommissioned on 31 January 1997.         During her service, INS Vikrant embarked four squadrons of the Naval Air Arm of the Indian Navy:                 Following decommissioning in 1997, the ship was earmarked for preservation as a  |museum_ship|Museum_Ship|  in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ships conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would be made into a training ship.  In 2001, the ship was opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the  |Government_of_Maharashtra|Government_Of_Maharashtra|  was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.                In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, chief of the  |Western_Naval_Command|Western_Naval_Command| , said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very difficult to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museums operations.  On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship.  The  |Bombay_High_Court|Bombay_High_Court|  dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessels dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.       In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction to a Darukhana  |ship-breaker|Ship_Breaking|  for .   , 9 April 2014,  |The_Economic_Times|The_Economic_Times| , access date 29 August 2014.  The  |Supreme_Court_of_India|Supreme_Court_Of_India|  dismissed another lawsuit challenging the ships sale and scrapping on 14 August 2014.  Vikrant remained beached off Darukhana in Mumbai Port while awaiting the final clearances of the Mumbai Port Trust. On 12 November 2014, the Supreme Court gave its final approval for the carrier to be scrapped, which commenced on 22 November 2014.          In memory of Vikrant, the Vikrant Memorial was unveiled by Vice Admiral  |Surinder_Pal_Singh_Cheema|Surinder_Pal_Singh_Cheema| , Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Western Naval Command at K Subash Marg in the Naval Dockyard of Mumbai on 25 January 2016. The memorial is made from metal recovered from the ship.    In February 2016,  |Bajaj|Bajaj_Auto|  unveiled a new motorbike made with metal from Vikrants scrap and named it Bajaj V in honour of Vikrant.       The navy has named its first home-built carrier  |INS_Vikrant|Ins_Vikrant|  in honour of INS Vikrant . The new carrier is built by  |Cochin_Shipyard_Limited|Cochin_Shipyard_Limited| , and will displace .  The keel was laid down in February 2009 and she was launched in August 2013. , the ship is being fitted out and is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2018.         The decommissioned ship featured prominently in the film  ABCD 2  as a backdrop while it was moored near Darukhana in Mumbai.
