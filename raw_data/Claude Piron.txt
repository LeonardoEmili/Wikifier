He worked as a translator for the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  from 1956 to 1961 and then for the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization| .     He was a prolific author of  |Esperanto|Esperanto|  works. He spoke Esperanto from childhood and used it in  |Japan|Japan| , the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| ,  |Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan| ,  |Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan| , in  |Africa|Africa|  and  |Latin_America|Latin_America| , and in nearly all the countries of  |Europe|Europe| .       Piron was a psychotherapist and taught from 1973 to 1994 in the psychology department at the  |University_of_Geneva|University_Of_Geneva|  in  |Switzerland|Switzerland| . His French-language book Le défi des langues — Du gâchis au bon sens is a kind of  |psychoanalysis|Psychoanalysis|  of international communication. A  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  version, O desafio das linguas, was published in 2002 .     In a lecture on the current system of international communication  Piron argued that Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes and differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns... The same neuropsychological law...—called by  |Jean_Piaget|Jean_Piaget|  generalizing assimilation—applies to word formation as well as to grammar.     His diverse Esperanto writings include instructional books, books for beginners, novels, short stories, poems, articles and non-fiction books. His most famous works are  Gerda malaperis!  and  La Bona Lingvo  .     Gerda malaperis! is a novella which uses basic grammar and vocabulary in the first chapter and builds up to expert Esperanto by the end, including word lists so that beginners may easily follow along.     In La Bona Lingvo, Piron captures the basic linguistic and social aspects of Esperanto. He argues strongly for imaginative use of the basic Esperanto  |morpheme|Morpheme|  inventory and word-formation techniques, and against perceived unnecessary importation of neologisms from European languages. He also presents the idea that, once one has learned enough vocabulary to express himself, it is easier to think clearly in Esperanto than in many other languages. This book has influenced some speakers to form a  |clique|Clique|  using a  |variety|Variety|  of Esperanto which, according to Standard Esperantology, is a misinterpretation of the  |Fundamento_de_Esperanto|Fundamento_De_Esperanto| |Berlina_Komentario_pri_la_Fundamento_de_Esperanto|Berlina_Komentario| , vol.I, 2015, pp. 385-6.
