           A chemical formula is a way of presenting information about the chemical proportions of  |atoms|Atom|  that constitute a particular  |chemical_compound|Chemical_Compound|  or molecule, using  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus and minus signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A chemical formula is not a  |chemical_name|Chemical_Nomenclature| , and it contains no words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical  |structural_formula|Structural_Formula| . Chemical formulas can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of  |molecules|Molecule|  and  |chemical_substances|Chemical_Substance| , and are generally more limited in power than are chemical names and structural formulas.     The simplest types of chemical formulas are called  empirical formula s, which use letters and numbers indicating the numerical proportions of atoms of each type. Molecular formulas indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, with no information on structure. For example, the empirical formula for  |glucose|Glucose|  is CH 2 O , while its molecular formula is C 6 H 12 O 6 .     Sometimes a chemical formula is complicated by being written as a  |condensed_formula|Condensed_Formula|  , which conveys additional information about the particular ways in which the atoms are  |chemically_bonded|Chemical_Bond|  together, either in  |covalent_bonds|Covalent_Bond| ,  |ionic_bonds|Ionic_Bond| , or various combinations of these types. This is possible if the relevant bonding is easy to show in one dimension. An example is the condensed molecular/chemical formula for ethanol, which is CH 3 -CH 2 -OH or CH 3 CH 2 OH. However, even a condensed chemical formula is necessarily limited in its ability to show complex bonding relationships between atoms, especially atoms that have bonds to four or more different  |substituents|Substituent| .     Since a chemical formula must be expressed as a single line of chemical element symbols, it often cannot be as informative as a true structural formula, which is a graphical representation of the spatial relationship between atoms in chemical compounds . For reasons of structural complexity, a single condensed chemical formula may correspond to different molecules, known as  |isomers|Isomer| . For example glucose shares its  |molecular_formula|Molecular_Formula| |C_6_H_12_O_6|C6H12O6|  with a number of other  |sugars|Sugar| , including  |fructose|Fructose| ,  |galactose|Galactose|  and  |mannose|Mannose| . Linear equivalent chemical names exist that can and do specify uniquely any complex structural formula , but such names must use many terms , rather than the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that define a chemical formula.     Chemical formulas may be used in  |chemical_equations|Chemical_Equation|  to describe  |chemical_reactions|Chemical_Reaction|  and other chemical transformations, such as the dissolving of ionic compounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulas do not have the full power of structural formulas to show chemical relationships between atoms, they are sufficient to keep track of numbers of atoms and numbers of electrical charges in chemical reactions, thus  |balancing_chemical_equations|Chemical_Equationbalancing_Chemical_Equations|  so that these equations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and conservation of electric charge.       A chemical formula identifies each constituent  |element|Chemical_Element|  by its  |chemical_symbol|Chemical_Symbol|  and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, by ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of  |ethanol|Ethanol|  may be written C 2 H 6 O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is  |boron_carbide|Boron_Carbide| , whose formula of CB n is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.     When the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple  |molecules|Molecule| , chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. These types of formulas are variously known as molecular formulas and  condensed formulas . A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for  |glucose|Glucose|  is C 6 H 12 O 6 rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH 2 O. However, except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous.     For simple molecules, a condensed formula is a type of chemical formula that may fully imply a correct structural formula. For example,  |ethanol|Ethanol|  may be represented by the condensed chemical formula CH 3 CH 2 OH, and  |dimethyl_ether|Dimethyl_Ether|  by the condensed formula CH 3 OCH 3 . These two molecules have the same empirical and molecular formulas , but may be differentiated by the condensed formulas shown, which are sufficient to represent the full structure of these simple  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound| .     Condensed chemical formulas may also be used to represent  |ionic_compounds|Ionic_Compound|  that do not exist as discrete molecules, but nonetheless do contain covalently bound clusters within them. These  |polyatomic_ions|Polyatomic_Ion|  are groups of atoms that are covalently bound together and have an overall ionic charge, such as the sulfate  ion. Each polyatomic ion in a compound is written individually in order to illustrate the separate groupings. For example, the compound  |dichlorine_hexoxide|Dichlorine_Hexoxide|  has an empirical formula , and molecular formula , but in liquid or solid forms, this compound is more correctly shown by an ionic condensed formula , which illustrates that this compound consists of  ions and  ions. In such cases, the condensed formula only need be complex enough to show at least one of each ionic species.     Chemical formulas as described here are distinct from the far more complex chemical systematic names that are used in various systems of  |chemical_nomenclature|Chemical_Nomenclature| . For example, one systematic name for glucose is -2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal. This name, interpreted by the rules behind it, fully specifies glucoses structural formula, but the name is not a chemical formula as usually understood, and uses terms and words not used in chemical formulas. Such names, unlike basic formulas, may be able to represent full structural formulas without graphs.              In  |chemistry|Chemistry| , the  |empirical_formula|Empirical_Formula|  of a chemical is a simple expression of the relative number of each type of atom or ratio of the elements in the compound. Empirical formulas are the standard for  |ionic_compounds|Ionic_Compound| , such as , and for macromolecules, such as . An empirical formula makes no reference to  |isomer|Isomer| ism, structure, or absolute number of atoms. The term empirical refers to the process of  |elemental_analysis|Elemental_Analysis| , a technique of  |analytical_chemistry|Analytical_Chemistry|  used to determine the relative percent composition of a pure chemical substance by element.     For example,  |hexane|Hexane|  has a molecular formula of , or structurally , implying that it has a chain structure of 6  |carbon|Carbon|  atoms, and 14  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  atoms. However, the empirical formula for hexane is . Likewise the empirical formula for  |hydrogen_peroxide|Hydrogen_Peroxide| , , is simply HO expressing the 1:1 ratio of component elements.  |Formaldehyde|Formaldehyde|  and  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid|  have the same empirical formula, . This is the actual chemical formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms.       Molecular formulas indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule of a molecular substance. They are the same as empirical formulas for molecules that only have one atom of a particular type, but otherwise may have larger numbers. An example of the difference is the empirical formula for glucose, which is CH 2 O , while its molecular formula is C 6 H 12 O 6 . For water, both formulas are H 2 O. A molecular formula provides more information about a molecule than its empirical formula, but is more difficult to establish.     A molecular formula shows the number of elements in a molecule, and determines whether it is a  |binary_compound|Binary_Compound| ,  |ternary_compound|Ternary_Compound| ,  |quaternary_compound|Quaternary_Compound| , or has even more elements.                    The  |connectivity|Connectivity|  of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms  might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a  |structural_formula|Structural_Formula|  is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate  |shape_of_the_molecule|Molecular_Geometry| .     A condensed chemical formula may represent the types and spatial arrangement of  |bonds|Chemical_Bond|  in a simple chemical substance, though it does not necessarily specify  |isomers|Isomer|  or complex structures. For example,  |ethane|Ethane|  consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH 3 CH 3 . In  |ethylene|Ethylene|  there is a double bond between the carbon atoms , therefore the chemical formula may be written: CH 2 CH 2 , and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is implicit because carbon has a valence of four. However, a more explicit method is to write H 2 CCH 2 or less commonly H 2 CCH 2 . The two lines indicate that a  |double_bond|Double_Bond|  connects the atoms on either side of them.     A  |triple_bond|Triple_Bond|  may be expressed with three lines or three pairs of dots , and if there may be ambiguity, a single line or pair of dots may be used to indicate a single bond.     Molecules with multiple  |functional_groups|Functional_Group|  that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in  |round_brackets|Parenthesis| . For example,  |isobutane|Isobutane|  may be written 3 CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions . The formula 3 CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three  |CH_3_groups|Methyl_Group| . The same number of atoms of each element may be used to make a straight chain molecule, n- |butane|Butane| |law_of_constant_composition|Law_Of_Constant_Composition| .     The law of constant composition says that, in any particular chemical compound, all samples of that compound will be made up of the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any water molecule is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio. If we look at the relative masses of oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule, we see that 94% of the mass of a water molecule is accounted for by oxygen and the remaining 6% is the mass of hydrogen. This mass proportion will be the same for any water molecule.   This material is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.          The alkene called but-2-ene has two isomers, which the chemical formula CH 3 CHCHCH 3 does not identify. The relative position of the two methyl groups must be indicated by additional notation denoting whether the methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond  or on the opposite sides from each other . Such extra symbols violate the rules for chemical formulas, and begin to enter the territory of more complex naming systems.     As noted above, in order to represent the full structural formulas of many complex organic and inorganic compounds,  |chemical_nomenclature|Chemical_Nomenclature|  may be needed which goes well beyond the available resources used above in simple condensed formulas. See  |IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry|Iupac_Nomenclature_Of_Organic_Chemistry|  and  |IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry_2005|Iupac_Nomenclature_Of_Inorganic_Chemistry_2005|  for examples. In addition, linear naming systems such as  |International_Chemical_Identifier|International_Chemical_Identifier|  allow a computer to construct a structural formula, and  |simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system|Simplified_Molecular-Input_Line-Entry_System|  allows a more human-readable ASCII input. However, all these nomenclature systems go beyond the standards of chemical formulas, and technically are chemical naming systems, not formula systems.         For  |polymers|Polymer|  in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit. For example, a  |hydrocarbon|Hydrocarbon|  molecule that is described as CH 3 50 CH 3 , is a molecule with fifty repeating units. If the number of repeating units is unknown or variable, the letter n may be used to indicate this formula: CH 3 n CH 3 .       For  |ions|Ion| , the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a right-hand superscript. For example, Na + , or Cu 2+ . The total charge on a charged molecule or a  |polyatomic_ion|Polyatomic_Ion|  may also be shown in this way. For example:  |H_3_O_+|Hydronium|  or  |SO_4_2−|Sulfate| . Note that + and - are used in place of +1 and -1, respectively.     For more complex ions, brackets are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in 2− , which is found in compounds such as  |Cs_2_[B_12_H_12|Caesium_Dodecaborate| . Parentheses can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in  |[Co_6_]_3+_Cl_3_−|Hexamminecobaltchloride| . Here, 6 indicates that the ion contains six  |NH_3_groups|Ammine|  bonded to  |cobalt|Cobalt| , and encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge +3.      This is strictly optional; a chemical formula is valid with or without ionization information, and Hexamminecobalt chloride may be written as 3+ Cl 3 − or l 3 . Brackets, like parentheses, behave in chemistry as they do in mathematics, grouping terms together they are not specifically employed only for ionization states. In the latter case here, the parentheses indicate 6 groups all of the same shape, bonded to another group of size 1 , and then the entire bundle, as a group, is bonded to 3 chlorine atoms. In the former case, it is clearer that the bond connecting the chlorines is  |ionic|Ionic_Bonding| , rather than  |covalent|Covalent_Bond| .         Although  |isotopes|Isotope|  are more relevant to  |nuclear_chemistry|Nuclear_Chemistry|  or  |stable_isotope|Stable_Isotope|  chemistry than to conventional chemistry, different isotopes may be indicated with a prefixed  |superscript|Superscript|  in a chemical formula. For example, the phosphate ion containing radioactive phosphorus-32 is & 91; 32 PO 4 & 93; 3− . Also a study involving stable isotope ratios might include the molecule 18 O 16 O.     A left-hand subscript is sometimes used redundantly to indicate the  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number| . For example, 8 O 2 for dioxygen, and  for the most abundant isotopic species of dioxygen. This is convenient when writing equations for  |nuclear_reactions|Nuclear_Reaction| , in order to show the balance of charge more clearly.             The @ symbol  indicates an atom or molecule trapped inside a cage but not chemically bound to it. For example, a  |buckminsterfullerene|Buckminsterfullerene|  with an atom would simply be represented as MC 60 regardless of whether M was inside the fullerene without chemical bonding or outside, bound to one of the carbon atoms. Using the @ symbol, this would be denoted M@C 60 if M was inside the carbon network. A non-fullerene example is 3− , an ion in which one As atom is trapped in a cage formed by the other 32 atoms.     This notation was proposed in 1991  with the discovery of  |fullerene|Fullerene|  cages , which can trap atoms such as  |La|Lanthanum|  to form, for example, La@C 60 or La@C 82 . The choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise, readily printed and transmitted electronically , and the visual aspects suggesting the structure of an endohedral fullerene.              Chemical formulas most often use  |integers|Integer|  for each element. However, there is a class of compounds, called  |non-stoichiometric_compounds|Non-Stoichiometric_Compound| , that cannot be represented by small integers. Such a formula might be written using  |decimal_fractions|Decimal_Fraction| , as in Fe 0.95 O, or it might include a variable part represented by a letter, as in Fe 1–x O, where x is normally much less than 1.       A chemical formula used for a series of compounds that differ from each other by a constant unit is called a general formula. It generates a  |homologous_series|Homologous_Series|  of chemical formulas. For example,  |alcohols|Alcohols|  may be represented by the formula C n H OH , giving the homologs  |methanol|Methanol| ,  |ethanol|Ethanol| ,  |propanol|Propanol|  for n1–3.       The Hill system is a system of writing empirical chemical formulas, molecular chemical formulas and components of a condensed formula such that the number of  |carbon|Carbon| |atoms|Atom|  in a  |molecule|Molecule|  is indicated first, the number of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  atoms next, and then the number of all other  |chemical_elements|Chemical_Element|  subsequently, in  |alphabetical_order|Alphabetical_Order|  of the  |chemical_symbols|Chemical_Symbols| . When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.     By sorting formulas according to the number of atoms of each element present in the formula according to these rules, with differences in earlier elements or numbers being treated as more significant than differences in any later element or number  like sorting text strings into  |lexicographical_order|Lexicographical_Order|   it is possible to  |collate|Collation|  chemical formulas into what is known as Hill system order.     The Hill system was first published by  |Edwin_A._Hill|Edwin_A._Hill|  of the  |United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office|United_States_Patent_And_Trademark_Office|  in 1900.  It is the most commonly used system in chemical databases and printed indexes to sort lists of compounds. Wiggins, Gary. . Chemical Information Sources.
