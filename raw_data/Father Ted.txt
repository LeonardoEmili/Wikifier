The three priests answer to Bishop  |Len_Brennan|List_Of_Father_Ted_Charactersbishop_Brennan| , who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety , Dougal for something only referred to as the Blackrock Incident , and Jack for his  |alcoholism|Alcoholism|  and  |womanising|Lothario| , particularly for an incident at a wedding in  |Athlone|Athlone| .     The show revolves around the priests lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Teds schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his enemy, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.          Father Ted ran for three series from 1995 to 1998, including a Christmas special. A total of 25 episodes were produced.                   Linehan and Mathews first met while working at  Hot Press .  In the late 1980s, Mathews,  |Paul_Woodfull|Paul_Woodfull|  and Kieran Woodfull formed The Joshua Trio, a  |U2|U2|  tribute band. The trio began writing comedy sketches to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.      In 1991, Mathews left his job at Hot Press and moved into Linehans London home. Over the next three to four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows while at the same time writing for sketch shows such as  The All New Alexei Sayle Show  and  The Fast Show . One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called Irish Lives, with six episodes, each focusing on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in  |Maynooth_College|St_Patricks_College,_Maynooth| . Producer  |Geoffrey_Perkins|Geoffrey_Perkins|  suggested that the episodes concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.       In the January 1994 issue of In Dublin , Mathews and Linehan told Damian Corless, who had initially introduced the pair to each other, of their work in progress, describing Ted as basically a nice man , Dougal as nice but really stupid and Jack as a hideous creature . Linehan revealed: Theyve all been sent to this isolated place called Craggy Island because theyre crap priests. Mathews elaborated: Theyve each a terrible secret which is why theyve been banished to this place, and the terrible thing is that they cant get away from each other. Obviously its not entirely reality based. Mathews was originally intended to play Ted, but decided he lacked the acting ability the role required.  |Maurice_ODonoghue|Maurice_Odonoghue| , who plays Father Dick in the series, was their second choice for the role of Ted, being the right age and having a similar look and lightness. Mathews always preferred  |Dermot_Morgan|Dermot_Morgan| ; Linehan was initially reluctant, fearing he would play Ted the same as Father Trendy , a character he played on the  |RTÉ|Raidió_Teilifís_Éireann|  television show  The Live Mike , but Morgan lobbied hard for the role and was cast.     The show was pitched directly to the UKs  |Hat_Trick_Productions|Hat_Trick_Productions|  and Channel 4 by the duo, contrary to rumours that  |RTÉ|Raidió_Teilifís_Éireann|  were originally offered the series but rejected it.         Three series and one Christmas special were aired. Declan Lowney directed the first two series and the Christmas special, while the third series was directed by Linehan and  |Andy_De_Emmony|Andy_De_Emmony|  . In addition, Morgan and OHanlon hosted an hour of  |Comic_Relief|Comic_Relief|  in character, during which Kelly and McLynn also made brief guest appearances. One day after the shooting of series three wrapped, Dermot Morgan died of a  |heart_attack|Myocardial_Infarction| , aged 45. As a mark of respect, the third series was first broadcast a week later than originally planned.     The show was already scheduled to conclude with the third season prior to Morgans death, as Morgan said that he did not want to continue playing the role of Father Ted for fear of being  |typecast|Typecasting| |Clive_Dunn|Clive_Dunn|  and end up playing the same character for years.      Following Morgans death, the production company received calls from numerous agents and casting directors suggesting either new actors for the role of Ted or spin-offs without the character; Linehan and Mathews declined all offers.        In 1994, the writers asked alternative rock band  |Pulp|Pulp|  to compose the theme music for Father Ted, requesting a parody of a typical sitcom theme. When Pulp declined involvement, they contacted  |Neil_Hannon|Neil_Hannon| , frontman of Northern Irish  |chamber_pop|Chamber_Pop|  band  |The_Divine_Comedy|The_Divine_Comedy| . Hannons first effort, a jaunty composition, was rejected on Geoffrey Perkinss advice. Hannon composed a second theme, which the team found acceptable. This theme was recorded by Hannon and co-producer  |Darren_Allison|Darren_Allison|  at  |The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chains|The_Jesus_And_Mary_Chain|  private studio. One of  |William_Reids|William_Reid|  guitars was selected by Allison and Hannon to carry the main tune, which was played by Hannon. Both themes were also reworked, with new lyrics, for inclusion on The Divine Comedys 1996 album  Casanova Father Ted theme became Songs of Love , while Hannons rejected theme became A Woman of the World .  As stated by Neil Hannon in the documentary Half Minute Melodies,  |BBC_Radio_4|Bbc_Radio_4| , 3 February 2000. Hannon offered a choice of tunes to the producers; his personal preference was for Woman of the World .     In 2010, Linehan discussed the dramatic effect this choice had on the tone of the series: Woman of the World was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He gave us two choices: he gave us that, and Songs of Love, and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we dont like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, Why do you want to make fun of your characters? He said, People will love these characters. And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned.      The Divine Comedy also contributed most of the shows original music, including the songs Big Men in Frocks ,  |My_Lovely_Horse|My_Lovely_Horse|  and The Miracle is Mine , and My Lovely Mayo Mammy .  Neil Hannon also provided Ted and Dougals vocals in the dream sequence version of My Lovely Horse , which was produced by Allison and Hannon, and later appeared as a  |B-side|A-Side_And_B-Side|  on the bands single  |Gin_Soaked_Boy|Gin_Soaked_Boy|  .

Spirit of Genovia, c1997     Embarrassment plays a role in many storylines, in a similar fashion to  Fawlty Towers . Linehan says, if Ted is in a situation that is slightly embarrassing we get him out of it by having him lying or cheating, basically digging a massive hole for himself . Arthur Mathews has described  Seinfeld  as a major influence on the comedy of Father Ted, with himself and Linehan being big fans of the show. ,  |Irish_Times|Irish_Times| , 31 December 2010 Father Ted also contains references to pop culture, and some film  |parodies|Parody| , such as the episode  |Speed_3|Speed_3|  .     Regarding the seriess religious content, Linehan says Ted doesnt have an anti-religious view of life, but a non-religious view. Its a job to him. He doesnt care about religion.

Since the end of the series, several attempts to remake Father Ted have been reported, but none has yet materialised.     In July 2003, it was announced that the show would be remade for the American market. The remake would be scripted by  |Spike_Feresten|Spike_Feresten| , who previously wrote for US sitcoms  Seinfeld  and  The Simpsons . Ferensten stated: I was raised Catholic and this show just felt right to me. The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles. Hat Trick founders  |Denise_ODonoghue|Denise_Odonoghue|  and  |Jimmy_Mulville|Jimmy_Mulville|  were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted  The Kumars at No. 42  for an American audience.      In March 2004, Supanet Limited reported that an American remake was in development. This version would be set on a fictional island off the coast of New York.  |Steve_Martin|Steve_Martin|  and  |Graham_Norton|Graham_Norton|  would reportedly play Ted and Dougal. Martin had not been expected to take the role because of his stature, but agreed because he was a fan of the original series, and would reportedly be paid £500,000 per episode. Norton was cast based on his popularity with American audiences, and in reference to his appearance as Father Noel Furlong in the original series.      In November 2007, a separate American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version would be set in an unfortunate fishing village in  |New_England|New_England| . American actor  |John_Michael_Higgins|John_Michael_Higgins|  was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the shows religious themes: The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We dont have that in our country, were frightened of it. Its basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we dont have that. So Ill be Father Ted, well see how it goes. Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2008.      In January 2015, Linehan said that there had been a few attempts by US broadcasters to remake the show, including one which would have been set in  |Boston|Boston|  – an idea Linehan considered ridiculous .        In an interview with  Radio Times  in January 2015, Linehan revealed that he wanted to revive Father Ted as a musical stage production. He stated that he would never revive the television series itself, because of the risk you poison peoples memories of the original , but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. Linehan mentioned the possibility of a dance number with spinning cardinals . He said that the musical would have to reference the  |Catholic_child_abuse_scandals|Roman_Catholic_Church_Sexual_Abuse_Scandal_In_Ireland| , stating, The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, because you just cant ignore this stuff. Mathews was not as convinced of the musical idea, though Linehan still insisted it could work.      In December, Mathews said that he and Paul Woodfull were developing a Joshua Trio musical and a show focusing on a  |Father_Michael_Cleary|Michael_Cleary| -type character , and that the Father Ted musical may follow. He expressed concerns that it would dilute the product or be seen as a cash-in , but said that he believed there was an audience for the project.      In April 2017, Linehan said that the musical would draw inspiration from  The Book of Mormon , and would go for the jugular ... you get all the things people loved about it, all the innocence and all the sweetness, but introduce a harder edge . Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a world-shaking story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to some weird succession thing .  In June, Linehan said that he hoped  |The_Divine_Comedy|The_Divine_Comedy|  frontman  |Neil_Hannon|Neil_Hannon| , who wrote the shows music, would return to compose the songs.      In June 2018, Linehan announced that Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical was nearing completion, with a script by Linehan and Mathews and music by Hannon.  Linehan said, Its the real final episode of Father Ted. This is true and not one of my stupid jokes, I promise. Didnt want to do something until the right idea came along. This was the right idea. Arthur and I have been laughing our arses off while writing it. Just like the old days .
