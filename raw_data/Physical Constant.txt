     A physical constant, sometimes fundamental physical constant or universal constant, is a  |physical_quantity|Physical_Quantity|  that is generally believed to be both universal in nature and have  |constant|Constant|  value in time. It is contrasted with a  |mathematical_constant|Mathematical_Constant| , which has a fixed numerical value, but does not directly involve any physical measurement.     There are many physical constants in science, some of the most widely recognized being the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light|  in vacuum c, the  |gravitational_constant|Gravitational_Constant|  G, the  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant|  h, the  |electric_constant|Electric_Constant|  ε 0 , and the  |elementary_charge|Elementary_Charge|  e. Physical constants can take many  |dimensional|Dimensional_Analysis|  forms: the speed of light signifies a maximum  |speed|Speed|  for any object and its  |dimension|Dimensional_Analysis|  is  |length|Length|  divided by  |time|Time| ; while the  |fine_structure_constant|Fine_Structure_Constant|  α, which characterizes the strength of the  |electromagnetic_interaction|Electromagnetic_Interaction| , is  |dimensionless|Dimensionless| .     The term fundamental physical constant is sometimes used to refer to universal but dimensioned physical constants such as those mentioned above.  NIST Increasingly, however, physicists reserve the use of the term fundamental physical constant for  |dimensionless_physical_constants|Dimensionless_Physical_Constant| , such as the fine-structure constant α.     Physical constant in the sense under discussion in this article should not be confused with other quantities called constants that are assumed to be constant in a given context without the implication that they are fundamental, such as the  |time_constant|Time_Constant|  characteristic of a given system, or  |material_constants|List_Of_Materials_Properties| , such as the  |Madelung_constant|Madelung_Constant| ,  |electrical_resistivity|Electrical_Resistivity_And_Conductivity| , and  |heat_capacity|Heat_Capacity| .     The  |International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|International_Bureau_Of_Weights_And_Measures|  decided to  |redefine_several_SI_base_units_as_from_20_May_2019|2019_Redefinition_Of_Si_Base_Units|  by fixing the SI value of several physical constants, including the Planck constant, h, the elementary charge, e, the  |Boltzmann_constant|Boltzmann_Constant| , k B , and the  |Avogadro_constant|Avogadro_Constant| , N A . The new fixed values are based on the best measurements of the constants based on the earlier definitions, including the  |kilogram|Kilogram| , to ensure minimal impact. As a consequence of the redefinition, the uncertainty in the value of many physical constants when expressed in SI units are substantially reduced.       Whereas the  |physical_quantity|Physical_Quantity|  indicated by a physical constant does not depend on the unit system used to express the quantity, the numerical values of dimensional physical constants do depend on choice of unit system.   The term physical constant refers to the physical quantity, and not to the numerical value within any given system of units. For example, the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light|  is defined as having the numerical value of  when expressed in the  |SI_unit|Si_Unit|  metres per second, and as having the numerical value of 1 when expressed in the  |natural_units|Natural_Units|  Planck length per Planck time. While its numerical value can be defined at will by the choice of units, the speed of light itself is a single physical constant.     Any  |ratio|Ratio|  between physical constants of the same dimensions results in a  |dimensionless_physical_constant|Dimensionless_Physical_Constant| , for example, the  |proton_to_electron_mass_ratio|Proton_To_Electron_Mass_Ratio| . Any relation between physical quantities can be expressed as a relation between dimensionless ratios via a process known as  |nondimensionalisation|Nondimensionalisation| .     The term of fundamental physical constant is reserved for physical quantities which, according to the current state of knowledge, are regarded as immutable and as non-derivable from more fundamental principles. Notable examples are the speed of light c, and the  |gravitational_constant|Gravitational_Constant|  G.     The  |fine_structure_constant|Fine_Structure_Constant|  α is the best known dimensionless fundamental physical constant. It is the value of the  |elementary_charge|Elementary_Charge|  squared expressed in  |Planck_units|Planck_Units| . This value has become a standard example when discussing the derivability or non-derivability of physical constants. Introduced by  |Arnold_Sommerfeld|Arnold_Sommerfeld| , its value as determined at the time was consistent with 1/137. This motivated  |Arthur_Eddington|Arthur_Eddington|  to construct an argument why its value might be 1/137 precisely, which related to the  |Eddington_number|Eddington_Number| , his estimate of the number of protons in the Universe.    By the 1940s, it became clear that the value of the fine-structure constant deviates significantly from the precise value of 1/137, refuting Eddingtons argument.        With the development of  |quantum_chemistry|Quantum_Chemistry|  in the 20th century, however, a vast number of previously inexplicable dimensionless physical constants were successfully computed from theory. In light of that, some theoretical physicists still hope for continued progress in explaining the values of other dimensionless physical constants.     It is known that  |the_Universe_would_be_very_different|Fine_Tuned_Universe|  if these constants took values significantly different from those we observe. For example, a few percent change in the value of the fine structure constant would be enough to eliminate stars like our Sun. This has prompted attempts at  |anthropic|Anthropic_Principle|  explanations of the values of some of the dimensionless fundamental physical constants.          Using  |dimensional_analysis|Dimensional_Analysis| , it is possible to combine dimensional universal physical constants to define a system of  |units_of_measurement|Units_Of_Measurement|  that has no reference to any human construct. Depending on the choice and arrangement of constants used, the resulting natural units may have useful physical meaning. For example,  |Planck_units|Planck_Units| , shown in the table below, use  |c|Speed_Of_Light| ,  |G|Gravitational_Constant| ,  |ħ|Planck_Constant| ,  |ε_0_|Electric_Constant| , and  |k_B_|Boltzmann_Constant|  in such a manner to derive units relevant to unified theories such as  |quantum_gravity|Quantum_Gravity| .   :       The number of fundamental physical constants depends on the  |physical_theory|Physical_Theory|  accepted as fundamental .   Currently, this is the theory of  |general_relativity|General_Relativity|  for gravitation and the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  for electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear interactions and the matter fields.   Between them, these theories account for a total of 19 independent fundamental constants.   There is, however, no single correct way of enumerating them, as it is a matter of arbitrary choice which quantities are considered fundamental and which as derived . Uzan lists 22 unknown constants in the fundamental theories, which give rise to 19 unknown dimensionless parameters , as follows:   the  |gravitational_constant|Gravitational_Constant|  G,   the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light|  c,   the  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant|  h,   the 9  |Yukawa_couplings|Yukawa_Couplings|  for the quarks and leptons ,   2 parameters of the  |Higgs_field|Higgs_Field|  potential,   4 parameters for the  |quark_mixing_matrix|Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa_Matrix| ,   3 coupling constants for the  |gauge_groups|Gauge_Group| |_SU × SU × U|Standard_Model|  ,   a phase for the  |QCD_vacuum|Qcd_Vacuum| .   The number of 19 independent fundamental physical constants is subject to change under possible  |extensions_of_the_Standard_Model|Physics_Beyond_The_Standard_Model| , notably by the introduction of  |neutrino_mass|Neutrino_Mass|  .      The discovery of variability in any of these constants would be equivalent to the discovery of  |new_physics|New_Physics|  .      The question as to which constants are fundamental is neither straightforward nor meaningless, but a question of interpretation of the physical theory regarded as fundamental; as pointed out by , not all physical constants are of the same importance, with some having a deeper role than others.    proposed a classification schemes of three types of fundamental constant:   A: characteristic of a particular system   B: characteristic of a class of physical phenomena   C: universal constants   The same physical constant may move from one category to another as the understanding of its role deepens; this has notably happened to the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light| , which was a class A constant  when it was first measured, but became a class B constant  with the development of  |classical_electromagnetism|Classical_Electromagnetism| , and finally a class C constant with the discovery of  |special_relativity|Special_Relativity| .           By definition, fundamental physical constants are subject to  |measurement|Measurement| , so that their being constant is necessarily an experimental result and subject to verification.      |Paul_Dirac|Paul_Dirac|  in 1937 speculated that physical constants such as the  |gravitational_constant|Gravitational_Constant|  or the  |fine_structure_constant|Fine_Structure_Constant|  might be subject to change over time in proportion of the  |age_of_the_universe|Age_Of_The_Universe| . Experiments can in principle only put an upper bound on the relative change per year. For the fine-structure constant, this upper bound is comparatively low, at   roughly 10 −17 per year .        The gravitational constant is much more difficult to measure with precision, and conflicting measurements in the 2000s have inspired the controversial suggestions of a periodic variation of its value in a 2015 paper.  However, while its value is not known to great precision, the possibility of observing  |type_Ia_supernovae|Type_Ia_Supernovae|  which happened in the universes remote past, paired with the assumption that the physics involved in these events is universal, allows for an upper bound of less than 10 −10 per year for the gravitational constant over the last nine billion years.      Similarly, an upper bound of the change in the  |proton_to_electron_mass_ratio|Proton_To_Electron_Mass_Ratio|  has been placed at 10 −7 over a period of 7 billion years in a 2012 study based on the observation of  |methanol|Methanol|  in a distant galaxy.       It is problematic to discuss the proposed rate of change of a single dimensional physical constant in isolation. The reason for this is that the choice of units is arbitrary, making the question of whether a constant is undergoing change an artefact of the choice of the units.        For example, in  |SI_units|Si_Units| , the speed of light was given a defined value in 1983. Thus, it was meaningful to experimentally measure the speed of light in SI units prior to 1983, but it is not so now. Similarly, with effect from May 2019, the Planck constant has a defined value, such that all  |SI_base_units|Si_Base_Units|  are now defined in terms of fundamental physical constants. With this change, the International Prototype Kilogram is being retired as the last physical object used in the definition of any SI unit.     Tests on the immutability of physical constants look at dimensionless quantities, i.e. ratios between quantities of like dimensions, in order to escape this problem. Changes in physical constants are not meaningful if they result in an observationally indistinguishable universe. For example, a  |_change_in_the_speed_of_light|Variable_Speed_Of_Light|  c would be meaningless if accompanied by a corresponding change in the elementary charge e so that the ratio  remained unchanged.    important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like α define the World is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by α is a combination of the electron charge, e, the speed of light, c, and Plancks constant, h. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If c, h, and e were all changed so that the values they have in metric units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of α remained the same, this new world would be observationally indistinguishable from our World. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses were doubled in value you cannot tell, because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged.          Some physicists have explored the notion that if the  |dimensionless_physical_constants|Dimensionless_Physical_Constant|  had sufficiently different values, our Universe would be so radically different that intelligent life would probably not have emerged, and that our Universe therefore seems to be  |fine_tuned|Fine_Tuned_Universe|  for intelligent life. The anthropic principle states a logical  |truism|Truism| |divine_creator|Intelligent_Design|  , or that ours is one universe of many in a  |multiverse|Multiverse|  , or even that,  |if_information_is_an_innate_property_of_the_universe|It_From_Bit|  and logically inseparable from consciousness, a universe without the capacity for conscious beings cannot exist.
