   Panentheism  is the  |belief|Belief|  that the  |divine|Divinity|  pervades and  |interpenetrates|Wikt:Interpenetration|  every part of  |the_universe|Universe|  and also extends beyond space and time. The term was coined by the German philosopher  |Karl_Krause|Karl_Krause|  in 1828 to distinguish the ideas of  |Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|  and  |Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling|  about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed  |pantheism|Pantheism|  of  |Baruch_Spinoza|Baruch_Spinoza| . John Culp : , in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved 18 March 2014. Unlike pantheism, which holds that the divine and the universe are  |identical|Identity| ,  panentheism maintains an  |ontological|Ontology|  distinction between the divine and the  |non-divine|Secular|  and the significance of both.     In panentheism, God is viewed as the  |soul|Soul|  of the universe, the universal  |spirit|Spirit|  present everywhere, which at the same time  |transcends|Transcendence|  all things created.   While pantheism asserts that all is God , panentheism claims that God is greater than the universe. Some versions of panentheism suggest that the universe is nothing more than the manifestation of God. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God, like in the  |Kabbalah|Kabbalah|  concept of  |tzimtzum|Tzimtzum| . Also much  |Hindu_thought|Hindu_Thought|  is highly characterized by panentheism and  |pantheism|Pantheism| . , in: Britannica. Whiting, Robert. . Stanley Thomes, London 1991, p.  viii. . The basic tradition however, on which Krauses concept was built, seems to have been  |Neoplatonic_philosophy|Neoplatonic_Philosophy|  and its successors in  |Western_philosophy|Western_Philosophy|  and  |Orthodox_theology|Orthodox_Theology| .         The religious beliefs of  |Neoplatonism|Neoplatonism|  can be regarded as panentheistic.  |Plotinus|Plotinus|  taught that there was an ineffable transcendent God  of which subsequent realities were emanations. From the One emanates the Divine Mind  and the Cosmic Soul . In Neoplatonism the world itself is God . This concept of divinity is associated with that of the  Logos  , which had originated centuries earlier with  |Heraclitus|Heraclitus|  . The Logos pervades the  |cosmos|Cosmos| , whereby all thoughts and all things originate, or as Heraclitus said: He who hears not me but the Logos will say: All is one. Neoplatonists such as  |Iamblichus|Iamblichus|  attempted to reconcile this perspective by adding another  |hypostasis|Hypostasis|  above the original monad of force or  Dunamis  . This new all-pervasive monad encompassed all creation and its original uncreated emanations.          |Baruch_Spinoza|Baruch_Spinoza|  later claimed that Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.

Allanson, Pantheism: Its Story and Significance , 1905. and prince Fraser, Alexander Campbell, Philosophy of Theism , William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p. 163. of  |pantheism|Pantheism| , in a letter to  |Henry_Oldenburg|Henry_Oldenburg|  Spinoza states that: as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature , they are quite mistaken . Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications, 2009, , letter 73. For Spinoza, our universe is a mode under two attributes of  |Thought|Thought|  and  |Extension|Extension| . God has infinitely many other  |attributes|Attributes_Of_God|  which are not present in our world.     According to German philosopher  |Karl_Jaspers|Karl_Jaspers| , when Spinoza wrote Deus sive Natura Spinoza did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that Gods transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified Gods  |immanence|Immanence| . Karl Jaspers, Spinoza , Harvest Books, 1974, , pp. 14 and 95. Furthermore,  |Martial_Guéroult|Martial_Guéroult|  suggested the term panentheism , rather than pantheism to describe Spinozas view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, in God. Yet, American philosopher and self-described panentheist  |Charles_Hartshorne|Charles_Hartshorne|  referred to Spinozas philosophy as  |classical_pantheism|Classical_Pantheism|  and distinguished Spinozas philosophy from panentheism. Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, Philosophers Speak of God, Humanity Books, 1953, ch. 4.     In 1828, the German philosopher  |Karl_Christian_Friedrich_Krause|Karl_Christian_Friedrich_Krause|  seeking to reconcile  |monotheism|Monotheism|  and  |pantheism|Pantheism| , coined the term panentheism . This conception of God influenced New England  |transcendentalists|Transcendentalists|  such as  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson| . The term was popularized by  |Charles_Hartshorne|Charles_Hartshorne|  in his development of  |process_theology|Process_Theology|  and has also been closely identified with the  |New_Thought|New_Thought_Movement| .  The formalization of this term in the West in the 19th century was not new; philosophical treatises had been written on it in the context of  |Hinduism|Hinduism|  for millennia.      Philosophers who embraced panentheism have included  |Thomas_Hill_Green|Thomas_Hill_Green|  ,  |James_Ward|James_Ward|  ,  |Andrew_Seth_Pringle-Pattison|Andrew_Seth_Pringle-Pattison|  and  |Samuel_Alexander|Samuel_Alexander|  . John W. Cooper Panentheism, the other God of the philosophers: from Plato to the present Baker Academic, 2006, . Beginning in the 1940s, Hartshorne examined numerous conceptions of God. He reviewed and discarded pantheism,  |deism|Deism| , and  |pandeism|Pandeism|  in favor of panentheism, finding that such a doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations . Hartshorne formulated God as a being who could become more perfect : He has absolute perfection in categories for which absolute perfection is possible, and relative perfection in categories for which perfection cannot be precisely determined. Charles Hartshorne, Mans Vision of God and the Logic of Theism  p. 348; cf.  |Michel_Weber|Michel_Weber| , https://www.academia.edu/279953/WhiteheadsPancreativism.TheBasics Whitehead’s Pancreativism. The Basics. Foreword by  |Nicholas_Rescher|Nicholas_Rescher| , Ontos Verlag, Frankfurt am Main and Paris, 2006.         Earliest reference to panentheistic thought in  |Hindu_philosophy|Hindu_Philosophy|  is in a creation myth contained in the later section of  |Rig_Veda|Rig_Veda|  called the  |Purusha_Sukta|Purusha_Sukta| ,  which was compiled before 1100 BCE. Oberlies gives an estimate of 1100 BC for the youngest hymns in book 10. Estimates for a terminus post quem of the earliest hymns are more uncertain. Oberlies based on cumulative evidence sets wide range of 1700–1100 The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the cosmos. It presents the nature of Purusha or the cosmic being as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it.

Thus, it is She who becomes the time and space, the cosmos, it is She who becomes the  |five_elements|Mahābhūta| , and thus all animate life and inanimate forms. She is the primordial energy that holds all creation and destruction, all cycles of birth and death, all laws of cause and effect within Herself, and yet is greater than the sum total of all these. She is transcendent, but becomes immanent as the cosmos . She, the Primordial Energy, directly becomes Matter.       Taoism says that all is part of the eternal  |tao|Tao| , and that all interact through  |qi|Qi| . Chapter 6 of the Tao Te Ching describes the Tao thus: The heart of Tao is immortal, the mysterious fertile mother of us all, of heaven and earth, of every thing and not-thing.        Panentheism is also a feature of some Christian  |philosophical_theologies|Philosophical_Theology|  and resonates strongly within the  |theological_tradition|Eastern_Orthodox_Christian_Theology|  of the  |Orthodox_Church|Orthodox_Church| .  It also appears in  |process_theology|Process_Theology| . Process theological thinkers are generally regarded in the  |Christian_West|Western_Christianity|  as unorthodox. Furthermore,  |process_philosophical|Process_Philosophy|  thought is widely believed to have paved the way for  |open_theism|Open_Theism| , a movement that tends to associate itself primarily with the  |Evangelical|Evangelicalism|  branch of  |Protestantism|Protestantism| , but is also generally considered unorthodox by most Evangelicals.            In  |Christianity|Christianity| , creation is not considered a literal part of God, and divinity is essentially distinct from creation . There is, in other words, an irradicable difference between the uncreated and the created . This does not mean, however, that the creation is wholly separated from God, because the creation exists in and from the  |divine_energies|Energies_Of_God| . In  |Eastern_Orthodoxy|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| , these energies or operations are the natural activity of God and are in some sense identifiable with God, but at the same time the creation is wholly distinct from the divine essence. God creates the universe by His will and from His energies. It is, however, not an imprint or emanation of Gods own essence , the essence He shares pre-eternally with  |His_Word_and_Holy_Spirit|Holy_Trinity| . Neither is it a directly literal outworking or effulgence of the divine, nor any other process which implies that creation is essentially God or a necessary part of God. The use of the term panentheism to describe the divine concept in  |Orthodox_Christian_theology|Eastern_Orthodox_Christian_Theology|  is problematic for those who would insist that panentheism requires creation to be part of God.     God is not merely Creator of the universe, as His dynamic presence is necessary to sustain the existence of every created thing, small and great, visible and invisible. St. Symeon in Practical & Theological Discourses, 1.1: “When men search for God with their bodily eyes they find Him nowhere, for He is invisible. But for those who ponder in the Spirit He is present everywhere. He is in all, yet beyond all.” That is, Gods  |energies|Energies_Of_God|  maintain the existence of the created order and all created beings, even if those agencies have explicitly rejected him. His love for creation is such that He will not withdraw His presence, which would be the ultimate form of  |annihilation|Annihilation| , not merely imposing death, but ending existence altogether. By this token, the entirety of creation is fundamentally good in its very being, and is not innately  |evil|Problem_Of_Evil|  either in whole or in part. This does not deny the existence of spiritual or moral evil in a  |fallen|The_Fall_Of_Man|  universe, only the claim that it is an intrinsic property of creation. Sin results from the  |essential_freedom|Metaphysical_Libertarianism|  of creatures to operate outside the divine order, not as a necessary consequence of having inherited human nature.       Many Christians who believe in  |universalism|Universalism|   – mainly expressed in the  |Universalist_Church_of_America|Universalist_Church_Of_America| , originating, as a fusion of  |Pietist|Pietist|  and  |Anabaptist|Anabaptist|  influences, from the American colonies of the 18th century  – hold panentheistic views of God in conjunction with their belief in  apocatastasis , also called  |universal_reconciliation|Universal_Reconciliation| . Panentheistic  |Christian_Universalists|Christian_Universalism|  often believe that all creations subsistence in God renders untenable the notion of final and permanent alienation from Him, citing Scriptural passages such as Ephesians 4:6 and Romans 11:36 to justify both panentheism and universalism. Panentheism was also a major force in the  |Unitarian|Unitarian_Universalism|  church for a long time, based in part on  |Ralph_Waldo_Emersons|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|  concept of the  |Over-soul|Over-Soul|  .     Panentheistic conceptions of God occur amongst some modern theologians.  |Process_theology|Process_Theology|  and  |Creation_Spirituality|Creation_Spirituality| , two recent developments in  |Christian_theology|Christian_Theology| , contain panentheistic ideas.  |Charles_Hartshorne|Charles_Hartshorne|  , who conjoined process theology with panentheism, maintained a lifelong membership in the Methodist church but was also a  |Unitarian|Unitarianism| . In later years he joined the  |Austin,_Texas|Austin,_Texas| ,  |Unitarian_Universalist|Unitarian_Universalism|  congregation and was an active participant in that church.  . Referring to the ideas such as Thomas Oords ‘theocosmocentrism’ , the soft panentheism of open theism, Keith Wards comparative theology and John Polkinghornes critical realism , Raymond Potgieter observes distinctions such as dipolar and bipolar:     The former suggests two poles separated such as God influencing creation and it in turn its creator , whereas bipolarity completes God’s being implying interdependence between temporal and eternal poles. , in dealing with Whitehead’s approach, does not make this distinction. I use the term bipolar as a generic term to include suggestions of the structural definition of God’s transcendence and immanence; to for instance accommodate a present and future reality into which deity must reasonably fit and function, and yet maintain separation from this world and evil whilst remaining within it. Potgieter, R., 2013, ‘Keith Ward’s soft panentheism’, In die Skriflig/In Luce Verbi 47, Art. 581, 9 pages.  ids.v47i1.581   Some argue that panentheism should also include the notion that God has always been related to some world or another, which denies the idea of creation out of nothing .  |Nazarene|Church_Of_The_Nazarene| |Methodist|Methodism|  theologian  |Thomas_Jay_Oord|Thomas_Jay_Oord|  advocates panentheism, but he uses the word theocosmocentrism to highlight the notion that God and some world or another are the primary conceptual starting blocks for eminently fruitful theology. This form of panentheism helps in overcoming the problem of evil and in proposing that Gods love for the world is essential to who God is.      The  |Christian_Church_International|Christian_Church_International|  also holds to a panentheist doctrine. The  |Latter_Day_Saint_movement|Latter_Day_Saint_Movement|  teaches that the  |Light_of_Christ|Light_Of_Christ|  proceeds from God through Christ and gives life and light to all things. , lds.org.            Gnosticism is a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems prevalent in the first and second century AD. The teachings of the various gnostic groups were very diverse. In his Dictionary of Gnosticism, Andrew Phillip Smith has written that some branches of Gnosticism taught a panentheistic view of reality,  and held to the belief that God exists in the visible world only as sparks of spiritual light . The goal of human existence is to know the sparks within oneself in order to return to God, who is in the Fullness .     Gnosticism was panentheistic, believing that the true God is simultaneously both separate from the physical universe and present within it. As Jesus states in the  |Gospel_of_Thomas|Gospel_Of_Thomas| , I am the light that is over all things. I am all ... . Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.  Gospel of Thomas , saying 77. This seemingly contradictory interpretation of gnostic theology is not without controversy, since one interpretation of  |dualistic_theology|Dualistic_Cosmology|  holds that a perfect God of pure spirit would not manifest himself through the fallen world of matter.      |Manichaeism|Manichaeism| , being another gnostic sect, preached a very different doctrine in positioning the true Manichaean God against matter as well as other deities, that it described as enmeshed with the world, namely the gods of Jews, Christians and pagans. “Now, he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests he says is the archont of Darkness, and the Christians, Jews, and pagans are one and the same, as they revere the same god. For in his aspirations he seduces them, as he is not the god of truth. And so therefore all those who put their hope in the god who spoke with Moses and the prophets have to be bound with him, because they did not put their hope in the god of truth. For that one spoke with them according to their own aspirations.” And elsewhere: “Now God has no part in this cosmos nor does he rejoice over it.” Classical Texts: Acta Archelai, p. 76 . Cf. . Nevertheless, this dualistic teaching included an elaborate cosmological myth that narrates the defeat of primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light. But the blessed One sent, through his beneficent Spirit and his great mercy, a helper to Adam, luminous  |Epinoia|Epinoia|  which comes out of him, who is called Life. And the luminous Epinoia was hidden in Adam, in order that the archons might not know her, but that the Epinoia might be a correction of the deficiency of the mother. And the man came forth because of the shadow of the light which is in him. And they took counsel with the whole array of archons and angels. And they brought him into the shadow of death, in order that they might form again from earth This is the tomb of the newly-formed body with which the robbers had clothed the man, the bond of forgetfulness; and he became a mortal man. But the Epinoia of the light which was in him, she is the one who was to awaken his thinking.       |Valentinian_Gnosticism|Valentinianism|  taught that matter came about through  |emanations|Emanationism|  of the supreme being, even if to some this event is held to be more accidental than intentional  . To other gnostics, these emanations were akin to the  |Sephirot|Sephirot|  of the Kabbalists and deliberate manifestations of a transcendent God through a complex system of intermediaries.       While mainstream  |Rabbinic_Judaism|Rabbinic_Judaism|  is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  , the panentheistic conception of God can be found among certain mystical Jewish traditions. A leading scholar of  |Kabbalah|Kabbalah| ,  |Moshe_Idel|Moshe_Idel|  Hasidism: Between Ecstacy and Magic, SUNY, 1995, p. 17 f. ascribes this doctrine to the kabbalistic system of  |Moses_ben_Jacob_Cordovero|Moses_Ben_Jacob_Cordovero|  and in the eighteenth century to the  |Baal_Shem_Tov|Baal_Shem_Tov|  , founder of the  |Hasidic_movement|Hasidic_Judaism| , as well as his contemporaries, Rabbi  |Dov_Ber,_the_Maggid_of_Mezeritch|Dov_Ber_Of_Mezeritch|  , and Menahem Mendel, the Maggid of Bar. This may be said of many, if not most, subsequent Hasidic masters. There is some debate as to whether  |Isaac_Luria|Isaac_Luria|  and  |Lurianic_Kabbalah|Lurianic_Kabbalah| , with its doctrine of  |tzimtzum|Tzimtzum| , can be regarded as panentheistic.     According to  |Hasidism|Hasidism| , the infinite  |Ein_Sof|Ein_Sof|  is incorporeal and exists in a state that is both  |transcendent|Transcendence|  and  |immanent|Immanent| . This appears to be the view of non-Hasidic Rabbi  |Chaim_of_Volozhin|Chaim_Of_Volozhin| , as well.  |Hasidic_Judaism|Hasidic_Judaism|  merges the elite ideal of  |nullification|Kenosis|  to a transcendent God, via the intellectual articulation of inner dimensions through Kabbalah and with emphasis on the panentheistic  |divine_immanence|Divine_Immanence|  in everything.      Many scholars would argue that panentheism is the best single-word description of the philosophical theology of  |Baruch_Spinoza|Baruch_Spinoza| .  It is therefore no surprise, that aspects of panentheism are also evident in the theology of  |Reconstructionist_Judaism|Reconstructionist_Judaism|  as presented in the writings of  |Mordecai_Kaplan|Mordecai_Kaplan|  , who was strongly influenced by Spinoza.           Several  |Sufi|Sufi|  saints and thinkers, primarily  |Ibn_Arabi|Ibn_Arabi| , held beliefs that have been considered panentheistic.  These notions later took shape in the theory of  |wahdat_ul-wujud|Wahdat_Ul-Wujud|  . Some Sufi Orders, notably the  |Bektashis|Bektashis|   and the  |Universal_Sufi|Universal_Sufism|  movement, continue to espouse panentheistic beliefs.  |Nizari|Nizari| |Ismaili|Ismaili|  follow  |panentheism_according_to_Ismaili_doctrine|Panentheism| . Nevertheless, some  |Shia|Shia|  Muslims also do believe in different degrees of Panentheism.     Al-Qayyuum is a  |Name_of_God|Names_Of_God_In_Islam|  in the Quran which translates to The Self-Existing by Whom all subsist . In Islam the universe can not exist if Allah doesnt exist, and it is only by His power which encompasses everything and which is everywhere that the universe can exist. In Ayaẗ al-Kursii Gods throne is described as extending over the heavens and the earth and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them . This does not mean though that the universe is God, or that a creature is God, because those would be respectively  |pantheism|Pantheism| , which is a heresy in traditional Islam, and the worst heresy in Islam, shirk . God is separated by His creation but His creation can not survive without Him.       The Mesoamerican empires of the  |Mayas|Maya_Religion| ,  |Aztecs|Aztec_Religion|  as well as the South American  |Incas|Religion_In_The_Inca_Empire|   have typically been characterized as  |polytheistic|Polytheism| , with strong male and female deities.  According to  |Charles_C._Manns|Charles_C._Mann|  history book  1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus , only the lower classes of Aztec society were polytheistic. Philosopher James Maffie has argued that Aztec metaphysics was pantheistic rather than panentheistic, since  |Teotl|Teotl|  was considered by Aztec philosophers to be the ultimate all-encompassing yet all-transcending force defined by its inherit duality.       |Native_American_beliefs|Native_American_Religion|  in  |North_America|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  have been characterized as panentheistic in that there is an emphasis on a single, unified divine spirit that is manifest in each individual entity.   This concept is referred to by many as the  |Great_Spirit|Great_Spirit| . Philosopher  |J._Baird_Callicott|J._Baird_Callicott|  has described Lakota theology as panentheistic, in that the divine both transcends and is immanent in everything.      One exception can be modern  |Cherokee|Cherokee|  who are predominantly  |monotheistic|Monotheism|  but apparently not panentheistic; , retrieved 2008-03-24. yet in older Cherokee traditions many observe both aspects of pantheism and panentheism, and are often not beholden to exclusivity, encompassing other spiritual traditions without contradiction, a common trait among some tribes in the Americas. In the stories of  |Keetoowah|Keetoowah|  storytellers Sequoyah Guess and Dennis Sixkiller, God is known as ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯ, commonly pronounced unehlanv, and visited earth in prehistoric times, but then left earth and her people to rely on themselves. This shows a parallel to  |Vaishnava|Vaishnava|  cosmology.       The  |Sikh_gurus|Sikh_Gurus|  have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the  |Guru_Granth_Sahib|Guru_Granth_Sahib| , the holy scripture of  |Sikhism|Sikhism| , but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout. God is described in the  |Mool_Mantar|Mul_Mantar| , the first passage in the  |Guru_Granth_Sahib|Guru_Granth_Sahib| , and the basic formula of the faith is:      in Punjabi   — ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥   Punjabi in Latin script   Ik Oankar Satnaam KartaaPurakh Nirbhau Nirvair AkaalMoorat Ajooni Saibhan GurPrasad   English translation   One primal being who made the sound that expanded and created the world. Truth is the name. Creative being personified. Without fear, without hate. Image of the undying. Beyond birth, self existent. By Gurus grace~     Guru Arjan, the fifth guru of Sikhs, says, God is beyond colour and form, yet His/Her presence is clearly visible , and Nanaks Lord transcends the world as well as the scriptures of the east and the west, and yet He/She is clearly manifest .     Knowledge of the ultimate Reality is not a matter for reason; it comes by revelation of the ultimate reality through nadar and by  |anubhava|Anubhava|  . Says Guru Nanak; budhi pathi na paiai bahu chaturaiai bhai milai mani bhane. This translates to He/She is not accessible through intellect, or through mere scholarship or cleverness at argument; He/She is met, when He/She pleases, through devotion .     Guru Nanak prefixed the numeral one to it, making it Ik Oankar or Ek Oankar to stress Gods oneness. God is named and known only through his Own immanent nature. The only name which can be said to truly fit Gods transcendent state is SatNam , the changeless and timeless Reality. God is transcendent and all-pervasive at the same time. Transcendence and immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality. The Reality is immanent in the entire creation, but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully. As says Guru Tegh Bahadur, Nanak IX, He has himself spread out His/Her Own “maya” which He oversees; many different forms He assumes in many colours, yet He stays independent of all .            In the  |Baháí_Faith|Baháí_Faith| , God is described as a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. The connection between God and the world is that of the creator to his  |creation|Genesis_Creation_Myth| .  God is understood to be independent of his creation, and that creation is dependent and contingent on God. Accordingly, the  |Baháí_Faith|Baháí_Faith|  is much more closely aligned with traditions of monotheism than panentheism. God is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. Instead, in the  |Baháí_understanding|Baháí_Teachings| , the world of creation  |emanates|Wiktionary:Emanate|  from God, in that all things have been realized by him and have attained to existence.
