Planners settled on an orbital flight with a dog. Soviet rocket engineers had long intended a canine orbit before attempting human spaceflight; since 1951, they had lofted twelve dogs into sub-orbital space on ballistic flights, working gradually toward an orbital mission set for some time in 1958. To satisfy Khrushchevs demands, they expedited the orbital canine flight for the November launch.     According to Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik  2 was made on 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft.
