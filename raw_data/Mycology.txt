     Mycology is the branch of  |biology|Biology|  concerned with the study of  |fungi|Fungus| , including their  |genetic|Genetics|  and  |biochemical|Biochemistry|  properties, their  |taxonomy|Taxonomy|  and  |their_use_to_humans|Ethnomycology|  as a source for  |tinder|Tinder| ,  |traditional_medicine|Traditional_Medicine| ,  |food|Edible_Mushroom| , and  |entheogens|Entheogens| , as well as their dangers, such as  |toxicity|Poison|  or  |infection|Fungal_Infection| .     A biologist specializing in mycology is called a mycologist.     Mycology branches into the field of  |phytopathology|Phytopathology| , the study of plant diseases, and the two disciplines remain closely related because the vast majority of plant pathogens are fungi.       Historically, mycology was a branch of  |botany|Botany|  because, although fungi are  |evolution|Evolution| arily more closely related to animals than to plants, this was not recognized until a few decades ago. Pioneer mycologists included  |Elias_Magnus_Fries|Elias_Magnus_Fries| ,  |Christian_Hendrik_Persoon|Christian_Hendrik_Persoon| ,  |Anton_de_Bary|Anton_De_Bary| , and  |Lewis_David_von_Schweinitz|Lewis_David_Von_Schweinitz| .     Many fungi produce  |toxins|Toxin| ,  |antibiotics|Antibiotics| , and other  |secondary_metabolites|Secondary_Metabolism| . For example, the  |cosmopolitan|Cosmopolitan_Distribution|  genus  Fusarium  and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by  |Abraham_Joffe|Abraham_Joffe| .     Fungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as  |symbionts|Symbiosis| , e.g. in the form of  |mycorrhizae|Mycorrhiza| ,  |insect|Insect|  symbionts, and  |lichens|Lichen| . Many fungi are able to break down complex  |organic|Organic_Compound| |biomolecules|Biomolecules|  such as  |lignin|Lignin| , the more durable component of  |wood|Wood| , and pollutants such as  |xenobiotics|Xenobiotic| ,  |petroleum|Petroleum| , and  |polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons|Polycyclic_Aromatic_Hydrocarbon| . By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the global  |carbon_cycle|Carbon_Cycle| .     Fungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as  |oomycetes|Oomycetes|  and myxomycetes , often are economically and socially important, as some cause diseases of animals  as well as plants .     Apart from pathogenic fungi, many fungal species are very important in controlling the plant diseases caused by different pathogens. For example, species of the filamentous fungal genus  Trichoderma  considered as one of the most important biological control agents as an alternative to chemical based products for effective crop diseases management.      Field meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as forays, after the first such meeting organized by the  |Woolhope_Naturalists_Field_Club|Woolhope_Naturalists_Field_Club|  in 1868 and entitled A foray among the funguses sic.      Some fungi can cause disease in humans and other animals - The study of  |pathogenic_fungi|Pathogenic_Fungi|  that infect animals is referred to as  |medical_mycology|Pathogenic_Fungi| .        It is presumed that humans started  |collecting_mushrooms|Mushroom_Hunting|  as food in  |prehistoric|Prehistoric|  times. Mushrooms were first written about in the works of  |Euripides|Euripides|  . The Greek philosopher  |Theophrastos|Theophrastos|  of  |Eresos|Eresos|  was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants; mushrooms were considered to be plants missing certain organs. It was later  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder|  , who wrote about  |truffles|Truffles|  in his encyclopedia  Naturalis historia . The word mycology comes from the  |Greek|Greek_Language| , meaning fungus and the suffix  , meaning study .     The  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi. Rather, the invention of the printing press allowed some authors to dispel superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors. Ainsworth, p. 13.          The start of the modern age of mycology begins with  |Pier_Antonio_Michelis|Pier_Antonio_Micheli|  1737 publication of Nova plantarum genera. Ainsworth, p. 4. Published in  |Florence|Florence| , this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic  |classification|Classification|  of grasses, mosses and fungi. The term mycology and the complementary mycologist were first used in 1836 by  |M.J._Berkeley|Miles_Joseph_Berkeley| . Ainsworth, p. 2.          For centuries, certain mushrooms have been documented as a  |folk_medicine|Traditional_Medicine|  in  |China|China| ,  |Japan|Japan| , and  |Russia|Russia| .  Although the use of mushrooms in folk medicine is centered largely on the Asian continent, people in other parts of the world like the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| ,  |Poland|Poland| , and  |Belarus|Belarus|  have been documented using mushrooms for medicinal purposes.  Sahih Muslim, Book 23, Chapter 27,  |Hadiths|Hadith|       Mushrooms produce large amounts of  |vitamin_D|Vitamin_D|  when exposed to  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet| .   |Penicillin|Penicillin| ,  |ciclosporin|Ciclosporin| ,  |griseofulvin|Griseofulvin| ,  |cephalosporin|Cephalosporin|  and  |psilocybin|Psilocybin|  are examples of drugs that have been isolated from  |molds|Mold|  or other fungi.
