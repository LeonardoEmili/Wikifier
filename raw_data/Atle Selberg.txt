   Atle Selberg was a Norwegian  |mathematician|Mathematician|  known for his work in  |analytic_number_theory|Analytic_Number_Theory|  and the theory of  |automorphic_forms|Automorphic_Form| , and in particular for bringing them into relation with  |spectral_theory|Spectral_Theory| . He was awarded the  |Fields_Medal|Fields_Medal|  in 1950.       Selberg was born in  |Langesund|Langesund| , Norway, the son of teacher Anna Kristina Selberg and mathematician  |Ole_Michael_Ludvigsen_Selberg|Ole_Michael_Ludvigsen_Selberg| . Two of his three brothers,  |Sigmund|Sigmund_Selberg|  and  |Henrik|Henrik_Selberg| , were also mathematicians. His other brother,  |Arne|Arne_Selberg| , was a professor of engineering.      While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of  |Srinivasa_Ramanujan|Srinivasa_Ramanujan|  and he found an exact analytical formula for the  |partition_function|Partition_Partition_Function|  as suggested by the works of Ramanujan; however, this result was first published by  |Hans_Rademacher|Hans_Rademacher| . During the war he fought against the German invasion of Norway, and was imprisoned several times.   He studied at the  |University_of_Oslo|University_Of_Oslo|  and completed his  |Ph.D.|Ph.D.|  in 1943.       During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Selberg worked in isolation due to the  |German_occupation_of_Norway|German_Occupation_Of_Norway| . After the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the  |Riemann_zeta_function|Riemann_Zeta_Function|  lie on the line   .     After the war, he turned to  |sieve_theory|Sieve_Theory| , a previously neglected topic which Selbergs work brought into prominence. In a 1947 paper he introduced the  |Selberg_sieve|Selberg_Sieve| , a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to  |Chens_theorem|Chens_Theorem| , among other important results.     In 1948 Selberg submitted two papers in  Annals of Mathematics  in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for  |primes_in_arithmetic_progression|Primes_In_Arithmetic_Progression|  and the  |density_of_primes|Prime_Number_Theorem| .     This challenged the widely held view of his time that certain theorems are only obtainable with the advanced methods of  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis| . Both results were based on his work on the asymptotic formula   :       +       2x    + O    where   :         for primes p . He established this result by elementary means in March 1948, and by July of that year, Selberg and  |Paul_Erdős|Paul_Erdős|  each obtained  |elementary_proofs|Elementary_Proof|  of the  |prime_number_theorem|Prime_Number_Theorem| , both using the asymptotic formula above as a starting point.  Circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between the two mathematicians.       For his fundamental accomplishments during the 1940s, Selberg received the 1950  |Fields_Medal|Fields_Medal| .       Selberg moved to the United States and settled at the  |Institute_for_Advanced_Study|Institute_For_Advanced_Study|  in  |Princeton,_New_Jersey|Princeton,_New_Jersey|  in the 1950s where he remained until his death. During the 1950s he worked on introducing  |spectral_theory|Spectral_Theory|  into  |number_theory|Number_Theory| , culminating in his development of the  |Selberg_trace_formula|Selberg_Trace_Formula| , the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of  |closed_geodesics|Closed_Geodesic|  on a  |compact_Riemann_surface|Compact_Riemann_Surface|  and the  |eigenvalues|Eigenvalue|  of the  |Laplacian|Laplace-Beltrami_Operator| , which is analogous to the duality between the  |prime_numbers|Prime_Number|  and the zeros of the zeta function.     He was awarded the 1986  |Wolf_Prize_in_Mathematics|Wolf_Prize_In_Mathematics| . He was also awarded an honorary  |Abel_Prize|Abel_Prize|  in 2002, its founding year, before the awarding of the regular prizes began.     Selberg received many distinctions for his work in addition to the  |Fields_Medal|Fields_Medal| , the  |Wolf_Prize|Wolf_Prize|  and the  |Gunnerus_Medal|Gunnerus_Medal| . He was elected to the  |Norwegian_Academy_of_Science_and_Letters|Norwegian_Academy_Of_Science_And_Letters| , the  |Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Letters|Royal_Danish_Academy_Of_Sciences_And_Letters|  and the  |American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|American_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences| .     In 1972 he was awarded an  |honorary_degree|Honorary_Degree| , doctor philos. honoris causa, at the  |Norwegian_Institute_of_Technology|Norwegian_Institute_Of_Technology| , later part of  |Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology|Norwegian_University_Of_Science_And_Technology| .      Selberg had two children, Ingrid Selberg and Lars Selberg. Ingrid Selberg is married to playwright  |Mustapha_Matura|Mustapha_Matura| .     He died at home in  |Princeton,_New_Jersey|Princeton,_New_Jersey|  on 6 August 2007 of heart failure.        Atle Selberg Collected Papers: 1 ,  Collected Papers , .
