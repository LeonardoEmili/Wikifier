           Miles Dewey Davis III  was an American jazz  |trumpet|Trumpet| er, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the  |history_of_jazz|History_Of_Jazz|  and 20th century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.     Born and raised in  |Illinois|Illinois| , Davis left to study at the  |Juilliard_School|Juilliard_School|  in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of  |saxophonist|Saxophone| |Charlie_Parkers|Charlie_Parker| |_bebop|Bebop|  quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the  Birth of the Cool  sessions for  |Capitol_Records|Capitol_Records| , which were instrumental to the development of  |cool_jazz|Cool_Jazz| . In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest  |hard_bop|Hard_Bop|  music while on  |Prestige_Records|Prestige_Records|  but did so haphazardly due to a  |heroin|Heroin|  addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the  |Newport_Jazz_Festival|Newport_Jazz_Festival|  in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records|  and recorded the 1957 album  Round About Midnight . It was his first work with saxophonist  |John_Coltrane|John_Coltrane|  and bassist  |Paul_Chambers|Paul_Chambers| , key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger  |Gil_Evans|Gil_Evans| , such as the Spanish-influenced  Sketches of Spain  , and band recordings, such as  Milestones  and  Kind of Blue  . The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over four million copies in the U.S.     Davis made several line-up changes while recording  Someday My Prince Will Come  , his  |1961_Blackhawk_concerts|In_Person_Friday_And_Saturday_Nights_At_The_Blackhawk_Complete| , and  Seven Steps to Heaven  , another mainstream success that introduced bassist  |Ron_Carter|Ron_Carter| , pianist  |Herbie_Hancock|Herbie_Hancock| , and drummer  |Tony_Williams|Tony_Williams| . After adding saxophonist  |Wayne_Shorter|Wayne_Shorter|  to his new quintet in 1964,  Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the  |post_bop|Post_Bop|  genre with albums such as  E.S.P  and  Miles Smiles  ,  before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk,  |African_rhythms|Rhythm_In_Sub_Saharan_Africa| , emerging  |electronic_music_technology|Music_Technology| , and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist  |Joe_Zawinul|Joe_Zawinul| , drummer  |Al_Foster|Al_Foster| , and guitarist  |John_McLaughlin|John_Mclaughlin| . This period, beginning with Davis 1969 studio album  In a Silent Way  and concluding with the 1975 concert recording  Agharta , was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. ;  His million-selling 1970 record  Bitches Brew  helped spark a resurgence in the genres commercial popularity with  |jazz_fusion|Jazz_Fusion|  as the decade progressed.      After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and  |pop|Popular_Music|  sounds on albums such as  The Man with the Horn  and  Tutu  . Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered the trumpeter his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a  |stroke|Stroke| ,  |pneumonia|Pneumonia|  and  |respiratory_failure|Respiratory_Failure| . In 2006, Davis was inducted into the  |Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame|Rock_And_Roll_Hall_Of_Fame| , which recognized him as one of the key figures in the history of jazz.  Rolling Stone  described him as the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,  while  |Gerald_Early|Gerald_Early|  called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.        Miles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent  |African_American|African_American|  family in  |Alton|Alton_Illinois| , Illinois,  north of  |St_Louis|St_Louis| . He had an older sister, Dorothy Mae , and a younger brother, Vernon . His mother, Cleota Mae Henry of  |Arkansas|Arkansas| , was a music teacher and violinist, and his father,  |Miles_Dewey_Davis_Jr_|Miles_Dewey_Davis_Jr_| , also of Arkansas, was a dentist. They owned a 200-acre estate near  |Pine_Bluff|Pine_Bluff_Arkansas| , Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses. In 1927, the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighborhood. From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school, then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports. At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.          In 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father. He took lessons from  |Elwood_Buchanan|Elwood_Buchanan| , a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father. His mother wanted him to play violin instead. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without  |vibrato|Vibrato|  and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone. Davis said that whenever he started playing with heavy vibrato, Buchanan slapped his knuckles. In later years Davis said, I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I cant get that sound I cant play anything.  |Kahn|Kahn|  In 1939, the family moved to 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis. On his thirteenth birthday his father bought him a new trumpet, and Davis began to play in local bands. He took additional trumpet lessons from Joseph Gustat, principal trumpeter of the  |St_Louis_Symphony_Orchestra|St_Louis_Symphony_Orchestra| .     In 1941, the 15-year-old attended  |East_St_Louis_Lincoln_High_School|East_St_Louis_Lincoln_High_School| , where he joined the marching band directed by Buchanan and entered music competitions. Years later, Davis said that if he lost a contest, it was because of  |racism|Racism| , but he added that these experiences made him a better musician. When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldnt do it, he began to learn  |music_theory|Music_Theory| . I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory.  At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth . He had a band that performed at the Elks Club.  Part of his earnings paid for his sisters education at  |Fisk_University|Fisk_University| . Davis befriended trumpeter  |Clark_Terry|Clark_Terry| , who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.     With encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle. He became the bands musical director, which involved hiring musicians and scheduling rehearsal. Years later, Davis considered this job one of the most important of his career.  |Sonny_Stitt|Sonny_Stitt|  tried to persuade him to join the  |Tiny_Bradshaw|Tiny_Bradshaw|  band, which was passing through town, but his mother insisted he finish high school before going on tour. He said later, I didnt talk to her for two weeks. And I didnt go with the band either.  In January 1944, Davis finished high school and graduated in absentia in June. During the next month, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl.     In July 1944,  |Billy_Eckstine|Billy_Eckstine|  visited St. Louis with a band that included  |Art_Blakey|Art_Blakey| ,  |Dizzy_Gillespie|Dizzy_Gillespie| , and  |Charlie_Parker|Charlie_Parker| . Trumpeter Buddy Anderson was too sick to perform, so Davis was invited to join. He played with the band for two weeks at Club Riviera. After playing with these musicians, he was certain he should move to New York City where the action was.  His mother wanted him to go to Fisk University, like his sister, and study piano or violin. Davis had other interests.            In September 1944, Davis accepted his fathers idea of studying at the  |Institute_of_Musical_Arts|Juilliard_School| , later known as the Juilliard School, in New York City. After passing the audition, he attended classes in music theory, piano, and dictation.     But he spent much of his time in clubs looking for his idol, Charlie Parker. According to Davis, Coleman Hawkins told him finish your studies at Juilliard and forget Bird.   After finding Parker, he became one of a cadre of regulars at  |Mintons|Mintons_Playhouse|  and  |Monroes|Monroes|  in Harlem who held jam sessions every night. The other regulars included  |J_J_Johnson|J_J_Johnson| ,  |Kenny_Clarke|Kenny_Clarke| ,  |Thelonious_Monk|Thelonious_Monk| ,  |Fats_Navarro|Fats_Navarro| , and  |Freddie_Webster|Freddie_Webster| . Davis reunited with Cawthon and their daughter when they moved to New York City. Parker became a roommate.     In mid-1945, Davis failed to register for the years autumn term at Juilliard and dropped out after three semesters because he wanted to perform full-time. Years later he criticized Juilliard for concentrating too much on classical European and white repertoire, but he praised the school for teaching him music theory and improving his trumpet technique.     He began performing at clubs on 52nd Street with Coleman Hawkins and  |Eddie_Lockjaw_Davis|Eddie_Lockjaw_Davis| . He recorded for the first time on April 24, 1945 when he entered the studio as a sideman for  |Herbie_Fieldss|Herbie_Fields|  band. During the next year, he recorded as a leader for the first time with the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway, one of the few times he accompanied a singer.           In 1945, he replaced Dizzy Gillespie in Charlie Parkers quintet. On November 26, Davis participated in several recording sessions as part of Parkers group Reboppers that also involved Gillespie and  |Max_Roach|Max_Roach| , displaying hints of the style he would become known for. In Parkers song  |Nows_the_Time|Nows_The_Time|  , Davis played a solo that anticipated  |cool_jazz|Cool_Jazz| . He then joined a big band led by  |Benny_Carter|Benny_Carter| , performing in St. Louis and remaining with the band in California. He again played with Parker and Gillespie. In Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that put him in the hospital for several months. On this occasion, Mingus bitterly criticized Davis for abandoning his musical father . In March 1946, Davis played in studio sessions with Parker and began a collaboration with bassist  |Charles_Mingus|Charles_Mingus|  that summer. Cawthon gave birth to Daviss second child, Gregory, in East St. Louis before reuniting with Davis in New York City the following year. Davis noted that by this time, I was still so much into the music that I was even ignoring Irene. He had also turned to alcohol and cocaine.     He was a member of Billy Eckstines big band in 1946 and Gillespies in 1947.  He joined a quintet led by Parker that also included Max Roach. Together they performed live with  |Duke_Jordan|Duke_Jordan|  and  |Tommy_Potter|Tommy_Potter|  for much of the year, including several studio sessions. In one session that May, Davis wrote the tune Cheryl , named after his daughter. Daviss first session as a leader followed in August 1947, playing as the Miles Davis All Stars that included Parker, pianist  |John_Lewis|John_Lewis| , and bassist  |Nelson_Boyd|Nelson_Boyd| ; they recorded Milestones , Half Nelson , and Sippin at Bells . After touring Chicago and Detroit with Parkers quintet, Davis returned to New York City in March 1948 and joined the  |Jazz_at_the_Philharmonic|Jazz_At_The_Philharmonic|  tour, which included a stop in St. Louis on April 30.       In August 1948, Davis declined an offer to join  |Duke_Ellingtons|Duke_Ellington|  orchestra as he had entered rehearsals with a nine-piece band with pianist and arranger  |Gil_Evans|Gil_Evans|  and baritone saxophonist  |Gerry_Mulligan|Gerry_Mulligan| , taking an active role on what soon became his own project. Mulligan, Gerry.   Evans Manhattan apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, Lewis, and Mulligan who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated bebop. These gatherings led to the formation of the Miles Davis  |Nonet|Nonet| , which included the unusual additions of French horn and tuba. The intent was to imitate the human voice through carefully arranged compositions and a relaxed, melodic approach to improvisation. In September, the band completed their sole engagement as the opening band for  |Count_Basie|Count_Basie|  at the  |Royal_Roost|Royal_Roost|  for two weeks. Davis had to persuade the venues manager to write the sign Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan. He prevailed only with the help of  |Monte_Kay|Monte_Kay| , the clubs artistic director. Davis returned to Parkers quintet, but relationships within the quintet were growing tense mainly due to Parkers erratic behavior caused by his drug addiction. Early in his time with Parker, Davis abstained from drugs, ate a vegetarian diet, and spoke of the benefits of water and juice. Davis and Roach objected to the addition of pianist  |Duke_Jordan|Duke_Jordan| , preferring  |Bud_Powell|Bud_Powell| .      In December 1948 Davis quit, claiming he was not being paid. His departure began a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman. His nonet remained active until the end of 1949. After signing a contract with  |Capitol_Records|Capitol_Records| , they recorded sessions in January and April 1949, which sold little but influenced the cool or west coast style of jazz. The line-up changed throughout the year and included the additions of tuba player  |Bill_Barber|Bill_Barber| , alto saxophonist  |Lee_Konitz|Lee_Konitz| , who had been preferred to  |Sonny_Stitt|Sonny_Stitt|  as his style was considered too bop-oriented, pianist  |Al_Haig|Al_Haig| , trombone players  |Mike_Zwerin|Mike_Zwerin|  with  |Kai_Winding|Kai_Winding| , French horn players  |Junior_Collins|Junior_Collins|  with Sandy Siegelstein and  |Gunther_Schuller|Gunther_Schuller| , and bassists  |Al_McKibbon|Al_Mckibbon|  and  |Joe_Shulman|Joe_Shulman| . One track featured singer  |Kenny_Hagood|Kenny_Hagood| . The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms. Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol continued until April 1950; much of it remained unreleased until the issue of  Birth of the Cool  .     In May 1949, Davis performed with the  |Tadd_Dameron|Tadd_Dameron|  Quintet with  |Kenny_Clarke|Kenny_Clarke|  and  |James_Moody|James_Moody|  at the  |Paris_International_Jazz_Festival|Paris_Jazz_Festival| . On his first trip abroad Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where he felt black jazz musicians and people of color in general were better respected than in America. The trip, he said, changed the way I looked at things forever.  He began an affair with singer and actress  |Juliette_Gréco|Juliette_Gréco|  that lasted for several years.       After returning from Paris in mid-1949, he became depressed and found little work, which included a short engagement with Powell in October and guest spots in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit until January 1950. He was falling behind in hotel rent and attempts were made to repossess his car. His heroin use became an expensive addiction, and Davis, yet to reach 24 years old, lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift.  In August 1950, during a family trip to East St. Louis and Chicago in an attempt to improve their fortunes, Cawthon gave birth to Daviss second son, Miles IV. Davis befriended boxer  |Johnny_Bratton|Johnny_Bratton|  and began his interest in the sport. Davis left Cawthon and his three children in New York City in the hands of a friend, jazz singer  |Betty_Carter|Betty_Carter| . He remained grateful to her for the rest of his life. He toured with Eckstine and  |Billie_Holiday|Billie_Holiday|  and was arrested for heroin possession in Los Angeles. The story was reported in  DownBeat  magazine, which caused a further reduction in work, though he was acquitted weeks later.     In January 1951, Daviss fortunes improved when he signed a one-year contract with  |Prestige|Prestige_Records|  after owner  |Bob_Weinstock|Bob_Weinstock|  became a fan of the nonet  Davis chose Lewis, trombonist  |Bennie_Green|Bennie_Green| , bassist  |Percy_Heath|Percy_Heath| , saxophonist  |Sonny_Rollins|Sonny_Rollins| , and drummer  |Roy_Haynes|Roy_Haynes| ; they recorded what became part of  Miles Davis and Horns  . Davis was hired for other studio dates in March, June, and September 1951 and started transcribing scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. During the next month, he recorded his second session for Prestige as band leader. The material was released on  The New Sounds  ,  Dig  , and  Conception  .     Davis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a Down Beat interview with  |Cab_Calloway|Cab_Calloway| , whom he never forgave as it brought him all pain and suffering.  He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months. Though he continued to use heroin, he met Roach and Mingus in September 1953 on their way to Los Angeles and joined their band, but the trip caused problems. He returned to his fathers home, determined to kick my habit ... that was the only thing on my mind.  He locked himself inside the guest house for about seven or eight days until he had gone through withdrawal. After the ordeal, he sat down and started thinking about how I was going to get my life back together.      Davis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City where it was easy to get drugs. Though he used heroin, he was still able to perform locally with  |Elvin_Jones|Elvin_Jones|  and  |Tommy_Flanagan|Tommy_Flanagan|  as part of  |Billy_Mitchells|Billy_Mitchell|  house band at the  |Blue_Bird|Blue_Bird_Inn|  club. He was also pimping a little.  A widely related story, attributed to Richard Prophet Jennings,   was that Davis stumbled into  |Bakers_Keyboard_Lounge|Bakers_Keyboard_Lounge|  out of the rain, carrying his trumpet in a paper bag under his coat. He walked to the bandstand, interrupted Roach and  |Clifford_Brown|Clifford_Brown|  in the middle of performing  |Sweet_Georgia_Brown|Sweet_Georgia_Brown|  , and played  |My_Funny_Valentine|My_Funny_Valentine|  before leaving. Davis was supposedly embarrassed into getting clean by this incident. He disputed this account, stating that Roach had invited him to play and that his decision to quit heroin was unrelated to the incident. He said he was inspired to quit by his idol, boxer  |Sugar_Ray_Robinson|Sugar_Ray_Robinson| .          In February 1954 Davis returned to New York City, feeling good for the first time in a long time, mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym. He informed Weinstock and management at  |Blue_Note|Blue_Note_Records|  that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted. He considered the resulting albums  Miles Davis Quartet  and  Miles Davis Volume 2  very important because he felt his performances were particularly strong. He was paid roughly $750  for each album and refused to give away his publishing rights.     Davis abandoned the bebop style and turned to the music of pianist  |Ahmad_Jamal|Ahmad_Jamal| , whose approach and use of space influenced him. When he returned to the studio in June 1955 to record Miles Davis Quartet, he wanted a pianist like Jamal and picked  |Red_Garland|Red_Garland| .  Blue Haze  ,  Bags Groove  ,  Walkin  , and  Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants  were recorded after his recovery from heroin addiction. They documented the evolution of his sound with the  |Harmon_mute|Harmon_Mute| , also known as a  |wah_wah|Wah_Wah|  mute, placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in  |hard_bop|Hard_Bop| , which was slower than bebop, less radical in harmony and melody, and often used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues. Open references to the blues in jazz playing were fairly recent. Until the middle of the 1930s, as Coleman Hawkins declared to  |Alan_Lomax|Alan_Lomax|  , African-American players working in white establishments would avoid references to the blues altogether. A few critics consider Walkin  the album that created the hard bop genre.     Davis gained a reputation for being cold, distant—and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson was the most important thing in my life besides music and adopted Robinsons arrogant attitude.  He showed contempt for critics and the press. There were well-publicized confrontations with the public and with other musicians. An argument with  |Thelonious_Monk|Thelonious_Monk|  during the recording of Bags Groove was reported. Davis had asked Monk to lay off while he was soloing. In his autobiography, Davis says that Monk could not play behind a horn.  |Charles_Mingus|Charles_Mingus|  reported this, and more, in his Open Letter to Miles Davis. In mid-1954, Davis reunited with Gréco for the first time since 1949 after she arrived in New York City for film prospects. The two had been in occasional contact since he left Paris. Though he was too busy to move to Spain with her, they remained lovers for many years.     Davis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955. The doctors told him to remain silent after the operation—but he got into an argument that permanently damaged his vocal cords and gave him a raspy voice for the rest of his life. Acquired by shouting at a record producer while still ailing after a recent operation to the throat –  |The_Autobiography|Bio| . He was called the prince of darkness, adding a patina of mystery to his public persona. Writers began to refer to Davis as the Prince of Darkness in liner notes of the records of this period, and the moniker persisted. See, for instance,   in  The Nation , and references in DVD, movies  and print articles .       In July 1955, Daviss fortunes improved considerably when he was invited to the second annual  |Newport_Jazz_Festival|Newport_Jazz_Festival|  on July 17, with a line-up of Monk, Heath, drummer  |Connie_Kay|Connie_Kay| , and horn players  |Zoot_Sims|Zoot_Sims|  and  |Gerry_Mulligan|Gerry_Mulligan| . He convinced organizer  |George_Wein|George_Wein|  that he should be on the bill, and Wein agreed. The performance was praised by critics and increased his popularity among affluent white audiences. He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 Down Beat magazine Readers Poll.      |George_Avakian|George_Avakian|  of  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records|  saw Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance  and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.     At the request of Avakian, he formed the  |Miles_Davis_Quintet|Miles_Davis_Quintet|  for a performance at  |Café_Bohemia|Café_Bohemia| . The quintet consisted of Davis on trumpet, Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone,  |Red_Garland|Red_Garland|  on piano,  |Paul_Chambers|Paul_Chambers|  on double bass, and  |Philly_Joe_Jones|Philly_Joe_Jones|  on drums. Rollins was replaced by  |John_Coltrane|John_Coltrane| , completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige:  Cookin with the Miles Davis Quintet  ,  Relaxin with the Miles Davis Quintet  ,  Workin with the Miles Davis Quintet  , and  Steamin with the Miles Davis Quintet  . Each album helped establish Daviss quintet as one of the best.     The style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the  |Great_American_Songbook|Great_American_Songbook|  and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on  Round About Midnight , Daviss first album for Columbia.     In 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the  |Modern_Jazz_Quartet|Modern_Jazz_Quartet|  and French and German musicians. In Paris he reunited with Greco for the first time since 1949. He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine. At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and  |Art_Taylor|Art_Taylor| .     In November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the  |soundtrack|Ascenseur_Pour_Léchafaud|  to Ascenseur pour léchafaud directed by  |Louis_Malle|Louis_Malle|  . Consisting of French session musicians  |Barney_Wilen|Barney_Wilen| ,  |Pierre_Michelot|Pierre_Michelot| , and  |René_Urtreger|René_Urtreger| , and American drummer  |Kenny_Clarke|Kenny_Clarke| , the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.     After returning to New York City, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on  Milestones  , an album that demonstrated Daviss interest in  |modal_jazz|Modal_Jazz| . A performance by  |Les_Ballets_Africains|Les_Ballets_Africains|  drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords. In this form of ballet music, the  |kalimba|Kalimba|  was played for a long periods on a single chord, weaving in and out of  |consonance_and_dissonance|Consonance_And_Dissonance| .     By May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer  |Jimmy_Cobb|Jimmy_Cobb| , and Red Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on Sids Ahead for the album Milestones. He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired  |Bill_Evans|Bill_Evans| , a young, white pianist with a background in classical music. Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left.  |Wynton_Kelly|Wynton_Kelly| , his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evanss delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on  Jazz Track  .     Kind of Blue |Harvard_University|Harvard_University|  and a musical director at a record label. Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward. Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to Music for Brass , an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by  |Gunther_Schuller|Gunther_Schuller|  featuring Davis as a guest soloist.     Davis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.  Miles Ahead  showcased Davis playing a flugelhorn and a rendition The Maids of Cadiz by  |Léo_Delibes|Léo_Delibes| , the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music. Cook, op. cit.  Porgy and Bess  includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwins  |opera|Porgy_And_Bess| .  Sketches of Spain  contained music by composers  |Joaquín_Rodrigo|Joaquín_Rodrigo|  and  |Manuel_de_Falla|Manuel_De_Falla|  and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldnt handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US. Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity. The pairs final album was  Quiet Nights  , a collection of  |bossa_nova|Bossa_Nova|  songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer  |Teo_Macero|Teo_Macero|  and refused to speak to him for more than two years. Davis noted later that my best friend is Gil Evans ; their work was included in the boxed set  Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings  , which won a Grammy Award for  |Best_Historical_Album|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Historical_Album|  and  |Best_Album_Notes|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Album_Notes|  in 1997.     In March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album,  Kind of Blue  . He named the album for its mood. He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evanss piano style. Both Davis and Evans were familiar with  |George_Russells|George_Russell|  ideas about modal jazz. But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song,  |Freddie_Freeloader|Freddie_Freeloader| .  The sextet had played  |So_What|So_What|  and  |All_Blues|All_Blues|  at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.     Released in August 1959, Kind of Blue was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics. It remains the best selling jazz album of all time. In October 2008, the album reached  |4×_platinum|Riaa_Certification|  certification from the  |Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|Recording_Industry_Association_Of_America|  for selling over four million copies in the US alone.  In 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution that honored it as a national treasure.       During the success of Kind of Blue, Davis found himself involved with the law. On August 25, 1959, during a recording session at the  |Birdland|Birdland|  nightclub in New York City for the US Armed Services, he took a break outside the club. As he was escorting a blonde-haired woman to a taxi, policeman Gerald Kilduff told him to move on.  Davis said that he was working at the club, and he refused to move.  Kilduff arrested him and grabbed him as he tried to protect himself.  Witnesses said the policeman punched Davis in the stomach with a nightstick without provocation. Two detectives held the crowd back, while a third approached Davis from behind and beat him in the head. Davis was taken to jail, charged for assaulting an officer, then taken to the hospital where he received five stitches. He was released on a $525 bail . By January 1960, he was acquitted of disorderly conduct and third-degree assault. He later stated the incident changed my whole life and whole attitude again, made me feel bitter and cynical again when I was starting to feel good about the things that had changed in this country.      Davis and his sextet toured to support Kind of Blue. He persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his quartet, though he returned for some tracks on Daviss album  Someday My Prince Will Come  . Its front cover shows a photograph of his wife, Frances Taylor, after Davis demanded that Columbia depict black women on his album covers. In early 1958, Davis began a relationship with Frances Taylor, a dancer he had met five years earlier in Los Angeles. They married on December 21, 1960.  The relationship involved numerous incidents of Davis  |domestic_violence|Domestic_Violence|  towards Taylor. He later wrote, Every time I hit her, I felt bad because a lot of it really wasnt her fault but had to do with me being temperamental and jealous.   One reason for his behavior was that in 1963 he had increased his use of alcohol and cocaine to reduce joint pain caused by  |sickle_cell_anemia|Sickle_Cell_Anemia| . He hallucinated, looking for this imaginary person in his house while wielding a kitchen knife. About a week after the photograph for the album  E.S.P.  was taken, Taylor left him for the last time. They remained separated until their divorce in February 1968. Davis later recalled that Frances was the best wife I ever had and I made a mistake when I broke up with her.           In December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left to join them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000  to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist  |George_Coleman|George_Coleman| , bassist  |Ron_Carter|Ron_Carter| , pianist  |Victor_Feldman|Victor_Feldman| , and drummer  |Frank_Butler|Frank_Butler| . By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist  |Herbie_Hancock|Herbie_Hancock|  and 17-year-old drummer  |Tony_Williams|Tony_Williams|  who made Davis excited all over again.  With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became  Seven Steps to Heaven  and recorded the live albums  Miles Davis in Europe  ,  My Funny Valentine  , and  Four & More  . The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Daviss previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.     In 1964, Coleman was replaced by saxophonist  |Sam_Rivers|Sam_Rivers|  until Davis persuaded  |Wayne_Shorter|Wayne_Shorter|  to leave  |Art_Blakey|Art_Blakey| . This quintet lasted through 1968. Shorter became the groups principal composer, and the album E.S.P. was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album,  Miles in Berlin  .     Davis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year. He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed. After his third month in the hospital, he discharged himself due to boredom and went home. He returned to the hospital in August after a fall required the insertion of a plastic hip joint. In November 1965, he had recovered enough to return to performing with his quintet, which included  |gigs_at_the_Plugged_Nickel|The_Complete_Live_At_The_Plugged_Nickel_1965|  in Chicago. Teo Macero returned as his engineer and record producer after their rift over Quiet Nights had healed.        In January 1966, Davis spent three months in the hospital due to a liver infection. When he resumed touring, he performed more at colleges because he had grown tired of the typical jazz venues. Columbia president  |Clive_Davis|Clive_Davis|  noted that in 1966 his sales had declined to around 40,000–50,000 per album, compared to as many as 100,000 per release a few years before. Matters were not helped by the press reporting his apparent financial troubles and imminent demise. After his appearance at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, he returned to the studio with his quintet for a series of productive sessions. He started a relationship with actress  |Cicely_Tyson|Cicely_Tyson| , who helped him reduce his alcohol consumption.     Material from the 1966–1968 sessions was released on  Miles Smiles  ,  Sorcerer  ,  Nefertiti  ,  Miles in the Sky  , and  Filles de Kilimanjaro  . The quintets approach to the new music became known as time no changes —which referred to Daviss decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists melodies. Through Nefertiti the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.     Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the  |fusion|Jazz_Fusion|  phase of Daviss career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro was recorded, bassist  |Dave_Holland|Dave_Holland|  and pianist  |Chick_Corea|Chick_Corea|  had replaced Carter and Hancock. Davis soon took over the compositional duties of his sidemen.          In September 1968, Davis married 23-year-old model and songwriter  |Betty_Mabry|Betty_Davis| . In his autobiography, Davis described her as a high-class groupie, who was very talented but who didnt believe in her own talent. Mabry, a familiar face in the New York City counterculture, helped introduce Davis to popular rock, soul, and funk musicians. Jazz critic  |Leonard_Feather|Leonard_Feather|  visited Daviss apartment and was shocked to find him listening to albums by  |The_Byrds|The_Byrds| ,  |Aretha_Franklin|Aretha_Franklin| , and  |Dionne_Warwick|Dionne_Warwick| . He also liked  |James_Brown|James_Brown| ,  |Sly_and_the_Family_Stone|Sly_And_The_Family_Stone| , and  |Jimi_Hendrix|Jimi_Hendrix| , whose group  |Band_of_Gypsys|Band_Of_Gypsys|  particularly made an impression on Davis.  Davis filed for divorce from Mabry in 1969, after accusing her of having an affair with Jimi Hendrix.      In a Silent Way  was recorded in a single studio session on February 18, 1969, with Shorter, Hancock, Holland, and Williams alongside keyboardists  |Chick_Corea|Chick_Corea|  and  |Josef_Zawinul|Josef_Zawinul|  and guitarist  |John_McLaughlin|John_Mclaughlin| . The album contains two side-long tracks that Macero pieced together from different takes recorded at the session.   When the album was released in July 1969, some critics accused him of selling out to the rock and roll audience. Nevertheless, it reached number 134 on the US  |Billboard_Top_LPs|Billboard_200|  chart, his first album since My Funny Valentine to reach the chart. In a Silent Way was his entry into jazz fusion. The touring band of 1969–1970—with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette—never completed a studio recording together, and became known as Daviss lost quintet .       In October 1969, Davis was shot at five times while in his car with one of his two lovers, Marguerite Eskridge. The incident left him with a graze and Eskridge unharmed. In 1970, Marguerite gave birth to their son Erin.     For the double album  Bitches Brew  , he hired  |Jack_DeJohnette|Jack_Dejohnette| ,  |Airto_Moreira|Airto_Moreira| , and  |Bennie_Maupin|Bennie_Maupin| . The album contained long compositions, some over twenty minutes, that were never played in the studio but were constructed from several takes by Macero and Davis. Other studio techniques included splicing, multitrack recording, and tape loops. Bitches Brew peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard Album chart.  In 1976 it was certified gold for selling over 500,000 records. By 2003, it had sold one million copies.        In March 1970, Davis began to perform as the opening act for various rock acts, allowing Columbia to market Bitches Brew to a larger audience. He was so offended by Clive Daviss suggestion to perform at the  |Fillmore_East|Fillmore_East|  that he threatened to switch record labels, but he reconsidered and shared a bill with the  |Steve_Miller_Band|Steve_Miller_Band|  and  |Neil_Young|Neil_Young|  with  |Crazy_Horse|Crazy_Horse|  on March 6 and 7. Biographer  |Paul_Tingen|Paul_Tingen|  wrote, Miles newcomer status in this environment led to mixed audience reactions, often having to play for dramatically reduced fees, and enduring the sell-out accusations from the jazz world, as well as being ...attacked by sections of the black press for supposedly genuflecting to white culture.  The 1970 tours included the  |1970_Isle_of_Wight_Festival|Isle_Of_Wight_Festival_1970|  on August 29 when he performed to an estimated 600,000 people, the largest of his career. Plans to record with Hendrix ended after the guitarists death; his funeral was the last that Davis attended. Several live albums with a transitional sextet/septet including Corea, DeJohnette, Holland, Moreira, saxophonist  |Steve_Grossman|Steve_Grossman| , and keyboardist  |Keith_Jarrett|Keith_Jarrett|  were recorded during this period, including  Miles Davis at Fillmore  and  Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West  .         By 1971, Davis had signed a contract with Columbia that paid him $100,000 a year  for three years in addition to royalties. He recorded a soundtrack album  for the  |1970_documentary_film|Jack_Johnson|  about heavyweight boxer  |Jack_Johnson|Jack_Johnson| , containing two long pieces of 25 and 26 minutes in length with Hancock, McLaughlin,  |Sonny_Sharrock|Sonny_Sharrock| , and  |Billy_Cobham|Billy_Cobham| . He was committed to making music for African-Americans who liked more commercial, pop, groove-oriented music. By November 1971, DeJohnette and Moreira had been replaced in the touring ensemble by drummer  |Leon_Ndugu_Chancler|Leon_Ndugu_Chancler|  and percussionists  |James_Mtume|James_Mtume|  and  |Don_Alias|Don_Alias| .   Live-Evil  was released in the same month. Showcasing former Stevie Wonder touring bassist  |Michael_Henderson|Michael_Henderson| , who replaced Holland in the autumn of 1970, the album demonstrated that Daviss ensemble had transformed into a funk-oriented group while retaining the exploratory imperative of Bitches Brew.     In 1972, composer-arranger  |Paul_Buckmaster|Paul_Buckmaster|  introduced Davis to the music of German avant-garde composer  |Karlheinz_Stockhausen|Karlheinz_Stockhausen| , leading to a period of creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, The effect of Davis study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis own space music shows Stockhausens influence compositionally.  His recordings and performances during this period were described as space music by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music.   The studio album  On the Corner  blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements. Davis invited Buckmaster to New York City to oversee the writing and recording of the album with Macero. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard jazz chart but peaked at No. 156 on the more heterogeneous Top 200 Albums chart. On the Corner elicited a favorable review from  |Ralph_J_Gleason|Ralph_J_Gleason|  of Rolling Stone,  but Davis felt that Columbia marketed it to the wrong audience. The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids dont listen to those stations; they listen to R & B stations and some rock stations.  In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash. He took painkillers and cocaine to cope with the pain. Looking back at his career after the incident, he wrote, Everything started to blur.         After recording On the Corner, he assembled a group with Henderson, Mtume,  |Carlos_Garnett|Carlos_Garnett| , guitarist  |Reggie_Lucas|Reggie_Lucas| , organist  |Lonnie_Liston_Smith|Lonnie_Liston_Smith| , tabla player  |Badal_Roy|Badal_Roy| , sitarist  |Khalil_Balakrishna|Khalil_Balakrishna| , and drummer  |Al_Foster|Al_Foster| . Only Smith was a jazz instrumentalist; consequently, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of solos. This group was recorded live for  In Concert  , but Davis found it unsatisfactory, leading him to drop the tabla and sitar and play keyboards. He also added guitarist  |Pete_Cosey|Pete_Cosey| . The compilation studio album  Big Fun  contains four long improvisations recorded between 1969 and 1972.     Studio activity in the 1970s culminated in sessions throughout 1973 and 1974 for  Get Up with It  , a compilation that included four long pieces alongside four shorter recordings from 1970 and 1972. The album contained He Loved Him Madly , a thirty-minute tribute to the recently deceased Duke Ellington that presaged later developments in  |ambient_music|Ambient_Music| .  In the United States, it performed comparably to On the Corner, reaching number 8 on the jazz chart and number 141 on the pop chart. He then concentrated on live performance with a series of concerts that Columbia released on the double live albums  Agharta  ,  Pangaea  , and  Dark Magus  . The first two are recordings of two sets from February 1, 1975 in Osaka, by which time Davis was troubled by pneumonia, osteoarthritis, sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, and stomach ulcers; he relied on alcohol, codeine, and morphine to get through the engagements. His shows were routinely panned by critics who mentioned his habit of performing with his back to the audience. Cosey later asserted that the band really advanced after the Japanese tour , but Davis was again hospitalized, for his ulcers and a hernia, during a tour of the US while opening for Herbie Hancock. Hancock had eclipsed his former employer from a commercial standpoint with  Head Hunters  and  Thrust  , two albums that were marketed to pop audiences in the aftermath of the On the Corner farrago and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard pop chart.     After appearances at the 1975 Newport Jazz Festival in July and the  |Schaefer_Music_Festival|Schaefer_Music_Festival|  in New York City on September 5, Davis dropped out of music.        In his autobiography, Davis wrote frankly about his life during his hiatus from music. He called his  |Upper_West_Side|Upper_West_Side|  brownstone a wreck and chronicled his heavy use of alcohol and cocaine, in addition to his sexual encounters with many women. In December 1975, he had regained enough strength to undergo a much needed hip replacement operation. In March 1976, Rolling Stone reported rumors of his imminent demise, citing his health problems during the previous tour. In December 1976, Columbia was reluctant to renew his contract and pay his usual large advances. But after his lawyer started negotiating with  |United_Artists|United_Artists_Records| , Columbia matched their offer, establishing the Miles Davis Fund to pay him regularly. Pianist  |Vladimir_Horowitz|Vladimir_Horowitz|  was the only other musician with Columbia that had a similar status.     In 1978, Julie Coryell interviewed Davis. Concerned about his health, she had him stay with a friend in  |Norwalk_Connecticut|Norwalk_Connecticut| . Davis asked Coryells husband, fusion guitarist  |Larry_Coryell|Larry_Coryell| , to participate in sessions with keyboardists  |Masabumi_Kikuchi|Masabumi_Kikuchi|  and George Pavlis, bassist  |T_M_Stevens|T_M_Stevens| , and drummer  |Al_Foster|Al_Foster| . Davis played the arranged piece uptempo, abandoned his trumpet for the organ, and had Macero record the session without the bands knowledge. After Coryell declined a spot in a band that Davis was beginning to put together, Davis returned to his reclusive lifestyle in New York City. Soon after, Marguerite Eskridge had Davis jailed for failing to pay child support to their son Erin, which cost him $10,000  for release on bail. A recording session that involved Buckmaster and Gil Evans was halted, with Evans leaving after failing to receive the payment he was promised. In August 1978, Davis hired a new manager, Mark Rothbaum, who had worked with him since 1972. Despite the dearth of new material, Davis placed in the Top 10 trumpeter poll of Down Beat magazine in 1979.        By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress  |Cicely_Tyson|Cicely_Tyson| , with whom he overcame his cocaine addiction and regained his enthusiasm for music. The two married on November 26, 1981, in a ceremony at  |Bill_Cosbys|Bill_Cosby|  home in Massachusetts that was officiated by politician and civil rights activist  |Andrew_Young|Andrew_Young| . Their tumultuous marriage ended with Tyson filing for divorce in 1988, which was finalized in 1989.     In October 1979, his contract with Columbia was up for negotiation. Label president Clive Davis was replaced by  |George_Butler|George_Butler| , who had visited Davis several times during the previous two years to encourage him to return to the studio. To help his situation, Davis had Buckmaster come over to collaborate on new music. After arriving, Buckmaster organized an  |intervention|Intervention|  for Davis, who was living in squalor among cockroach infestations, in the dark with his curtains always closed. His sister Dorothy cleaned his house with help from Buckmaster, Tyson, and neighbor  |Chaka_Khan|Chaka_Khan| . Davis later thanked Buckmaster for helping him.       Davis hadnt played the trumpet much for three years and found it difficult to reclaim his  |embouchure|Embouchure| . His first post-hiatus studio appearance took place on May 1, 1980. A day later, Davis was hospitalized due to a leg infection. He recorded  The Man with the Horn  from June 1980 to May 1981 with Macero producing. A large band was abandoned in favor of a combo with saxophonist  |Bill_Evans|Bill_Evans|   and bassist  |Marcus_Miller|Marcus_Miller| . Both would collaborate with him during the next decade.     The Man with the Horn received a poor critical reception despite selling well. In June 1981, Davis returned to the stage for the first time since 1975 in a ten-minute guest solo as part of  |Mel_Lewiss|Mel_Lewis|  band at the  |Village_Vanguard|Village_Vanguard| . This was followed by appearances with a new band, a four-night run at Kix in Boston, and two shows at Avery Fisher Hall on July 5 as part of the  |Kool_Jazz_Festival|Kool_Jazz_Festival| . Recordings from a mixture of dates from 1981, including the Kix and Avery Fisher Hall gigs, were released on  We Want Miles  , which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist.        In January 1982, while Tyson was working in Africa, Davis went a little wild with alcohol, and suffered a stroke that temporarily paralyzed his right hand. Tyson returned home and cared for him. After three months of treatment with a Chinese acupuncturist, he was able to play the trumpet again. He listened to his doctors warnings and gave up alcohol and drugs. He credited Tyson with helping his recovery, which involved exercise, piano playing, and visits to spas. She encouraged him to draw, which he pursued for the rest of his life.     Davis resumed touring in May 1982 with a line-up that included French percussionist  |Mino_Cinelu|Mino_Cinelu|  and guitarist  |John_Scofield|John_Scofield| , with whom he worked closely on the album  Star People  . In mid-1983, he worked on the tracks for  Decoy , an album mixing soul music and  |electronica|Electronica|  that was released in 1984. He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist  |Robert_Irving_III|Robert_Irving_Iii| , who had collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and  |Darryl_Jones|Darryl_Jones| , he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the  |Léonie_Sonning_Music_Prize|Léonie_Sonning_Music_Prize| . Trumpeter  |Palle_Mikkelborg|Palle_Mikkelborg|  had written a contemporary classical piece titled Aura for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album,  Aura  . Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.     In May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with  |Warner_Bros_|Warner_Bros_Records|  that required him to give up his publishing rights. Trumpeter  |Wynton_Marsalis|Wynton_Marsalis|  publicly dismissed his more recent fusion recordings as not being true jazz. Davis shrugged off the comment, calling Marsalis a nice young man, only confused. Marsalis appeared unannounced onstage during Davis performance at the inaugural  |Vancouver_International_Jazz_Festival|Vancouver_International_Jazz_Festival|  in 1986. Marsalis whispered into Davis ear that someone had told him to do so. Davis responded by ordering him off the stage. Davis had become increasingly irritated at Columbias delay in releasing Aura. The breaking point appears to have come when a producer at Columbia asked him to call Marsalis and wish him a happy birthday. The tour in 1985 included a performance in London in July in which Davis performed on stage for five hours. Jazz critic  |John_Fordham|John_Fordham|  concluded, The leader is clearly enjoying himself.  By 1985, Davis was diabetic and required daily injections of insulin.     He released  Youre Under Arrest , his final album for Columbia, in September 1985. It included cover versions of two pop songs:  |Time_After_Time|Time_After_Time|  by  |Cyndi_Lauper|Cyndi_Lauper|  and  |Human_Nature|Human_Nature|  sung by  |Michael_Jackson|Michael_Jackson| . He considered releasing an album of pop songs, and he recorded dozens of them, but the idea was rejected. He said that many of todays jazz standards had been pop songs in  |Broadway_theater|Broadway_Theater|  and that he was simply updating the standards repertoire.     Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British post-punk and new wave movements during this period, including  |Scritti_Politti|Scritti_Politti| .  At the invitation of producer  |Bill_Laswell|Bill_Laswell| , he recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd.s  Album , according to  |John_Lydon|John_Lydon|  in the liner notes of their  Plastic Box  box set. In Lydons words, however, Strangely enough, we didnt use According to Lydon in the Plastic Box notes, Davis favorably compared Lydons singing voice to his trumpet sound during these sessions.           After taking part in the recording of the 1985 protest song  |Sun_City|Sun_City|  as a member of  |Artists_United_Against_Apartheid|Artists_United_Against_Apartheid| , Davis appeared on the instrumental Dont Stop Me Now by  |Toto|Toto|  for their album  Fahrenheit  . For his next studio album, he intended to collaborate with  |Prince|Prince| , but the project was dropped. Davis also collaborated with  |Zane_Giles|Zane_Giles|  and  |Randy_Hall|Randy_Hall|  on the  Rubberband  sessions in 1985 but those would remain unreleased until 2019.  Instead, he worked with Marcus Miller and  Tutu  , became the first time he used modern studio tools such as programmed synthesizers,  |sampling|Sampling| , and drum loops. Released in September 1986, its front cover is a portrait of Davis by  |Irving_Penn|Irving_Penn| . In 1987, he won a Grammy Award for  |Best_Jazz_Instrumental_Performance_Soloist|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Improvised_Jazz_Solo| .     In 1988, Davis had a small part as a street musician in the Christmas comedy film  Scrooged  starring Bill Murray. He also collaborated with  |Zucchero_Fornaciari|Zucchero_Fornaciari|  in a version of Dune Mosse , published in 2004 in  Zu & Co.  of the Italian bluesman. In November 1988, he was inducted into the  |Knights_of_Malta|Knights_Of_Malta|  at a ceremony at the Alhambra Palace in Spain . Later that month, Davis cut his European tour short after he collapsed and fainted after a two-hour show in Madrid and flew home.  Rumors of his health were made public after the American magazine Star, in its February 21, 1989 edition, published that Davis had contracted AIDS, prompting his manager Peter Shukat to issue a statement the following day to deny the claim. Shukat revealed Davis had been in the hospital for a mild case of pneumonia and the removal of a benign polyp on his vocal cords and was resting comfortably in preparation for his 1989 tours.  Davis later blamed one of his former wives or girlfriends for starting the rumor and decided against taking legal action. He was interviewed on  60 Minutes  by Harry Reasoner. In October 1989, he received a Grande Medaille de Vermeil from Paris mayor  |Jacques_Chirac|Jacques_Chirac| . In 1990, he received a  |Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award|Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award| . In early 1991, he appeared in the  |Rolf_de_Heer|Rolf_De_Heer|  film  Dingo  as a jazz musician.        Davis followed Tutu with  Amandla  and soundtracks to four films:  Street Smart ,  Siesta ,  The Hot Spot , and  Dingo . His last albums were released posthumously: the hip hop-influenced  Doo-Bop  and  Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux  , a collaboration with Quincy Jones from the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival where, for the first time in three decades, he performed songs from Miles Ahead, Porgy and Bess, and Sketches of Spain.      On July 8, 1991, Davis returned to performing material from his past at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival with a band and orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones. The set consisted of arrangements from his albums recorded with Gil Evans. The show was followed by a concert billed as Miles and Friends at the  |Grande_halle_de_la_Villette|Grande_Halle_De_La_Villette|  in Paris two days later, with guest performances by musicians from throughout his career, including John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul. In Paris, he was awarded the  |Chevalier_of_the_Legion_of_Honor|Legion_Of_Honour| . After returning to America, he stopped in New York City to record material for Doo-Bop, then returned to California to play at the Hollywood Bowl on August 25, his final live performance.          In early September 1991, Davis checked into  |St_Johns_Hospital|Saint_Johns_Health_Center|  near his home in Santa Monica, California, for routine tests. Doctors suggested he have a  |tracheal_tube|Tracheal_Tube|  implanted to relieve his breathing after repeated bouts of  |bronchial_pneumonia|Bronchial_Pneumonia| . The suggestion provoked an outburst from Davis that led to an  |intracerebral_hemorrhage|Intracerebral_Hemorrhage|  followed by a coma. After several days on life support, his machine was turned off and he died on September 28, 1991. He was 65 years old. His death was attributed to the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. According to Troupe, Davis was taking  |azidothymidine|Zidovudine|  , a type of  |antiretroviral_drug|Antiretroviral_Drug|  used for the treatment of  |HIV|Hiv|  and  |AIDS|Aids| , during his treatments in hospital. A funeral service was held on October 5, 1991, at St. Peters Lutheran Church on  |Lexington_Avenue|Lexington_Avenue|  in New York City   that was attended by around 500 friends, family members, and musical acquaintances, with many fans standing in the rain. He was buried in  |Woodlawn_Cemetery|Woodlawn_Cemetery|  in  |The_Bronx|The_Bronx| , New York City, with one of his trumpets, near the site of  |Duke_Ellingtons|Duke_Ellington|  grave.       Late in his life, from the electric period onwards, Davis repeatedly explained his reasons for not wishing to perform his earlier works, such as  Birth of the Cool  or  Kind of Blue . In his view, remaining stylistically static was the wrong option. He commented: So What or Kind of Blue, they were done in that era, the right hour, the right day, and it happened. Its over  ... What I used to play with Bill Evans, all those different modes, and substitute chords, we had the energy then and we liked it. But I have no feel for it anymore, its more like warmed-over turkey.  When  |Shirley_Horn|Shirley_Horn|  insisted in 1990 that Miles reconsider playing the ballads and modal tunes of his Kind of Blue period, he demurred. Nah, it hurts my lip was the reason he gave.  |Bill_Evans|Bill_Evans| , who played piano on Kind of Blue, said, I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master, but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material.

The Guardian  described him as a pioneer of 20th-century music, leading many of the key developments in the world of jazz.  He has been called one of the great innovators in jazz ,  and had the titles Prince of Darkness and the Picasso of Jazz bestowed upon him. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said, Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music.      William Ruhlmann of  |AllMusic|Allmusic|  wrote, To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period  ... It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasnt there to push it forward.  Music writer Christopher Smith wrote,     Miles Davis artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary.  ... Miles performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.     His approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.           Kind of Blue remains the best-selling jazz album of all time.
