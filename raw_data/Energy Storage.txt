     Energy storage is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time.   A device that stores energy is generally called an  |accumulator|Accumulator|  or  |battery|Battery| .   Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation,  |chemical|Chemical_Energy| ,  |gravitational_potential|Gravitational_Potential_Energy| ,  |electrical_potential|Electric_Potential_Energy| , electricity, elevated temperature,  |latent_heat|Latent_Heat|  and  |kinetic|Kinetic_Energy| .   Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms.     Some technologies provide short-term energy storage, while others can endure for much longer.   Bulk energy storage is currently dominated by hydroelectric dams, both conventional as well as pumped.     Common examples of energy storage are the  |rechargeable_battery|Rechargeable_Battery| , which stores chemical energy readily convertible to electricity to operate a mobile phone, the  |hydroelectric|Hydroelectricity|  dam, which stores energy in a  |reservoir|Reservoir|  as gravitational  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy| , and  |ice_storage|Ice_Storage_Air_Conditioning|  tanks, which store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling.    |Fossil_fuels|Fossil_Fuel|  such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels.    |Food|Food|  is a form of energy stored in  |chemical|Chemical|  form.              In the twentieth century grid, electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel. When less power was required, less fuel was burned. Concerns with air pollution, energy imports, and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power.  Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed. Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours, while demand often peaks after sunset . Interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the  |renewable_energy_industry|Renewable_Energy_Industry|  begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption.       |Off_grid_electrical|Off-The-Grid|  use was a niche market in the twentieth century, but in the twenty-first century, it has expanded. Portable devices are in use all over the world. Solar panels are now a common sight in the rural settings worldwide.  Access to electricity is now a question of economics and financial viability, and not solely on technical aspects.  Powering transportation without burning fuel, however, remains in development.         The following list includes a variety of types of energy storage:       |Compressed_air_energy_storage|Compressed_Air_Energy_Storage| |Fireless_locomotive|Fireless_Locomotive| |Flywheel_energy_storage|Flywheel_Energy_Storage| |Gravitational_potential_energy|Gravitationalpotentialenergystoragewithsolidmasses| |Hydraulic_accumulator|Hydraulic_Accumulator| |Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity|Pumped-Storage_Hydroelectricity|    Electrical, electromagnetic    |Capacitor|Capacitor| |Supercapacitor|Supercapacitor| |Superconducting_magnetic_energy_storage|Superconducting_Magnetic_Energy_Storage|    Biological    |Glycogen|Glycogen| |Starch|Starch| |Flow_battery|Flow_Battery| |Rechargeable_battery|Rechargeable_Battery| |UltraBattery|Ultrabattery| |Brick_storage_heater|Storage_Heater| |Cryogenic_energy_storage|Cryogenic_Energy_Storage| , Liquid air energy storage    |Liquid_nitrogen_engine|Liquid_Nitrogen_Engine| |Eutectic_system|Eutectic_System| |Ice_storage_air_conditioning|Ice_Storage_Air_Conditioning| |Molten_salt_storage|Molten_Salt_Heat_Storage| |Phase-change_material|Phase-Change_Material| |Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage|Seasonal_Thermal_Energy_Storage| |Solar_pond|Solar_Pond| |Steam_accumulator|Steam_Accumulator| |Thermal_energy_storage|Thermal_Energy_Storage|    Chemical    |Biofuels|Biofuels| |Hydrated_salts|Hydrate| |Hydrogen_storage|Hydrogen_Storage| |Hydrogen_peroxide|Hydrogen_Peroxide| |Power_to_gas|Power_To_Gas| |Vanadium_pentoxide|Vanadium_Pentoxide|           Energy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using  |pumped_storage|Pumped_Storage|  methods or by moving solid matter to higher locations .   Other commercial mechanical methods include  |compressing_air|Compressed-Air_Energy_Storage|  and  |flywheels|Flywheel_Energy_Storage|  that convert electric energy into kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks.           |Hydroelectric_dams|Hydroelectric_Dam|  with reservoirs can be operated to provide electricity at times of peak demand.   Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high.   The net effect is similar to pumped storage, but without the pumping loss.     While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources.   In this mode, dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage, because only the timing of its generation changes.   Hydroelectric turbines have a start-up time on the order of a few minutes.                Worldwide,  |pumped-storage_hydroelectricity|Pumped-Storage_Hydroelectricity|  is the largest-capacity form of active  |grid_energy_storage|Grid_Energy_Storage|  available, and, as of March 2012, the  |Electric_Power_Research_Institute|Electric_Power_Research_Institute|  reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000  |MW|Megawatt| .   PSH  |energy_efficiency|Energy_Conversion_Efficiency|  varies in practice between 70% and 80%, with claims of up to 87%.     At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir.   When demand grows, water is released back into a lower reservoir through a  |turbine|Turbine| , generating electricity. Reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine .   Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies.   Pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs, while the pump-back approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional  |hydroelectric_plants|Hydroelectric_Plant|  that use natural stream-flow.               Compressed air energy storage uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation. Wild, Matthew, L. ,  The New York Times , July 28, 2010, pp. B1.   Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives.   The compressed air is stored in an  |underground_reservoir|Underground_Reservoir| , as a  |salt_dome|Salt_Dome| .     Compressed-air energy storage plants can bridge the gap between production volatility and load. CAES storage addresses the energy needs of consumers by effectively providing readily available energy to meet demand. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy have variable resources. As a result, the supplement of other forms of energy is necessary to meet energy demand during periods of decreased resource availability. Compressed-air energy storage plants are capable of taking in the surplus energy output of renewable energy sources during times of energy over-production. This stored energy can be used at a later time when demand for electricity increases or energy resource availability decreases.       |Compression|Gas_Compressor|  of  |air|Air|  creates heat; the air is warmer after compression.  |Expansion|Thermal_Expansion|  requires heat.   If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, efficiency improves considerably. A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways. Air storage can be  |adiabatic|Adiabatic| ,  |diabatic|Diabatic| , or  |isothermal|Isothermal| .   Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles.                  Flywheel energy storage works by accelerating a rotor  to a very high speed, holding energy as  |rotational_energy|Rotational_Energy| . When energy is extracted, the flywheels rotational speed declines as a consequence of  |conservation_of_energy|Conservation_Of_Energy| ; adding energy correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.     Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel, but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration.  , retrieved June 7, 2007.     FES systems have rotors made of high strength  |carbon-fiber|Carbon-Fiber|  composites, suspended by  |magnetic_bearings|Magnetic_Bearing|  and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000  rpm in a vacuum enclosure.    Such flywheels can reach maximum speed   in a matter of minutes. The flywheel system is connected to a combination  |electric_motor|Electric_Motor| / |generator|Electric_Generator| .     FES systems have relatively long lifetimes ,  high  |specific_energy|Specific_Energy|   and  |power_density|Power_Density| .       |California_Independent_System_Operator|California_Independent_System_Operator| .   It examined the movement of earth-filled  |hopper_rail_cars|Hopper_Car|  driven by  |electric_locomotives|Electric_Locomotive|  from lower to higher elevations.     Methods include using rails  and cranes  to move concrete weights up and down, using high-altitude solar-powered buoyant platforms supporting winches to raise and lower solid masses,  using winches supported by an ocean barge for taking advantage of a 4  km elevation difference between the surface and the seabed.  Efficiencies can be as high as 85% recovery of stored energy.               Thermal energy storage is the temporary storage or removal of heat.         Sensible heat storage take advantage of  |sensible_heat|Sensible_Heat|  in a material to store energy. Layered Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion, Editors: Dongsheng Geng, Yuan Cheng, Gang Zhang , Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2019,      |Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage|Seasonal_Thermal_Energy_Storage|  allows heat or cold to be used months after it was collected from waste energy or natural sources.   The material can be stored in contained aquifers, clusters of boreholes in geological substrates such as sand or crystalline bedrock, in lined pits filled with gravel and water, or water-filled mines.   Seasonal thermal energy storage projects often have paybacks in the four-to-six year range.   An example is  |Drake_Landing_Solar_Community|Drake_Landing_Solar_Community|  in Canada, for which 97% of the year-round heat is provided by solar-thermal collectors on the garage roofs, with a borehole thermal energy store being the enabling technology.  , Natural Resources Canada, October 5, 2012.   In Braestrup, Denmark,  |the_communitys_solar_district_heating_system|Solar_Power_In_Denmark|  also utilizes STES, at a storage temperature of .   A heat pump, which is run only when there is surplus wind power available on the national grid, is used to raise the temperature to  for distribution.   When surplus wind generated electricity is not available, a gas-fired boiler is used. Twenty percent of Braestrups heat is solar.      Latent heat thermal energy storage  |latent_heat|Latent_Heat|  capacity, known as  |phase_change_materials|Phase-Change_Material|  . The main advantage of these materials is that their latent heat storage capacity is much more than sensible heat. In a specific temperature range, phase changes from solid to liquid absorbs a large amount of thermal energy for later use.     Latent-heat thermal energy storage consists of a process by which, energy in the form of heat, is either absorbed or released during the phase-change of a  |phase_change_material|Phase-Change_Material|  . A PCM is a material with a high heat of fusion. A phase-change is the melting or solidifying of a material. During a phase change, a PCM has the capacity to absorb large amounts of energy due to its high heat of fusion.      A  |steam_accumulator|Steam_Accumulator|  is a type of LHTES system. In this case, the phase change is between liquid and gas and use is made of the  |latent_heat_of_vaporization|Latent_Heat_Of_Vaporization|  of water.                   A rechargeable battery, comprises one or more  |electrochemical_cells|Electrochemical_Cell| . It is known as a secondary cell because its  |electrochemical|Electrochemistry| |reactions|Chemical_Reaction|  are electrically reversible. Rechargeable batteries come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from  |button_cells|Button_Cellrechargeable_Variants|  to megawatt grid systems.     Rechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than non-rechargeable batteries. Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same form factors as disposables. Rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times.     Common rechargeable battery chemistries include:    |Lead–acid_battery|Lead–Acid_Battery| |lead_sulfate|Lead_Sulfate|  positive electrode are immersed in a dilute  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| |electrolyte|Electrolyte| . In the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water.     ::Lead-acid battery technology has been developed extensively. Upkeep requires minimal labor and its cost is low. The batterys available energy capacity is subject to a quick discharge resulting in a low life span and low energy density.       |Nickel–cadmium_battery|Nickel–Cadmium_Battery|  : Uses  |nickel_oxide_hydroxide|Nickel_Oxide_Hydroxide|  and metallic  |cadmium|Cadmium|  as  |electrodes|Electrode| . Cadmium is a toxic element, and was banned for most uses by the European Union in 2004. Nickel–cadmium batteries have been almost completely replaced by nickel–metal hydride batteries.    |Nickel–metal_hydride_battery|Nickel–Metal_Hydride_Battery|  : First commercial types were available in 1989. These are now a common consumer and industrial type. The battery has a hydrogen-absorbing  |alloy|Alloy|  for the negative  |electrode|Electrode|  instead of  |cadmium|Cadmium| .    |Lithium-ion_battery|Lithium-Ion_Battery| |energy-to-mass_ratios|Specific_Energy|  and a very slow  |self-discharge|Self-Discharge|  when not in use.    |Lithium-ion_polymer_battery|Lithium-Ion_Polymer_Battery|      A  |flow_battery|Flow_Battery|  operates by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to charge/discharge the cell.    |Cell_voltage|Electrode_Potentialpotential_Difference_Of_A_Cell_Assembled_Of_Two_Electrodes|  is chemically determined by the  |Nernst_equation|Nernst_Equation|  and ranges, in practical applications, from 1.0 to 2.2 V. Its storage capacity is a function of the volume of the tanks holding the solution.     A flow battery is technically akin both to a  |fuel_cell|Fuel_Cell|  and an  |electrochemical_accumulator_cell|Electrochemical_Cell| .   Commercial applications are for long half-cycle storage such as backup grid power.                |Supercapacitors|Supercapacitor| , also called electric double-layer capacitors or ultracapacitors, are generic terms for a family of  |electrochemical_capacitors|Electrochemical_Capacitor|  that do not have conventional solid  |dielectrics|Dielectric| .  |Capacitance|Capacitance|  is determined by two storage principles, double-layer capacitance and  |pseudocapacitance|Pseudocapacitance| .     Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and  |rechargeable_batteries|Rechargeable_Battery| .   They store the most energy per unit volume or mass  among capacitors. They support up to 10,000  |farads|Farads| /1.2 volt, up to 10,000 times that of  |electrolytic_capacitors|Electrolytic_Capacitor| , but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time .     While supercapacitors have specific energy and energy densities that are approximately 10% of batteries, their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater. This results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles. Additionally, they will tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than batteries.     Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications, including:   Low supply current for memory backup in  |static_random-access_memory|Static_Random-Access_Memory|    Power for cars, buses, trains, cranes and elevators, including energy recovery from braking, short-term energy storage and burst-mode power delivery                 |Power_to_gas|Power_To_Gas|  is a technology which converts  |electricity|Electricity|  into a gaseous  |fuel|Fuel|  such as  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  or  |methane|Methane| . The three commercial methods use electricity to reduce  |water|Water_Splitting|  into  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |oxygen|Oxygen|  by means of  |electrolysis|Electrolysis| .     In the first method, hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry. The second method is to combine the hydrogen with  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  to produce  |methane|Methane|  using a  |methanation|Methanation|  reaction such as the  |Sabatier_reaction|Sabatier_Reaction| , or biological methanation, resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8%. The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid. The third method uses the output gas of a  |wood_gas_generator|Wood_Gas_Generator|  or a  |biogas|Biogas|  plant, after the  |biogas_upgrader|Biogas_Upgrader|  is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer, to upgrade the quality of the biogas.        The element  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  can be a form of stored energy. Hydrogen can produce electricity via a  |hydrogen_fuel_cell|Hydrogen_Fuel_Cell| .     At penetrations below 20% of the grid demand, renewables do not severely change the economics; but beyond about 20% of the total demand, external storage becomes important. If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen, they can be freely expanded. A 5-year community-based pilot program using  |wind_turbines|Wind_Turbine|  and hydrogen generators began in 2007 in the remote community of  |Ramea,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador|Ramea,_Newfoundland_And_Labrador| . A similar project began in 2004 on  |Utsira|Utsira| , a small Norwegian island.     Energy losses involved in the  |hydrogen_storage|Hydrogen_Storage|  cycle come from the  |electrolysis_of_water|Electrolysis_Of_Water| , liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity.     About 50  kW·h of solar energy is required to produce a kilogram of hydrogen, so the cost of the electricity is crucial. At $0.03/kWh, a common off-peak high-voltage line rate in the  |United_States|United_States| , hydrogen costs $1.50 a kilogram for the electricity, equivalent to $1.50/gallon for  |gasoline|Gasoline| . Other costs include the  |electrolyzer_plant|High_Pressure_Electrolysis| ,  |hydrogen_compressors|Hydrogen_Compressor|  or  |liquefaction|Liquid_Hydrogen| , storage and  |transportation|Hydrogen_Infrastructure| .     Hydrogen can also be produced from  |aluminum|Aluminum|  and  |water|Water|  by stripping aluminums naturally-occurring  |aluminum_oxide|Aluminum_Oxide|  barrier and introducing it to water. This method is beneficial because recycled aluminum cans can be used as fuel to generate hydrogen, however systems to harness this option have not been commercially developed and are much more complex than electrolysis systems. Common methods to strip the oxide layer include caustic catalysts such as  |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  and alloys with  |gallium|Gallium| ,  |mercury|Mercury|  and other metals.      |Underground_hydrogen_storage|Underground_Hydrogen_Storage|  is the practice of  |hydrogen_storage|Hydrogen_Storage|  in  |cave|Cave| rns,  |salt_domes|Salt_Dome|  and depleted oil and gas fields. Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in caverns by  |Imperial_Chemical_Industries|Imperial_Chemical_Industries|  for many years without any difficulties. The European Hyunder project indicated in 2013 that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require 85 caverns.           |Methane|Methane|  is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula CH 4 . Methane is more easily stored and transported than hydrogen. Storage and combustion infrastructure  are mature.     Synthetic natural gas  can be created in a multi-step process, starting with hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is then reacted with  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  in a  |Sabatier_process|Sabatier_Reaction| , producing methane and water. Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity. The resulting water is recycled, reducing the need for water. In the electrolysis stage oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant, eliminating  |nitrogen_oxides|Nitrogen_Oxide| .     Methane combustion produces carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis. Methane production, storage and combustion recycles the reaction products.     The CO 2 has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector, not a cost as in  |carbon_capture_and_storage|Carbon_Capture_And_Storage| .       Power to liquid is similar to power to gas, however the hydrogen produced by electrolysis from wind and solar electricity isnt converted into gases such as methane but into liquids such as  |methanol|Methanol| . Methanol is easier to handle than gases, and requires fewer safety precautions than hydrogen. It can be used for  |transportation|Transportation| , including  |aircraft|Aircraft| , but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector. Alberto Varone, Michele Ferrari: Power to liquid and power to gas: An option for the German Energiewende.  |Renewable_and_Sustainable_Energy_Reviews|Renewable_And_Sustainable_Energy_Reviews|  45, , 207–218, .            Various  |biofuels|Biofuels|  such as  |biodiesel|Biodiesel| ,  |vegetable_oil|Straight_Vegetable_Oil| ,  |alcohol_fuels|Alcohol_Fuel| , or  |biomass|Biomass|  can replace  |fossil_fuels|Fossil_Fuels| . Various chemical processes can convert the carbon and hydrogen in coal, natural gas, plant and animal  |biomass|Biomass|  and organic wastes into short hydrocarbons suitable as replacements for existing hydrocarbon fuels. Examples are  |Fischer–Tropsch|Fischer–Tropsch_Process|  diesel,  |methanol|Methanol| ,  |dimethyl_ether|Dimethyl_Ether|  and  |syngas|Syngas| . This diesel source was used extensively in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in Germany, which faced limited access to crude oil supplies. South Africa produces most of the countrys diesel from coal for similar reasons. A long term oil price above US$35/bbl may make such large scale synthetic liquid fuels economical.      |Aluminum|Aluminum|  has been proposed as an energy storage method by a number of researchers. The volume  |electrochemical_equivalent|Electrochemical_Equivalent|  of aluminum is nearly a factor of four greater than lithium . Energy can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water to generate  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| . To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural  |oxide|Oxide|  layer, a process which requires pulverization, chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys. The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is  |aluminum_oxide|Aluminum_Oxide| , which can be recycled back into aluminum with the  |Hall–Héroult_process|Hall–Héroult_Process| , making the reaction theoretically renewable. If the Hall-Heroult Process is run using solar or wind power, aluminum could be used to store the energy produced at higher efficiency than direct solar electrolysis.          |Boron|Boron| ,  |silicon|Silicon| , and  |zinc|Zinc|  have been proposed as energy storage solutions.       The organic compound  norbornadiene   converts to  quadricyclane  upon exposure to light, storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds. A working system has been developed in Sweden as a molecular solar thermal system.                    A  |capacitor|Capacitor|  is a  |passive|Passivity| |two-terminal|Terminal| |electrical_component|Electronic_Component|  used to store  |energy|Energy| |electrostatic|Electrostatic| ally. Practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two  |electrical_conductors|Electrical_Conductor|  separated by a  |dielectric|Dielectric|  . A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit, so it can be used like a temporary  |battery|Battery| , or like other types of  |rechargeable_energy_storage_system|Rechargeable_Energy_Storage_System| . Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change. Conventional capacitors provide less than 360  |joules|Joule|  per kilogram, while a conventional  |alkaline_battery|Alkaline_Battery|  has a density of 590 kJ/kg.     Capacitors store  |energy|Energy|  in an  |electrostatic_field|Electric_Field|  between their plates. Given a  |potential_difference|Potential_Difference|  across the conductors , an  |electric_field|Electric_Field|  develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge to collect on one plate and negative charge to collect on the other plate. If a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time, no current can flow through the capacitor. However, if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a  |displacement_current|Displacement_Current|  can flow. Besides capacitor plates, charge can also be stored in a dielectric layer.      Capacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area. In practice, the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of  |leakage_current|Leakage|  and has an electric field strength limit, known as the  |breakdown_voltage|Breakdown_Voltage| . However, the effect of recovery of a dielectric after a high-voltage breakdown holds promise for a new generation of self-healing capacitors.   The conductors and  |leads|Lead|  introduce undesired  |inductance|Equivalent_Series_Inductance|  and  |resistance|Equivalent_Series_Resistance| .     Research is assessing the quantum effects of  |nanoscale|Nanoscopic_Scale|  capacitors  for digital quantum batteries.            Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems store energy in a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field|  created by the flow of  |direct_current|Direct_Current|  in a  |superconducting|Superconductivity|  coil that has been cooled to a temperature below its  |superconducting_critical_temperature|Superconductivitysuperconducting_Phase_Transition| . A typical SMES system includes a superconducting  |coil|Inductor| , power conditioning system and refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current does not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely.     The stored energy can be released to the network by discharging the coil. The associated inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of  |electricity|Electricity|  in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems offer round-trip efficiency greater than 95%.     Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the cost of  |superconducting_wire|Superconducting_Wire| , SMES is used for short duration storage such as improving  |power_quality|Power_Quality| . It also has applications in grid balancing.             The classic application before the  |industrial_revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  was the control of waterways to drive water mills for processing grain or powering machinery. Complex systems of  |reservoirs|Reservoir|  and  |dams|Dam|  were constructed to store and release water  when required.            Home energy storage is expected to become increasingly common given the growing importance of distributed generation of renewable energies and the important share of energy consumption in buildings. To exceed a self-sufficiency of 40%   in a household equipped with photovoltaics, energy storage is needed. Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy, generally to hold surplus energy from home solar/wind generation. Today, for home energy storage, Li-ion batteries are preferable to lead-acid ones given their similar cost but much better performance.       |Tesla_Motors|Tesla_Motors|  produces two models of the  |Tesla_Powerwall|Tesla_Powerwall| . One is a 10 kWh weekly cycle version for backup applications and the other is a 7 kWh version for daily cycle applications.  In 2016, a limited version of the Tesla Powerpack 2 cost $398/kWh to store electricity worth 12.5 cents/kWh making a positive  |return_on_investment|Tesla_Powerwallreturn_On_Investment_Calculations|  doubtful unless electricity prices are higher than 30 cents/kWh.      RoseWater Energy produces two models of the Energy & Storage System , the HUB 120  and SB20.  Both versions provide 28.8 kWh of output, enabling it to run larger houses or light commercial premises, and protecting custom installations. The system provides five key elements into one system, including providing a clean 60  Hz Sine wave, zero transfer time, industrial-grade surge protection, renewable energy grid sell-back , and battery backup.        |Enphase_Energy|Enphase_Energy|  announced an integrated system that allows home users to store, monitor and manage electricity. The system stores 1.2 kWh of energy and 275W/500W power output.      Storing wind or solar energy using  |thermal_energy_storage|Thermal_Energy_Storage|  though less flexible, is considerably less expensive than batteries. A simple 52-gallon electric water heater can store roughly 12 kWh of energy for supplementing hot water or space heating.      For purely financial purposes in areas where  |net_metering|Net_Metering|  is available, home generated electricity may be sold to the grid through a  |grid-tie_inverter|Grid-Tie_Inverter|  without the use of batteries for storage.                        The largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams. A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons. A very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years. While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources, it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind. If wind or solar generation exceeds the regions hydroelectric capacity, then some additional source of energy will be needed.     Many  |renewable_energy|Renewable_Energy|  sources produce  |variable_power|Variable_Renewable_Energy| . Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes. Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms.     The main method of electrical grid storage is  |pumped-storage_hydroelectricity|Pumped-Storage_Hydroelectricity| . Areas of the world such as Norway, Wales, Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for  |reservoirs|Reservoir| , using electrically powered pumps to fill them. When needed, the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity. Pumped storage in Norway, which gets almost all its electricity from hydro, has currently a capacity of 1.4 GW but since the total installed capacity is nearly 32 GW and 75% of that is regulable, it can be expanded significantly. .

Some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped-storage  |hydroelectric_dams|Hydroelectric_Dams| ,  |rechargeable_batteries|Rechargeable_Battery| ,  |thermal_storage|Thermal_Energy_Storage|  including  |molten_salts|Molten_Salt_Heat_Storage|  which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy, and  |compressed_air_energy_storage|Compressed_Air_Energy_Storage| ,  |flywheels|Flywheel_Energy_Storage| ,  |cryogenic_systems|Cryogenic_Energy_Storage|  and  |superconducting_magnetic_coils|Superconducting_Magnetic_Energy_Storage| .     Surplus power can also be converted into  |methane|Power_To_Gas|   with stockage in the natural gas network.     In 2011, the  |Bonneville_Power_Administration|Bonneville_Power_Administration|  in  |Northwestern_United_States|Northwestern_United_States|  created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds. Under central control, home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in  |special_space_heaters|Storage_Heater|  to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified  |hot_water_heater_tanks|Storage_Water_Heater| . After charging, the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed. The experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down, or in the case of a nuclear power plant, reduced to its lowest possible operating level, leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy.     Another advanced method used at the former  |Solar_Two_project|The_Solar_Project|  in the United States and the  |Solar_Tres_Power_Tower|Gemasolar_Thermosolar_Plant|  in Spain uses  |molten_salt|Thermal_Energy_Storagemolten_Salt_Technology|  to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power. The system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun. Insulated tanks store the solution. Electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to  |turbines|Turbine| .     Since the early 21st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load-leveling and  |frequency_regulation|Utility_Frequency|  capabilities.     In  |vehicle-to-grid|Vehicle-To-Grid|  storage, electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed.             |Thermal_energy_storage|Thermal_Energy_Storage|  can be used for  |air_conditioning|Air_Conditioning| . It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and/or groups of smaller buildings. Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads. In 2009, thermal storage was used in over 3,300 buildings in over 35 countries. It works by chilling material at night and using the chilled material for cooling during the hotter daytime periods.     The most popular technique is  |ice_storage|Thermal_Energy_Storageair_Conditioning| , which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chillers daytime output.     A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day. At night, they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water. Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water. Such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day. Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 - 50% of the size needed for a conventional, no-storage design. Storage sufficient to store half a days available heat is usually adequate.     A full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours. Capital costs are higher, as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system.     This ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower. Off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs. The U.S.  |Green_Building_Council|Green_Building_Council|  has developed the  |Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design|Leadership_In_Energy_And_Environmental_Design|  program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings. Off-peak cooling may help toward LEED Certification. Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, Fundamentals of HVAC/R, Page 1263     Thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling. An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night.     Latent heat can also be stored in technical  |phase_change_materials|Phase-Change_Material|  . These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels, to moderate room temperatures.       Liquid  |hydrocarbon_fuels|Hydrocarbon_Fuel|  are the most commonly used forms of energy storage for use in  |transportation|Transportation| , followed by a growing use of  |Battery_Electric_Vehicles|Battery_Electric_Vehicles|  and  |Hybrid_Electric_Vehicles|Hybrid_Electric_Vehicle| . Other energy carriers such as  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  can be used to avoid producing greenhouse gases.     Public transport systems like trams and trolleybuses require electricity, but due to their variability in movement, a steady supply of electricity via renewable energy is challenging.  |Photovoltaic|Photovoltaic|  systems installed on the roofs of buildings can be used to power public transportation systems during periods in which there is increased demand for electricity and access to other forms of energy are not readily available.        Capacitors are widely used in  |electronic_circuits|Electronic_Circuit|  for blocking  |direct_current|Direct_Current|  while allowing  |alternating_current|Alternating_Current|  to pass. In  |analog_filter|Analog_Filter|  networks, they smooth the output of  |power_supplies|Power_Supply| . In  |resonant_circuits|Lc_Circuit|  they tune  |radios|Radio|  to particular  |frequencies|Frequency| . In  |electric_power_transmission|Electric_Power_Transmission|  systems they stabilize voltage and power flow.            The  |United_States_Department_of_Energy_International_Energy_Storage_Database|United_States_Department_Of_Energy_International_Energy_Storage_Database|  , is a free-access database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the  |United_States_Department_of_Energy|United_States_Department_Of_Energy|  Office of Electricity and  |Sandia_National_Labs|Sandia_National_Labs| .       Storage capacity is the amount of energy extracted from a  |power_plant|Power_Plant|  energy storage system; usually measured in  |joules|Joule|  or  |kilowatt-hours|Kilowatt_Hour|  and their multiples, it may be given in number of hours of electricity production at power plant  |nameplate_capacity|Nameplate_Capacity| ; when storage is of primary type , output is sourced only with the power plant embedded storage system.             Moreover, ESS are affected by several risks, e.g.:      1.
