While some have criticized Bukharin for this apparent U-turn, his change of emphasis can be partially explained by the necessity for peace and stability following seven years of war in Russia, and the failure of communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, which ended the prospect of worldwide revolution.

Coehn, 1980      Bukharin was worried by the prospect of Stalins plan, which he feared would lead to “military-feudal exploitation” of the peasantry. Bukharin did want the Soviet Union to achieve industrialization but he preferred the more moderate approach of offering the peasants the opportunity to become prosperous, which would lead to greater grain production for sale abroad. Bukharin pressed his views throughout 1928 in meetings of the Politburo and at the Communist Party Congress, insisting that enforced grain requisition would be counterproductive, as War Communism had been a decade earlier. Paul R. Gregory, Politics, Murder, and Love in Stalins Kremlin: The Story of Nikolai Bukharin and Anna Larina ch 3-6       Bukharins support for the continuation of the NEP was not popular with higher Party cadres, and his slogan to peasants, Enrich yourselves! and proposal to achieve socialism at snails pace left him vulnerable to attacks first by Zinoviev and later by Stalin. Stalin attacked Bukharins views, portraying them as capitalist deviations and declaring that the revolution would be at risk without a strong policy that encouraged rapid industrialization.     Having helped Stalin achieve unchecked power against the Left Opposition, Bukharin found himself easily outmaneuvered by Stalin. Yet Bukharin played to Stalins strength by maintaining the appearance of unity within the Party leadership. Meanwhile, Stalin used his control of the Party machine to replace Bukharins supporters in the Rightist power base in Moscow, trade unions, and the Comintern.Bukharin attempted to gain support from earlier foes including Kamenev and Zinoviev who had fallen from power and held mid-level positions within the Communist party. The details of his meeting with Kamenev, to whom he confided that Stalin was Genghis Khan and changed policies to get rid of rivals, were leaked by the Trotskyist press and subjected him to accusations of factionalism. Eventually, Bukharin lost his position in the Comintern and the editorship of Pravda in April 1929 and he was expelled from the Politburo on 17 November of that year. Paul R. Gregory, Politics, Murder, and Love in Stalins Kremlin: The Story of Nikolai Bukharin and Anna Larina ch 17     Bukharin was forced to renounce his views under pressure.
