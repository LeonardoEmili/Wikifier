      Bessel functions, first defined by the mathematician  |Daniel_Bernoulli|Daniel_Bernoulli|  and then generalized by  |Friedrich_Bessel|Friedrich_Bessel| , are canonical solutions  of Bessels  |differential_equation|Differential_Equation|      : x2   + x   +   0     for an arbitrary  |complex_number|Complex_Number|  , the order of the Bessel function. Although  and  produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of .     The most important cases are when  is an  |integer|Integer|  or  |half_integer|Half_Integer| . Bessel functions for integer  are also known as cylinder functions or the  cylindrical harmonics  because they appear in the solution to  |Laplaces_equation|Laplaces_Equation|  in  |cylindrical_coordinates|Cylindrical_Coordinates| .  Spherical Bessel functions  with half-integer  are obtained when the  |Helmholtz_equation|Helmholtz_Equation|  is solved in  |spherical_coordinates|Spherical_Coordinates| .       Bessels equation arises when finding separable solutions to  |Laplaces_equation|Laplaces_Equation|  and the  |Helmholtz_equation|Helmholtz_Equation|  in cylindrical or  |spherical_coordinates|Spherical_Coordinates| . Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of  |wave_propagation|Wave_Propagation|  and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order ; in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders . For example:      |Electromagnetic_waves|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  in a cylindrical  |waveguide|Waveguide| |_inviscid|Inviscid_Flow|  rotational flows    |Heat_conduction|Conduction|  in a cylindrical object   Modes of vibration of a thin circular  |acoustic_membrane|Acoustic_Membrane|     Diffusion problems on a lattice   Solutions to the radial  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation|  for a free particle   Solving for patterns of acoustical radiation   Frequency-dependent friction in circular pipelines   Dynamics of floating bodies    |Angular_resolution|Angular_Resolution| |_DNA|Dna| |_Probability_density_function|Probability_Density_Function|  of product of two normally distributed random variables     Bessel functions also appear in other problems, such as signal processing .       Because this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two  |linearly_independent|Linearly_Independent|  solutions. Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient. Different variations are summarized in the table below and described in the following sections.     :     Bessel functions of the second kind and the spherical Bessel functions of the second kind are sometimes denoted by  and  respectively, rather than  and .       Bessel functions of the first kind: , are solutions of Bessels differential equation that are finite at the origin  for integer or positive   and diverge as  approaches zero for negative non-integer  . It is possible to define the function by its  |series_expansion|Taylor_Series|  around , which can be found by applying the  |Frobenius_method|Frobenius_Method|  to Bessels equation: Abramowitz and Stegun, .     : J      ,     where  is the  |gamma_function|Gamma_Function| , a shifted generalization of the  |factorial|Factorial|  function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an  |entire_function|Entire_Function|  if  is an integer, otherwise it is a  |multivalued_function|Multivalued_Function|  with singularity at zero. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to x , although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large .           For non-integer , the functions  and  are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order , the following relationship is valid : Abramowitz and Stegun, .     : J n Jn.     This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.       Another definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of , is possible using an integral representation:      : Jn             Another integral representation is:     : Jn     e       This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by one of Schläflis integrals, for  ref nameTemme / ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref /ref math /math  ref  /ref math /math  ref  /ref math /math  ref name mhtlab.uwaterloo.ca  /ref  math /math  math /math  ref  /ref math /math math /math  ref nameMathWorld  /ref  /math  Abramowitz and Stegun, . :     :     J  & e I      Y  & eI  -            and  are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessels equation.     : x2   + x   -   0.     Unlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument,  and  are  |exponentially_growing|Exponential_Growth|  and  |decaying|Exponential_Decay|  functions respectively. Like the ordinary Bessel function , the function  goes to zero at  for  ref  /ref  !--  Plot of six modified Bessel functions. In solid line , , and .
