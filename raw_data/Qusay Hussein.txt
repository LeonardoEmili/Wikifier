      Qusay Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti  was an Iraqi politician. He was the second son of former  |Iraq|Iraq| i President  |Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein| . He was appointed as his fathers  |heir_apparent|Family_Dictatorship|  in 2000.       Hussein was born in  |Baghdad|Baghdad|  in 1966 to  |Baathist|Baathism|  revolutionary  |Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein| , who was in prison at the time, and his wife and cousin,  |Sajida_Talfah|Sajida_Talfah| . Unlike other members of his family and the government, little is known about Hussein, politically or personally. He married Sahar Maher Abd al-Rashid; the daughter of  |Maher_Abd_al-Rashid|Maher_Abd_Al-Rashid| , a top ranking military official, and had three sons: Mustapha Qusay ; Yahya Qusay and Yaqub Qusay .       Hussein played a role in crushing the  |Shiite|Shiite|  uprising in the aftermath of the 1991  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War|  and is also thought to have masterminded the destruction of the southern  |marsh|Marsh| es of Iraq. The wholesale destruction of these marshes ended a centuries-old way of life that prevailed among the Shiite  |Marsh_Arabs|Marsh_Arabs|  who made the wetlands their home, and ruined the habitat for dozens of species of  |migratory_birds|Migratory_Birds| . The Iraqi government stated that the action was intended to produce usable farmland, though a number of outsiders believe the destruction was aimed against the Marsh Arabs as retribution for their participation in the 1991 uprising.     Husseins older brother  |Uday|Uday_Hussein|  was viewed as  |their_fathers|Saddam_Hussein|  heir-apparent until he sustained serious injuries in a 1996 assassination attempt. Unlike Uday, who was known for extravagance and erratic, violent behavior, Qusay kept a low profile so details regarding his actions and roles are obscure.     Iraqi dissidents claim that Hussein was responsible for the killing of many political activists.  The Sunday Times  reported that Hussein ordered the killing of Khalis Mohsen al-Tikriti, an engineer at the military industrialization organization, because he believed Mohsen was planning to leave Iraq. In 1998, Iraqi opposition groups accused Hussein of ordering the execution of thousands of political prisoners after hundreds of inmates were similarly executed to make room for new prisoners in crowded jails.     Husseins service in the  |Iraqi_Republican_Guard|Iraqi_Republican_Guard|  began in 2000. It is believed that he became the supervisor of the Guard and the head of internal security forces , and had authority over other Iraqi military units.                 On the afternoon of 22 July 2003, troops of the 101st Airborne 3/327th Infantry HQ and C-Company, aided by U.S. Special Forces, killed Hussein, his 14-year-old son Mustapha, and his older brother Uday, during a  |raid|2003_Mosul_Raid|  on a house in the northern Iraqi city of  |Mosul|Mosul| .  Acting on a tip from Husseins cousin, a special forces team attempted to apprehend everyone in the house at the time. After being fired on, the special forces moved back and called for backup. After Task Force 121 members were wounded, the 3/327th Infantry surrounded and fired on the house with a  |TOW_missile|Tow_Missile| ,  |Mark_19_Automatic_Grenade_Launcher|Mk_19_Grenade_Launcher| ,  |M2_50_Caliber_Machine_guns|M2_Browning|  and small arms. After about four hours of battle , the soldiers entered the house and found four dead, including the two brothers and their bodyguard. There were reports that Husseins 14-year-old son Mustapha was the fourth body found.  |Brigadier_general|Brigadier_General| |Frank_Helmick|Frank_Helmick| , the assistant commander of 101st Airborne, commented that all occupants of the house died during the gun battle before U.S. troops were able to enter.      On 23 July 2003, the American command stated that it had conclusively identified two of the dead men as  |Saddam_Husseins|Saddam_Hussein|  sons from dental records. Because many Iraqis were skeptical of news of the deaths, the U.S. Government released photos of the corpses and allowed Iraqs governing council to identify the bodies despite the U.S. objection to the publication of American corpses on Arab television. Afterwards, their bodies were reconstructed by morticians. For example, Qusays beard was shaved and gashes from the battle were removed.  They also announced that the informant, possibly the owner of the house, would receive the combined $30 million reward on the pair.  Hussein was the  |ace|Ace|  of clubs in the coalition forces  |most-wanted_Iraqi_playing_cards|Most-Wanted_Iraqi_Playing_Cards| . His father was the ace of spades and his brother was the ace of hearts.     Husseins other two sons, Yahya Qusay and Yaqub Qusay, are presumed alive, but their whereabouts are unknown.
