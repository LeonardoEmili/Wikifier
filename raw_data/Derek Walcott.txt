Walcott was born and raised in  |Castries|Castries| ,  |Saint_Lucia|Saint_Lucia| , in the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| , the son of Alix and Warwick Walcott.  He had a twin brother, the playwright  |Roderick_Walcott|Roderick_Walcott| , and a sister, Pamela Walcott. His family is of English, Dutch and African descent, reflecting the complex colonial history of the island that he explores in his poetry. His mother, a teacher, loved the arts and often recited poetry around the house.  |Edward_Hirsch|Edward_Hirsch| , ,  The Paris Review , Issue 101, Winter 1986. His father was a  |civil_servant|Civil_Servant|  and a talented painter. He died when Walcott and his brother were one year old, and were left to be raised by their mother. Walcott was brought up in Methodist schools. His mother, who was a teacher at a Methodist elementary school, provided her children with an environment where their talents could be nurtured. Puchner, Martin. The Norton Anthology of World Literature. 4th ed., f, W.W. Norton & Company, 2013. Walcotts family was part of a minority Methodist community, who felt overshadowed by the dominant Catholic culture of the island established during French colonial rule.      As a young man Walcott trained as a painter, mentored by Harold Simmons,  whose life as a professional artist provided an inspiring example for him. Walcott greatly admired  |Cézanne|Cézanne|  and  |Giorgione|Giorgione|  and sought to learn from them. Walcotts painting was later exhibited at the  |Anita_Shapolsky_Gallery|Anita_Shapolsky_Gallery|  in New York City, along with the art of other writers, in a 2007 exhibition named The Writers Brush: Paintings and Drawing by Writers .       He studied as a writer, becoming an elated, exuberant poet madly in love with English and strongly influenced by modernist poets such as  |T._S._Eliot|T._S._Eliot|  and  |Ezra_Pound|Ezra_Pound| . Walcott had an early sense of a vocation as a writer. In the poem Midsummer , he wrote:       Forty years gone, in my island childhood, I felt that   the gift of poetry had made me one of the chosen,   that all experience was kindling to the fire of the Muse.     At 14, Walcott published his first poem, a  |Miltonic|John_Milton| , religious poem, in the newspaper The Voice of St Lucia. An English Catholic priest condemned the Methodist-inspired poem as blasphemous in a response printed in the newspaper. By 19, Walcott had self-published his first two collections with the aid of his mother, who paid for the printing: 25 Poems and Epitaph for the Young: XII Cantos . He sold copies to his friends and covered the costs. , Academy of American Poets. He later commented:     I went to my mother and said, I’d like to publish a book of poems, and I think its going to cost me two hundred dollars. She was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher, and I remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it. Somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary. She gave it to me, and I sent off to  |Trinidad|Trinidad|  and had the book printed. When the books came back I would sell them to friends. I made the money back.     The influential Bajan poet  |Frank_Collymore|Frank_Collymore|  critically supported Walcotts early work.     After getting his high school education from St. Marys College, he received a scholarship to study at the  |University_College_of_the_West_Indies|University_College_Of_The_West_Indies|  in  |Kingston,_Jamaica|Kingston,_Jamaica| .           After graduation, Walcott moved to Trinidad in 1953, where he became a critic, teacher and journalist. He founded the  |Trinidad_Theatre_Workshop|Trinidad_Theatre_Workshop|  in 1959 and remained active with its board of directors.      Exploring the Caribbean and its history in a colonialist and post-colonialist context, his collection In a Green Night: Poems 1948–1960 attracted international attention. His play  Dream on Monkey Mountain  was produced on NBC-TV in the United States the year it was published. In 1971 it was produced by the  |Negro_Ensemble_Company|Negro_Ensemble_Company|  off-Broadway in New York City; it won an  |Obie_Award|Obie_Award|  that year for Best Foreign Play . , InfoPlease The following year, Walcott won an  |OBE|Obe|  from the British government for his work.      He was hired as a teacher by  |Boston_University|Boston_University|  in the United States, where he founded the  |Boston_Playwrights_Theatre|Boston_Playwrights_Theatre|  in 1981. That year he also received a  |MacArthur_Foundation_Fellowship|Macarthur_Foundation_Fellowship|  in the United States. Walcott taught literature and writing at Boston University for more than two decades, publishing new books of poetry and plays on a regular basis. Walcott retired from his position at Boston University in 2007. He became friends with other poets, including the Russian expatriate  |Joseph_Brodsky|Joseph_Brodsky| , who lived and worked in the U.S. after being exiled in the 1970s, and the Irishman  |Seamus_Heaney|Seamus_Heaney| , who also taught in Boston.     His epic poem  Omeros  , which loosely echoes and refers to characters from the  Iliad , has been critically praised as Walcotts major achievement. The book received praise from publications such as  The Washington Post  and  The New York Times Book Review , which chose Omeros as one of its Best Books of 1990 .      Walcott was awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  in 1992, the second Caribbean writer to receive the honour after  |Saint-John_Perse|Saint-John_Perse| , who was born in  |Guadeloupe|Guadeloupe| , received the award in 1960. The Nobel committee described Walcotts work as a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment . He won an  |Anisfield-Wolf_Book_Award|Anisfield-Wolf_Book_Award|  for Lifetime Achievement in 2004.     His later poetry collections include Tiepolos Hound , illustrated with copies of his watercolors; , essay, Academy of American Poets, 18 February 2005. The Prodigal , and White Egrets , which received the T.S. Eliot Prize and the 2011  |OCM_Bocas_Prize_for_Caribbean_Literature|Ocm_Bocas_Prize_For_Caribbean_Literature| .      In 2009, Walcott began a three-year distinguished scholar-in-residence position at the  |University_of_Alberta|University_Of_Alberta| . In 2010, he became Professor of Poetry at the  |University_of_Essex|University_Of_Essex| .      As a part of St Lucias Independence Day celebrations, in February 2016, he became one of the first knights of the  |Order_of_Saint_Lucia|Order_Of_Saint_Lucia| .        In 1982 a Harvard sophomore accused Walcott of sexual harassment in September 1981. She alleged that after she refused a sexual advance from him, she was given the only C in the class. In 1996 a student at Boston University sued Walcott for sexual harassment and offensive sexual physical contact . The two reached a settlement.       In 2009, Walcott was a leading candidate for the position of  |Oxford_Professor_of_Poetry|Oxford_Professor_Of_Poetry| . He withdrew his candidacy after reports of the accusations against him of sexual harassment from 1981 and 1996.      When the media learned that pages from an American book on the topic were sent anonymously to a number of Oxford academics, this aroused their interest in the university decisions.        |Ruth_Padel|Ruth_Padel| , also a leading candidate, was elected to the post. Within days,  The Daily Telegraph  reported that she had alerted journalists to the harassment cases.   Under severe media and academic pressure, Padel resigned.  Padel was the first woman to be elected to the Oxford post, and some journalists attributed the criticism of her to misogyny Libby Purves, , The Times, 18 May 2009.  and a gender war at Oxford. They said that a male poet would not have been so criticized, as she had reported published information, not rumour.       Numerous respected poets, including  |Seamus_Heaney|Seamus_Heaney|  and  |Al_Alvarez|Al_Alvarez| , published a letter of support for Walcott in  The Times Literary Supplement , and criticized the press furore.  |Al_Alvarez|Al_Alvarez| ,  |Alan_Brownjohn|Alan_Brownjohn| , Carmen Bugan,  |David_Constantine|David_Constantine| ,  |Elizabeth_Cook|Elizabeth_Cook| ,  |Robert_Conquest|Robert_Conquest| ,  |Jonty_Driver|Jonty_Driver| ,  |Seamus_Heaney|Seamus_Heaney| ,  |Jenny_Joseph|Jenny_Joseph| ,  |Grevel_Lindop|Grevel_Lindop| ,  |Patrick_McGuinness|Patrick_Mcguinness| ,  |Lucy_Newlyn|Lucy_Newlyn| ,  |Bernard_ODonoghue|Bernard_Odonoghue| ,  |Michael_Schmidt|Michael_Schmidt| ,  |Jon_Stallworthy|Jon_Stallworthy| ,  |Michael_Suarez|Michael_Suarez| ,  |Don_Thomas|D._M._Thomas| ,  |Anthony_Thwaite|Anthony_Thwaite| , Oxford Professor of Poetry, The Times Literary Supplement, 3 June 2009, p. 6. Other commentators suggested that both poets were casualties of the media interest in an internal university affair, because the story had everything, from sex claims to allegations of character assassination . , ENotes.  |Simon_Armitage|Simon_Armitage|  and other poets expressed regret at Padels resignation.                    |Methodism|Methodism|  and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in Walcotts work. He commented, I have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer. I have grown up believing it is a  |vocation|Vocation| , a religious vocation. Describing his writing process, he wrote, the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the I not being important. That is the ecstasy...Ultimately, its what  |Yeats|Yeats|  says: Such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed. That’s always there. It’s a benediction, a transference. It’s gratitude, really. The more of that a poet keeps, the more genuine his nature. He also notes, if one thinks a poem is coming on...you do make a retreat, a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you. What you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity.       Walcott said his writing was influenced by the work of the American poets,  |Robert_Lowell|Robert_Lowell|  and  |Elizabeth_Bishop|Elizabeth_Bishop| , who were also friends.       He published more than twenty plays, the majority of which have been produced by the  |Trinidad_Theatre_Workshop|Trinidad_Theatre_Workshop|  and have also been widely staged elsewhere. Many of them address, either directly or indirectly, the liminal status of the West Indies in the post-colonial period.  Through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy.        In his 1970 essay What the Twilight Says: An Overture , discussing art and theatre in his native region , Walcott reflects on the West Indies as colonized space. He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly  |indigenous|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another . The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as Ti-Jean and his Brothers. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information, but to truly know nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.      Walcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture:     What we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a  |Defoe|Daniel_Defoe| , a  |Dickens|Dickens| , a  |Richardson|Henry_Handel_Richardson| .     Walcott identified as absolutely a Caribbean writer , a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage. In such poems as The Castaway and in the play  Pantomime  , he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and  |Crusoe|Robinson_Crusoe|  to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes: If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature. While we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non-existent past, then time passes us by.     Omeros   Walcotts epic book-length poem  Omeros  was published in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references  |Homer|Homer|  and some of his major characters from  The Iliad . Some of the poems major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas , and the author himself.      Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from  |Brookline,_Massachusetts|Brookline,_Massachusetts|  , and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including  |Lisbon|Lisbon| , London,  |Dublin|Dublin| , Rome, and Toronto.      Composed in a variation on  terza rima , the work explores the themes that run throughout Walcotts oeuvre: the beauty of the islands, the colonial burden, the fragmentation of Caribbean identity, and the role of the poet in a post-colonial world. Patrick Bixby, , essay: Spring 2000,  |Emory_University|Emory_University| . Retrieved 30 March 2012.       Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992, two years after publishing the epic poem Omeros. He was known for writing about the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds. His poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the English language and his sense of his own people. Grimes, William. Derek Walcott, Poet and Nobel Laureate of the Caribbean, Dies at 87. The New York Times, The New York Times, 17 March 2017, www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/books/derek-walcott-dead-nobel-prize-literature.html.     Stephen Breslow explained that he and the Swedish Academy chose Derek Walcott for the Nobel Laureate in Literature because his work had a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality, through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication. It was Walcotts ability to be more than just exotic that brought his work critical attention. Breslow explains that Walcott has merged a profound, rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace – its people, its landscape, and its history – with the central, classical tradition of Western civilization. This ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the Swedish Academy. Walcotts works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works. Breslow, Stephen.      In his Nobel acceptance speech, Walcott describes life on Antilles and what it means to discover identity. He describes all of the broken fragments of his diasporic identity. People need books, he says, but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is. Walcott says that the visible poetry of the Antilles, then. Survival because all of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory; every mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog. He encompasses the diasporic identity found in Caribbean Literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot, alone, fully bring together a cultural identity. . Nobel Foundation. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web.       Walcotts work has received praise from major poets including  |Robert_Graves|Robert_Graves| , who wrote that Walcott handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most, if not any, of his contemporaries , Robert D. Hamner, , Critical Perspectives on Derek Walcott , Lynne Rienner, 1997, p. 1. and  |Joseph_Brodsky|Joseph_Brodsky| , who praised Walcotts work, writing: For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves, coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper. He gives us more than himself or a world; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language.  Walcott noted that he, Brodsky, and the Irish poet  |Seamus_Heaney|Seamus_Heaney| , who all taught in the United States, were a band of poets outside the American experience .     The poetry critic  |William_Logan|William_Logan|  critiqued Walcotts work in a New York Times book review of Walcotts Selected Poems. While he praised Walcotts writing in Sea Grapes and The Arkansas Testament, Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcotts poetry, calling Omeros clumsy and Another Life pretentious. He concluded with No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered.      Most reviews of Walcotts work are more positive. For instance, in  The New Yorker  review of The Poetry of Derek Walcott,  |Adam_Kirsch|Adam_Kirsch|  had high praise for Walcotts oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:     By combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott’s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of  Alice in Wonderland  world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.      Kirsch calls Another Life Walcotts first major peak and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcotts imagery from his earliest work through to later books like Tiepolos Hound. He also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcotts work, calling him the postcolonial writer par excellence . Kirsch calls the early poem A Far Cry from Africa a turning point in Walcotts development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of Omeros, which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although Omeros is the volume of Walcotts that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes Midsummer to be his best book.     His poetry, as spoken performance, appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group  |Dreadzone|Dreadzone| . Their track entitled Captain Dread from the album  Second Light  incorporates the fourth verse of Walcotts 1990 poem The Schooner Flight .     In 2013 Dutch filmmaker Ida Does released Poetry is an Island, a feature documentary film about Walcotts life and the ever-present influence of his birthplace of  |St_Lucia|St_Lucia| .         In 1954 Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1959. They had a son, the St Lucian painter Peter Walcott. Walcott married a second time to Margaret Maillard in 1962, who worked as an  |almoner|Almoner|  in a hospital, and together they had two daughters, Elizabeth Walcott-Hackshaw and Anna Walcott-Hardy, before divorcing in 1976. , Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 18 March 2017. In 1976, Walcott married for a third time, to actress Norline Metivier; they divorced in 1993. His companion until his death was Sigrid Nama, a former art gallery owner.        Walcott was also known for his passion for travelling to countries around the world. He split his time between New York, Boston, and St. Lucia, and incorporated the influences of different areas into his pieces of work.          Walcott died at his home in Cap Estate, St. Lucia, on 17 March 2017.  He was 87. He was given a state funeral on Saturday, 25 March, with a service at the  |Cathedral_Basilica_of_the_Immaculate_Conception_in_Castries|Cathedral_Basilica_Of_The_Immaculate_Conception_In_Castries|  and burial at  |Morne_Fortune|Morne_Fortune| . ,  Jamaica Observer , 25 March 2017. , St. Lucia Times, 27 March 2017.
