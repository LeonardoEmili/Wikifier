He also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways .

The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.     Greenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned .     Greenberg used the premise that mass borrowing of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters in certain semantic areas , making it easy to detect . With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.     Greenberg first termed his method mass comparison in an article of 1954 . As of 1987, he replaced the term mass comparison with multilateral comparison , to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step . According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification .     Most historical linguists reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages.

They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.     However, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenbergs Amerind classification: the “First American” category. “The cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.” Nevertheless, this category of “First American” people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dené populations, with 60% and 90% First American DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups.
