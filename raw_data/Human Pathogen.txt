A human pathogen is a  |pathogen|Pathogen|   that causes  |disease|Disease|  in  |humans|Human| .     The human physiological defense against common pathogens  is mainly the responsibility of the  |immune_system|Immune_System|  with help by some of the bodys normal  |flora_and_fauna|Human_Microbiome| . However, if the immune system or good microbiota are damaged in any way , pathogenic  |bacteria|Bacteria|  that were being held at bay can proliferate and cause harm to the host. Such cases are called  |opportunistic_infections|Opportunistic_Infection| .     Some pathogens  have been responsible for massive numbers of casualties and have had numerous effects on afflicted groups. Of particular note in modern times is HIV, which is known to have infected several million humans globally, along with the  |influenza|Influenza|  virus. Today, while many medical advances have been made to safeguard against infection by pathogens, through the use of  |vaccination|Vaccination| ,  |antibiotics|Antibiotics| , and  |fungicide|Fungicide| , pathogens continue to threaten human life. Social advances such as  |food_safety|Food_Safety| ,  |hygiene|Hygiene| , and  |water_treatment|Water_Treatment|  have reduced the threat from some pathogens.              Pathogenic viruses are mainly those of the families of:  Adenoviridae , Picornaviridae , Herpesviridae , Hepadnaviridae , Flaviviridae , Retroviridae , Orthomyxoviridae , Paramyxoviridae , Papovaviridae , Polyomavirus , Rhabdoviridae , and  Togaviridae . Some notable pathogenic viruses cause smallpox, influenza,  |mumps|Mumps| ,  |measles|Measles| ,  |chickenpox|Chickenpox| ,  |ebola|Ebola| , and rubella. Viruses typically range between 20 and 300 nanometers in length.             Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial to ones body, a few pathogenic bacteria can cause  |infectious_diseases|Infectious_Disease| . The most common bacterial disease is  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis| , caused by the bacterium  Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which affects about 2 million people mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as  |pneumonia|Pneumonia| , which can be caused by bacteria such as  Streptococcus  and  Pseudomonas , and  |foodborne_illness|Foodborne_Illness| es, which can be caused by bacteria such as  Shigella ,  Campylobacter , and  Salmonella . Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as  |tetanus|Tetanus| ,  |typhoid_fever|Typhoid_Fever| ,  |diphtheria|Diphtheria| ,  |syphilis|Syphilis| , and  |Hansens_disease|Hansens_Disease| . They typically range between 1 and 5 micrometers in length.          Fungi comprise a eukaryotic kingdom of microbes that are usually  |saprophytes|Saprophyte| , but can cause diseases in humans. Life-threatening fungal infections in humans most often occur in immunocompromised patients or vulnerable people with a weakened immune system, although fungi are common problems in the immunocompetent population as the causative agents of skin, nail, or yeast infections. Most antibiotics that function on bacterial pathogens cannot be used to treat fungal infections because fungi and their hosts both have eukaryotic cells. Most clinical fungicides belong to the  |azole_group|Azole| . The typical fungal spore size is 1-40 micrometers in length.          Some eukaryotic organisms, such as  |protists|Protists|  and  |helminths|Helminths| , cause disease. One of the best known diseases caused by protists in the genus  Plasmodium  is  |malaria|Malaria| . These can range from 3-200 micrometers in length.          Prions are infectious pathogens that do not contain  |nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid| . Prions are abnormal proteins whose presence causes some diseases such as  |scrapie|Scrapie| ,  |bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy|Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy|  , and  |Creutzfeldt–Jakob_disease|Creutzfeldt–Jakob_Disease| .  STANLEY B. PRUSINER, Scientific American The discovery of prion as a new class of pathogen allowed  |Stanley_B._Prusiner|Stanley_B._Prusiner|  to receive the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  in 1997.       Animal pathogens are disease-causing agents of wild and domestic animal species, at times including humans. Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions - Page 510 Daniel Simberloff, Marcel Rejmánek - 2011 Pathogens, animal Graham J. Hickling University of Tennessee, Knoxville Animal pathogens are disease-causing agents of wild and domestic animal species, at times including humans. In the context of invasion biology, the term usually ..        |Virulence|Virulence|  evolves when that pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite that host being very debilitated. An example is the malaria parasite, which can spread from a person near death, by hitching a ride to a healthy person on a mosquito that has bitten the diseased person. This is called  |horizontal_transmission|Horizontal_Transmission|  in contrast to  |vertical_transmission|Vertical_Transmission| , which tends to evolve symbiosis by linking the pathogens evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism.      |Evolutionary_medicine|Evolutionary_Medicine|  has found that under horizontal transmission,  |the_host_population_might_never_develop_tolerance_to_the_pathogen|Optimal_Virulence| .          Transmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the fecal-oral route. One of the primary pathways by which food or water become contaminated is from the release of untreated sewage into a  |drinking_water|Drinking_Water|  supply or onto cropland, with the result that people who eat or drink contaminated sources become infected. In  |developing_countries|Developing_Countries| , most sewage is discharged into the environment or on cropland; even in  |developed_countries|Developed_Countries| , periodic system failures result in  |sanitary_sewer_overflows|Sanitary_Sewer_Overflow| .        Bacillus anthracis    the causative agent of  |anthrax|Anthrax|  in humans and animals    Clostridium botulinum    releases the most powerful  |neurotoxin|Neurotoxin|  leading to death from  |botulism|Botulism|   Mycobacterium tuberculosis    the causative agent of most cases of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis|   Mycobacterium leprae    the bacterium that causes  |leprosy|Leprosy|     Yersinia pestis     |pneumonic|Pneumonic_Plague| ,  |septicemic|Septicemic_Plague| , and the notorious  |bubonic|Bubonic_Plague|  plagues     Rickettsia prowazekii    the etiologic agent of  |typhus_fever|Epidemic_Typhus|   Bartonella  spp.    |Spanish_influenza|Spanish_Influenza|  virus    |Entamoeba_histolytica|Entamoeba_Histolytica| .
