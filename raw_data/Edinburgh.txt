            Edinburgh  is the  |capital|Capital_City|  of  |Scotland|Scotland|  and one of its 32  |council_areas|Council_Areas_Of_Scotland| . Historically part of the county of  |Midlothian|Midlothian|  ,  it is located in  |Lothian|Lothian|  on the  |Firth_of_Forths|Firth_Of_Forth|  southern shore.     Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the  |Scottish_Government|Scottish_Government| , the  |Scottish_Parliament|Scottish_Parliament|  and the  |supreme_courts_of_Scotland|Courts_Of_Scotland| . The citys  |Palace_of_Holyroodhouse|Holyrood_Palace|  is the  |official_residence|Official_Residence|  of the  |monarch|Monarchy_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine,  |Scots_law|Scots_Law| , literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. It is the second largest financial centre in the United Kingdom  and the citys historical and cultural attractions have made it the United Kingdoms second most popular tourist destination attracting 1.75 million visits from overseas in 2016.      Edinburgh is Scotlands  |second_most_populous_city|List_Of_Towns_And_Cities_In_Scotland_By_Population|  and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The official population estimates are 488,050 for the  |Locality|List_Of_Towns_And_Cities_In_Scotland_By_Populationlocalities|  of Edinburgh ,  518,500 for the City of Edinburgh, and 1,339,380 for the  |city_region|City_Region| .   Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region comprising  |East_Lothian|East_Lothian| , Edinburgh,  |Fife|Fife| , Midlothian,  |Scottish_Borders|Scottish_Borders|  and  |West_Lothian|West_Lothian| .      The city is the annual venue of the  |General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland|General_Assembly_Of_The_Church_Of_Scotland| . It is home to national institutions such as the  |National_Museum_of_Scotland|National_Museum_Of_Scotland| , the  |National_Library_of_Scotland|National_Library_Of_Scotland|  and the  |Scottish_National_Gallery|Scottish_National_Gallery| . The  |University_of_Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh| , founded in 1582 and now one of four in the city, is placed 20th in the  |QS_World_University_Rankings|Qs_World_University_Rankings|  for 2020. The city is also famous for the  |Edinburgh_International_Festival|Edinburgh_International_Festival|  and the  |Fringe|Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe| , the latter being the worlds largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include  |Edinburgh_Castle|Edinburgh_Castle| , the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of  |St._Giles|St_Giles_Cathedral| ,  |Greyfriars|Greyfriars_Kirk|  and the  |Canongate|Canongate_Kirk| , and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburghs  |Old_Town|Old_Town,_Edinburgh|  and  |New_Town|New_Town,_Edinburgh|  together are listed as a  |UNESCO|Unesco| |World_Heritage_site|World_Heritage_Site| ,  which has been managed by  |Edinburgh_World_Heritage|Edinburgh_World_Heritage|  since 1999.          Edin , the root of the citys name, derives from  Eidyn , the name for this region in  |Cumbric|Cumbric| , the  |Brittonic|Brittonic_Languages| |Celtic|Celtic_Languages|  language formerly spoken there. The names meaning is unknown.  The district of Eidyn centred on the stronghold Din Eidyn, the  |dun|Dun|  or  |hillfort|Hillfort|  of Eidyn. This stronghold is believed to have been located at  |Castle_Rock|Castle_Rock,_Edinburgh| , now the site of  |Edinburgh_Castle|Edinburgh_Castle| . Eidyn was conquered by the  |Angles|Angles|  of  |Bernicia|Bernicia|  in the 7th century and later by the Scots in the 10th century.  As the language shifted to  |Old_English|Old_English| , and subsequently to modern English and  |Scots|Scots_Language| , the Brittonic din in Din Eidyn was replaced by  burh , producing Edinburgh. Similarly, din became dùn in  |Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish_Gaelic| , producing Dùn Èideann.             The city is affectionately nicknamed Auld Reekie,   Scots for Old Smoky, for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town.   A remark on a poem in an 1800 collection of the poems of  |Allan_Ramsay|Allan_Ramsay|  said, Auld Reeky. A name the country people give Edinburgh from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it.       |Thomas_Carlyle|Thomas_Carlyle|  said, Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh,—for, ever since  |Aeneas_Silviuss|Pope_Pius_Ii|  time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called Auld Reekie by the country people.      A character in  |Walter_Scotts|Walter_Scott|   The Abbot  says ... yonder stands Auld Reekie—you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles distance.       |Robert_Chambers|Robert_Chambers|  who said that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  attributed the name to a  |Fife|Fife|  laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. Its time now bairns, to tak the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonders Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!      Some have called Edinburgh the Athens of the North for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the  |Castle_Rock|Castle_Rock|  of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the  |Athenian|Athens| |Acropolis|Acropolis,_Athens| . Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a  |port|Port|  several miles away . Although this arrangement is common in  |Southern_Europe|Southern_Europe| , it is rare in  |Northern_Europe|Northern_Europe| . The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the  |Scottish_Enlightenment|Scottish_Enlightenment| , was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as  |David_Hume|David_Hume|  and  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith|  shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the  |Union|Treaty_Of_Union_1707| , some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later  |neoclassical|Neoclassicism|  architecture, particularly that of  |William_Henry_Playfair|William_Henry_Playfair| , and the  |National_Monument|National_Monument,_Edinburgh| .  |Tom_Stoppards|Tom_Stoppard|  character Archie, of  Jumpers , said, perhaps playing on  |Reykjavík|Reykjavík|  meaning smoky bay , that the Reykjavík of the South would be more appropriate.      The city has also been known by several Latin names, such as Aneda or Edina. The adjectival form of the latter, Edinensis, can often be seen inscribed on educational buildings.       The Scots poets  |Robert_Fergusson|Robert_Fergusson|  and  |Robert_Burns|Robert_Burns|  used the citys Latin name, Edina, in their poems.  |Ben_Jonson|Ben_Jonson|  described it as Britaines other eye ,  . Retrieved 17 April 2007. and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as yon Empress of the North .  . Retrieved 17 April 2007. Robert Louis Stevenson, also a son of the city, wrote, Edinburgh is what Paris ought to be .     The colloquial pronunciation Embra or Embro has also been used,  as in  |Robert_Gariochs|Robert_Garioch|  Embro to the Ploy.                    The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at  |Cramond|Cramond| , where evidence was found of a  |Mesolithic|Mesolithic|  camp site dated to c. 8500 BC.  Traces of later  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  and  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  settlements have been found on Castle Rock,  |Arthurs_Seat|Arthurs_Seat| ,  |Craiglockhart_Hill|Craiglockhart_Hill|  and the  |Pentland_Hills|Pentland_Hills| .      When the  |Romans|Roman_Empire|  arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a  |Brittonic|Celtic_Britons|  Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the  |Votadini|Votadini| .  The Votadini transitioned into the  |Gododdin|Gododdin|  kingdom in the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| , with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdoms districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdoms major centre.  The medieval poem  Y Gododdin  describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.        In 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to  |King_Oswald|Oswald_Of_Northumbria|  of  |Northumbria|Northumbria| , and around this time control of Lothian passed to the  |Angles|Angles| . Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of  |Indulf|Indulf| , son of  |Constantine_II|Constantine_Ii_Of_Scotland| , the burh , named in the 10th-century  Pictish Chronicle  as oppidum Eden,  was abandoned to the Scots. It thenceforth remained under their jurisdiction.      The  |royal_burgh|Royal_Burgh|  was founded by King David I in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, though the date of its charter is unknown.  The first documentary evidence of the medieval  |burgh|Burgh|  is a  |royal_charter|Royal_Charter| , , by  |King_David_I|David_I_Of_Scotland|  granting a  |toft|Burgage|  in  to the  |Priory_of_Dunfermline|Dunfermline_Abbey| .  By the middle of the 14th century, the French chronicler  |Jean_Froissart|Jean_Froissart|  was describing it as the capital of Scotland , and  |James_III|James_Iii_Of_Scotland|  referred to it in the 15th century as the principal burgh of our kingdom .  Despite the destruction caused by an  |English_assault|Burning_Of_Edinburgh|  in 1544, the town slowly recovered,  and was at the centre of events in the 16th-century  |Scottish_Reformation|Scottish_Reformation|   and 17th-century  |Wars_of_the_Covenant|Covenanter| .           In 1603, King  |James_VI|James_Vi_And_I|  of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England in a  |personal_union|Personal_Union|  known as the  |Union_of_the_Crowns|Union_Of_The_Crowns| , though Scotland remained, in all other respects, a separate kingdom.  In 1638,  |King_Charles_Is|Charles_I_Of_England|  attempt to introduce  |Anglican|Anglican_Communion|  church forms in Scotland encountered stiff  |Presbyterian|Presbyterianism|  opposition culminating in the conflicts of the  |Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms|Wars_Of_The_Three_Kingdoms| .  Subsequent Scottish support for  |Charles_Stuarts|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburghs occupation by  |Oliver_Cromwells|Oliver_Cromwell| |Commonwealth_of_England|Commonwealth_Of_England|  forces – the  |New_Model_Army|New_Model_Army|  – in 1650.      In the 17th century, Edinburghs boundaries were still defined by the citys defensive  |town_walls|Edinburgh_Town_Walls| . As a result, the citys growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common,  and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper.   Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantly  |Victorian|Victorian_Era|  buildings seen in todays Old Town.         Following the  |Treaty_of_Union|Treaty_Of_Union|  in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed  |Acts_of_Union|Acts_Of_Union_1707|  in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the  |Kingdom_of_Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain|  effective from 1 May 1707.  As a consequence, the  |Parliament_of_Scotland|Parliament_Of_Scotland|  merged with the  |Parliament_of_England|Parliament_Of_England|  to form the  |Parliament_of_Great_Britain|Parliament_Of_Great_Britain| , which sat at  |Westminster|Palace_Of_Westminster|  in London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.      By the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europes most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns.   Visitors were struck by the fact that the various social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same  |tenement|Tenement|  buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.           During the  |Jacobite_rising_of_1745|Jacobite_Rising_Of_1745| , Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite Highland Army before its march into England.  After its eventual defeat at  |Culloden|Battle_Of_Culloden| , there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebellious  |clans|Scottish_Clan| .  In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle,  reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to the  |Hanoverian|House_Of_Hanover|  monarch  |George_III|George_Iii_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  by its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example,  |Rose|Tudor_Rose|  Street and  |Thistle|Thistleorigin_As_A_Symbol_Of_Scotland|  Street; and for the royal family,  |George_Street|George_Street,_Edinburgh| ,  |Queen_Street|Queen_Street,_Edinburgh| , Hanover Street, Frederick Street and  |Princes_Street|Princes_Street|  .      In the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of the  |Scottish_Enlightenment|Scottish_Enlightenment| ,  when thinkers like  |David_Hume|David_Hume| ,  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| ,  |James_Hutton|James_Hutton|  and  |Joseph_Black|Joseph_Black|  were familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname Athens of the North because of its many  |neo-classical|Classical_Architecture|  buildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens.  In the 18th-century novel  The Expedition of Humphry Clinker  by  |Tobias_Smollett|Tobias_Smollett|  one character describes Edinburgh as a hotbed of genius .  Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London bookseller  |Andrew_Millar|Andrew_Millar|  was apprenticed there to James McEuen.      From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant one-family residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the citys social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented.                 Although Edinburghs traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continued to grow in the 19th century, and were joined by new  |rubber_works|Hunter_Boot_Ltd|  and  |engineering_works|Engineering| , there was little industrialisation compared with other cities in Britain. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  as Scotlands largest city.  The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates.  Improvements carried out under Lord Provost  |William_Chambers|William_Chambers|  in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly  |Victorian|Victorian_Architecture|  Old Town seen today.  More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of  |Patrick_Geddes|Patrick_Geddes| ,  but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major  |slum_clearance|Slum_Clearance|  in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the  |George_Square|George_Square,_Edinburgh|  and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.       Since the 1990s a new financial district , including the  |Edinburgh_International_Conference_Centre|Edinburgh_International_Conference_Centre| , has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into  |Fountainbridge|Fountainbridge| , a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdoms second largest financial and administrative centre after London.   Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city.  The development of  |Edinburgh_Park|Edinburgh_Park| , a new business and technology park covering ,  west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Councils strategy for the citys major economic regeneration.     In 1998, the  |Scotland_Act|Scotland_Act_1998| , which came into force the following year, established a  |devolved|Devolution|  Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive . Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while  |reserved_matters|Reserved_And_Excepted_Matters|  such as defence, taxation and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the  |Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in London.            Situated in Scotlands  |Central_Belt|Central_Belt| , Edinburgh lies on the Firth of Forths southern shore. The city centre is  southwest of the shoreline of  |Leith|Leith|  and  inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  at  |Dunbar|Dunbar| .  While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on  |seven_hills|Hills_In_Edinburgh| , namely Calton Hill,  |Corstorphine_Hill|Corstorphine_Hill| , Craiglockhart Hill,  |Braid_Hill|Braid_Hills| ,  |Blackford_Hill|Blackford_Hill| , Arthurs Seat and the Castle Rock,  giving rise to allusions to the  |seven_hills_of_Rome|Seven_Hills_Of_Rome| .      Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the  |Pentland_Hills|Pentland_Hills|  and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.     Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with  |faulting|Fault| , led to the creation of tough  |basalt|Basalt| |volcanic_plugs|Volcanic_Plug| , which predominate over much of the area.  One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing ice sheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a  tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive  |crag_and_tail|Crag_And_Tail|  formation.  Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained  |Nor_Loch|Nor_Loch| . These features, along with another hollow on the rocks south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built.  Similarly, Arthurs Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the  |Carboniferous_period|Carboniferous_Period| , which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age.  Erosive action such as  |plucking|Plucking|  and  |abrasion|Abrasion|  exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east.  This process formed the distinctive  |Salisbury_Crags|Salisbury_Crags| , a series of  |teschenite|Theraliteteschenites|  cliffs between Arthurs Seat and the location of the early burgh.  The residential areas of  |Marchmont|Marchmont|  and  |Bruntsfield|Bruntsfield|  are built along a series of  |drumlin|Drumlin|  ridges south of the city centre, which were  |deposited|Glacial_Deposition|  as the glacier receded.      Other prominent landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are also products of glacial erosion.  The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the citys south-west that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Firth of Forth.       Edinburgh is drained by the river named the  |Water_of_Leith|Water_Of_Leith| , which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for  through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith.  The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at  |Dean_Village|Dean_Village|  on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by  |Thomas_Telfords|Thomas_Telford| |Dean_Bridge|Dean_Bridge| , built in 1832 for the road to  |Queensferry|South_Queensferry| . The  |Water_of_Leith_Walkway|Water_Of_Leith_Walkway|  is a mixed-use  |trail|Trail|  that follows the course of the river for  from Balerno to Leith.           Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a  |green_belt|Green_Belt| , designated in 1957, which stretches from  |Dalmeny|Dalmeny|  in the west to  |Prestongrange|Prestongrange|  in the east.  With an average width of  the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as  |Edinburgh_Airport|Edinburgh_Airport|  and the  |Royal_Highland_Showground|Royal_Highland_Showground|  at  |Ingliston|Ingliston|  lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as  |Juniper_Green|Juniper_Green|  and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include  |Holyrood_Park|Holyrood_Park|  and Corstorphine Hill.            Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Many areas, such as  |Dalry|Dalry,_Edinburgh|  contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as  |tenements|Tenement| , although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been more affluent with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.       The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of  |Princes_Street_Gardens|Princes_Street_Gardens| . To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.     The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.     Edinburghs Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO  |World_Heritage_Site|World_Heritage_Site|  in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500  |listed_buildings|Listed_Building|  within the city, a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.     The  |Royal_Mile|Royal_Mile|  runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets  lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.  The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles Cathedral, the  |City_Chambers|Edinburgh_City_Chambers|  and the  |Law_Courts|Parliament_House,_Edinburgh| . Other places of historical interest nearby are  |Greyfriars_Kirkyard|Greyfriars_Kirkyard|  and the  |Grassmarket|Grassmarket| . The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities.     The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest high rise residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as lands were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.  Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly  |Irish_immigrants|Irish_Migration_To_Great_Britain| , during the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| .     The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a New Town was won by  |James_Craig|James_Craig| , a 27-year-old architect.  The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be  |George_Street|George_Street,_Edinburgh| , running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the Old Town . To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburghs main shopping street and now has few of its  |Georgian|Georgian_Architecture|  buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by  |St_Andrew_Square|St_Andrew_Square,_Edinburgh|  and  |Charlotte_Square|Charlotte_Square|  respectively. The latter, designed by  |Robert_Adam|Robert_Adam| , influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.   |Bute_House|Bute_House| , the official residence of the  |First_Minister_of_Scotland|First_Minister_Of_Scotland| , is on the north side of Charlotte Square.      The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the  |Nor_Loch|Nor_Loch| , which was created for the towns defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their  |sewage|Sewage| . It was drained by the 1820s as part of the citys northward expansion. Craigs original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch, but this idea was abandoned.  Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the  |loch|Loch|  to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as  |The_Mound|The_Mound| .     In the middle of the 19th century the  |National_Gallery_of_Scotland|National_Gallery_Of_Scotland|  and  |Royal_Scottish_Academy_Building|Royal_Scottish_Academy_Building|  were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between  |Haymarket|Haymarket_Railway_Station|  and  |Waverley|Edinburgh_Waverley_Railway_Station|  stations were driven through it.     The Southside is a popular residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards,  |Marchmont|Marchmont| ,  |Morningside|Morningside,_Edinburgh| ,  |Newington|Newington,_Edinburgh| ,  |Sciennes|Sciennes| ,  |the_Grange|The_Grange,_Edinburgh|  and  |Blackford|Blackford,_Edinburgh| . The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the  |Burgh_Muir|Burgh_Muir| , and grew in popularity as a residential area after the opening of the  |South_Bridge|South_Bridge,_Edinburgh|  in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families , young professionals and students , and  |Napier_University|Napier_University|  . The area is also well provided with hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example,  |Church_Hill|Church_Hill,_Edinburgh|  in Morningside, was the home of  |Muriel_Sparks|Muriel_Spark|  Miss Jean Brodie,  and  |Ian_Rankins|Ian_Rankin| |Inspector_Rebus|Inspector_Rebus|  lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.        |Leith|Leith|  was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.  The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.  Even today the parliamentary seat is known as Edinburgh North and Leith . The loss of traditional industries and commerce  resulted in economic decline.  The Edinburgh Waterfront development has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities and helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.     The coastal suburb of  |Portobello|Portobello,_Edinburgh|  is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a popular beach and  |promenade|Promenade|  and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops.
