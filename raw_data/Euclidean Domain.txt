In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , more specifically in  |ring_theory|Ring_Theory| , a Euclidean domain  is an  |integral_domain|Integral_Domain|  that can be endowed with a  |Euclidean_function|Definition|  which allows a suitable generalization of the  |Euclidean_division|Euclidean_Division|  of the integers. This generalized Euclidean algorithm can be put to many of the same uses as Euclids original algorithm in the ring of  |integers|Integer| : in any Euclidean domain, one can apply the Euclidean algorithm to compute the  |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor|  of any two elements. In particular, the greatest common divisor of any two elements exists and can be written as a linear combination   of them . Also every  |ideal|Ideal|  in a Euclidean domain is  |principal|Principal_Ideal| , which implies a suitable generalization of the  |fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic|Fundamental_Theorem_Of_Arithmetic| |unique_factorization_domain|Unique_Factorization_Domain| .     It is important to compare the class of Euclidean domains with the larger class of  |principal_ideal_domains|Principal_Ideal_Domain|  . An arbitrary PID has much the same structural properties of a Euclidean domain , but when an explicit  |algorithm|Algorithm|  for Euclidean division is known, one may use  |Euclidean_algorithm|Euclidean_Algorithm|  and  |extended_Euclidean_algorithm|Extended_Euclidean_Algorithm|  to compute  |greatest_common_divisors|Greatest_Common_Divisor|  and  |Bézouts_identity|Bézouts_Identity| . In particular, the existence of efficient algorithms for Euclidean division of integers and of polynomials in one variable over a field is of basic importance in  |computer_algebra|Computer_Algebra| .     So, given an integral domain , it is often very useful to know that  has a Euclidean function: in particular, this implies that  is a PID. However, if there is no obvious Euclidean function, then determining whether  is a PID is generally a much easier problem than determining whether it is a Euclidean domain.     Euclidean domains appear in the following chain of  |class_inclusions|Subclass|           Let  be an integral domain. A Euclidean function on  is a function  from  to the  |non-negative_integers|Non-Negative_Integer|  satisfying the following fundamental division-with-remainder property:     If  and  are in  and  is nonzero, then there exists  and  in  such that  and either  or  .
