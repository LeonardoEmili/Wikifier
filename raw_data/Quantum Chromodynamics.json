Chiral symmetries involve independent transformations of these two types of particle.   Vector symmetries mean the same transformation is applied on the two chiralities.   Axial symmetries are those in which one transformation is applied on left-handed particles and the inverse on the right-handed particles.       As mentioned, asymptotic freedom means that at large energy – this corresponds also to short distances – there is practically no interaction between the particles. This is in contrast – more precisely one would say  dual – to what one is used to, since usually one connects the absence of interactions with large  distances. However, as already mentioned in the original paper of Franz Wegner, F. Wegner, Duality in Generalized Ising Models and Phase Transitions without Local Order Parameter, J. Math. Phys. 12 2259–2272.     : Reprinted in ": null

Abstract:   a solid state theorist who introduced 1971 simple gauge invariant lattice models, the high-temperature behaviour of the original model, e.g. the strong decay of correlations at large distances, corresponds to the low-temperature behaviour of the dual model, namely the asymptotic decay of non-trivial correlations, e.g. short-range deviations from almost perfect arrangements, for short distances. Here, in contrast to Wegner, we have only the dual model, which is that one described in this article. Perhaps one can guess that in the original model mainly the quarks would fluctuate, whereas in the present one, the dual model, mainly the gluons do.       The color group SU corresponds to the local symmetry whose gauging gives rise to QCD. The electric charge labels a representation of the local symmetry group U which is gauged to give ": null
