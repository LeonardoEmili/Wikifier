             Maria Feodorovna , known before her marriage as Princess Dagmar of Denmark, was a  |Danish|Danes|  princess and  |Empress_of_Russia|Imperial_Consorts_Of_Russia|  as spouse of  |Emperor_Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Russia|  . She was the second daughter and fourth child of  |King_Christian_IX_of_Denmark|Christian_Ix_Of_Denmark|  and  |Louise_of_Hesse-Kassel|Louise_Of_Hesse-Kassel| ; her siblings included Queen  |Alexandra|Alexandra_Of_Denmark|  of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , King  |Frederick_VIII_of_Denmark|Frederick_Viii_Of_Denmark|  and King  |George_I_of_Greece|George_I_Of_Greece| . Her eldest son became the last Russian monarch,  |Emperor_Nicholas_II_of_Russia|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia| . She lived for ten years after he and his family were killed.          Princess Marie Sophie Frederikke Dagmar was born at the  |Yellow_Palace|Yellow_Palace,_Copenhagen|  in  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen| . Her father was Prince  |Christian_of_Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|Christian_Ix_Of_Denmark| , a member of a relatively impoverished princely  |cadet_line|Cadet_Branch| . Her mother was Princess  |Louise_of_Hesse-Kassel|Louise_Of_Hesse-Kassel| .     She was baptised as a  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  and named after her kinswoman  |Marie_Sophie_of_Hesse-Kassel|Marie_Sophie_Of_Hesse-Kassel| ,  |Queen|Queen_Consort| |Dowager|Dowager|  of  |Denmark|Denmark|  as well as the  |medieval|Medieval|  Danish queen,  |Dagmar_of_Bohemia|Dagmar_Of_Bohemia| . Her godmother was  |Queen_Caroline_Amalie_of_Denmark|Caroline_Amalie_Of_Augustenburg| . Growing up, she was known by the name Dagmar. Most of her life, she was known as Maria Feodorovna, the name which she took when she converted to  |Orthodoxy|Russian_Orthodox_Church|  immediately before her 1866 marriage to the future Emperor  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Russia| . She was known within her family as Minnie .     In 1852 Dagmars father became heir-presumptive to the throne of  |Denmark|Denmark| , largely due to the succession rights of his wife Louise as niece of  |King_Christian_VIII|Christian_Viii_Of_Denmark| . In 1853, he was given the title Prince of Denmark and he and his family were given an official summer residence,  |Bernstorff_Palace|Bernstorff_Palace| . Dagmars father became King of Denmark in 1863 upon the death of  |King_Frederick_VII|Frederick_Vii_Of_Denmark| .     Due to the brilliant marital alliances of his children, he became known as the Father-in-law of  |Europe|Europe| . Dagmars eldest brother would succeed his father as  |King_Frederick_VIII_of_Denmark|Frederick_Viii_Of_Denmark|  . Her elder, and favourite, sister,  |Alexandra|Alexandra_Of_Denmark|  married  |Albert_Edward,_the_Prince_of_Wales|Edward_Vii|  in March 1863. Alexandra, along with being queen consort of King Edward VII, was also mother of  |George_V|George_V|  of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , which helps to explain the striking resemblance between their sons Nicholas II and George V. Within months of Alexandras marriage, Dagmars second older brother, Wilhelm, was elected as  |King_George_I_of_the_Hellenes|King_George_I_Of_Greece| . Her younger sister was  |Thyra,_Duchess_of_Cumberland|Thyra_Of_Denmark| . She also had another younger brother,  |Valdemar|Prince_Valdemar_Of_Denmark| .     During her upbringing, Dagmar, together with her sister Alexandra, was given swimming lessons by the  |Swedish|Sweden|  pioneer of swimming for women,  |Nancy_Edberg|Nancy_Edberg| ;  she would later welcome Edberg to  |Russia|Russia| , where she came on royal  |scholarship|Scholarship|  to hold swimming lessons for women.       The rise of  |Slavophile|Slavophile|  ideology in the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  led  |Alexander_II_of_Russia|Alexander_Ii_Of_Russia|  to search for a bride for the heir apparent,  |Tsarevich_Nicholas_Alexandrovich|Grand_Duke_Nicholas_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia| , in countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided consorts for the tsars. In 1864, Nicholas, or Nixa as he was known in his family, went to Denmark where he was betrothed to Dagmar. On 22 April 1865 he died from  |meningitis|Meningitis| . His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Russia| . Dagmar was distraught after her young fiancés death. She was so heartbroken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her health. She had already become emotionally attached to Russia and often thought of the huge, remote country that was to have been her home. The disaster had brought her very close to Nixas parents, and she received a letter from Alexander II in which the Emperor attempted to console her. He told Dagmar in very affectionate terms that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family.  In June 1866, while on a visit to Copenhagen, the Tsarevich Alexander asked Dagmar for her hand. They had been in her room looking over photographs together.      Dagmar left Copenhagen on 1 September 1866.  |Hans_Christian_Andersen|Hans_Christian_Andersen| , who had occasionally been invited to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay in order to see her off. The writer remarked in his diary, Yesterday, at the quay, while passing me by, she stopped and took me by the hand. My eyes were full of tears. What a poor child! Oh Lord, be kind and merciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsars family is nice; still, she heads for an unfamiliar country, where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side.     Dagmar was warmly welcomed in  |Kronstadt|Kronstadt|  by  |Grand_Duke_Constantine_Nikolaevich_of_Russia|Grand_Duke_Konstantin_Nikolayevich_Of_Russia|  and escorted to St. Petersburg, where she was greeted by her future mother-in-law and sister-in-law on 24 September. On the 29th, she made her formal entry in to the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold and traveled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she was introduced to the Russian public on a balcony. Catherine Radziwill described the occasion: ”rarely has a foreign princess been greeted with such enthusiasm… from the moment she set foot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself all hearts. Her smile, the delightful way she had of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity” Hall, Coryne, Little Mother of Russia: A Biography of Empress Marie Feodorovna,      She converted to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia. The lavish wedding took place on  in the Imperial Chapel of the  |Winter_Palace|Winter_Palace|  in  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| . Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederick. Her brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending.  After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine... How I felt then, I do not wish to describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time.  After the many wedding parties were over the newlyweds moved into the  |Anichkov_Palace|Anichkov_Palace|  in Saint Petersburg where they were to live for the next 15 years, when they were not taking extended holidays at their summer villa  |Livadia|Livadia_Palace|  in the  |Crimean_Peninsula|Crimean_Peninsula| .         Maria Feodorovna was beautiful and well received by her Russian peers. Early on she made it a priority to learn the  |Russian_language|Russian_Language|  and to try to understand the  |Russian_people|Russian_People| . She rarely interfered with politics, preferring to devote her time and energies to her family, charities, and the more social side of her position. She had also seen the student protests of Kiev and St. Petersburg in the 1860s, and when police were beating students, the students cheered on Feodorovna, to which she replied They were quite loyal, they cheered me. Why do you allow the police to treat them so brutally?  Her one exception to official politics was her militant  |anti-German_sentiment|Anti-German_Sentiment|  due to the annexation of  |Danish_territories|Province_Of_Schleswig-Holstein|  by  |Prussia|Prussia|  in 1864, a sentiment also expressed by her sister, Alexandra. Prince Gorchakov remarked about this policy: “it is our belief, that Germany will not forget that both in Russia and in England a Danish Princess has her foot on the steps of the throne.” Maria Feodorovna suffered a miscarriage in 1866 in Denmark while horseback riding.        On 18 May 1868, Maria Feodorovna gave birth to her eldest son,  |Nicholas|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia| . Her next son, Alexander Alexandrovich, born in 1869, died from  |meningitis|Meningitis|  in infancy. She would bear Alexander four more children who reached adulthood:  |George|Grand_Duke_George_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  ,  |Xenia|Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_Of_Russia|  ,  |Michael|Grand_Duke_Michael_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  , and  |Olga|Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_Of_Russia|  . As a mother, she doted on and was quite possessive of her sons. She had a more distant relationship with her daughters.     In 1873, Maria, Alexander, and their two eldest sons made a journey to the United Kingdom. The imperial couple and their children were entertained at  |Marlborough_House|Marlborough_House|  by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The royal sisters Maria and Alexandra delighted London society by dressing alike at social gatherings.  The following year, Maria and Alexander welcomed the Prince and Princess of Wales to St. Petersburg; they had come for the wedding of the Princes younger brother,  |Alfred|Prince_Alfred,_Duke_Of_Edinburgh| , to  |Grand_Duchess_Maria_Alexandrovna|Grand_Duchess_Maria_Alexandrovna_Of_Russia| , daughter of Tsar Alexander II and the sister of the tsarevich.             On the morning of 13 March 1881, her father-in-law  |Alexander_II_of_Russia|Alexander_Ii_Of_Russia| , aged 62, was killed by a bomb on the way back to the Winter Palace from a military parade. In her diary, Maria later described how the wounded, still living Emperor was taken to the palace: His legs were crushed terribly and ripped open to the knee; a bleeding mass, with half a boot on the right foot, and only the sole of the foot remaining on the left.  Alexander II died a few hours later. Although the people were not enamoured of the new emperor, they adored Russias new empress. As Marias contemporaries said of her: She is truly an empress. She was not altogether pleased with her new status. In her diary she wrote, Our happiest and serenest times are now over. My peace and calm are gone, for now I will only ever be able to worry about Sasha.  Despite being haunted by her father-in-laws gruesome death and her anxiety over the safety of her husband, at Alexander IIs funeral, she was at least afforded the comfort of the presence of her brother-in-law and favourite sister, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the latter of whom, despite her husbands reluctance and Queen Victorias objections, stayed on in Russia with Maria for several weeks after the funeral.     Alexander and Maria were crowned at the  |Assumption_Cathedral|Assumption_Cathedral_In_Moscow|  in the  |Kremlin|Kremlin|  in Moscow on 27 May 1883. Just before the coronation, a major conspiracy had been uncovered, which cast a pall over the celebration. Nevertheless, over 8000 guests attended the splendid ceremony. Because of the many threats against Maria and Alexander III, the head of the security police, General Cherevin, shortly after the coronation urged the Tsar and his family to relocate to  |Gatchina_Palace|Gatchina_Palace| , a more secure location 50 kilometres outside St. Petersburg. The huge palace had 900 rooms and was built by  |Catherine_the_Great|Catherine_The_Great| . The Romanovs heeded the advice. Maria and Alexander III lived at Gatchina for 13 years, and it was here that their five surviving children grew up. Under heavy guard, Alexander III and Maria made periodic trips from Gatchina to the capital to take part in official events.     Maria is described as a success in her social role as Empress, loved to dance at the balls of high society and became a popular socialite and hostess of the Imperial balls; her daughter Olga commented, “Court life had to run in splendor, and there my mother played her part without a single false step.”, and a contemporary remarked on her success: “of the long gallery of Tsarinas who have sat in state in the Kremlin or paced in the Winter Palace, Marie Feodorovna was perhaps the most brilliant”. She longed for the balls and gatherings in the Winter Palace. These also occurred at Gatchina. Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the musicians, although he would end up sending them off one by one. When that happened, Maria knew the party was over.         As tsarevna, and then as tsarina, Maria Feodorovna had something of a social rivalry with the popular  |Grand_Duchess_Marie_Pavlovna|Marie_Of_Mecklenburg-Schwerin| , wife of her Russian brother-in-law,  |Grand_Duke_Vladimir|Grand_Duke_Vladimir_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia| . This rivalry had echoed the one shared by their husbands, and served to exacerbate the rift within the family.  While Maria Feodorovna knew better than to publicly criticise both the Grand Duke and Duchess in public, Marie Pavlovna had earned the caustic epithet of Empress Vladimir from the tsarina.      Nearly each summer, Maria, Alexander and their children would make an annual trip to Denmark, where her parents, King Christian IX and Queen Louise, hosted family reunions. Marias brother,  |King_George_I|King_George_I_Of_Greece| , and his wife,  |Queen_Olga|Queen_Olga_Of_Greece| , would come up from Athens with their children, and the Princess of Wales, often without her husband, would come with some of her children from the United Kingdom. In contrast to the tight security observed in Russia, the tsar, tsarina and their children relished the relative freedom that they could enjoy at Bernstorff and  |Fredensborg|Fredensborg_Palace| . The annual family meetings of monarchs in Denmark was regarded as suspicious in Europe, where many assumed they secretly discussed state affairs. Bismarck nicknamed Fredensborg “Europe’s Whispering Gallery” and accused Queen Louise of plotting against him with her children. Maria also had a good relationship with the majority of her in-laws, and was often asked to act as a mediator between them and the tsar. In the words of her daughter Olga: “She proved herself extremely tactful with her in-laws, which was no easy task”.        During Alexander IIIs reign, the monarchys opponents quickly disappeared underground. A group of students had been planning to assassinate Alexander III on the sixth anniversary of his fathers death at the  |Peter_and_Paul_Cathedral|Peter_And_Paul_Cathedral|  in St. Petersburg. The plotters had stuffed hollowed-out books with dynamite, which they intended to throw at the Tsar when he arrived at the cathedral. However, the Russian secret police uncovered the plot before it could be carried out. Five students were hanged in 1887; amongst them was  |Aleksandr_Ulyanov|Aleksandr_Ulyanov| , older brother of  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin| .     The biggest threat to the lives of the tsar and his family, however, came not from terrorists, but from a  |derailment_of_the_imperial_train|Borki_Train_Disaster|  in the fall of 1888. Maria and her family had been at lunch in the dining car when the train jumped the tracks and slid down an embankment, causing the roof of the dining car to nearly cave in on them.     When Marias eldest sister  |Alexandra|Alexandra_Of_Denmark|  visited Gatchina in July 1894, she was surprised to see how weak her brother-in-law Alexander III had become. At the time Maria had long known that he was ill and did not have long left. She now turned her attention to her eldest son, the future  |Nicholas_II|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia| , for it was on him that both her personal future and the future of the dynasty now depended.     Nicholas had long had his heart set on marrying  |Princess_Alix_of_Hesse-Darmstadt|Alexandra_Feodorovna| , a favourite grandchild of  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria| . Despite the fact that she was their godchild, neither Alexander III nor Maria approved of the match. Nicholas summed up the situation as follows: I wish to move in one direction, and it is clear that Mama wishes me to move in another  – my dream is to one day marry Alix.  Maria and Alexander found Alix shy and somewhat peculiar. They were also concerned that the young Princess was not possessed of the right character to be Empress of Russia. Nicholass parents had known Alix as a child and formed the impression that she was hysterical and unbalanced, which may have been due to the loss of her mother and youngest sister,  |Marie|Princess_Marie_Of_Hesse_And_By_Rhine| , to diphtheria when she was just six. It was only when Alexander IIIs health was beginning to fail that they reluctantly gave permission for Nicholas to propose.          On 1 November 1894,  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Russia|  died aged just 49 at Livadia. In her diary Maria wrote, I am utterly heartbroken and despondent, but when I saw the blissful smile and the peace in his face that came after, it gave me strength.  Two days later, the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived at Livadia from London. While the Prince of Wales took it upon himself to involve himself in the preparations for the funeral, the Princess of Wales spent her time comforting grieving Maria, including praying with her and sleeping at her bedside.    Maria Feodorovnas birthday was a week after the funeral, and as it was a day in which court mourning could be somewhat relaxed, Nicholas used the day to marry Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt, who took the name Alexandra Feodorovna.      Once the death of  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Russia|  had receded, Maria again took a brighter view of the future. Everything will be all right , as she said. Maria continued to live in the  |Anichkov_Palace|Anichkov_Palace|  in St. Petersburg and at Gatchina Palace. In May 1896, she travelled to Moscow for the coronation of Nicholas and Alexandra.     As a new  |Imperial_Train|Royal_Train|  was constructed for Nicholas II in time for his coronation, Alexander IIIs Temporary Imperial Train  was transferred to the Empress Dowagers personal use.      During the first years of her sons reign, Maria often acted as the political adviser to the Tsar. Uncertain of his own ability and aware of her connections and knowledge, Tsar Nicholas II often told the ministers that he would ask her advice before making decisions, and the ministers sometimes suggested this themselves. It was reportedly on her advice that Nicholas initially kept his fathers ministers. Maria herself estimated that her son was of a weak character and that it was better that he was influenced by her than someone worse. Her daughter Olga remarked upon her influence: “she had never before taken the least interest … now she felt it was her duty. Her personality was magnetic and her zest of activity was incredible. She had her finger on every educational pulse in the empire. She would work her secretaries to shreds, but she did not spare herself. Even when bored in committee she never looked bored. Her manner and, above all, her tact conquered everybody”. After the death of her spouse, Maria came to be convinced that Russia needed reforms to avoid a revolution. According to courtier Paul Benckendorff there was a scene when Maria asked her son not to appoint the conservative Wahl as minister for internal affairs: “during which one almost threw herself at his knees begging him not to make this appointment and to choose someone who could make concessions. She said that if Nicholas did not agree, she would leave for Denmark, and then without me here let them twist your head around . Nicholas did appoint her favored candidate, and she reportedly told her favoured candidate the liberal reformist Peter Sviatopolk-Mirsky to accept by saying: “You must fulfil my son’s wish; If you do, I will give you a kiss”. After the birth of a son to the tsar the same year, however, Nicholas II replaced his mother as his political confidant and adviser with his wife, Empress Alexandra.     Maria Feodorovnas grandson-in-law, Prince  |Felix_Yusupov|Felix_Yusupov| , noted that she had great influence in the Romanov family.  |Sergei_Witte|Sergei_Witte|  praised her tact and diplomatic skill. Nevertheless, despite her social tact, she did not get along well with her daughter-in-law, Tsarina Alexandra, holding her responsible for many of the woes that beset her son Nicholas and the Russian Empire in general. She was appalled with Alexandras inability to win favour with public, and also that she did not give birth to an heir until almost ten years after her marriage, after bearing four daughters. The fact that Russian court custom dictated that an empress dowager took precedence over an empress consort, combined with the possessiveness that Maria had of her sons, and her jealousy of Empress Alexandra only served to exacerbate tensions between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.   |Sophie_Buxhoeveden|Sophie_Buxhoeveden|  remarked of this conflict: “Without actually clashing they seemed fundamentally unable … to understand one another”, and her daughter Olga commented: “they had tried to understand each other and failed. They were utterly different in character, habits and outlook”. Maria was sociable and a good dancer, with an ability to ingratiate herself with people, while Alexandra, though more intelligent and beautiful, was very shy and closed herself off from the Russian people.     By the turn of the twentieth century, Maria was spending increasing time abroad. In 1906, following the death of their father, King Christian IX, she and her sister, Alexandra, who had become queen-consort of the United Kingdom in 1901, purchased the villa of  |Hvidøre|Hvidøre| . The following year, a change in political circumstances allowed Maria Feodorovna to be welcomed to England by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, Marias first visit to England since 1873.  Following a visit in early 1908, Maria Feodorovna was present at her brother-in-law and sisters visit to Russia that summer. A little under two years later, Maria Feodorovna travelled to England yet again, this time for the funeral of her brother-in-law, King Edward VII, in May 1910. During her nearly three-month visit to England in 1910, Maria Feodorovna attempted, unsuccessfully, to get her sister, now Queen Dowager Alexandra, to claim a position of precedence over her daughter-in-law,  |Queen_Mary|Mary_Of_Teck| .              Empress Maria Feodorovna, the mistress of  |Langinkoski|Langinkoski|  retreat, was also otherwise a known friend of Finland. During the  |first_russification_period|Russification_Of_Finland| , she tried to have her son halt the constraining of the  |grand_principalitys_autonomy|Grand_Principality_Of_Finland|  and to recall the unpopular Governor-General  |Bobrikov|Nikolai_Bobrikov|  from Finland to some other position in Russia itself. During the  |second_russification_period|Russification_Of_Finland| , at the start of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , the Empress Dowager, travelling by her special train through Finland to  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| , expressed her continued disapprobation for the russification of Finland by having an orchestra of a welcoming committee play the  |March_of_the_Pori_Regiment|Porilaisten_Marssi|  and the Finnish national anthem  |Maamme|Maamme|  , which at the time were under the explicit ban from  |Franz_Albert_Seyn|Franz_Albert_Seyn| , the  |Governor-General_of_Finland|Governor-General_Of_Finland| .     In 1899, Marias second son, George, died of tuberculosis in the Caucasus. During the funeral, she kept her composure, but at the end of the service, she ran from the church clutching her sons top hat that been atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing.  Two years later, according to her daughter, Grand Duchess Olga, she arranged Olgas disastrous marriage to  |Peter,_Duke_of_Oldenburg|Duke_Peter_Alexandrovich_Of_Oldenburg| .  For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce, only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War. When Olga attempted to contract a  |morganatic_marriage|Morganatic_Marriage|  with  |Nikolai_Kulikovsky|Nikolai_Kulikovsky| , Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade her, yet, they did not protest too vehemently.  Indeed, Maria Feodorovna was one of the few people who attended the wedding in November 1916. In 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly married his mistress, much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas.      Maria Feodorovna disliked Rasputin, whom she regarded to be a dangerous charlatan, and when his activities damaged the reputation of the Tsar, she asked the Tsar and Empress to remove him from their vicinity. When the Tsar remained silent and Empress Alexandra answered and refused for both of them, Maria assumed the empress was the true regent and that she also lacked the capability for such a position: “My poor daughter-in-law does not perceive that she is ruining the dynasty and herself. She sincerely believes in the holiness of an adventurer, and we are powerless to ward of the misfortune, which is sure to come”, When the Tsar dismissed minister  |Vladimir_Kokovtsov|Vladimir_Kokovtsov|  in February 1914 on the advice of Alexandra, Maria again reproached her son, who answered in such a way that she became even more convinced that Alexandra was the real ruler of Russia, and she called upon Kokovtsov and said to him: “My daughter-in-law does not like me; she thinks that I am jealous of her power. She does not perceive that my one aspiration is to see my son happy. Yet I see we are nearing some kind of catastrophe and the Tsar listens to no one but flatterers… Why do you not tell the Tsar everything that you think and know… if it is not already too late”.       In May 1914 Maria Feodorovna travelled to England to visit her sister.  While she was in London,  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  broke out , forcing her to hurry home to Russia. In Berlin the German authorities prevented her train from continuing toward the  |Russian_border|Borders_Of_Russia| . Instead she had to return to Russia by way of Denmark and Finland. Upon her return in August, she took up residence at  |Yelagin_Palace|Yelagin_Palace| , which was closer to St. Petersburg  than Gatchina. During the war she served as president of Russias  |Red_Cross|Red_Cross| .  As she had done a decade earlier in the  |Russo-Japanese_War|Russo-Japanese_War|  of 1904-1905, she also financed a  |sanitary_train|Hospital_Train| .     During the war, there was great concern within the imperial house about the influence Empress Alexandra had upon state affairs through the Tsar, and the influence  |Grigori_Rasputin|Grigori_Rasputin|  was believed to have upon her, as it was considered to provoke the public and endanger the safety of the imperial throne and the survival of the monarchy. King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. . p. 299-300   On behalf of the imperial relatives of the Tsar, both the Empresss sister  |Grand_Duchess_Elizabeth_Feodorovna|Princess_Elisabeth_Of_Hesse_And_By_Rhine|  and her cousin  |Grand_Duchess_Victoria_Feodorovna|Princess_Victoria_Melita_Of_Saxe-Coburg_And_Gotha|  had been selected to mediate and ask Empress Alexandra to banish Rasputin from court to protect her and the thrones reputation, but without success. In parallel, several of the Grand Dukes had tried to intervene with the Tsar, but with no more success.     During this conflict of 1916-1917,  |Grand_Duchess_Maria_Pavlovna|Duchess_Marie_Of_Mecklenburg-Schwerin|  reportedly planned a  |coup_détat|Coup_Détat|  to depose the Tsar with the help of four regiments of the imperial guard which were to invade the Alexander Palace, force the Tsar to abdicate and replace him with his underage son under the regency of her son  |Grand_Duke_Kirill|Kirill_Vladimirovich,_Grand_Duke_Of_Russia| . King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. . p. 319-26-300     There are documents that support the fact that in this critical situation, Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned  |coup_détat|Coup_Détat|  to depose her son from the throne in order to save the monarchy. The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to banish Rasputin unless he wished for her to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup. Exactly how she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed, but two versions are available: first, that  |Grand_Duke_Paul_Alexandrovich_of_Russia|Grand_Duke_Paul_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  would take power in her name, and that she herself would thereafter become ruling empress; the other version further claims that  |Grand_Duke_Paul_Alexandrovich_of_Russia|Grand_Duke_Paul_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  would replace the Tsar with his son, the heir to the throne, Marias grandson Alexey, upon which Maria and Paul Alexandrovich would share power as regents during his minority. Maria was asked to make her appeal to the Tsar after Empress Alexandra had asked the Tsar to dismiss minister Polianov. Initially, she refused to make the appeal, and her sister-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna stated to the French Ambassador: “It’s not want of courage or inclination that keeps her back. Its better that she don’t. She’s too outspoken and imperious. The moment she starts to lecture her son, her feelings run away with her; she sometimes says the exact opposite of what she should; she annoys and humiliates him. Then he stands on his dignity and reminds his mother he is the emperor. They leave each other in a rage.” Eventually, she was however convinced to make the appeal. Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup, and when Maria Feodorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar, the empress convinced him to order his mother to leave the capital. Consequently, the Empress Dowager left Petrograd to live in the  |Mariyinsky_Palace|Mariyinsky_Palace|  in  |Kiev|Kiev|  the same year. She never again returned to Russias capital. Empress Alexandra commented about her departure: “it’s much better Motherdear stays … at Kiev, where the climate is better and she can live as she wishes and hears less gossip”.     In Kiev, Maria engaged in the Red Cross and hospital work, and in September, the 50th anniversary of her arrival in Russia was celebrated with great festivities, during which she was visited by her son, Nicholas II, who came without his wife. Empress Alexandra wrote to the Tsar: “When you see Motherdear, you must rather sharply tell her how pained you are, that she listens to slander and does not stop it, as it makes mischief and others would be delighted, I am sure, to put her against me…” Maria did ask Nicholas II to remove both Rasputin and Alexandra from all political influence, but shortly after, Nicholas and Alexandra broke all contact with the Tsars family.   When Rasputin was murdered, part of the Imperial relatives asked Maria to return to the capital and use the moment to replace Alexandra as the Tsars political adviser. Maria refused, but she did admit that Alexandra should be removed from influence over state affairs: “Alexandra Feodorovna must be banished. Don’t know how but it must be done. Otherwise she might go completely mad. Let her enter a convent or just disappear.”       Revolution came to Russia in 1917, first with the  |February_Revolution|February_Revolution| , then with Nicholas IIs  |abdication|Abdication|  on 15 March. After travelling from  |Kiev|Kiev|  to meet with her deposed son,  |Nicholas_II|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia|  in  |Mogilev|Mogilev| , Maria returned to the city, where she quickly realised how Kiev had changed and that her presence was no longer wanted. She was persuaded by her family there to travel to the Crimea by train with a group of other refugee Romanovs.     After a time living in one of the imperial residences in the Crimea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly rejected the report as a rumour. On the day after the murder of the Tsars family, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, a touching man who told of how difficult life was for her sons family in  |Yekaterinburg|Yekaterinburg| . And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals! The Diaries of Empress Marie Feodorovna, p. 239  In her diary she comforted herself: I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth.  She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. I think of you day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal. Marias daughter Olga Alexandrovna commented further on the matter, Yet I am sure that deep in her heart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death.      Despite the overthrow of the monarchy in 1917, the former Empress Dowager Maria at first refused to leave Russia. Only in 1919, at the urging of her sister, Queen Dowager Alexandra, did she begrudgingly depart, fleeing  |Crimea|Crimea|  over the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  to  |London|London| .  |King_George_V|George_V_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  sent the warship  |HMS_Marlborough|Hms_Marlborough|  to retrieve his aunt. The party of 17 Romanoffs included her daughter the Grand Duchess  |Xenia|Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_Of_Russia|  and five of Xenias sons plus six dogs and a canary.     After a brief stay in the British base in Malta, they travelled to England on the British ship the Lord Nelson, and she stay with her sister, Alexandra. Although Queen Alexandra never treated her sister badly and they spent time together at Marlborough House in London and at  |Sandringham_House|Sandringham_House|  in Norfolk, Maria, as a deposed empress dowager, felt that she was now number two, in contrast to her sister, a popular queen dowager, and she eventually returned to her native Denmark. After living briefly with her nephew,  |King_Christian_X|King_Christian_X| , in a wing of the  |Amalienborg_Palace|Amalienborg_Palace| , she chose her holiday villa  |Hvidøre|Hvidøre|  near  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen|  as her new permanent home.     There were many Russian émigrées in  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen|  who continued to regard her as the Empress and often asked her for help. The All-Russian Monarchical Assembly held in 1921 offered her the  locum tenens  of the Russian throne but she declined with the evasive answer Nobody saw Nicky killed and therefore there was a chance her son was still alive. She rendered financial support to Nikolai Sokolov, who studied the circumstances of the death of the Tsars family, but they never met. The Grand Duchess Olga sent a telegram to Paris cancelling an appointment because it would have been too difficult for the old and sick woman to hear the terrible story of her son and his family.        In November 1925, Marias favourite sister,  |Queen_Alexandra|Alexandra_Of_Denmark| , died. That was the last loss that she could bear. She was ready to meet her Creator, wrote her son-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, about Marias last years. On 13 October 1928 at  |Hvidøre|Hvidøre|  near Copenhagen, in a house she had once shared with her sister Queen Alexandra, Maria died at the age of 80, having outlived four of her six children. Following services in Copenhagens Russian Orthodox  |Alexander_Nevsky_Church|Alexander_Nevsky_Church,_Copenhagen| , the Empress was  |interred|Interred|  at  |Roskilde_Cathedral|Roskilde_Cathedral| .

The crowd around the coffin was so great that a young Danish diplomat fell into the grave before the coffin was interred.
