        The canton of Aargau  is one of the more northerly  |cantons_of_Switzerland|Cantons_Of_Switzerland| . It is situated by the lower course of the  |Aare|Aare| , which is why the canton is called Aar- gau  . It is one of the most densely populated regions of Switzerland.             The area of Aargau and the surrounding areas were controlled by the  |Helvetians|Helvetians| , a member of the  |Celts|Celts| , as far back as 200  BC, eventually being occupied by the  |Romans|Roman_Empire|  and then by the 6th century, the  |Franks|Franks| . The Romans built a major settlement called  |Vindonissa|Vindonissa| , near the present location of  |Brugg|Brugg| .              The reconstructed Old High German name of Aargau is Argowe,   first unambiguously attested  in 795.   The term described a territory only loosely equivalent to that of the modern canton, including the region between Aare and  |Reuss|Reuss| , including  |Pilatus|Pilatus|  and  |Napf|Napf| , i.e. including parts of the modern cantons of Bern ,    |Solothurn|Canton_Of_Solothurn| ,  |Basel_Landschaft|Basel_Landschaft| ,  |Lucerne|Canton_Of_Lucerne| ,  |Obwalden|Obwalden|  and  |Nidwalden|Nidwalden| , but not the parts of the modern canton east of the Reuss , which were part of  |Zürichgau|Zürichgau| .     Within the  |Frankish_Empire|Frankish_Empire|  , the area was a disputed border region between the duchies of  |Alamannia|Alamannia|  and  |Burgundy|Burgundy| . A line of the von  |Wetterau|Wetterau|   intermittently held the countship of Aargau from 750 until about 1030, when they lost it .   This division became the ill-defined outer border of the early  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  at its formation in the second half of the 10th century.   Most of the region came under the control of the ducal  |house_of_Zähringen|House_Of_Zähringen|  and the comital houses of  |Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg|  and  |Kyburg|House_Of_Kyburg|  by about 1200.     In the second half of the 13th century, the territory became divided between the territories claimed by the  |imperial_cities|Reichsfrei|  of  |Bern|Bern| ,  |Lucerne|Lucerne|  and  |Solothurn|Solothurn|  and the Swiss canton of  |Unterwalden|Unterwalden| .   The remaining portion, largely corresponding to the modern canton of Aargau, remained under the control of the Habsburgs until the conquest of Aargau by the  |Old_Swiss_Confederacy|Old_Swiss_Confederacy|  in 1415.     |Habsburg_Castle|Habsburg_Castle|  itself, the original seat of the House of Habsburg, was taken by Bern in April 1415. Peter Frey. Die Habsburg. Bericht über die Ausgrabungen von 1994/95 in: Argovia, Jahresschrift der Historischen Gesellschaft des Kantons Aargau 109 , p. 167.   The Habsburgs had founded a number of monasteries , the closing of which by the government in 1841 was a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Swiss civil war – the  |Sonderbund_War|Sonderbund_War|  – in 1847.          When  |Frederick_IV_of_Habsburg|Frederick_Iv_Duke_Of_Austria|  sided with  |Antipope_John_XXIII|Antipope_John_Xxiii|  at the  |Council_of_Constance|Council_Of_Constance| ,  |Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| |_Sigismund|Sigismund_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  placed him under the  |Imperial_ban|Imperial_Ban| . In July 1414, the Pope visited  |Bern|Bern|  and received assurances from them, that they would move against the Habsburgs. A few months later the  |Swiss_Confederation|Swiss_Confederation|  denounced the  |Treaty_of_1412|Treaty_Of_1412| . Shortly thereafter in 1415,  |Bern|Bern|  and the rest of the Swiss Confederation used the ban as a pretext to invade the Aargau. The Confederation was able to quickly conquer the towns of Aarau, Lenzburg, Brugg and Zofingen along with most of the Habsburg castles.  |Bern|Bern|  kept the southwest portion , northward to the confluence of the  |Aare|Aare|  and  |Reuss|Reuss| . The important city of  |Baden|Baden_Switzerland|  was taken by a united Swiss army and governed by all 8 members of the Confederation. Some districts, named the  Freie Ämter   –  |Mellingen|Mellingen| ,  |Muri|Muri_District| ,  |Villmergen|Villmergen| , and  |Bremgarten|Bremgarten| , with the  |countship_of_Baden|County_Of_Baden|  – were governed as subject lands by all or some of the Confederates. Shortly after the conquest of the Aargau by the Swiss,  |Frederick|Frederick_Iv_Duke_Of_Austria|  humbled himself to the Pope. The Pope reconciled with him and ordered all of the taken lands to be returned. The Swiss refused and years later after no serious attempts at re-acquisition, the Duke officially relinquished rights to the Swiss.           Berns portion of the Aargau came to be known as the  |Unteraargau|Unteraargau| , though can also be called the Berner or Bernese Aargau. In 1514 Bern expanded north into the  |Jura|Canton_Of_Jura|  and so came into possession of several strategically important mountain passes into the Austrian  |Fricktal|Fricktal| . This land was added to the Unteraargau and was directly ruled from Bern. It was divided into seven rural  |bailiwicks|Bailiwick|  and four administrative cities, Aarau, Zofingen, Lenzburg and Brugg. While the Habsburgs were driven out, many of their minor nobles were allowed to keep their lands and offices, though over time they lost power to the Bernese government. The bailiwick administration was based on a very small staff of officials, mostly made up of Bernese citizens, but with a few locals.      When Bern converted during the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  in 1528, the Unteraargau also converted. At the beginning of the 16th century a number of  |anabaptists|Anabaptist|  migrated into the upper Wynen and Rueder valleys from  |Zürich|Zürich| . Despite pressure from the Bernese authorities in the 16th and 17th centuries anabaptism never entirely disappeared from the Unteraargau.     Bern used the Aargau bailiwicks mostly as a source of grain for the rest of the city-state. The administrative cities remained economically only of regional importance. However, in the 17th and 18th centuries Bern encouraged industrial development in Unteraargau and by the late 18th century it was the most industrialized region in the city-state. The high industrialization led to high population growth in the 18th century, for example between 1764 and 1798, the population grew by 35%, far more than in other parts of the canton. In 1870 the proportion of farmers in Aarau, Lenzburg, Kulm, and Zofingen districts was 34–40%, while in the other districts it was 46–57%.          The rest of the  |Freie_Ämter|Freie_Ämter|  were collectively administered as subject territories by the rest of the Confederation. Muri Amt was assigned to Zürich, Lucerne,  |Schwyz|Canton_Of_Schwyz| ,  |Unterwalden|Unterwalden| ,  |Zug|Canton_Of_Zug|  and  |Glarus|Canton_Of_Glarus| , while the Ämter of Meienberg, Richensee and  |Villmergen|Villmergen|  were first given to Lucerne alone. The final boundary was set in 1425 by an arbitration tribunal and Lucerne had to give the three Ämter to be collectively ruled.  The four Ämter were then consolidated under a single Confederation  |bailiff|Bailiff|  into what was known in the 15th century as the Waggental Bailiwick . In the 16th century, it came to be known as the Vogtei der Freien Ämter. While the Freien Ämter often had independent lower courts, they were forced to accept the Confederations sovereignty. Finally, in 1532, the canton of Uri became part of the collective administration of the Freien Ämter.      At the time of  |Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , the majority of the Ämter converted to the new faith. In 1529, a wave of  |iconoclasm|Iconoclasm|  swept through the area and wiped away much of the old religion. After the defeat of Zürich in the second  |Battle_of_Kappel|Battle_Of_Kappel|  in 1531, the victorious five Catholic cantons marched their troops into the Freie Ämter and reconverted them to Catholicism.     In the  |First_War_of_Villmergen|First_War_Of_Villmergen| , in 1656, and the  |Toggenburg_War|Toggenburg_War|  , in 1712, the Freie Ämter became the staging ground for the warring Reformed and Catholic armies. While the peace after the 1656 war did not change the status quo, the fourth Peace of Aarau in 1712 brought about a reorganization of power relations. The victory gave Zürich the opportunity to force the Catholic cantons out of the government in the  |county_of_Baden|County_Of_Baden|  and the adjacent area of the Freie Ämter. The Freie Ämter were then divided in two by a line drawn from the gallows in  |Fahrwangen|Fahrwangen|  to the  |Oberlunkhofen|Oberlunkhofen|  church steeple. The northern part, the so-called Unteren Freie Ämter , which included the districts of Boswil and Hermetschwil and the Niederamt, were ruled by Zürich, Bern and Glarus. The southern part, the Oberen Freie Ämter , were ruled by the previous seven cantons but Bern was added to make an eighth.     During the  |Helvetic_Republic|Helvetic_Republic|  , the county of Baden, the Freie Ämter and the area known as the  |Kelleramt|Kelleramt|  were combined into the  |canton_of_Baden|Canton_Of_Baden| .          The  |County_of_Baden|County_Of_Baden|  was a shared  |condominium|Condominium|  of the entire  |Old_Swiss_Confederacy|Old_Swiss_Confederacy| . After the Confederacy conquest in 1415, they retained much of the Habsburg legal structure, which caused a number of problems. The local nobility had the right to hold the  |low_court|High_Middle_And_Low_Justice|  in only about one fifth of the territory. There were over 30 different nobles who had the right to hold courts scattered around the surrounding lands. All these overlapping jurisdictions caused numerous conflicts, but gradually the Confederation was able to acquire these rights in the County. The cities of Baden,  |Bremgarten|Bremgarten_Aargau|  and  |Mellingen|Mellingen|  became the administrative centers and held the high courts. Together with the courts, the three administrative centers had considerable local autonomy, but were ruled by a governor who was appointed by the Acht Orte every two years. After the  |Protestant|Swiss_Reformed_Church|  victory at the  |Second_Battle_of_Villmergen|Toggenburg_War| , the administration of the County changed slightly. Instead of the Acht Orte appointing a bailiff together, Zürich and Bern each appointed the governor for 7 out of 16 years while  |Glarus|Canton_Of_Glarus|  appointed him for the remaining 2 years.      The chaotic legal structure and fragmented land ownership combined with a tradition of dividing the land among all the heirs in an inheritance prevented any large scale reforms. The governor tried in the 18th century to reform and standardize laws and ownership across the County, but with limited success. With an ever-changing administration, the County lacked a coherent long-term economic policy or support for reforms. By the end of the 18th century there were no factories or mills and only a few small  |cottage_industries|Cottage_Industrycottage_Industry|  along the border with Zürich. Road construction first became a priority after 1750, when Zürich and Bern began appointing a governor for seven years.     During the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , some of the municipalities converted to the new faith. However, starting in 1531, some of the old parishes were  |converted_back_to_the_old_faith|Counter_Reformation| . The governors were appointed from both Catholic and Protestant cantons and since they changed every two years, neither faith gained a majority in the County.     The County was the only federal condominium in the 17th century where Jews were tolerated. In 1774, they were restricted to just two towns,  |Endingen|Endingen_Switzerland|  and  |Lengnau|Lengnau_Aargau| . While the rural upper class tried several times to finally expel the Jews, the financial interests of the authorities prevented this. The Jews were directly subordinate to the governor starting in 1696 when they were forced to buy a protecting and shielding letter every 16 years from the governor.     After the French invasion, on 19 March 1798, the governments of Zürich and Bern agreed to the creation of the short lived  |canton_of_Baden|Canton_Of_Baden|  in the  |Helvetic_Republic|Helvetic_Republic| . With the  |Act_of_Mediation|Act_Of_Mediation|  in 1803, the canton of Baden was dissolved. Portions of the lands of the former County of Baden now became the District of Baden in the newly created canton of Aargau. After World War II, this formerly agrarian region saw striking growth and became the district with the largest and densest population in the canton .             The contemporary canton of Aargau was formed in 1803, a canton of the  |Swiss_Confederation|Swiss_Confederation|  as a result of the  |Act_of_Mediation|Act_Of_Mediation| . It was a combination of three short-lived cantons of the  |Helvetic_Republic|Helvetic_Republic| |Napoleonic_era|Switzerland_In_The_Napoleonic_Era| . In the year 2003, the canton of Aargau celebrated its 200th anniversary.     French forces occupied the Aargau from 10 March to 18 April 1798; thereafter the Bernese portion became the canton of Aargau and the remainder formed the  |canton_of_Baden|Canton_Of_Baden| . Aborted plans to merge the two halves came in 1801 and 1802, and they were eventually united under the name Aargau,  which was then admitted as a full member of the reconstituted Confederation following the Act of Mediation. Some parts of the canton of Baden at this point were transferred to other cantons: the Amt of  |Hitzkirch|Hitzkirch|  to Lucerne, whilst  |Hüttikon|Hüttikon| ,  |Oetwil_an_der_Limmat|Oetwil_An_Der_Limmat| ,  |Dietikon|Dietikon|  and  |Schlieren|Schlieren_Zürich|  went to Zürich. In return, Lucernes Amt of  |Merenschwand|Merenschwand|  was transferred to Aargau .     The  |Fricktal|Fricktal| , ceded in 1802 by  |Austria|Austria|  via Napoleonic France to the Helvetic Republic, was briefly a separate canton of the Helvetic Republic  under a  Statthalter  , but on 19 March 1803 was incorporated into the canton of Aargau.     The former cantons of Baden and Fricktal can still be identified with the contemporary  |districts|Districts_Of_Switzerlandaargau|  – the  |canton_of_Baden|Canton_Of_Baden|  is covered by the districts of Zurzach, Baden, Bremgarten, and Muri ; the  |canton_of_Fricktal|Canton_Of_Fricktal|  by the districts of Rheinfelden and Laufenburg .       The chief magistracy of Aargau changed its style repeatedly:   first two consecutive  Regierungsstatthalter  :   April 1798 – November 1801 Jakob Emmanuel Feer   1802–1803 Johann Heinrich Rothpletz   Presidents of the Government Commission   10 March 1803 – 26 April 1803 Johann Rudolf Dolder   26 April 1803 – 1815 a Small Council   annual  Amtsbürgermeister  1815–1831   annual  Landammänner  since 1815          In the 17th century, Jews were banished from Switzerland. However, a few families were permitted to live in two villages,  |Endingen|Endingen_Switzerland|  and  |Lengnau|Lengnau_Aargau| , in Aargau which became the Jewish ghetto in Switzerland. During this period, Jews and Christians were not allowed to live under the same roof, neither were Jews allowed to own land or houses. They were taxed at a much higher rate than others and, in 1712, the Lengnau community was pillaged. In 1760, they were further restricted regarding marriages and procreation. This remained the case until the 19th century. In 1799, all special tolls were abolished, and, in 1802, the poll tax was removed. On 5 May 1809, they were declared citizens and given broad rights regarding trade and farming. They were still restricted to Endingen and Lengnau until 7 May 1846, when their right to move and reside freely within the canton of Aargau was granted. On 24 September 1856, the  |Swiss_Federal_Council|Swiss_Federal_Council|  granted them full political rights within Aargau, as well as broad business rights; however the majority Christian population did not abide by these new liberal laws fully. The time of 1860 saw the canton government voting to grant suffrage in all local rights and to give their communities autonomy. Before the law was enacted, it was repealed due to vocal opposition led by the  |Ultramonte_Party|Ultramontanism| . Finally, the federal authorities in July 1863, granted all Jews full rights of citizens. However, they did not receive all of the rights in Endingen and Lengn until a resolution of the  |Grand_Council|Grand_Council_Of_Aargau| , on 15 May 1877, granted citizens rights to the members of the Jewish communities of those places, giving them charters under the names of New Endingen and New Lengnau.  The  |Swiss_Jewish_Kulturverein|Swiss_Jewish_Kulturverein|  was instrumental in this fight from its founding in 1862 until it was dissolved 20 years later. During this period of diminished rights, they were not even allowed to bury their dead in Swiss soil and had to bury their dead on an island called  Judenäule  on the  |Rhine|Rhine|  near  |Waldshut|Waldshut_Tiengen| . Beginning in 1603, the deceased Jews of the  |Surbtal|Surbtal|  communities were buried on the river island which was leased by the Jewish community. As the island was repeatedly flooded and devastated, in 1750 the  |Surbtal_Jews|Surbtal_Jews|  asked the  Tagsatzung  to establish the  |Endingen_cemetery|Jüdischer_Friedhof_Endingen|  in the vicinity of their communities.            The capital of the canton is  |Aarau|Aarau| , which is located on its western border, on the  |Aare|Aare| . The canton borders  |Germany|Germany|   to the north, the Rhine forming the border. To the west lie the Swiss cantons of  |Basel_Landschaft|Basel_Landschaft| ,  |Solothurn|Canton_Of_Solothurn|  and  |Bern|Canton_Of_Bern| ; the  |canton_of_Lucerne|Canton_Of_Lucerne|  lies south, and  |Zürich|Canton_Of_Zürich|  and  |Zug|Canton_Of_Zug|  to the east. Its total area is . It contains both large rivers, the  |Aare|Aare|  and the  |Reuss|Reuss| .      The canton of Aargau is one of the least mountainous Swiss cantons, forming part of a  |great_table_land|Swiss_Plateau| , to the north of the  |Alps|Swiss_Alps|  and the east of the  |Jura|Jura_Mountains| , above which rise low hills. The surface of the country is diversified with undulating tracts and well-wooded hills, alternating with fertile valleys watered mainly by the Aare and its tributaries. The valleys alternate with hills, many of which are wooded. Slightly over one-third of the canton is wooded , while nearly half is used from farming .  or about 2.4% of the canton is considered unproductive, mostly lakes  and streams. With a population density of 450/km 2 , the canton has a relatively high amount of land used for human development, with  or about 15% of the canton developed for housing or transportation.      It contains the hot sulphur springs of  |Baden|Baden_Switzerland|  and  |Schinznach_Bad|Schinznach_Bad| , while at  |Rheinfelden|Rheinfelden|  there are very extensive saline springs. Just below  |Brugg|Brugg|  the  |Reuss|Reuss|  and the  |Limmat|Limmat|  join the Aar, while around Brugg are the ruined castle of  |Habsburg|Habsburg| , the old convent of  |Königsfelden|Königsfelden_Abbey|  and the remains of the  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|  settlement of Vindonissa .      |Fahr_Monastery|Fahr_Monastery|  forms a small  |exclave|Enclave_And_Exclave|  of the canton, otherwise surrounded by the  |canton_of_Zürich|Canton_Of_Zürich| , and since 2008 is part of the Aargau municipality of  |Würenlos|Würenlos| .               Aargau is divided into 11 districts:    |Aarau|Aarau|  with capital  |Aarau|Aarau| |_Baden|Baden|  with capital  |Baden|Baden_Switzerland| |_Bremgarten|Bremgarten|  with capital  |Bremgarten|Bremgarten_Ag| |_Brugg|Brugg|  with capital  |Brugg|Brugg_Switzerland| |_Kulm|Kulm|  with capital  |Unterkulm|Unterkulm| |_Laufenburg|Laufenburg|  with capital  |Laufenburg|Laufenburg_Switzerland| |_Lenzburg|Lenzburg|  with capital  |Lenzburg|Lenzburg| |_Muri|Muri|  with capital  |Muri|Muri_Aargau| |_Rheinfelden|Rheinfelden|  with capital  |Rheinfelden|Rheinfelden| |_Zofingen|Zofingen|  with capital  |Zofingen|Zofingen| |_Zurzach|Zurzach|  with capital  |Zurzach|Zurzach|      The most recent change in district boundaries occurred in 2010 when  |Hottwil|Hottwil|  transferred from Brugg to Laufenburg, following its merger with other municipalities, all of which were in Laufenburg.          There are 213 municipalities in the canton of Aargau. As with most Swiss cantons there has been a trend since the early 2000s for municipalities to merge, though mergers in Aargau have so far been less radical than in other cantons.       The  |blazon|Blazon|  of the  |coat_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms|  is Per pale, dexter: sable, a fess wavy argent, charged with two cotises wavy azure; sinister: sky blue, three mullets of five argent.
