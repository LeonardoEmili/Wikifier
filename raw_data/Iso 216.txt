   ISO 216 specifies  |international_standard|International_Organization_For_Standardization| |paper_sizes|Paper_Size|  used in most countries in the world today, although not in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, or the Dominican Republic. The standard defines the A and B series of paper sizes, including A4, the most commonly available paper size worldwide. Two supplementary standards,  |ISO_217|Iso_217|  and  |ISO_269|Iso_269| , define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 C series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.     All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes have the same  |aspect_ratio|Aspect_Ratio| ,  |millimetres|Millimetres| . This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthways, the halves also have the same aspect ratio. Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size in the same series.                         The oldest known mention of the advantages of basing a paper size on an  |aspect_ratio|Aspect_Ratio|  of  is found in a letter written on 25 October 1786 by the German scientist  |Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg|Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg|  to  |Johann_Beckmann|Johann_Beckmann| .  Published in        The formats that became ISO paper sizes A2, A3, B3, B4, and B5 were developed in France. They were listed in a 1798 law on taxation of publications that was based in part on page sizes.  Kuhn includes copies of pages from the journal article that announced the law:         The French format series never became widely known and was quickly forgotten again. Searching for a standard system of paper formats on a scientific basis by the association  |Die_Brücke_-_Internationales_Institut_zur_Organisierung_der_geistigen_Arbeit|Die_Brücke| , as a replacement for the vast variety of other paper formats that had been used before, in order to make paper stocking and document reproduction cheaper and more efficient,  |Wilhelm_Ostwald|Wilhelm_Ostwald|  proposed in 1911, over a hundred years after the “Loi sur le timbre”, a  |Weltformat|Diebrückeweltformat-Worldstandard|  for paper sizes based on the ratio 1:, referring to the argument advanced by Lichtenberg 1786 letter, and linking this to the metrical system by using 1  |centimetre|Centimetre|  as the width of the base format.  |W._Porstmann|W._Porstmann|  argued in a long article published in 1918, that a firm basis for the system of paper formats, which deal with surfaces, could not be the length, but the surface, i.e. linking the system of paper formats to the metrical system of measures by the square metre, using the two formulae of x / y 1: and x × y 1. Porstmann also argued that formats for containers of paper like envelopes should be 10% larger than the paper format itself.     In 1921, after a long discussion and another intervention by W. Porstmann, the Normenausschuß der deutschen Industrie  published German standard DI Norm 476 the specification of 4 series of paper formats with ratio 1:, with series A as the always preferred formats and basis for the other series. All measures are rounded to the nearest millimetre. A0 has a surface area within a rounding error of 1 square metre with a width of 841mm and height of 1189mm, so an actual area of 0.999949m², and A4 recommended as standard paper size for business, administrative and government correspondence and A6 for postcards. Series B is based on B0 with width of 1 metre, C0 is 917 mm × 1297 mm, and D0 771 mm × 1090 mm. Series C is the basis for envelope formats.     This German standardisation work was accompanied by contributions from other countries, and the published DIN paper-format concept was soon introduced as a national standard in many other countries, for example, Belgium , Netherlands , Norway , Switzerland , Sweden , Soviet Union , Hungary , Italy , Finland , Uruguay , Argentina , Brazil , Spain , Austria , Romania , Japan , Denmark , Czechoslovakia , Israel , Portugal , Yugoslavia , India , Poland , United Kingdom , Venezuela , New Zealand , Iceland , Mexico , South Africa , France , Peru , Turkey , Chile , Greece , Zimbabwe , Singapore , Bangladesh , Thailand , Barbados , Australia , Ecuador , Columbia and Kuwait .     It finally became both an international standard as well as the official United Nations document format in 1975 and it is today used in almost all countries on this planet, with the exception of North America.     In 1977, a large German car manufacturer performed a study of the paper formats found in their incoming mail and concluded that out of 148 examined countries, 88 already used the A series formats.         The main advantage of this system is its scaling.  |Rectangular|Rectangle|  paper with an aspect ratio of  has the unique property that, when cut or folded in half midway between its shorter sides, each half has the same  aspect ratio as the whole sheet before it was divided. Equivalently, if one lays two same-sized sheets of paper with an aspect ratio of  side-by-side along their longer side, they form a larger rectangle with the aspect ratio of  and double the area of each individual sheet.     The ISO system of paper sizes exploits these properties of the  aspect ratio. In each series of sizes , the largest size is numbered 0 , and each successive size has half the area of the preceding sheet and can be cut by halving the length of the preceding size sheet. The new measurement is rounded down to the nearest millimetre. A folded  |brochure|Brochure|  can be made by using a sheet of the next larger size  .
