              The Sirenia, commonly referred to as sea-cows or sirenians, are an  |order|Order|  of fully aquatic,  |herbivorous|Herbivorous| |mammals|Mammal|  that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the  |families|Family| |Dugongidae|Dugongidae|   and Trichechidae  with a total of four species. The  |Protosirenidae|Protosirenidae|  and  |Prorastomidae|Prorastomidae|  families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the  |clade|Clade| |Paenungulata|Paenungulata| , alongside the  |elephants|Elephant|  and the  |hyrax|Hyrax| es, and evolved in the  |Eocene|Eocene|  50 million years ago. The Dugongidae  |diverged|Genetic_Divergence|  from the Trichechidae in the  |late_Eocene|Late_Eocene|  or  |early_Oligocene|Early_Oligocene| .     Sirenians grow to between  in length and  in weight. The now extinct  |Stellers_sea_cow|Stellers_Sea_Cow|  was the largest sirenian to have lived, and could reach lengths of  and weights of . Sirenians have a large,  |fusiform|Wikt:Fusiform|  body to reduce  |drag|Parasitic_Drag|  through the water. They have heavy bones that act as  |ballasts|Ballast_Tank|  to counteract the buoyancy of their  |blubber|Blubber| . They have a thin layer of blubber and consequently are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which cause migrations when water temperatures dip too low. Sirenians are slow-moving, typically coasting at , but they can reach  in short bursts. They use their strong lips to pull out  |seagrass|Seagrass| es, consuming 10â€“15% of their body weight per day.     While breathing, they hold just their nostrils above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so. Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, but have been known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish. Males typically mate with more than one female , and may participate in  |lek_mating|Lek_Mating| . Sirenians are  |K-selected|K-Selected| , and display  |parental_care|Parental_Care| .          The meat, oil, bones, and skins are valuable items sold in markets. Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as  |habitat_destruction|Habitat_Destruction| ,  |entanglement|Bycatch|  in  |fishing_gear|Fishing_Net| , and  |watercraft_collisions|Ship_Strike| .  |Stellers_sea_cow|Stellers_Sea_Cow|  went extinct due to overhunting in 1768.         Sirenia, commonly sirenians, are also referred to by the  |common_name|Common_Name|  sirens, deriving from the  |sirens|Siren|  of  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| .    Sirenian International - Manatee & Dugong Research, Education, & Conservation This comes from a  |legend|Legend|  about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for  |mermaids|Mermaid| . Seekoei is also the name for a  |hippopotamus|Hippopotamus|  in  |Afrikaans|Afrikaans| .        Sirenians are classified within the  |cohort|Cohort| |Afrotheria|Afrotheria|  in the  |clade|Clade| |Paenungulata|Paenungulata| , alongside  |Proboscidea|Proboscidea|  ,  |Hyracoidea|Hyracoidea|  ,  |Embrithopoda|Embrithopoda| ,  |Desmostylia|Desmostylia| , and  |Afroinsectiphilia|Afroinsectiphilia| .    This clade was first established by  |George_Gaylord_Simpson|George_Gaylord_Simpson|  in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as  |testicondy|Testicondy|  and similar  |fetal_development|Fetal_Development| . The Paenungulata, along with the Afrotheria, are one of the most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny.  Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade  |Tethytheria|Tethytheria| . Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria,  |Perissodactyla|Perissodactyla| , and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the  |Altungulata|Altungulata| , but this has been invalidated by molecular data.                                              The evolution of sirenians is characterized by the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians . The nostrils are large and  |retracted|Retraction| , the  |upper-jaw_bone|Premaxilla|  contacts the  |frontal_bone|Frontal_Bone| , the  |sagittal_crest|Sagittal_Crest|  is missing, the  |mastoid|Mastoid_Part_Of_The_Temporal_Bone|  fills the  |supratemporal_fenestra|Supratemporal_Fenestra|  , a drop-like  |ectotympanic|Ectotympanic|  , and  |pachyosteosclerotic|Pachyosteosclerosis|  bones.     Sirenians first appeared in the  |fossil_record|Fossil_Record|  in the  |Early_Eocene|Ypresian|  and significantly  |diversified|Speciation|  throughout the  |epoch|Epoch| . They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other  |marine_mammals|Marine_Mammal|  such as  |cetacea|Cetacea| ns,  lived in the  |New_World|New_World| . One of the earliest aquatic sirenians discovered is  Prorastomus  which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the  |quadruped|Quadruped|   Pezosiren , lived 50 million years ago.  An ancient sirenian fossil of a  |petrosal_bone|Petrous_Part_Of_The_Temporal_Bone|  was found in Tunisia, dating back to approximately the same time as Prorastomus.  This is the oldest sirenian fossil to be found in Africa and supports molecular data suggesting that sirenians may have originated in Africa.  |Prorastomidae|Prorastomidae|  and  |Protosirenidae|Protosirenidae| , the earliest sirenian  |families|Family| , consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died out at the end of the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.      The last of the sirenian families to appear,  |Trichechidae|Trichechidae| , apparently arose from early dugongids in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. It is a monophyletic taxon. In 1994, the family was expanded to include not only the subfamily  |Trichechinae|Trichechinae|  ,  but also  |Miosireninae|Miosireninae|  . The African manatee and the West Indian manatee are more closely related to each other than to the Amazonian manatee.     Dugongidae comprises the subfamilies Dugonginae and  |Hydrodamalinae|Hydrodamalinae|  and the paraphyletic Halitheriinae. The tusks of modern-day dugongs may have originally been used for digging, but they are now used for social interaction. The genus Dugong probably originated in the Indo-Pacific area.               The  |tail_fluke|Tail_Fluke|  of a dugong is notched and similar to those of  |dolphins|Dolphin| , whereas the tail fluke of manatees is paddle-shaped. The fluke is raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, or twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.  Unlike manatees, the dugong lacks  |nails|Nail|  on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugongs body length. Manatees generally glide at speeds of , but can reach speeds of  in short bursts.  The body is  |fusiform|Wikt:Fusiform|  to reduce  |drag|Parasitic_Drag|  in the water. Like cetaceans, the hind limbs are internal and  |vestigial|Vestigial| . The  |snout|Rostrum|  is angled downwards to aid in  |bottom-feeding|Bottom_Feeder| .  Sirenians typically make two- to three-minute dives,  but manatees can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes while resting and dugongs up to six minutes. They may stand on their tail to hold their head above water.         Much like elephants, manatees are  |polyphyodonts|Polyphyodont| , and continuously replace their teeth from the back of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10  |cheek_teeth|Cheek_Teeth|  in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugongs teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement.  The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the  |premaxilla|Premaxilla| .  The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong.     Sirenians exhibit  |pachyostosis|Pachyostosis| , a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are solid and contain little or no  |bone_marrow|Bone_Marrow| . They have among the densest bones in the  |animal|Animal|  kingdom, which may be used as  |ballast|Ballast_Tank| , counteracting the buoyancy effect of their blubber and help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the waters surface.  Manatees do not possess blubber, per se, but rather have thick skin, and, consequently, are sensitive to temperature changes. Likewise, they often migrate to warmer waters whenever the water temperature dips below . The  |lungs|Lung|  of sirenians are unlobed; they, along with the  |diaphragm|Thoracic_Diaphragm| , extend the entire length of the vertebral column, which help them control their buoyancy and reduce tipping in the water.       Extant sirenians grow to between  in length and can weigh up to . Stellers sea cow was the largest sirenian to have lived, and could reach lengths of ,  and could weigh in at .  A dugongs brain weighs a maximum of , about 0.1% of the animals body weight. The body of sirenians is sparsely covered in short hair , except for on the muzzle, which may allow for  |tactile|Tactition|  interpretation of their environment.  Manatees are the only creatures to exhibit corneal avascularity, and lack blood vessels in the cornea, which prevents optical clarity and vision. This may be the result of irritations from or protection against their  |hypotonic|Hypotonic|  freshwater environment.           Sirenians are referred to as sea cows because their diet consists mainly of  |seagrass|Seagrass| . Dugongs sift through the seafloor in search of seagrasses. Dugongs use their sense of smell to find the seagrass because their eyesight is poor making it difficult to use their sense of sight to find food.  They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the West Indian manatee, are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as  |shoalweed|Shoalweed| ,  |water_lettuce|Water_Lettuce| ,  |muskgrass|Muskgrass| ,  |manatee_grass|Manatee_Grass| , and  |turtle_grass|Turtle_Grass| . Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10â€“15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day.
