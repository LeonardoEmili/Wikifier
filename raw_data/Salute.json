With the advent of increasingly cumbersome headgear in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the act of removing ones hat was gradually converted into the simpler gesture of grasping or touching the visor and issuing a courteous salutation.     As early as 1745, a British order book stated that: The men are ordered not to pull off their hats when they pass an officer, or to speak to them, but only to clap up their hands to their hats and bow as they pass. Over time, it became conventionalized into something resembling the modern hand salute. , US Army Quartermaster Center & School, retrieved 27 September 2014 In the Austrian Army the practice of making a hand salute replaced that of removing the headdress in 1790, although officers wearing ": null

Less formal salutes include the order arms salute and the shoulder arms salutes. These are most often given by a sentry to a low-ranking superior who does not rate the full present arms salute. In the order arms salute, the rifle rests on its butt by the sentrys right foot, held near the muzzle by the sentrys right hand, and does not move. The sentry brings his flattened left hand across his body and touches the rifle near its muzzle.

In both countries, the right-hand salute is generally identical to, and drawn from the traditions of, the British armed forces. The salute of the Australian or New Zealand Army is best described as the right arm taking the path of the longest way up and then the shortest way down. Similar in many ways, the salute of the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force takes the longest way up and the shortest way down. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy, however, take the shortest way up, palm down, and the shortest way down. The action of the arm rotating up is slower than the action of the conclusion of the salute which is the arm being quickly snapped down to the saluters side. Junior members are required to salute first and the senior member is obliged to return the compliment. Protocol dictates that the Monarch, members of the Royal Family, the Governor-General and State Governors are to be saluted at all times by all ranks. Except where a Drill Manual protocol dictates otherwise, the duration of the salute is timed at three beats of the quick-time march , timed from the moment the senior member first returns it. In situations where cover is not being worn, the salute is given verbally; the junior party will first come to attention, then offer the salute Good morning/afternoon Your Majesty/Your Royal Highness/Prime Minister/Your Grace/Sir/Maam , etc., as the case may be. It is this, rather than the act of standing to attention, which indicates that a salute is being offered. If either party consists of two or more members, all will come to attention, but only the most senior member of the party will offer the physical or verbal salute. The party which is wearing headdress must always offer, or respond with, a full salute. At the Forward Edge of the Battle Area no salutes of any kind are given, under any circumstances; it is always sensible to assume that there are snipers in the area. In this case, parties personally known to each other are addressed familiarly by their first or given names, regardless of rank; senior officers are addressed as one might address a stranger, courteously, but without any naming or mark of respect.
