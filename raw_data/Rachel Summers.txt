Although the character is considered unique to the Marvel Comics  |multiverse|Multiverse|  , Uncanny X-Men 462 her name has been used to designate the mother of Marvel characters  |Hyperstorm|Hyperstorm|   Fantastic Four  414 and Dream Richards  in respective timelines.          Rachel first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men  141 and has since been affiliated with several comic book superhero teams including the X-Men and  |Excalibur|Excalibur| .            Rachel Anne Summers comes from an alternate future Earth known as Earth-811, as seen in the  |Days_of_Future_Past|Days_Of_Future_Past|  storyline from The Uncanny X-Men  141–142. In this reality, the assassination of Senator  |Robert_Kelly|Robert_Kelly|  provoked the  |ratification|Ratify|  of the  |Mutant_Registration_Act|Registration_Acts| , leading to a  |dystopia|Dystopia| n future where the mutant-hunting  |Sentinel|Sentinels|  robots rule North America. Rachel was abducted by operatives working for Ahab, who used drugs and  |hypnotherapy|Hypnotherapy|  to turn Rachel into a  |Hound|Hounds|  , a mutant who tracks down other mutants. She fulfilled her duties, but her  |psychic|Psychic|  powers linked her to her victims; fueling her grief and despair until she attacked Ahab and scarred him. In return, he sent her to the mutant  |concentration_camps|Concentration_Camp| . There, she befriended the surviving mutant rebels, including  |Wolverine|Wolverine| ,  |Magneto|Magneto| ,  |Colossus|Colossus| ,  |Storm|Storm| ,  |Kate_Pryde|Kitty_Pryde| , and her lover, the adult  |Franklin_Richards|Franklin_Richards| .     Rachel managed to send Kates consciousness into the past to her younger self to prevent the assassination, but it did not change their time.  Excalibur  52 Rachel sent her astral form into the past to find out why and discovered she had sent Kate into an  |alternate_past|Parallel_Universe| . On the way back, she encountered the disembodied  |Phoenix_Force|Phoenix_Force|  and it followed her to her present. Rachel passed out from the strain of  |astral_projection|Astral_Projection|  and the Phoenix Force revealed itself to Kate, who asked it to give Rachel a fresh start.     When Rachel and Kate broke into Project:  |Nimrod|Nimrod|  on a suicide mission to destroy a new model of Sentinel, they became trapped. The Uncanny X-Men 192 When Kate spoke the words Dark Phoenix, the Phoenix Force ripped Rachel from her timeline and sent her body back to the alternate past to which she had sent Kates consciousness. The Uncanny X-Men 184 This was a past where she learned Jean Grey was dead The Uncanny X-Men 188 and that her father was married to someone else. Rachel experienced additional heartache and displacement trauma when she discovered that her fathers new wife,  |Madelyne_Pryor|Madelyne_Pryor| , was pregnant with a son , because in her timeline she was the first-born child of Scott Summers. X-Men/ Alpha Flight  1–2       Rachel had a brief membership in the X-Men before finding a  |Shiar|Shiar|  holoempathic crystal at her grandparents home. The crystal was imprinted with a portion of Rachels mothers essence inside it as a tribute to the family shortly after Jean Greys death. After Rachel took a vow to remember her mother with the uniform and name of Phoenix, The Uncanny X-Men 199 the  |Phoenix_Force|Phoenix_Force|  fully bonded with her. She was granted access to its power on a cosmic magnitude, albeit in a much more limited fashion than the Dark Phoenix. Soon after, the grudge which she had begun with  |Selene|Selene|  boiled over when Rachel secretly invaded the  |Hellfire_Club|Hellfire_Club| . She did this with the intention of taking vengeance on Selene for the murders she had committed, particularly that of nightclub owner Nicholas Damiano, who had previously taken Rachel into his home after Selene had attacked her. Selene proved to be no match for Rachels newly increased powers, but just as she was about to finish Selene, Wolverine arrived and was forced to stab Rachel in the chest. The Uncanny X-Men 207 Mortally injured, Rachel was lured into  |Spirals|Spiral|  Body Shoppe. The Uncanny X-Men 209          Months later, while recuperating from injuries on  |Muir_Island|Muir_Island| ,  |Shadowcat|Kitty_Pryde|  and  |Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler|  both had the same dream, where they were actors on a weird set and helped Rachel, who was trapped there, escape. Shortly thereafter, Rachel escaped from the alternate reality of  |Mojoworld|Mojo| . Rachel has once been cited having a flashback to her time there where she is held in chains and tortured. The three former X-Men were joined by  |Captain_Britain|Captain_Britain|  and  |Meggan|Meggan|  and founded the British superhero team  |Excalibur|Excalibur| . Excalibur: The Sword is Drawn While part of the team, she discovered that this universes version of her mother, Jean Grey, was alive. She attempted to bond with Jean, but Jean, upon discovering Rachel was the present host for the Phoenix, rejected any contact with her. Jean still resented the Phoenix Force for stealing a portion of her life. She also rejected Rachel because she felt that Rachels existence was a constant reminder of the dystopian future she feared could still come to pass. Uncanny X-Men Annual 14 Eventually, however, Jean moved past those feelings and formally welcomed Rachel into her life. Excalibur 71       Rachel remained with Excalibur until an incident caused Captain Britain to be lost in the timestream. She exchanged places with the time-lost Captain Britain Excalibur 75 and emerged two thousand years in the future, in a world conquered by  |Apocalypse|Apocalypse|  and crushed under his iron fist.  The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix  1–4 She gathered together a group of rebels and founded the  |Askani|Askani| . She trained one of her followers to  |travel_back_in_time|Time_Travel|  and bring her brother Nathan forward in time when he was infected with a  |techno-organic_virus|Technarchy| .  X-Factor  68 The Askani  |cloned|Clone|  Nathan in case he was not able to survive the virus. Apocalypses followers attacked the Askani and took the clone , leaving Rachel critically injured. Hooked up to life support, she drew the minds of Scott and Jean into the future, as Slym and Redd , to raise Nathan and tutor him in the use of his powers. Rachel finally died ten years later and sent Scott and Jean back to their original bodies seconds after they had left.     After Nathan, now known as  |Cable|Cable| , had finally defeated Apocalypse, he went into the timeline to retrieve Rachel. There, he discovered a Rachel sans Phoenix Force. With the premature death of Apocalypse, the Askani timeline had been diverged from the mainstream Marvel Universe,  |Earth-616|Earth-616| . As a result, she had been flung into the far future, yet subjectively a short time after she had been lost in the timestream, as the slave of a creature called Gaunt , who had used her to lead Cable there for a battle of the ages . Cable defeated Gaunt in the battle and Rachel, now free, was able to use her residual Phoenix Force to return them both to the present. She then decided to take a break from superheroics and enrolled in college after she made Cable promise he would not tell anyone she was back. Despite her efforts to live a normal life, however, she was kidnapped by the telepath  |Elias_Bogan|Elias_Bogan|  and subsequently rescued by the X-Men.       She decided to rejoin the X-Men, taking the name Marvel Girl to honor her mother and wearing a costume her mother had designed but never worn; a variation on Jeans first green costume. She also changed her last name to Grey , possibly to express disapproval at her fathers betrayal of Jean, as well as his continuing relationship with  |Emma_Frost|Emma_Frost| ; X-Men Unlimited vol. 2, 11 though she and Emma made a truce of sorts during one of the teams missions in  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| . Rachel and  |Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler|  began to have an attraction towards each other, kissing at one point, Uncanny X-Men 450 but nothing came of it as Nightcrawler also had an attraction to Storm at the time, who was in somewhat of a romantic friendship with Wolverine. Uncanny X-Men 453 Uncanny X-Men 455 Her stint with this team also included a visit to the  |Savage_Land|Savage_Land| . In the storyline Worlds End , which was heavily criticized by readers, Rachel was subjected to the mind-control of a tribe of advanced dinosaur people, the Haukka, causing her to believe she belonged to their species. Afterward, she subconsciously used her telekinesis to change her own genome in their image. This was eventually reverted. After  House of M  and  Decimation , where most of the worlds mutants lost their powers, the government had  |Sentinels|Sentinels|  instituted at the  |X-Mansion|X-Mansion|  to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point to attack. Though their intentions were good this time, it reminded Rachel too much of the previous timeline when Sentinels herded mutants into concentration camps.     Rachel had a short stint with newly re-formed Excalibur, reminiscent of the former team, shortly after the House of M events. She assisted the team in battling  |Shadow-X|Shadow-X|  and the  |Shadow_King|Shadow_King|  . New Excalibur 1–4          Rachel spent some time with her grandparents, bonding with her grandfather. At a family reunion with all her relatives, a commando unit under the order of the  |Shiar|Shiar|  attacked the party, killing everyone in an effort to wipe out the Grey genome. The commando unit was unable to kill Rachel; instead, one member was able to graft a deathmark on her back that would allow them to find her wherever she went. It is assumed that the only remaining member of the Grey family now left on Earth besides Rachel is Cable. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shiar and was quoted as saying, Im not my mom. Im not the Phoenix. Im my own woman. And by the time Im done... theyll wish I was the Phoenix.     The Death Commandos later tracked Rachel to the psychiatry office of Dr. Maureen Lyszinski. Rachel, with the help of  |Psylocke|Psylocke| ,  |Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler| ,  |Bishop|Bishop| , and  |Cannonball|Cannonball| , saved the doctor and took down the Death Commandos. She decided to imprison them, instead of killing them, by telling them, I mean to find destiny in a way that brings us both honor. She is also sometimes referenced as Starchilde in this series.       After Rachel was kidnapped, along with Cyclops, by her paternal uncle  |Vulcan|Vulcan| , he freed  |Darwin|Darwin|  from inside him. Later,  |Professor_X|Professor_X|  recruited Rachel, along with  |Havok|Havok| ,  |Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler| ,  |Warpath|Warpath| , Darwin, and  |Polaris|Polaris| , for a space mission to stop Vulcan from laying waste to the  |Shiar|Shiar|  empire. Uncanny X-Men 475 Xavier, who recently was stripped of his powers, recruited Rachel to serve as his telepathic eyes and ears during their mission. Aware of Rachels vendetta against the Shiar, Xavier agreed to use their trip into space to find out who in the Shiar Empire gave the order to wipe out all members of the Grey family, and he warned Rachel that they will deal with the people responsible for her recent losses Xaviers way.     While in space, the team was attacked by  |Korvus|Korvus| , a Shiar warrior sent to kill Rachel. Korvus ancestor, Rookshir, was a previous host of the Phoenix Force, and a small portion of the Phoenixs power was left behind in his sword, the Blade of the Phoenix. With this power, Korvus made short work of the other X-Men, but when Rachel blocked the sword, their minds were involuntarily linked. Through this link, Rachel learned that Korvus family was also murdered by the Shiar government because of their connection to the Phoenix. The remaining echo of the Phoenix power from the sword was then transferred to Rachel. Rachel claimed that rather than having taken the power, the power chose to go to her, saying, The Phoenix knows me, remember? It likes me. When this happened, Rachels normally gold energy aura turned blue, the same color as the Blade of the Phoenix. She then telekinetically disabled an explosive implant that the Shiar chancellor was using to force Korvus obedience.     Due to Rachels connection to Korvus through the sword, she discovers the Phoenix Force formerly in the blade is just an echo, a blue shadow , of the Force. The shadow of the Phoenix begins influencing Rachels behavior, causing her to design a new darker uniform and begin a romance with Korvus. Uncanny X-Men 481 She soon breaks off the relationship after she realizes their bond is only because of the residual Phoenix Force. X-Men: Emperor Vulcan 1     Leading up to the fight with Vulcan, Rachel is shown using her powers to kill the guards who stand in her way. Havok warns her not to, but Rachel tells him that they deserve to die after what they did to her family. When it comes to the big fight, Rachel shows just how powerful she is by protecting Korvus from one of Vulcans blasts. Rachel is one of the X-Men stranded in Shiar space when their ship is sent back to Earth.     After the death of her other grandfather, Corsair, at the hands of Vulcan, she, along with Havok, Polaris, Korvus, Chod, and Raza, become the new Starjammers. They elect to remain in Shiar space and restore  |Lilandra|Lilandra_Neramani|  to the throne or die trying. As her uncle states, If they fail, he has no doubt that Vulcan will head for Earth. Uncanny X-Men 486       During the conflict, the  |Starjammers|Starjammers|  find another threat in the form of the Scyar Tal . Rachel makes contact with the eldest Scyar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scyar Tal were originally called the MKraan. Early in their history, the Shiar attacked them, killing a great number of their people and making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shiar settled on their planet, took the MKraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the MKraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities,  |Sharra|Sharra|  and  |Kythri|Kythri| . The MKraan then changed their name to Scyar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shiar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feathers Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan made contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.     During the ceasefire, Rachel comes into contact with the Death Commandos again and attempts to kill them to avenge the deaths of her relatives; however, she is deterred by Polaris. At the end, all the Starjammers are captured by the Shiar except Rachel, Korvus, and Lilandra.       Rachel and the Starjammers play a large role in the sequel to the Emperor Vulcan miniseries called X-Men: Kingbreaker.  She is also seen prominently in the  |War_of_Kings|War_Of_Kings|  storyline, which features Vulcan, the  |Inhumans|Inhumans| ,  |Nova|Nova| , and the  |Guardians_of_the_Galaxy|Guardians_Of_The_Galaxy| .      While with the Starjammers, in battle with Vulcans new guard, the fragment of the blue Phoenix within her and Korvus blade mysteriously leaves them. After the Phoenix echo leaves Rachel, she says please... not now.... Mom. From this frame onward, the hound markings reappear on Rachels face. X-Men: Kingbreaker 4     In agreement with the Inhumans, the Starjammers and the Guardians of the Galaxy assault a Shiar vessel in order to free Lilandra, hoping to end the conflict while restoring her to the throne. Even without her Phoenix powers, Rachel is powerful enough to entrap Gladiator in an illusion in order to keep him distracted from battle. Their gambit pays off and the group is able to free Lilandra.     Rachel is next seen as Lilandras bodyguard along with the rest of the Starjammers. On the home planet of the Shiar, Lilandra assumes her throne, but while making a ceremonial gesture is killed by the murderer known as Razor, who possesses the  |Darkhawk|Darkhawk|  armor. The only person who perceives this is Rachel, since Razor is shielded from the perceptions of others. War of Kings 4     After Lilandra is assassinated, Rachel fights alongside the Starjammers against the Shiar Guard and Araki, who has summoned the same Shiar commandos that killed Rachels family and branded her with the Shiar death mark. Rachel uses her powers to implode Black Cloaks head, saying, He was the one... He killed my family, though killing him does not make her feel happier. Gladiator finishes the job by killing Araki himself. Rachel, along with the rest of the Starjammers, regroup later on and mourn the Shiar, as they doubt that they will recover from this war. War of Kings 5       It is known through  |Chod|Chod| , and apparently due to the incident where she and Korvus both lost the connection to the Phoenix Force, that Rachel and Korvus, along with  |Havok|Havok|  and  |Polaris|Polaris| , have departed for Earth. Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard 2       While on the way back to Earth, Rachel attempted to contact Professor Xavier or Emma Frost with a message. However at that moment, Moira warped reality taking Rachels mind with it creating the amnesic Revenant. Once reality was restored, Rachels mind is separated from her body which according to her is half a universe away . Because of Moiras actions, Rachel no longer remembers the message and her mind retains the form of her Age of X counterpart. Scott promised her that they would return her home. X-Men: Legacy 248       Being actually a mental manifestation, Rachel soon began fading. She asks Rogue to connect with her to see what will happen. When the two of them touch, Rogue sees a vision of where Rachel, Havok and Polaris are as Rachel then returns to her body. When she awakens she is met by an unseen villain holding a gun and telling her he has killed her friends. X-Men: Legacy 250     Borrowing one of  |Legions|Legion|  manifold powers,  |Rogue|Rogue|  teleports alongside  |Gambit|Gambit| ,  |Magneto|Magneto|  and  |Frenzy|Joanna_Cargill|  to rescue their teammates on the other side of the galaxy. Once there, Rachel is retrieved from a band of pirates as Rogue becomes their new leader. The remaining X-Men discover theyve arrived at a space station called Gul Damar which is in a state of upheaval due to the rebellion of insectoid creatures called Grad Nan Holt against their  |Shiar|Shiar|  enslavers. They are also being pulled into an exploding sun and the entire civil war is revealed to be orchestrated by a powerful Grad Nan Holt telepath known as Friendless. A number of battles with the creature proves unsuccessful for Rachel, but with the combined efforts of Rogue and the X-Men they are able to defeat him and return home via the wormhole that was created from the collapsing star. X-Men: Legacy 254–258     Rachel as part of a team of Wolverines X-Men attempted to psychically battle Exodus in an attempt to prevent the assassination of Cyclops. The team is eventually beaten and the X-Men are saved by Generation Hope. X-Men: Legacy 263     Rachel is then invited to hold a position as senior staff member of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, which was rebuilt from the Xavier Institute and has Wolverine as acting Headmaster and Kitty Pryde as Headmistress. X-Men: Regenesis Wolverine and the X-Men 1       During the events of AVX, when the X-Men on Utopia escape from the invading Avengers, Rachel contacts Cyclops to provide Hopes location. Avengers vs. X-Men 3 Afterwards, Rachel states that she knows the Phoenix Force better than anyone else on Earth and that she is living proof that it can be controlled. She also says that if the Phoenix has chosen her and that is the destiny that Hope wants, she will do everything in her power to help her. She and Iceman tell Wolverine at the school that they are going to help Cyclops in the battle. Wolverine and the X-Men 10 However, when Cyclops and Emma Frost begin to be corrupted by the Phoenixs power, she, like the other X-Men, decide to oppose their rule. Rachel then battled against Cyclops and helped both the Avengers and X-Men in the final battle.       In 2013, Marvel revealed an all new all female series simply named  X-Men . Written by Brian Wood with art by Olivier Coipel, X-Men will feature an all female cast including Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke.      The X-Men are in pursuit of  |Arkea|Arkea|  who has attempted to revive the X-Mens long lost enemies. The X-Men are attacked by the newly formed Sisterhood and Rachel is telepathically locked down by  |Madelyne_Pryor|Madelyne_Pryor| . Storm strikes a deal for Rachels freedom allowing Madelyne and Selene to walk free. X-Men v4 12     In the AXIS story arc, Storm sends the entire student body against the Red Onslaught in an attempt to save Earth. Rachel is shown to be reverted to her hound form by Dr. Doom and Wanda Maximoffs spell. Deadpool 38     Rachel is part of Storms team of Amazing X-Men who attempts to stop the Living Monolith from becoming the new Juggernaut. Amazing X-Men 15     Rachel Grey is distrusting of Spider-Mans newly appointed position as Jean Grey School guidance counseller. Using her telepathy she seeks to expose his secret identity only to lose that memory by being mind-wiped by Martha Johansson. Spider-Man and the X-Men 1-5     Rachel is shown as a teacher at the Jean Grey Institute in the battle against Kenji. Storm 10       When Kitty Pryde returns from space to lead the X-Men, Rachel joins her team in X-Men Gold and adopts the unique, new code name Prestige.        Rachel possesses various  |psionic|Psionics|  abilities, generally exhibited through  |telepathy|Telepathy| ,  |psychometry|Psychometry| ,  |telekinesis|Psychokinesis| , and limited time manipulation.       Marvel Girls virtually unlimited telepathy allows her to receive, broadcast, and manipulate  |cognitive_processes|Cognition|  in an intricate manner. Examples of Rachels aptitudes for this include creating durable mind-links across distances, projecting blasts of psionic energy that disrupt aspects of brain functioning, shielding her mind from other telepaths, creating illusions, and rendering someone imperceptible to the five senses. In addition, Rachel has demonstrated the ability to telepathically suppress superpowers; control, repair, and exchange minds; as well as safely editing memories. Rachel has also harnessed her telepathy to sense, locate, and track other sentient beings based on their thought patterns, but has a moral apprehension about using this skill due to her experiences as a Hound.     It has been suggested that Rachels telepathy, although immeasurable in raw power, is mitigated by her limited training and finesse.  |Emma_Frost|Emma_Frost|  was able to outflank an incredulous Rachel in a contest on the  |astral_plane|Astral_Plane| . In the same issue, Emma offered her educative services; and later still, Rachel received training from  |Professor_Charles_Xavier|Professor_X|  , giving her access to his vast knowledge and expertise in telepathy. Uncanny X-Men 475–486       By using telekinesis, Marvel Girl can remotely manipulate matter even on a sub-atomic level. She can channel this ability to create protective force fields and blasts of concussive force. By using her telekinesis to levitate herself, Marvel Girl can fly at incredible speeds. Rachel has been able to create a micro  |black_hole|Black_Hole| , Uncanny X-Men 447 levitate an entire city for a time,  Cable and Deadpool  10 sustain shields that withstood Jovian atmospheric pressures, Uncanny X-Men 449 and direct blows from Thors hammer, Mjolnir. Wolverine and the X-Men 12 Moreover, Rachels telekinetic fine-motor control has allowed her to alter molecular valences, X-Treme X-Men 44 mentally alter clothing with ease, Excalibur 20 create a telekinetic/psionic sword , Uncanny X-Men 464 a telekinetic hammer powerful enough to knock Thor off his feet, and even rewrite human genomes. Uncanny X-Men 459     While all depictions portray Rachel as an extremely powerful telekinetic, the limitations of her hard-psi capabilities have been somewhat inconsistent. Some instances have depicted Rachels telekinetic potential to be nigh-unlimited, whereas others have shown her struggling against, and even outmatched by, lesser developed telekinetics such as Psylocke.       Marvel Girl utilizes her psionic talents in conjunction with her ability to manipulate time in a variety of ways. Chronoskimming describes her ability to temporarily transplant a persons mind and send it through time into a younger/older version, a close ancestor/descendant, or as a disembodied astral form.   Rachel unconsciously emanates a fourth dimensional pulse, effectively creating a chrono-shield that protects her from changes in the timeline. Excalibur 50 She can also sense and manipulate residual psychic energy in the form of  |psychometry|Psychometry| .  Marvel Knights Spider-Man  6 X-Men: Deadly Genesis 2            When Rachel was bonded to the cosmic entity known as the  |Phoenix_Force|Phoenix_Force| , she demonstrated heightened psi-powers, the ability to manipulate energy and life-forces, and limited cosmic awareness. The Uncanny X-Men 202–203 X-Men: Phoenix 1–3 Excalibur 61 Rachels connection to the Phoenix power was lost in the distant future and did not return with her when she traveled back to the early 21st century of Earth-616 . Cable 85–86     Most recently, Marvel Girl absorbed a residual echo of the Phoenix Force left in the sword of a previous host, a Shiar named Rookshir. Uncanny X-Men 479 It was revealed that this energy source was a less powerful form of the Phoenix Force. The echo was powerful enough to allow Rachel to survive in and fly through the vacuum of space without the need for additional protection, as well as being able to hold her own in combat against the tremendous physical power of  |Gladiator|Gladiator| . X-Men: Emperor Vulcan 5 These demonstrations were short lived, however, due to its disappearance, which Rachel attributes to Jean Grey. She now exhibits her standard power levels. War of Kings 1–6       As a host for the Phoenix Force, Rachel manifested the cosmic firebird in displays of great power. During her 2000s Uncanny X-Men appearances, Marvel Girl also exhibited a Phoenix emblem over her left eye whenever she demonstrated psionic feats. Uncanny X-Men 444 It was at first accompanied by a shadow form . However, the illustration of this shadow form ceased without explanation. Uncanny X-Men 472–474 After regaining a small portion of the Phoenix Force , the emblem over her eye changed from a gold Phoenix shape to a static version made of electric blue flame. Her display of power was once more altered in X-Men: Emperor Vulcan 3, where she produced the familiar fiery  |raptor|Bird_Of_Prey|  with which the Phoenix Force is commonly associated .       At times, Rachel has been shown to learn new skills extremely quickly. For example, she mastered a set of demon ninja sword skills simply by watching her teammate Shadowcat perform them. Excalibur 16 Along with sword fighting, Rachel has experience in lock-picking, vehicular repair , and use of advanced technology and weaponry. X-Men: Phoenix Force Handbook However, these abilities have not been evident in her more recent appearances.       Rachels power level and scope of abilities have been inconsistently described by writers over the years. However, she is usually depicted with virtually unlimited potential in her dual psionic talents. X-Men: The 198 Files In most cases, she displayed greater feats as the Phoenix Uncanny X-Men 208 and even matched  |Gladiators|Gladiator|  strength with the aid of a Phoenix echo . Rachel is considered by many to be an  |Omega-level_mutant|Omega-Level_Mutant|  , but the only literary reference to this attribute is when the future Sentinel,  |Nimrod|Nimrod| , classified Rachel as an Omega class subject several years before the term was established in Marvel canon.     Even with the omnipotent strength of the Phoenix, magic and magical objects are able to resist Rachels powers. When the  |Soulsword|Soulsword|  appeared near the  |Excalibur|Excalibur|  lighthouse headquarters seeking  |Kitty_Pryde|Kitty_Pryde|  to become its new wielder, Rachel attempted to remove it from bedrock to alleviate her friends apprehension. Despite using the full extent of power permitted by the Phoenix Force, Rachel was unable to remove the sword, surmising that only Kitty could remove it. Excalibur 7       In the very first issue of the Uncanny X-Men story arc Season of the Witch , Rachel and  |Psylocke|Psylocke|  were transported to the  |White_Hot_Room|Mkraan_Crystalwhite_Hot_Room|  as an indirect result of the reality-shift performed by a mentally unstable  |Scarlet_Witch|Scarlet_Witch| . House of M 1 While there, it was established that the Rachel appearing in  |Earth-616|Earth-616|  has no true alternate counterparts within the Marvel multiverse. Rather, all other incarnations of Rachel Summers that exist in parallel timelines are linked only by having the same name, or attributes.       The subsequent issues had Rachel and Psylocke return to their dimension and thus be engrossed in the Scarlet Witchs reconstruction of the world. In this reality, Rachel was the bodyguard and traveling companion to Psylocke, who was crowned British royalty after her brother, Brian, became ruler of all England. Rachel then became involved with  |Captain_Britains|Captain_Britain|  mission to seal the breach in reality that was created by the Scarlet Witchs manipulations. Uncanny X-Men 465       In at least three alternate future timelines derived from Days of Future Past , a Rachel Summers married  |Franklin_Richards|Franklin_Richards|  and procreated mutant children. One such child was the time-traveling supervillain  |Hyperstorm|Hyperstorm|  . Hyperstorm was responsible for causing the  |Fantastic_Four|Fantastic_Four|  to think that  |Mister_Fantastic|Mister_Fantastic|  and  |Doctor_Doom|Doctor_Doom|  were dead; he was only defeated when he was trapped in another dimension by  |Galactus|Galactus| . The second child was Dream Summers, who possessed  |empathic|Empathy|  superpowers. She was a superhero who appeared in the Spider-Man/X-Men: Times Arrow trilogy of novels . In a third reality, they produced a child named David Richards, who was rescued from a concentration camp by the interdimensional traveling  |Exiles|Exiles|  and raised by the  |Age_of_Apocalypse|Age_Of_Apocalypse|  version of  |Sabretooth|Sabretooth| .
