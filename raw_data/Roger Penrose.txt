      Sir Roger Penrose  is an English  |mathematical_physicist|Mathematical_Physicist| ,  |mathematician|Mathematics|  and  |philosopher_of_science|Philosophy_Of_Science| . He is  |Emeritus|Emeritus| |Rouse_Ball_Professor_of_Mathematics|Rouse_Ball_Professor_Of_Mathematics|  at the  |University_of_Oxford|University_Of_Oxford|  and an emeritus fellow of  |Wadham_College|Wadham_College| , Oxford.     Penrose has made contributions to the mathematical physics of  |general_relativity|General_Relativity|  and  |cosmology|Physical_Cosmology| . He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988  |Wolf_Prize|Wolf_Prize|  for physics, which he shared with  |Stephen_Hawking|Stephen_Hawking|  for the  |Penrose–Hawking_singularity_theorems|Penrose–Hawking_Singularity_Theorems| .       Born in  |Colchester|Colchester| , Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of psychiatrist and geneticist  |Lionel_Penrose|Lionel_Penrose|  and Margaret Leathes, and the grandson of the  |physiologist|Physiologist| |John_Beresford_Leathes|John_Beresford_Leathes|  and his  |Russian|Russian_People|  wife, Sonia Marie Natanson,  who had left  |St._Petersburg|St._Petersburg|  in the late 1880s.  His uncle was artist  |Roland_Penrose|Roland_Penrose| , whose son with photographer  |Lee_Miller|Lee_Miller|  is  |Antony_Penrose|Antony_Penrose| . Penrose is the brother of physicist  |Oliver_Penrose|Oliver_Penrose|  and of  |chess_Grandmaster|Grandmaster| |Jonathan_Penrose|Jonathan_Penrose| . Penrose attended  |University_College_School|University_College_School|  and  |University_College,_London|University_College,_London| , where he graduated with a first class degree in mathematics. In 1955, while still a student, Penrose reintroduced the  |E._H._Moore|E._H._Moore|  generalised matrix inverse, also known as the  |Moore–Penrose_inverse|Moore–Penrose_Pseudoinverse| ,  after it had been reinvented by  |Arne_Bjerhammar|Arne_Bjerhammar|  in 1951. Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir  |W._V._D._Hodge|W._V._D._Hodge| , Penrose finished his PhD at  |St_Johns_College,_Cambridge|St_Johns_College,_Cambridge|  in 1958, with a thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry under algebraist and geometer  |John_A._Todd|J._A._Todd| . He devised and popularised the  |Penrose_triangle|Penrose_Triangle|  in the 1950s, describing it as impossibility in its purest form , and exchanged material with the artist  |M._C._Escher|M._C._Escher| , whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Eschers  |Waterfall|Waterfall| , and  |Ascending_and_Descending|Ascending_And_Descending|  were in turn inspired by Penrose.     As reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:        Having become a  |reader|Reader|  at Birkbeck College, London  it was in 1964 that, in the words of  |Kip_Thorne|Kip_Thorne|  of Caltech, Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime . Until then work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einsteins equations to be soluble explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by the use of  |perturbation_theory|Perturbation_Theory| , as developed under the leadership of  |John_Archibald_Wheeler|John_Archibald_Wheeler|  at Princeton. The other, more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its  |conformal_structure|Conformal_Structure| , since it is the latter – as determined by the lay of the lightcones – that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penroses epoch-making paper Gravitational collapse and space-time singularities  was not only its result . It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang| , which he dealt with in collaboration with  |Dennis_Sciamas|Dennis_Sciama|  most famous student,  |Stephen_Hawking|Stephen_Hawking| .        It was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture, to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved  |event_horizon|Event_Horizon|  surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term  |black_hole|Black_Hole| , leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the  |Penrose_process|Penrose_Process| , while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as  |quasars|Quasars| .     Following up his weak  |cosmic_censorship_hypothesis|Cosmic_Censorship_Hypothesis|  , Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the strong censorship hypothesis . Together with the  |BKL_conjecture|Bkl_Conjecture|  and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in  |general_relativity|General_Relativity| . Also from 1979 dates Penroses influential  |Weyl_curvature_hypothesis|Weyl_Curvature_Hypothesis|  on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the  |second_law_of_thermodynamics|Second_Law_Of_Thermodynamics| .  Penrose and James Terrell independently realised that objects travelling near the speed of light will appear to undergo a peculiar skewing or rotation. This effect has come to be called the  |Terrell_rotation|Terrell_Rotation|  or Penrose–Terrell rotation.          In 1967, Penrose invented the  |twistor_theory|Twistor_Theory|  which maps geometric objects in  |Minkowski_space|Minkowski_Space|  into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature .      Penrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of  |Penrose_tilings|Penrose_Tiling| , which are formed from two tiles that can only  |tile|Tessellation|  the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. Penrose developed these ideas based on the article Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique Jaromír Korčák : Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique. Prague, Comité dorganisation, Bull. de lInstitute Intl de Statistique, vol. 3, pp. 295–299.  by Czech  |geographer|Geographer| ,  |demographer|Demographer|  and statistician Jaromír Korčák. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in  |quasicrystals|Quasicrystal| .  Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of  |spin_networks|Spin_Network| , which later came to form the geometry of  |spacetime|Spacetime|  in  |loop_quantum_gravity|Loop_Quantum_Gravity| . He was influential in popularising what are commonly known as  |Penrose_diagrams|Penrose_Diagram|  .     In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at  |Rice_University|Rice_University|  in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.        In 2004, Penrose released  The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe , a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the  |Laws_of_Physics|Physical_Law|  that includes an explanation of his own theory. The  |Penrose_Interpretation|Penrose_Interpretation|  predicts the relationship between  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  and  |general_relativity|General_Relativity| , and proposes that a  |quantum_state|Quantum_State|  remains in  |superposition|Quantum_Superposition|  until the difference of  |space-time_curvature|Space-Time_Curvature|  attains a significant level.       Penrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at  |Pennsylvania_State_University|Pennsylvania_State_University| .  He is also a member of the Editorial Board of The Astronomical Review and of the Advisory Board of Universe.            In 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in  |WMAP|Wmap|  data of the  |CMB|Cmb|  sky, of an earlier universe existing before the  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang|  of our own present universe.  He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book Cycles of Time, Roger Penrose, Cycles of Time, Vintage; Reprint edition a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with  |Einsteins_field_equations|Einsteins_Field_Equations| , the  |Weyl_curvature|Weyl_Curvature|  C, and the  |Weyl_curvature_hypothesis|Weyl_Curvature_Hypothesis|  , that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it. He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and he also popularized his  |conformal_cyclic_cosmology|Conformal_Cyclic_Cosmology|  theory.     In simple terms, he believes that the singularity in  |Einsteins_field_equation|Einsteins_Field_Equation|  at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the  |event_horizon|Event_Horizon|  of a  |black_hole|Black_Hole| . The latter singularity can be removed by a change of  |coordinate_system|Coordinate_System| , and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the  |Wheeler–DeWitt_equation|Wheeler–Dewitt_Equation| , which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the  |Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac_equations|Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac_Equations| .             Penrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human consciousness. In  The Emperors New Mind  , he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics . Penrose uses a variant of  |Turings_halting_theorem|Turings_Halting_Theorem|  to demonstrate that a system can be  |deterministic|Deterministic|  without being  |algorithm|Algorithm| ic.      Penrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical  |wave_function_reduction|Wave_Function_Collapse| , and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that computers today are unable to have intelligence because they are algorithmically deterministic systems. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of  |strong_artificial_intelligence|Computational_Theory_Of_Mind| , who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends  |formal_logic|Formal_Logic|  because things such as the insolubility of the  |halting_problem|Halting_Problem|  and  |Gödels_incompleteness_theorem|Gödels_Incompleteness_Theorem|  prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher  |John_Lucas|John_Lucas|  of  |Merton_College|Merton_College,_Oxford| ,  |Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| .     The  |Penrose–Lucas_argument|Penrose–Lucas_Argument|  about the implications of Gödels incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.   Criticism of the Lucas/Penrose argument that intelligence can not be entirely algorithmic:    .
