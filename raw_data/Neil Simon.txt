           Marvin Neil Simon was an American  |playwright|Playwright| ,  |screenwriter|Screenwriter|  and author. He wrote more than 30 plays and nearly the same number of movie screenplays, mostly adaptations of his plays. He received more combined  |Oscar|Academy_Award|  and  |Tony|Tony_Award|  nominations than any other writer.     Simon grew up in  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  during the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , with his parents financial hardships affecting their marriage, giving him a mostly unhappy and unstable childhood. He often took refuge in movie theaters where he enjoyed watching the early comedians like  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| . After graduating from high school and a few years in the Army Air Force Reserve, he began writing comedy scripts for radio and some popular early television shows. Among them were  |Sid_Caesars|Sid_Caesar|   Your Show of Shows  from 1950 , and  The Phil Silvers Show , which ran from 1955 to 1959.     He began writing his own plays beginning with  Come Blow Your Horn  , which took him three years to complete and ran for 678 performances on  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre| . It was followed by two more successful plays,  Barefoot in the Park  and  The Odd Couple  , for which he won a  |Tony_Award|Tony_Award| . It made him a national celebrity and the hottest new playwright on Broadway. During the 1960s to 1980s, he wrote both original screenplays and stage plays, with some films actually based on his plays. His style ranged from romantic comedy to farce to more serious dramatic comedy. Overall, he garnered 17 Tony nominations and won three. During one season, he had four successful plays running on Broadway at the same time, and in 1983 became the only living playwright to have a New York theatre, the  |Neil_Simon_Theatre|Neil_Simon_Theatre| , named in his honor.       Neil Simon was born on July 4, 1927, in  |The_Bronx|The_Bronx| ,  |New_York|New_York| , to  |Jewish|Jews|  parents. His father, Irving Simon, was a garment salesman, and his mother, Mamie Simon, was mostly a homemaker.  Simon had one older brother by eight years, television writer and comedy teacher  |Danny_Simon|Danny_Simon| . He grew up in  |Washington_Heights|Washington_Heights,_Manhattan| , Manhattan, during the period of the Great Depression, graduating from  |DeWitt_Clinton_High_School|Dewitt_Clinton_High_School|  when he was sixteen, where he was nicknamed Doc and described as extremely shy in the school yearbook.       Simons childhood was difficult and mostly unhappy due to his parents tempestuous marriage and financial hardship caused by the Depression. .  He would sometimes block out their arguments by putting a pillow over his ears at night.  His father often abandoned the family for months at a time, causing them further financial and emotional hardship. As a result, Simon and his brother Danny were sometimes forced to live with different relatives, or else their parents took in boarders for some income.      During an interview with writer  |Lawrence_Grobel|Lawrence_Grobel| , Simon stated: To this day I never really knew what the reason for all the fights and battles were about between the two of them  ... Shed hate him and be very angry, but he would come back and she would take him back. She really loved him.   Simon states that among the reasons he became a writer was to fulfill his need to be independent of such emotional family issues, a need he recognized when he was seven or eight: Id better start taking care of myself somehow  ... It made me strong as an independent person.      To escape difficulties at home he often took refuge in movie theaters, where he especially enjoyed comedies with silent stars like  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| ,  |Buster_Keaton|Buster_Keaton| , and  |Laurel_and_Hardy|Laurel_And_Hardy| . Simon recalls: I was constantly being dragged out of movies for laughing too loud.          Simon acknowledged these childhood movies as having inspired him to write comedy: I wanted to make a whole audience fall onto the floor, writhing and laughing so hard that some of them pass out. .  He appreciated Chaplins ability to make people laugh and made writing comedy his long-term goal, and also saw it as a way to connect with people. I was never going to be an athlete or a doctor.  He began creating comedy for which he got paid while still in high school, when at the age of fifteen, Simon and his brother created a series of comedy sketches for employees at an annual department store event. And to help develop his writing skill, he often spent three days a week at the library reading books by famous humorists such as  |Mark_Twain|Mark_Twain| ,  |Robert_Benchley|Robert_Benchley| ,  |George_S._Kaufman|George_S._Kaufman|  and  |S._J._Perelman|S._J._Perelman| .      Soon after graduating from high school, he signed up with the  |Army_Air_Force_Reserve|United_States_Army_Air_Forces|  at  |New_York_University|New_York_University| , and was eventually sent to  |Colorado|Colorado|  as a corporal. It was during those years in the Reserve that Simon began writing, starting as a sports editor. He was assigned to  |Lowry_Air_Force_Base|Lowry_Air_Force_Base|  during 1945 and attended the  |University_of_Denver|University_Of_Denver|  from 1945 to 1946.              Simon quit his job as a mailroom clerk in the  |Warner_Brothers|Warner_Bros.|  offices in  |Manhattan|Manhattan|  to write radio and television scripts with his brother  |Danny_Simon|Danny_Simon| , including tutelage by radio humourist  |Goodman_Ace|Goodman_Ace|  when Ace ran a short-lived writing workshop for CBS. They wrote for the radio series The Robert Q. Lewis Show, which led to other writing jobs.  |Max_Liebman|Max_Liebman|  hired the duo for his popular television comedy series  Your Show of Shows , for which he earned two  |Emmy_Award|Emmy_Award|  nominations. He later wrote scripts for  The Phil Silvers Show ; the episodes were broadcast during 1958 and 1959.     Simon credited these two latter writing jobs for their importance to his career, having stated that between the two of them, I spent five years and learned more about what I was eventually going to do than in any other previous experience.  He added, I knew when I walked into Your Show of Shows, that this was the most talented group of writers that up until that time had ever been assembled together.  Simon described a typical writing session with the show:           Simon incorporated some of their experiences into his play  Laughter on the 23rd Floor  . A 2001 TV adaptation of the play won him two Emmy Award nominations. The first Broadway show Simon wrote for was Catch a Star! , collaborating on sketches with his brother, Danny.         During 1961, Simons first Broadway play,  Come Blow Your Horn , ran for 678 performances at the  |Brooks_Atkinson_Theatre|Brooks_Atkinson_Theatre| . Simon took three years to write that first play, partly because he was also working on writing television scripts. He rewrote the play at least twenty times from beginning to end:  It was the lack of belief in myself. I said, This isnt good enough. Its not right.  ... It was the equivalent of three years of college.  That play, besides being a monumental effort for Simon, was a turning point in his career: The theater and I discovered each other.       After  Barefoot in the Park  and  The Odd Couple  , for which he won a  |Tony_Award|Tony_Award| , he became a national celebrity and was considered the hottest new playwright on Broadway , writes Susan Koprince in her book on Simon.  Those successful productions were followed by others. During 1966, Simon had four shows playing at Broadway theatres simultaneously:  Sweet Charity ,   The Star-Spangled Girl ,   The Odd Couple   and  Barefoot in the Park .  His professional association with producer  |Emanuel_Azenberg|Emanuel_Azenberg|  began with  The Sunshine Boys  and continued with  The Good Doctor ,  Gods Favorite ,  Chapter Two ,  Theyre Playing Our Song ,  I Ought to Be in Pictures ,  Brighton Beach Memoirs ,  Biloxi Blues ,  Broadway Bound ,  Jakes Women ,  The Goodbye Girl  and  Laughter on the 23rd Floor , among others. His subjects ranged from serious to romantic comedy to more serious drama and less humor. Overall, he garnered seventeen Tony nominations and won three.      Simon also adapted material written by others for his plays, such as the musical  Little Me  from  |the_novel_by_Patrick_Dennis|Little_Me| ,  Sweet Charity  from a screenplay by  |Federico_Fellini|Federico_Fellini|  and others , and  Promises, Promises  from a film by  |Billy_Wilder|Billy_Wilder| ,  The Apartment . Simon was occasionally brought in as an uncredited script doctor to help hone the book for Broadway-bound plays or musicals under development  such as  A Chorus Line  .  During the 1970s, he wrote a string of successful plays, sometimes having more than one playing at the same time to standing room only audiences. And while he was by then recognized as one of the countrys leading playwrights, his inner drive kept him writing:        Simon also drew extensively on his own life and experience for his stories, with settings typically in working-class New York City neighborhoods, similar to ones in which he grew up. In 1983, he began writing the first of three autobiographical plays,  Brighton Beach Memoirs  ,  Biloxi Blues  and  Broadway Bound  . With them, he received his greatest critical acclaim. After his follow-up play,  Lost in Yonkers  , Simon was awarded a  |Pulitzer_Prize|Pulitzer_Prize| .       Simon also wrote screenplays for more than twenty films, and he received four  |Academy_Award|Academy_Award|  nominations for his screenplays. Some of his screenplays are adaptations of his own plays, along with some original work, including  The Out-of-Towners ,  Murder by Death  and  The Goodbye Girl . Although most of his films were successful, movies were always secondary in importance to him to his plays:           Simon chose not to write the screenplay for the first film adaptation of his work,  Come Blow Your Horn  , preferring to focus on his playwriting. However, he was disappointed with the film, and tried to control his film screenplays thereafter. Many of his earlier screenplays were similar to the play, a characteristic Simon observed in hindsight: I really didnt have an interest in films then , he explains. I was mainly interested in continuing writing for the theater  ... The plays never became cinematic .   The Odd Couple  , however, was a highly successful early adaptation, both faithful to the stage play, but also opened out, having more scenic variety.        Theater critic  |John_Lahr|John_Lahr|  describes Simons primary theme as being about the silent majority , many of whom are frustrated, edgy, and insecure . Simons characters are also portrayed as likable and easy for audiences to identify with, often having difficult relationships in marriage, friendship or business, as they struggle to find a sense of belonging .  There is always an implied seeking for solutions to human problems through relationships with other people Simon is able to deal with serious topics of universal and enduring concern , writes biographer Edythe McGovern, while still making people laugh.      She adds that one of Simons hallmarks is his great compassion for his fellow human beings,  an opinion similar to that of author Alan Cooper, who states that Simons plays are essentially about friendships, even when they are about marriage or siblings or crazy aunts  ...      Many of Simons plays are set in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , which gives them an urban flavor. Within that setting, Simons themes, besides marital conflict, sometimes include infidelity, sibling rivalry, adolescences, bereavement, and fear of aging. And despite the serious nature of the themes, Simon continually managed to tell the stories with humor, developing the theme to include both realism and comedy.  Simon said he would tell aspiring comedy playwrights not to try to make it funny  ... try and make it real and then the comedy will come.      When I was writing plays, he says, I was almost always writing a drama that was funny  ... I wanted to tell a story about real people.  Simon explained how he managed this combination:        In marriage relationships, his comedies often portray these struggles with plots of marital difficulties or fading love, sometimes leading to separation, divorce and child custody battles. Their endings typically conclude, after many twists in the plot, to renewal of the relationships.      Politics seldom have any overt role in Simons stories, and his characters avoid confronting society despite their personal problems. Simon is simply interested in showing human beings as they are—with their foibles, eccentricities, and absurdities.  Drama critic  |Richard_Eder|Richard_Eder|  noted that Simons popularity relies on his ability to portray a painful comedy, where characters say and do funny things in extreme contrast to the unhappiness they are feeling.      Simons plays are generally semi-autobiographical, often portraying aspects of his troubled childhood and first marriages. According to Koprince, Simons plays also invariably depict the plight of white middle-class Americans, most of whom are New Yorkers and many of whom are Jewish, like himself.  He states, I suppose you could practically trace my life through my plays.  In plays such as Lost in Yonkers, Simon suggests the necessity of a loving marriage, opposite to that of his parents, and when children are deprived of it in their home, they end up emotionally damaged and lost .      One of the key influences on Simon is his Jewish heritage, says Koprince, although he is unaware of it when writing. For example, in the Brighton Beach trilogy, she explains, the lead character is a master of self-deprecating humor, cleverly poking fun at himself and at his Jewish culture as a whole.  Simon himself has said that his characters are people who often self-deprecating and usually see life from the grimmest point of view,  explaining, I see humor in even the grimmest of situations. And I think its possible to write a play so moving it can tear you apart and still have humor in it. This theme in writing, notes Koprince, belongs to a tradition of Jewish humor  ... a tradition which values laughter as a defense mechanism and which sees humor as a healing, life-giving force.        Simons characters are typically portrayed as imperfect, unheroic figures who are at heart decent human beings , according to Koprince, and she traces Simons style of comedy to that of  |Menander|Menander| , a playwright of ancient Greece. Menander, like Simon, also used average people in domestic life settings, the stories also blending humor and tragedy into his themes.  Many of Simons most memorable plays are built around two-character scenes, as in segments of California Suite and Plaza Suite.     Before writing, Simon tries to create an image of his characters. He said that the play  Star Spangled Girl , which was a box-office failure, was the only play I ever wrote where I did not have a clear visual image of the characters in my mind as I sat down at the typewriter.  Simon considered character building an obligation, stating that the trick is to do it skillfully .  While other writers have created vivid characters, they have not created nearly as many as Simon did: Simon has no peers among contemporary comedy playwrights, stated biographer Robert Johnson.      Simons characters often amuse the audience with sparkling zingers, believable due to Simons skill with writing dialogue. He reproduces speech so adroitly that his characters are usually plausible and easy for audiences to identify with and laugh at.  His characters may also express serious and continuing concerns of mankind  ... rather than purely topical material .  McGovern notes that his characters are always impatient with phoniness, with shallowness, with amorality , adding that they sometimes express implicit and explicit criticism of modern urban life with its stress, its vacuity, and its materialism.  However, Simons characters are never seen thumbing their noses at society.        The key aspect most consistent in Simons writing style is comedy, situational and verbal, and presents serious subjects in a way that makes audiences laugh to avoid weeping.  He achieved this with rapid-fire jokes and wisecracks,  in a wide variety of urban settings and stories.  This creates a sophisticated, urban humor , says editor Kimball King, and results in plays that represent middle America.  Simon created everyday, apparently simple conflicts with his stories, which became comical premises for problems which needed be solved.      Another feature of his writing is his adherence to traditional values regarding marriage and family.  McGovern states that this thread of the monogamous family runs through most of Simons work, and is one he feels is necessary to give stability to society.  Some critics have therefore described his stories as somewhat old fashioned, although Johnson points out that most members of his audiences are delighted to find Simon upholding their own beliefs.  And where infidelity is the theme in a Simon play, rarely, if ever, do those characters gain happiness: In Simons eyes, adds Johnson, divorce is never a victory.      Another aspect of Simons style is his ability to combine both comedy and drama. Barefoot in the Park, for example, is a light romantic comedy, while portions of Plaza Suite were written as farce , and portions of California Suite are high comedy .      Simon was willing to experiment and take risks, often moving his plays in new and unexpected directions. In  The Gingerbread Lady , he combined comedy with tragedy;  Rumors  is a full-length farce; in  Jakes Women  and  Brighton Beach Memoirs  he used dramatic narration; in  The Good Doctor , he created a pastiche of sketches around various stories by  |Chekhov|Chekhov| ; and  Fools  , was written as a fairy-tale romance similar to stories by  |Sholem_Aleichem|Sholem_Aleichem| .  Although some of these efforts failed to win approval from many critics, Koprince claims that they nonetheless demonstrate Simons seriousness as a playwright and his interest in breaking new ground.        During most of his career Simons work received mixed reviews, with many critics admiring his comedy skills, much of it a blend of humor and pathos .  Other critics were less complimentary, noting that much of his dramatic structure was weak and sometimes relied too heavily on gags and one-liners. As a result, notes Kopince, literary scholars had generally ignored Simons early work, regarding him as a commercially successful playwright rather than a serious dramatist.   |Clive_Barnes|Clive_Barnes| , theater critic for The New York Times, wrote that like his British counterpart  |Noël_Coward|Noël_Coward| , Simon was destined to spend most of his career underestimated , but nonetheless very popular .         This attitude changed after 1991, when he won a Pulitzer Prize for drama with  Lost in Yonkers . McGovern writes that seldom has even the most astute critic recognized what depths really exist in the plays of Neil Simon.  Although, when Lost in Yonkers was considered by the Pulitzer Advisory Board, board member Douglas Watt noted that it was the only play nominated by all five jury members, and that they judged it a mature work by an enduring American playwright.      McGovern compares Simon with noted earlier playwrights, including  |Ben_Jonson|Ben_Jonson| ,  |Molière|Molière| , and  |George_Bernard_Shaw|George_Bernard_Shaw| , pointing out that those playwrights had successfully raised fundamental and sometimes tragic issues of universal and therefore enduring interest without eschewing the comic mode. She concludes, It is my firm conviction that Neil Simon should be considered a member of this company  ... an invitation long overdue.  McGovern attempts to explain the response of many critics:        Similarly, literary critic Robert Johnson explains that Simons plays have given us a rich variety of entertaining, memorable characters who portray the human experience, often with serious themes. Although his characters are more lifelike, more complicated and more interesting than most of the characters audiences see on stage, Simon has not received as much critical attention as he deserves.  Lawrence Grobel, in fact, calls him the Shakespeare of his time , and possibly the most successful playwright in history.  He states:     Broadway critic  |Walter_Kerr|Walter_Kerr|  tries to rationalize why Simons work has been underrated:            Simon was married five times. He was married to dancer Joan Baim for 20 years and had two children. Simon became a widower when Baim died of bone cancer. Simon married actress  |Marsha_Mason|Marsha_Mason|  , actress Diane Lander in two separate marriages , and actress  |Elaine_Joyce|Elaine_Joyce|  .  He was the father of Nancy and Ellen, from his first marriage, and Bryn, Landers daughter from a previous relationship, whom he adopted.     Simons nephew is U.S. District Judge  |Michael_H._Simon|Michael_H._Simon|  and his niece-in-law is U.S. Congresswoman  |Suzanne_Bonamici|Suzanne_Bonamici| .      Simon was on the board of selectors of  |Jefferson_Awards_for_Public_Service|Jefferson_Awards_For_Public_Service| .      In 2004, Simon received a kidney transplant from his long-time friend and publicist Bill Evans.      Neil Simon died on August 26, 2018, after being on life support while hospitalized for  |renal_failure|Renal_Failure| .  He also had  |Alzheimers_disease|Alzheimers_Disease| .  He was 91. The cause of death was complications of  |pneumonia|Pneumonia| , according to his publicist, Bill Evans. Simon died around 1 a.m. Sunday at  |New_York-Presbyterian_Hospital|New_York-Presbyterian_Hospital|  in New York City.        Simon held three  |honorary_degrees|Honorary_Degree| ; a  |Doctor_of_Humane_Letters|Doctor_Of_Humane_Letters|  from  |Hofstra_University|Hofstra_University| , a  |Doctor_of_Letters|Doctor_Of_Letters|  from  |Marquette_University|Marquette_University|  and a  |Doctor_of_Law|Doctor_Of_Law|  from  |Williams_College|Williams_College| .  In 1983 Simon became the only living playwright to have a New York City theatre named after him.  The Alvin Theatre on Broadway was renamed the  |Neil_Simon_Theatre|Neil_Simon_Theatre|  in his honor, and he was an honorary member of the  |Walnut_Street_Theatres|Walnut_Street_Theatre|  board of trustees. Also in 1983, Simon was inducted into the  |American_Theater_Hall_of_Fame|American_Theater_Hall_Of_Fame| .      In 1965, he won the Tony Award for Best Playwright , and in 1975, a special Tony Award for his overall contribution to  |American_theater|Theater_In_America| .  Simon won the 1978 Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay for The Goodbye Girl.  For Brighton Beach Memoirs , he was awarded the  |New_York_Drama_Critics_Circle|New_York_Drama_Critics_Circle|  Award,  followed by another Tony Award for Best Play of 1985, Biloxi Blues. In 1991 he won the  |Pulitzer_Prize|Pulitzer_Prize|   along with the Tony Award for Lost in Yonkers .     The Neil Simon Festival  is a professional summer  |repertory_theatre|Repertory_Theatre|  devoted to preserving the works of Simon and his contemporaries. The Neil Simon Festival was founded by Richard Dean Bugg in 2003.      In 2006, Simon received the  |Mark_Twain_Prize_for_American_Humor|Mark_Twain_Prize_For_American_Humor| .
