In the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the  |bar|Bar_Association|  in another jurisdiction. However, under the  |American_Bar_Associations|American_Bar_Association| |Model_Rules_of_Professional_Conduct|American_Bar_Association_Model_Rules_Of_Professional_Conduct| , which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.
