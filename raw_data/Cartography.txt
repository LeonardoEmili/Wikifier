           Cartography  is the study and practice of making  |maps|Map| . Combining  |science|Science| ,  |aesthetics|Aesthetics| , and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.     The fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:   Set the maps agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped. This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as  |toponyms|Toponomy|  or political boundaries.   Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of  |map_projections|Map_Projection| .   Eliminate characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant to the maps purpose. This is the concern of  |generalization|Cartographic_Generalization| .   Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the concern of generalization.   Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience. This is the concern of  |map_design|Map_Design| .     Modern cartography constitutes many theoretical and practical foundations of  |geographic_information_systems|Geographic_Information_System| .                               What is the earliest known map is a matter of some debate, both because the term map is not well-defined and because some artifacts that might be maps might actually be something else.

About 1,100 of these are known to have survived: of these, some 900 are found illustrating manuscripts and the remainder exist as stand-alone documents. Woodward, p.  286           The  |Arab_geographer|Geography_In_Medieval_Islam| |Muhammad_al-Idrisi|Muhammad_Al-Idrisi|  produced his medieval atlas  Tabula Rogeriana  in 1154. By combining the knowledge of  |Africa|Africa| , the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| ,  |Europe|Europe| , and the  |Far_East|Far_East|  with the information he inherited from the classical geographers, he was able to write detailed descriptions of a multitude of countries. Along with the substantial text he had written, he created a world map influenced mostly by the Ptolemaic conception of the world, but with significant influence from multiple Arab geographers. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries. S. P. Scott , History of the Moorish Empire, pp. 461–462.  The map was divided into seven  |climatic|Climate|  zones, with detailed descriptions of each zone. As part of this work, a smaller, circular map was made depicting the south on top and Arabia in the center. Al-Idrisi also made an estimate of the circumference of the world, accurate to within 10%.           In the  |Age_of_Exploration|Age_Of_Exploration| , from the 15th century to the 17th century, European cartographers both copied earlier maps and drew their own, based on explorers observations and new  |surveying|Surveying|  techniques. The invention of the  |magnetic_compass|Magnetic_Compass| ,  |telescope|Telescope|  and  |sextant|Sextant|  enabled increasing accuracy.

Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the  |sinusoidal_projection|Sinusoidal_Projection|  and the  |Bonne_projection|Bonne_Projection| . The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.

URL :  ; DOI : 10.4000/cybergeo.3977      In 1569, mapmaker  |Gerardus_Mercator|Gerardus_Mercator|  first published  |a_map_based_on_his_Mercator_projection|Mercator_1569_World_Map| , which uses equally-spaced parallel vertical lines of longitude and parallel latitude lines spaced farther apart as they get farther away from the equator. By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word atlas to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earths creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.       In the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owners reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this,  towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art.  In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.     There were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:    General descriptions of the world   Navigation and wayfinding   Land surveying and property management     In medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power. Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.     In the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.       There were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance:  |woodcut|Woodcut|  and  |copper-plate_intaglio|Intaglio| , referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.     In woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesnt need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.     In intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.  The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map. Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a plate mark around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.  Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.     Whether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.     Both relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.       Lettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time. To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as  |cancellaresca|Italic_Script| . There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.       The first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information. Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.       Maps of the  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercators prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.     Due to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the Beaver Map was published in 1715 by  |Herman_Moll|Herman_Moll| . This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by  |Nicolas_de_Fer|Nicolas_De_Fer| . De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by  |Louis_Hennepin|Louis_Hennepin| , published in 1697, and  |François_Du_Creux|François_Du_Creux| , in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, After in the maps title or  |cartouche|Cartouche| . Map Imitation in , a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada               In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the  |compass|Compass|  and much later,  |magnetic_storage|Magnetic_Storage|  devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to  |store_and_manipulate_them_digitally|Digital_Mapping| .     Advances in mechanical devices such as the  |printing_press|Printing_Press| ,  |quadrant|Quadrant|  and  |vernier|Vernier_Scale| , allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data.  |Hartmann_Schedel|Hartmann_Schedel|  was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the  |telescope|Telescope| ,  |sextant|Sextant|  and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their  |latitude|Latitude|  by measuring angles to the  |North_Star|North_Star|  at night or the Sun at noon.     Advances in photochemical technology, such as the  |lithographic|Lithography|  and  |photochemical_processes|Photography| , make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.     In the 20th century,  |aerial_photography|Aerial_Photography| ,  |satellite_imagery|Satellite_Imagery| , and  |remote_sensing|Remote_Sensing|  provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite  |ground_tracks|Ground_Track|  for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.  Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of  |computers_and_peripherals|Computer_Hardware|  such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also  |digital_raster_graphic|Digital_Raster_Graphic| .     These days most commercial-quality maps are made using  |software|Software|  of three main types:  |CAD|Computer-Aided_Design| ,  |GIS|Geographic_Information_System|  and specialized illustration  |software|Software| . Spatial information can be stored in a  |database|Database| , from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.      |Field-rugged_computers|Rugged_Computer| ,  |GPS|Gps| , and  |laser_rangefinders|Laser_Rangefinder|  make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.             There are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a maps  |deconstruction|Deconstruction| . A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.     It is claimed that the Europeans promoted an  |epistemological|Epistemology|  understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.  An example of this understanding is that reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth… . 17th-century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.     A common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. There was a not cartography land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a sense of the other in relation to nonconforming maps.     Although cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographers black box always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making. For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps. This social play on cartographic knowledge …produces the order of features and the hierarchies of its practices. Michel Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences.

The depiction of Africa and the low latitudes in general on the  |Mercator_projection|Mercator_Projection|  has been interpreted as imperialistic and as symbolic of subjugation due to the diminished proportions of those regions compared to higher latitudes where the European powers were concentrated. Monmonier, Mark . Rhumb Lines and Map Wars: A Social History of the Mercator Projection p. 152. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.     Maps furthered imperialism and colonization of Africa in practical ways by showing basic information like roads, terrain, natural resources, settlements, and communities. Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the  |Berlin_Conference|Berlin_Conference|  of 1884–1885.     Before 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. dAnville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory. This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.                      In understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey|  are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000  |Ordnance_Survey|Ordnance_Survey|  maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.      |Thematic_cartography|Thematic_Map|  involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a  |dot_map|Thematic_Mapdot|  showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical  |choropleth|Choropleth_Map|  classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.     A third type of map is known as an orienteering, or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.        A  |topographic_map|Topographic_Map|  is primarily concerned with the  |topographic|Topography|  description of a place, including the use of  |contour_lines|Contour_Line|  showing elevation.  |Terrain|Terrain|  or relief can be shown in a variety of ways . In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate digital elevation models which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.       A  |topological_map|Topological_Map|  is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information.  |Becks|Harry_Beck| |London_Underground_map|Tube_Map|  is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of The Tube, it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the  |River_Thames|River_Thames| , letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.  Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.                |Arthur_H._Robinson|Arthur_H._Robinson| , an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed will be a cartographic failure. He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that map design is perhaps the most complex.  Robinson codified the mapmakers understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs.      From the very beginning of mapmaking, maps have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes .  The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term percipient refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson.  The principle of  |figure-ground|Figure-Ground_In_Map_Design|  refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the users experience and keep their attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.     Making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal.  |Alan_MacEachren|Alan_Maceachren|  explains that a well designed map is convincing because it implies authenticity .  An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the needed link necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.  p.  93     In the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the  |human_body|Human_Body|  to the  |virtual_worlds|Virtual_World|  of  |cyberspace|Cyberspace| . Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map – for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by  |public_transport|Public_Transport|  organisations to guide  |passengers|Passenger| , namely  |urban_rail_and_metro_maps|Urban_Rail_And_Metro_Maps| , many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by  |Harry_Beck|Harry_Beck|  and  |George_Dow|George_Dow| .          Most maps use text to  |label|Labeling|  places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name Germany for that country, while a German map would use Deutschland and a French map Allemagne. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an  |exonym|Exonym| .     In some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to  |Myanmar|Myanmar| , but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use Burma. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of Saigon for  |Ho_Chi_Minh_City|Ho_Chi_Minh_City| , Bangkok for  |Krung_Thep|Bangkok|  and Ivory Coast for  |Côte_dIvoire|Ivory_Coast| .     Difficulties arise when  |transliteration|Transliteration|  or  |transcription|Transcription|  between  |writing_systems|Writing_System|  is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as Russia or Rußland for Росси́я, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno only as Leghorn when road signs and railway timetables show it as Livorno . In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the  |Cyrillic|Cyrillic|  letter Р is usually written as R in the  |Latin_script|Latin_Script| , although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of  |Arabic|Arabic_Script| , but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of  |Mocha|Mocha,_Yemen|  is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukhā, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the  |Pinyin|Pinyin|  phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as  |Wade-Giles|Wade-Giles| , resulting in the city being spelled Beijing on newer English maps and Peking on older ones.     Further difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both Brussel and Bruxelles. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages.  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia|  is also officially named la Colombie-Britannique. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled Québec in French.      The study of placenames is called  |toponymy|Toponymy| , while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is  |etymology|Etymology| .     In order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is  |Lance_Wymans|Lance_Wyman|  early plans for the  |Mexico_City_Metro|Mexico_City_Metro| , on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the  |Washington_Metro|Washington_Metro| , though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are  |Fukuoka|Fukuoka| ,  |Guadalajara|Guadalajara|  and  |Monterrey|Monterrey| .       Cartographic  |symbology|Symbology|  encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.     A map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. Some examples are:   A  |legend,_or_key|Map_Key_Or_Legend| , explains the maps pictorial language.   A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.   A neatline frames the entire map image.   A  |compass_rose|Compass_Rose|  or north arrow provides orientation.   An overview map gives global context for the primary map.   A  |bar_scale|Bar_Scale|  translates between map measurements and real distances.   A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.     The map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.      |Map_coloring|Map_Coloring|  is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color schemes structure can critically affect the readers ability to understand the maps information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the  |gamut|Gamut|  that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.     Quantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenons magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics.  |Choropleth_maps|Choropleth_Map|  portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.            The map key, or legend, describes how to interpret the maps symbols and may give details of publication and authorship.               Most maps label features so that the map reader can know features names. For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book. Jill Saligoe-Simmel, Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the features category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.          A good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest  in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the  |Ordnance_Surveys|Ordnance_Survey|  first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from  |ground_truth|Ground_Truth| , when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.            The Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.  The mapmaker must choose a suitable map projection according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.       Some maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as  |propaganda|Cartographic_Propaganda|  or as a  |watermark|Watermark|  to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled  |trap_streets|Trap_Streets|  .  Other names and forms for this are  |paper_townsites|Paper_Townsite| ,  |fictitious_entries|Fictitious_Entry| , and copyright  |easter_eggs|Easter_Egg| .      Another motive for deliberate errors is cartographic vandalism : a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the  |Rocky_Mountains|Rocky_Mountains| |continental_divide|Continental_Divide|  that appeared on a  |Boulder_County,_Colorado|Boulder_County,_Colorado|  map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.      |Sandy_Island|Sandy_Island| .
