Remembering the suits and rankings of the tiles is easier if one understands the Chinese names of the tiles and the symbolism behind them. The military tiles are named and ranked according to the total points on the tiles. For example, the nines rank higher than the eights .     The military tiles are also considered to be five mixed pairs . Among the military tiles, individual tiles of the same pair rank equally. The 2-4 and 1-2 are an odd pair. They are the only tiles in the whole set that dont match other tiles in the normal sense. This pair when played together is considered a suit on its own, called the gi jun . It is the highest ranking pair in the game of Pai Gow, though the tiles rank low individually . When a tile of this pair is played individually in the game of Tien Gow, each takes its regular ranking among other military suit tiles according to the total points. The rankings of the individual tiles are similar in most games. However, the ranking of combination tiles is slightly different in Pai Gow and Tien Gow.     Using the same coloring scheme of the traditional Chinese dice, every half-domino with 1 or 4 pips has those pips colored red . The only exception is the pair of 6-6 tiles. Half of the pips on the 6-6 domino are colored red to make them stand out as the top ranking tiles.
