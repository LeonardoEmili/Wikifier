   In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a product is the result of  |multiplying|Multiplication| , or an expression that identifies  |factors|Divisor|  to be multiplied. Thus, for instance, 15 is the product of 3 and 5 , and x  is the product of x and .     The order in which  |real|Real_Number|  or  |complex|Complex_Number|  numbers are  |multiplied|Multiplied|  has no bearing on the product; this is known as the  |commutative_law|Commutativity|  of multiplication. When  |matrices|Matrix|  or members of various other  |associative_algebras|Associative_Algebra|  are multiplied, the product usually depends on the order of the factors. Matrix multiplication, for example, and multiplication in other algebras is in general non-commutative.     There are many different kinds of products in mathematics: besides being able to multiply just numbers, polynomials or matrices, one can also define products on many different  |algebraic_structures|Algebraic_Structure| . An overview of these different kinds of products is given here.                   Placing several stones into a rectangular pattern with r rows and s columns gives     : r   s   r     s       stones. Another approach to multiplication that applies also to real numbers is continuously stretching the number line from , so that the  is stretched to the one factor, and looking up the product, where the other factor is stretched to.       Integers allow positive and negative numbers. Their product is determined by the product of their positive amounts, combined with the sign derived from the following rule, which is a necessary consequence of demanding distributivity of the multiplication over addition, but is no additional rule.     :       & - & +       - & + & -     + & - & +               In words, we have:   Minus times Minus gives Plus   Minus times Plus gives Minus   Plus times Minus gives Minus   Plus times Plus gives Plus       Two fractions can be multiplied by multiplying their numerators and denominators:     :               For a rigorous definition of the product of two real numbers see  |Construction_of_the_real_numbers|Construction_Of_The_Real_Numbers| .       Two complex numbers can be multiplied by the distributive law and the fact that i2-1 , as follows:   :         & a  c + a   d  i + b  c   i + b  d   i2    & +   i              Complex numbers can be written in  |polar_coordinates|Polar_Coordinates| |quaternions|Quaternions| . However, in this case, a  b and b  a are in general different.       The product operator for the  |product_of_a_sequence|Multiplicationcapital_Pi_Notation|  is denoted by the capital Greek letter  |pi|Pi|  ‚àè . The product of a sequence consisting of only one number is just that number itself. The product of no factors at all is known as the  |empty_product|Empty_Product| , and is equal to 1.        |Commutative_rings|Commutative_Ring|  have a product operation.          Residue classes in the rings   can be added:     : + a+b + N      and multiplied:     :   a  b + N                Two functions from the reals to itself can be multiplied in another way, called the  |convolution|Convolution| .     If   :    f              .
