     Eleanor of Aquitaine was  |queen_consort|Queen_Consort|  of  |France|Kingdom_Of_France|  and  |England|Kingdom_Of_England|  and  |duchess_of_Aquitaine|Duchy_Of_Aquitaine| |in_her_own_right|Suo_Jure|  . As a member of the  |Ramnulfids|Ramnulfids|   rulers in southwestern France, she was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe during the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages| . She was  |patron|Patron|  of literary figures such as  |Wace|Wace| ,  |Benoît_de_Sainte-Maure|Benoît_De_Sainte-Maure| , and  |Bernart_de_Ventadorn|Bernart_De_Ventadorn| . She led armies several times in her life and was a leader of the  |Second_Crusade|Second_Crusade| .     As the duchess of Aquitaine, Eleanor was the most eligible bride in Europe. Three months after becoming duchess upon the death of her father,  |William_X|William_X,_Duke_Of_Aquitaine| , she married King  |Louis_VII_of_France|Louis_Vii_Of_France| , son of her guardian,  |King_Louis_VI|King_Louis_Vi| . As  |queen_of_France|Queen_Of_France| , she participated in the unsuccessful Second Crusade. Soon afterwards, Eleanor sought an  |annulment|Annulment|  of her marriage, but her request was rejected by  |Pope_Eugene_III|Pope_Eugene_Iii| . However, after the birth of her second daughter  |Alix|Alix_Of_France,_Countess_Of_Blois| , Louis agreed to an annulment, as 15 years of marriage had not produced a son. The marriage was annulled on 21 March 1152 on the grounds of  |consanguinity|Consanguinity|  within the fourth degree. Their daughters were declared legitimate, custody was awarded to Louis, and Eleanors lands were restored to her.     As soon as the annulment was granted, Eleanor became engaged to the  |Duke_of_Normandy|Duke_Of_Normandy| , who became King  |Henry_II_of_England|Henry_Ii_Of_England|  in 1154. Henry was her third cousin and 11 years younger. The couple married on  |Whitsun|Whitsun| , 18 May 1152, eight weeks after the annulment of Eleanors first marriage, in  |Poitiers_Cathedral|Poitiers_Cathedral| . Over the next 13 years, she bore eight children: five sons, three of whom became kings; and three daughters. However, Henry and Eleanor eventually became estranged. Henry imprisoned her in 1173 for supporting their son  |Henrys|Henry_The_Young_King|  revolt against him. She was not released until 6 July 1189, when her husband Henry died and their second son,  |Richard_the_Lionheart|Richard_I_Of_England| , ascended the throne.     As  |queen_dowager|Queen_Dowager| , Eleanor acted as  |regent|Regent|  while Richard went on the  |Third_Crusade|Third_Crusade| . Eleanor also lived well into the reign of Richards heir and her youngest son,  |John|John,_King_Of_England| .       Eleanors year of birth is not known precisely: a late 13th-century genealogy of her family listing her as 13 years old in the spring of 1137 provides the best evidence that Eleanor was perhaps born as late as 1124. On the other hand, some chronicles mention a fidelity oath of some lords of Aquitaine on the occasion of Eleanors fourteenth birthday in 1136. This, and her known age of 82 at her death make 1122 more likely the year of birth. Her parents almost certainly married in 1121. Her birthplace may have been  |Poitiers|Poitiers| ,  |Bordeaux|Bordeaux| , or  |Nieul-sur-lAutise|Nieul-Sur-Lautise| , where her mother and brother died when Eleanor was 6 or 8.       Eleanor was the oldest of three children of  |William_X,_Duke_of_Aquitaine|William_X,_Duke_Of_Aquitaine| , whose glittering ducal court was renowned in early 12th-century Europe, and his wife,  |Aenor_de_Châtellerault|Aenor_De_Châtellerault| , the daughter of  |Aimery_I,_Viscount_of_Châtellerault|Aimery_I,_Viscount_Of_Châtellerault| , and  |Dangereuse_de_lIsle_Bouchard|Dangereuse_De_Lisle_Bouchard| , who was  |William_IXs|William_Ix,_Duke_Of_Aquitaine|  longtime  |mistress|Mistress|  as well as Eleanors maternal grandmother. Her parents marriage had been arranged by Dangereuse with her paternal grandfather WilliamIX.     Eleanor is said to have been named for her mother Aenor and called Aliénor from the  |Latin|Latin_Language|  Alia Aenor, which means the other Aenor. It became Eléanor in the  langues doïl  of northern France and Eleanor in English. There was, however, another prominent Eleanor before her— |Eleanor_of_Normandy|Eleanor_Of_Normandy| , an aunt of  |William_the_Conqueror|William_The_Conqueror| , who lived a century earlier than Eleanor of Aquitaine. In Paris as the queen of France, she was called Helienordis, her honorific name as written in the Latin epistles.     By all accounts, Eleanors father ensured that she had the best possible education. Eleanor came to learn arithmetic, the constellations, and history. She also learned domestic skills such as household management and the needle arts of embroidery, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving. Eleanor developed skills in conversation, dancing, games such as backgammon, checkers, and chess, playing the harp, and singing. Although her native tongue was  |Poitevin|Poitevin_Dialect| , she was taught to read and speak  |Latin|Latin_Language| , was well versed in music and literature, and schooled in riding, hawking, and hunting. Eleanor was extroverted, lively, intelligent, and strong-willed. Her four-year-old brother William Aigret and their mother died at the castle of Talmont on Aquitaines Atlantic coast in the spring of 1130. Eleanor became the  |heir_presumptive|Heir_Presumptive|  to her fathers domains. The Duchy of Aquitaine was the largest and richest province of France. Poitou, where Eleanor spent most of her childhood, and Aquitaine together was almost one-third the size of modern France. Eleanor had only one other legitimate sibling, a younger sister named Aelith also called  |Petronilla|Petronilla_Of_Aquitaine| . Her half-brother Joscelin was acknowledged by WilliamX as a son, but not as his heir. The notion that she had another half-brother, William, has been discredited. Later, during the first four years of HenryIIs reign, her siblings joined Eleanors royal household.       In 1137 Duke William X left Poitiers for  |Bordeaux|Bordeaux|  and took his daughters with him. Upon reaching Bordeaux, he left them in the charge of the  |archbishop_of_Bordeaux|Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_Of_Bordeaux| , one of his few loyal  |vassals|Vassal| . The duke then set out for the  |Shrine_of_Saint_James_of_Compostela|Santiago_De_Compostela_Cathedralhistory|  in the company of other  |pilgrims|Pilgrim| . However, he died on  |Good_Friday|Good_Friday|  of that year .     Eleanor, aged 12 to 15, then became the duchess of Aquitaine, and thus the most eligible heiress in Europe. As these were the days when kidnapping an heiress was seen as a viable option for obtaining a title, William dictated a  |will|Will|  on the very day he died that bequeathed his domains to Eleanor and appointed King  |Louis_VI_of_France|Louis_Vi_Of_France|  as her guardian. William requested of the king that he take care of both the lands and the duchess, and find her a suitable husband. However, until a husband was found, the king had the legal right to Eleanors lands. The duke also insisted to his companions that his death be kept a secret until Louis was informed; the men were to journey from Saint James of Compostela across the  |Pyrenees|Pyrenees|  as quickly as possible to call at Bordeaux to notify the archbishop, then to make all speed to Paris to inform the king.     The king of France, known as Louis the Fat, was also gravely ill at that time, suffering from a bout of  |dysentery|Dysentery|  from which he appeared unlikely to recover. Yet despite his impending death, Louiss mind remained clear. His heir,  |Prince_Louis|Louis_Vii_Of_France| , had originally been destined for  |the_monastic_life_of_a_younger_son|Cadet_Branch| , but had become the  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent|  when his elder brother  |Philip|Philip_Of_France|  died from a riding accident in 1131.     The death of William, one of the kings most powerful vassals, made available the most desirable  |duchy|Duchy|  in France. While presenting a solemn and dignified face to the grieving Aquitainian messengers, Louis exulted when they departed. Rather than act as guardian to the duchess and duchy, he decided to marry the duchess to his 17-year-old heir and bring Aquitaine under the control of the French crown, thereby greatly increasing the power and prominence of France and its ruling family, the  |House_of_Capet|House_Of_Capet| . Within hours, the king had arranged for Prince Louis to be married to Eleanor, with Abbot  |Suger|Suger|  in charge of the wedding arrangements. Prince Louis was sent to Bordeaux with an escort of 500 knights, along with Abbot Suger,  |Theobald_II,_Count_of_Champagne|Theobald_Ii,_Count_Of_Champagne| , and Count Ralph.               On 25 July 1137, Eleanor and Louis were married in the  |Cathedral_of_Saint-André|Bordeaux_Cathedral|  in Bordeaux by the archbishop of Bordeaux. Immediately after the wedding, the couple were enthroned as duke and duchess of Aquitaine. However, there was a catch: the land would remain independent of France until Eleanors oldest son became both king of France and duke of Aquitaine. Thus, her holdings would not be merged with France until the next generation. As a wedding present she gave Louis a  |rock_crystal_vase|Rock_Crystal_Vase|  , currently on display at the  |Louvre|Louvre| . Louis gave the vase to the  |Basilica_of_St_Denis|Basilica_Of_St_Denis| . This vase is the only object connected with Eleanor of Aquitaine that still survives.     Louiss tenure as count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine and Gascony lasted only a few days. Although he had been invested as such on 8 August 1137, a messenger gave him the news that Louis VI had died of dysentery on 1 August while he and Eleanor were making a tour of the provinces. He and Eleanor were  |anointed|Anointing|  and  |crowned|Coronation|  king and queen of France on Christmas Day of the same year.     Possessing a high-spirited nature, Eleanor was not popular with the staid northerners; according to sources, Louiss mother  |Adelaide_of_Maurienne|Adelaide_Of_Maurienne|  thought her flighty and a bad influence. She was not aided by memories of  |Constance_of_Arles|Constance_Of_Arles| , the  |Provençal|Provence|  wife of  |Robert_II|Robert_Ii_Of_France| , tales of whose immodest dress and language were still told with horror. Eleanors conduct was repeatedly criticized by church elders, particularly  |Bernard_of_Clairvaux|Bernard_Of_Clairvaux|  and Abbot Suger, as indecorous. The king was madly in love with his beautiful and worldly bride, however, and granted her every whim, even though her behavior baffled and vexed him. Much money went into making the austere Cité Palace in  |Paris|Paris|  more comfortable for Eleanors sake.       Although Louis was a pious man, he soon came into a violent conflict with  |Pope_Innocent_II|Pope_Innocent_Ii| . In 1141, the  |Archbishopric_of_Bourges|Archbishopric_Of_Bourges|  became vacant, and the king put forward as a candidate one of his chancellors, Cadurc, while vetoing the one suitable candidate,  |Pierre_de_la_Chatre|Pierre_De_La_Chatre| , who was promptly elected by the  |canons|Canon|  of  |Bourges|Bourges_Cathedral|  and  |consecrated|Consecration|  by the Pope. Louis accordingly bolted the gates of Bourges against the new bishop. The Pope, recalling similar attempts by William X to exile supporters of Innocent from Poitou and replace them with priests loyal to himself, blamed Eleanor, saying that Louis was only a child and should be taught manners. Outraged, Louis swore upon relics that so long as he lived Pierre should never enter Bourges. An  |interdict|Interdict|  was thereupon imposed upon the kings lands, and Pierre was given refuge by  |Theobald_II,_Count_of_Champagne|Theobald_Ii,_Count_Of_Champagne| .     Louis became involved in a war with Count Theobald by permitting  |Raoul_I,_Count_of_Vermandois|Raoul_I,_Count_Of_Vermandois|  and  |seneschal|Seneschal|  of France, to repudiate his wife  |Eleanor_of_Blois|Eleanor_Of_Blois| , Theobalds sister, and to marry  |Petronilla_of_Aquitaine|Petronilla_Of_Aquitaine| , Eleanors sister. Eleanor urged Louis to support her sisters marriage to Count Raoul. Theobald had also offended Louis by siding with the Pope in the dispute over Bourges. The war lasted two years and ended with the occupation of  |Champagne|Champagne|  by the royal army. Louis was personally involved in the assault and burning of the town of  |Vitry|Vitry-Le-François| . More than a thousand people who sought refuge in the church there died in the flames. Horrified, and desiring an end to the war, Louis attempted to make peace with Theobald in exchange for his support in lifting the interdict on Raoul and Petronilla. This was duly lifted for long enough to allow Theobalds lands to be restored; it was then lowered once more when Raoul refused to repudiate Petronilla, prompting Louis to return to Champagne and ravage it once more.     In June 1144, the king and queen visited the newly built monastic church at Saint-Denis. While there, the queen met with Bernard of Clairvaux, demanding that he use his influence with the Pope to have the excommunication of Petronilla and Raoul lifted, in exchange for which King Louis would make concessions in Champagne and recognize Pierre de la Chatre as archbishop of Bourges. Dismayed at her attitude, Bernard scolded Eleanor for her lack of penitence and interference in matters of state. In response, Eleanor broke down and meekly excused her behavior, claiming to be bitter because of her lack of children. In response, Bernard became more kindly towards her: My child, seek those things which make for peace. Cease to stir up the king against the Church, and urge upon him a better course of action. If you will promise to do this, I in return promise to entreat the merciful Lord to grant you offspring. In a matter of weeks, peace had returned to France: Theobalds provinces were returned and Pierre de la Chatre was installed as archbishop of Bourges. In April 1145, Eleanor gave birth to a daughter,  |Marie|Marie_Of_France,_Countess_Of_Champagne| .     Louis, however, still burned with guilt over the massacre at Vitry and wished to make a pilgrimage to the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land|  to atone for his sins. In autumn 1145,  |Pope_Eugene_III|Pope_Eugene_Iii|  requested that Louis lead a  |Crusade|Crusades|  to the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  to rescue the  |Frankish_states|Crusader_States|  there from disaster. Accordingly, Louis declared on Christmas Day 1145 at Bourges his intention of going on a crusade.       Eleanor of Aquitaine also formally took up the cross symbolic of the  |Second_Crusade|Second_Crusade|  during a sermon preached by Bernard of Clairvaux. In addition, she had been corresponding with her uncle  |Raymond|Raymond_Of_Poitiers| ,  |Prince_of_Antioch|Prince_Of_Antioch| , who was seeking further protection from the French crown against the Saracens. Eleanor recruited some of her royal ladies-in-waiting for the campaign as well as 300 non-noble Aquitainian vassals. She insisted on taking part in the Crusades as the feudal leader of the soldiers from her duchy. The story that she and her ladies dressed as  |Amazons|Amazons|  is disputed by historians, sometimes confused with the account of King Conrads train of ladies during this campaign in  |Edward_Gibbons|Edward_Gibbon|   The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . She left for the Second Crusade from  |Vézelay|Vézelay| , the rumored location of  |Mary_Magdalenes|Mary_Magdalene|  grave, in June 1147.     The Crusade itself achieved little. Louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. In eastern Europe, the French army was at times hindered by  |Manuel_I_Comnenus|Manuel_I_Comnenus| , the  |Byzantine_Emperor|Byzantine_Emperor| , who feared that the Crusade would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. Notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at  |Constantinople|Constantinople| , Louis was fêted and Eleanor was much admired. She was compared with  |Penthesilea|Penthesilea| , mythical queen of the  |Amazons|Amazons| , by the Greek historian  |Nicetas_Choniates|Nicetas_Choniates| . He added that she gained the epithet chrysopous from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed her robe. Louis and Eleanor stayed in the  |Philopation|Philopation|  palace just outside the city walls.          From the moment the Crusaders entered  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor| , things began to go badly. The king and queen were still optimistic  —the Byzantine Emperor had told them that the  |German_King_Conrad|Conrad_Iii_Of_Germany|  had won a great victory against a Turkish army when in fact the German army had been massacred. However, while camping near Nicea, the remnants of the German army, including a dazed and sick King Conrad, staggered past the French camp, bringing news of their disaster. The French, with what remained of the Germans, then began to march in increasingly disorganized fashion towards Antioch. They were in high spirits on Christmas Eve, when they chose to camp in a lush valley near  |Ephesus|Ephesus| . Here they were ambushed by a Turkish detachment, but the French proceeded to slaughter this detachment and appropriate their camp.     Louis then decided to cross the Phrygian mountains directly in the hope of reaching Eleanors  |uncle_Raymond|Raymond_Of_Poitiers|  in Antioch more quickly. As they ascended the mountains, however, the army and the king and queen were horrified to discover the unburied corpses of the German army previously slaughtered there.     On the day set for the crossing of Mount Cadmus, Louis chose to take charge of the rear of the column, where the unarmed pilgrims and the baggage trains marched. The vanguard, with which Queen Eleanor marched, was commanded by her Aquitainian vassal,  |Geoffrey_de_Rancon|Geoffrey_De_Rancon| . Unencumbered by baggage, they reached the summit of Cadmus, where Rancon had been ordered to make camp for the night. Rancon, however, chose to continue on, deciding in concert with  |Amadeus_III,_Count_of_Savoy|Amadeus_Iii,_Count_Of_Savoy| , Louiss uncle, that a nearby plateau would make a better campsite. Such disobedience was reportedly common.        Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, the rear of the column  —believing the days march to be nearly at an end  —was dawdling. This resulted in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. At this point, the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers, and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler  |William_of_Tyre|William_Of_Tyre| , writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.     The king, having scorned royal apparel in favor of a simple pilgrims tunic, escaped notice, unlike his bodyguards, whose skulls were brutally smashed and limbs severed. He reportedly nimbly and bravely scaled a rock by making use of some tree roots which God had provided for his safety and managed to survive the attack. Others were not so fortunate: No aid came from Heaven, except that night fell.      Official blame for the disaster was placed on Geoffrey de Rancon, who had made the decision to continue, and it was suggested that he be hanged, a suggestion which the king ignored. Since Geoffrey was Eleanors vassal, many believed that it was she who had been ultimately responsible for the change in plan, and thus the massacre. This suspicion of responsibility did nothing for her popularity in  |Christendom|Christendom| . She was also blamed for the size of the baggage train and the fact that her Aquitainian soldiers had marched at the front and thus were not involved in the fight. Continuing on, the army became split, with the commoners marching toward Antioch and the royalty traveling by sea. When most of the land army arrived, the king and queen had a dispute. Some, such as  |John_of_Salisbury|John_Of_Salisbury|  and William of Tyre, say Eleanors reputation was sullied by rumors of an affair with her uncle Raymond. However, this rumor may have been a ruse, as Raymond, through Eleanor, had been trying to induce Louis to use his army to attack the actual Muslim encampment at nearby  |Aleppo|Aleppo| , gateway to retaking  |Edessa|Edessa| , which had all along, by papal decree, been the main objective of the Crusade. Although this was perhaps a better military plan, Louis was not keen to fight in northern Syria. One of Louiss avowed Crusade goals was to journey in pilgrimage to  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| , and he stated his intention to continue. Reputedly Eleanor then requested to stay with Raymond and brought up the matter of consanguinity  —the fact that she and her husband, King Louis, were perhaps too closely related. Consanguinity was grounds for annulment in the medieval period. But rather than allowing her to stay, Louis took Eleanor from Antioch against her will and continued on to Jerusalem with his dwindling army.     Louiss refusal and his forcing her to accompany him humiliated Eleanor, and she maintained a low profile for the rest of the crusade. Louiss subsequent assault on  |Damascus|Damascus|  in 1148 with his remaining army, fortified by King Conrad and  |Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem|Baldwin_Iii_Of_Jerusalem| , achieved little. Damascus was a major wealthy trading center and was under normal circumstances a potential threat, but the rulers of Jerusalem had recently entered into a truce with the city, which they then forswore. It was a gamble that did not pay off, and whether through military error or betrayal, the Damascus campaign was a failure. Louiss long march to Jerusalem and back north, which Eleanor was forced to join, debilitated his army and disheartened her knights; the divided Crusade armies could not overcome the Muslim forces, and the royal couple had to return home. The French royal family retreated to Jerusalem and then sailed to Rome and made their way back to Paris.     While in the eastern Mediterranean, Eleanor learned about maritime conventions developing there, which were the beginnings of what would become  |admiralty_law|Admiralty_Law| . She introduced those conventions in her own lands on the island of  |Oleron|Oleron|  in 1160  and later in England as well. She was also instrumental in developing trade agreements with Constantinople and ports of trade in the Holy Lands.       Even before the Crusade, Eleanor and Louis were becoming estranged, and their differences were only exacerbated while they were abroad. Eleanors purported relationship with her uncle Raymond, the ruler of Antioch, was a major source of discord. Eleanor supported her uncles desire to re-capture the nearby  |County_of_Edessa|County_Of_Edessa| , the objective of the Crusade. In addition, having been close to him in their youth, she now showed what was considered to be excessive affection toward her uncle. Raymond had plans to abduct Eleanor, to which she consented. While many historians today dismiss this as familial affection, noting their early friendship and his similarity to her father and grandfather, some of Eleanors adversaries interpreted the generous displays of affection as an incestuous affair.     Home, however, was not easily reached. Louis and Eleanor, on separate ships due to their disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanors ship far to the south to the  |Barbary_Coast|Barbary_Coast|  and caused her to lose track of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanors ship finally reached  |Palermo|Palermo|  in Sicily, where she discovered that she and her husband had both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King  |Roger_II_of_Sicily|Roger_Ii_Of_Sicily| , until the king eventually reached  |Calabria|Calabria| , and she set out to meet him there. Later, at King Rogers court in  |Potenza|Potenza| , she learned of the death of her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from  |Marseilles|Marseilles| , they went to see  |Pope_Eugene_III|Pope_Eugene_Iii|  in  |Tusculum|Tusculum| , where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the  |Commune_of_Rome|Commune_Of_Rome| .     Eugene did not, as Eleanor had hoped, grant an annulment. Instead, he attempted to reconcile Eleanor and Louis, confirming the legality of their marriage. He proclaimed that no word could be spoken against it, and that it might not be dissolved under any pretext. Eventually, he arranged events so that Eleanor had no choice but to sleep with Louis in a bed specially prepared by the Pope. Historia Pontificalis of  |John_of_Salisbury|John_Of_Salisbury|  Thus was conceived their second child  —not a son, but another daughter,  |Alix_of_France|Alix_Of_France,_Countess_Of_Blois| .     The marriage was now doomed. Still, without a son and in danger of being left with no male heir, facing substantial opposition to Eleanor from many of his barons and her own desire for annulment, Louis bowed to the inevitable. On 11 March 1152, they met at the royal castle of  |Beaugency|Beaugency|  to dissolve the marriage. Hugues de Toucy,  |archbishop_of_Sens|Archbishop_Of_Sens| , presided, and Louis and Eleanor were both present, as were the archbishop of Bordeaux and Rouen. Archbishop  |Samson_of_Reims|Samson_Of_Reims|  acted for Eleanor.     On 21 March, the four archbishops, with the approval of Pope Eugene, granted an annulment on grounds of  |consanguinity|Consanguinity|  within the fourth degree; Eleanor was Louis third cousin once removed, and shared common ancestry with  |Robert_II_of_France|Robert_Ii_Of_France| . Their two daughters were, however, declared legitimate. Children born to a marriage that was later annulled were not at risk of being bastardized, because ere parties married in good faith, without knowledge of an impediment,  ... children of the marriage were legitimate.  |Whit_Sunday|Whit_Sunday| |chbishop_of_Yo|Chbishop_Of_Yo| smarried 12 July 1137, annulled 21 March 1152married 18 May 1152, widowed 6 July 1189died 1244 .
