Born Georg Henri Anton Ivens  into a wealthy family, Ivens went to work in one of his fathers photo supply shops and from there developed an interest in film. Under the direction of his father, he completed his first film at 13; in college he studied economics with the goal of continuing his fathers business, but an interest in class issues distracted him from that path. He met photographer  |Germaine_Krull|Germaine_Krull|  in Berlin in 1923, and entered into a  |marriage_of_convenience|Marriage_Of_Convenience|  with her between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy. Sichel, Kim. Germaine Krull: Photographer of Modernity. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1999. Pages 41 and 70. .     Originally his work focused on technique, especially in  Rain  , a 10-minute short filmed over 2 years, and in  The Bridge  . Around this time, along with  |Menno_ter_Braak|Menno_Ter_Braak|  and others, he was involved in the creation of the Dutch Film League  based in Amsterdam. The League drew foreign filmmakers to the Netherlands such as  |Alberto_Cavalcanti|Alberto_Cavalcanti| ,  |René_Clair|René_Clair| ,  |Sergei_Eisenstein|Sergei_Eisenstein| ,  |Vsevolod_Pudovkin|Vsevolod_Pudovkin| , and  |Dziga_Vertov|Dziga_Vertov| , who also became his friends.     In 1929, Ivens went to the Soviet Union and was invited to direct a film on a topic of his own choosing which was the new industrial city of  |Magnitogorsk|Magnitogorsk| . Before commencing work, he returned to the Netherlands to make Industrial Symphony for Philips Electric which is considered to be a film of great technical beauty. Erik Barnouw. Documentary. New York: Oxford University Press, 2nd revised edition, 1993. pp.: 133-134 He returned to the Soviet Union to make the film about Magnitogorsk, Song of Heroes  in 1931 with music composed by  |Hanns_Eisler|Hanns_Eisler| . This was the first film on which Ivens and Eisler worked together. It was a propaganda film about this new industrial city where masses of forced laborers and communist youth worked for Stalins Five Year Plan.   With  |Henri_Storck|Henri_Storck| , Ivens made  Misère au Borinage  , a documentary on life in a coal mining region. In 1943, he also directed two Allied propaganda films for the  |National_Film_Board_of_Canada|National_Film_Board_Of_Canada| , including Action Stations, about the  |Royal_Canadian_Navys|Royal_Canadian_Navy|  escorting of convoys in the  |Battle_of_the_Atlantic|Battle_Of_The_Atlantic| .          From 1936 to 1945, Ivens was based in the United States. For  |Pare_Lorentzs|Pare_Lorentz| |_U_S_Film_Service|U_S_Film_Service| , in the year 1940, he made a documentary film on  |rural_electrification|Rural_Electrification|  called Power and the Land. It focused on a family, the Parkinsons, who ran a business providing milk for their community. The film showed the problem in the lack of electricity and the way the problem was fixed. Ivens was, however, known for his anti- |fascist|Fascism|  and other  |propaganda_films|Propaganda_Film| , including  The Spanish Earth , for the Spanish  |Republicans|Republican_Faction| , co-written with  |Ernest_Hemingway|Ernest_Hemingway|  and music by  |Marc_Blitzstein|Marc_Blitzstein|  and  |Virgil_Thomson|Virgil_Thomson| .  |Jean_Renoir|Jean_Renoir|  did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version only after  |Orson_Welless|Orson_Welles|  sounded too theatrical.. This film was financed by  |Archibald_MacLeish|Archibald_Macleish| ,  |Fredric_March|Fredric_March| ,  |Florence_Eldridge|Florence_Eldridge| ,  |Lillian_Hellman|Lillian_Hellman| ,  |Luise_Rainer|Luise_Rainer| ,  |Dudley_Nichols|Dudley_Nichols| ,  |Franchot_Tone|Franchot_Tone|  and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the  |Contemporary_Historians|Contemporary_Historians| .  Spanish Earth  was shown at the  |White_House|White_House|  on July 8, 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway,  |Martha_Gellhorn|Martha_Gellhorn| , had had dinner with President  |Franklin_D_Roosevelt|Franklin_D_Roosevelt| ,  |Eleanor_Roosevelt|Eleanor_Roosevelt|  and  |Harry_Hopkins|Harry_Hopkins| . The Roosevelts loved the film but said that it needed more propaganda. This 1937 documentary was considered his masterpiece.     In 1938 he traveled to China.  The 400 Million  depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the  |Second_Sino_Japanese_War|Second_Sino_Japanese_War| , including dramatic shots of the  |Battle_of_Taierzhuang|Battle_Of_Taierzhuang| .  |Robert_Capa|Robert_Capa|  did camerawork,  |Sidney_Lumet|Sidney_Lumet|  worked on the film as a reader,  |Hanns_Eisler|Hanns_Eisler|  wrote the musical score, and  |Fredric_March|Fredric_March|  provided the narration. It, too, had been financed by the same people as those of Spanish Earth. Its chief fundraiser was  |Luise_Rainer|Luise_Rainer| , recipient of the best actress  |Oscar|Academy_Award|  two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, History Today, Inc . The  |Guomindang|Guomindang|  government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces. European Foundation Joris Ivens.   Ivens was also suspected of being a friend of  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong|  and especially  |Zhou_Enlai|Zhou_Enlai| . Martha Gellhorn. A Memoir: Travels with Myself and Another. New York: Penguin Putnam, Inc, 1978. p.:52     In early 1943,  |Frank_Capra|Frank_Capra|  hired Ivens to supervise the production of Know Your Enemy: Japan  for his U.S. War Department film series  Why We Fight . The films commentary was written largely by  |Carl_Foreman|Carl_Foreman| . Capra fired Ivens from the project because he felt that his approach was too sympathetic toward the Japanese. The films release was held up because there were concerns that  |Emperor_Hirohito|Emperor_Hirohito|  was being depicted as a war criminal, and there was a policy shift to portray the Emperor more favorably after the war as a means of maintaining order in post-war Japan.     With the emerging Red Scare of the late 1940s, Ivens was forced to leave the country in the early months of the Truman administration. Ivens leftist politics also put the kibosh on his first feature film project which was to have starred  |Greta_Garbo|Greta_Garbo| . In fact,  |Walter_Wanger|Walter_Wanger| , the films producer, was adamant about running out of town.         In 1946, commissioned to make a Dutch film about Indonesian independence, Ivens resigned in protest over what he considered ongoing  |imperialism|Imperialism| ; the Dutch were in his view resisting decolonization. Instead, Ivens filmed  Indonesia Calling  in secret. For around a decade Ivens lived in Eastern Europe, working for several studios there. His position concerning Indonesia and his taking sides for the  |Eastern_Bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  in the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  annoyed the Dutch government. Over a period of many years, he was obliged to renew his passport every three or four months. According to later mythology however, he lost his passport for ten years, which is not true, as demonstrated by the fact that he was able to travel to New York City to sit by the bedside of his old friend  |Paul_Robeson|Paul_Robeson|  when he was ill.     From 1965 to 1970 he filmed two propaganda films about North Vietnam during the war: he made  17e parallèle: La guerre du peuple   and he participated in the collective work  Loin du Vietnam  . He was awarded the  |Lenin_Peace_Prize|Lenin_Peace_Prize|  for the year 1967.     From 1971 to 1977, he shot  How Yukong Moved the Mountains , a 763-minute propaganda documentary about the  |Cultural_Revolution|Cultural_Revolution|  in China. He was given unprecedented access because of his pro-communist views and his old personal friendships with  |Zhou_Enlai|Zhou_Enlai|  and  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong| .     He spoke to  |Radio_Netherlands|Radio_Netherlands|  about his life and work in a wide-ranging interview.      In 1988 Ivens received the  |Golden_Lion_Honorary_Award|Golden_Lion|  at the  |Venice_Film_Festival|Venice_Film_Festival| .  He then received the  |Order_of_the_Netherlands_Lion|Order_Of_The_Netherlands_Lion|  in January 1989, and died on 28 June that year. Shortly before his death he released the last of more than 40 films  Une histoire de vent  .
