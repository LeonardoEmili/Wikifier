           Blue Jam was an  |ambient|Ambient_Music| ,  |surreal|Surrealism| |_dark_comedy|Dark_Comedy|  and  |horror|Horror_And_Terror|  radio programme created and directed by  |Chris_Morris|Chris_Morris| . It was broadcast on  |BBC_Radio_1|Bbc_Radio_1|  in the early hours of the morning, for three series from 1997 to 1999.     The programme gained cult status due to its unique mix of surreal monologue, ambient soundtrack, synthesised voices, heavily edited broadcasts and recurring sketches. It featured vocal performances of  |Kevin_Eldon|Kevin_Eldon| ,  |Julia_Davis|Julia_Davis| ,  |Mark_Heap|Mark_Heap| , David Cann and  |Amelia_Bullmore|Amelia_Bullmore| , with Morris himself delivering disturbing monologues, one of which was revamped and made into the  |BAFTA|British_Academy_Of_Film_And_Television_Arts| -winning short film  My Wrongs 8245–8249 & 117 . Writers who contributed to the programme included  |Graham_Linehan|Graham_Linehan| ,  |Arthur_Mathews|Arthur_Mathews| ,  |Peter_Baynham|Peter_Baynham| ,  |David_Quantick|David_Quantick| ,  |Jane_Bussmann|Jane_Bussmann| , Robert Katz and the cast.     The programme was adapted into the TV series  Jam , which aired in 2000. All episodes of Blue Jam are currently available for streaming and download on the  |Internet_Archive|Internet_Archive| .         On his inspiration for making the show, Morris commented: It was so singular, and it came from a mood, quite a desolate mood. I had this misty, autumnal, boggy mood anyway, so I just went with that. But no doubt getting to the end of something like Brass Eye, where youve been forced to be a sort of surrogate lawyer, well, thats the most creatively stifling thing you could possibly do.  Morris also described the show as being like the nightmares you have when you fall asleep listening to the  |BBC_World_Service|Bbc_World_Service|  .     Morris originally requested that the show be broadcast at 3 a.m. on Radio 1 because at that hour, on insomniac radio, the amplitude of terrible things is enormously overblown . As a compromise, the show was broadcast at midnight without much promotion. Morris reportedly included sketches too graphic or transgressive for radio that he knew would be cut so as to make his other material seem less transgressive in comparison. During the airing of episode 6 of series one, a re-editing of the Archbishop of Canterburys speech at Princess Dianas funeral was deemed too offensive for broadcast, and was switched with a different episode as it aired.         Each episode opened with a short spoken monologue describing, in surreal, broken language, various bizarre feelings and situations , set to ambient music interspersed with short clips of other songs and sounds. The introduction would always end with welcome in Blue Jam , inviting the listener, who is presumably experiencing such feelings, to get lost in the program.  The sketches within dealt with heavy and taboo topics, such as murder, suicide, missing or dead children, and rape.       Doctor : The Doctor is a seemingly normal physician working in a standard British medical practice. However, he has a habit of treating his patients in bizarre and often disturbing ways, such as prescribing heroin for a cold, making a man with a headache jump up and down in order to make his penis swing and making a patient leave and go into the next room so he can examine him over the telephone. His name is revealed to be Michael Perlin in several sketches.   The Monologue Man Michael Alexander St. JohnBad Sex making increasingly bizarre erotic requests of one another, such as to shit your leg off and make your spunk come out green .   The Interviewer : conducting real interviews with celebrities such as  |Andrew_Morton|Andrew_Morton|  and  |Jerry_Springer|Jerry_Springer| , Morris confuses and mocks his subjects with ambiguous and odd questions.   Mr. Ventham Mr. Reilly , who seems to be his psychologist, for the most banal of matters.     The sketches not listed are often in the style of a documentary; characters speak as if being interviewed about a recent event. In one sketch, a character voiced by Morris describes a man attempting to commit suicide by jumping off a second-story balcony repeatedly; in another, an angry man shouts about how his car, after being picked up from the garage, is only four feet long.       Morris included a series of radio stings, bizarre sequences of sounds and prose as a parody of modern DJs own soundbites and self-advertising pieces. Each one revolves around a contemporary DJ, such as  |Chris_Moyles|Chris_Moyles| ,  |Jo_Whiley|Jo_Whiley|  and  |Mark_Goodier|Mark_Goodier| , typically involving each DJ dying in a graphic way or going mad in some form – for example, Chris Moyles covering himself in jam and hanging himself from the top of a building.         Three series were produced, with a total of eighteen episodes. All episodes were originally broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 1. Series 1 was broadcast from 14 November to 19 December 1997; series 2 was broadcast from 27 March to 1 May 1998; and series 3 broadcast from 21 January to 25 February 1999.     Series 1 – 14 November 1997 to 19 December 1997, from 00:00 to 01:00.   Series 2 – 27 March 1998 to 1 May 1998, from 01:00 to 02:00.   Series 3 – 21 January 1999 to 25 February 1999, from 00:00 to 01:00.     The first five episodes of series 1 of Blue Jam were repeated by  |BBC_Radio_4_Extra|Bbc_Radio_4_Extra|  in February and March 2014, and series 2 was rebroadcast in December.              Blue Jam features songs, generally of a  |downtempo|Downtempo|  nature, interspersed between sketches. Artists featured includes  |Massive_Attack|Massive_Attack| ,  |Air|Air| ,  |Morcheeba|Morcheeba| ,  |The_Chemical_Brothers|The_Chemical_Brothers| ,  |Björk|Björk| ,  |Aphex_Twin|Aphex_Twin| ,  |Everything_But_the_Girl|Everything_But_The_Girl|  and  |Dimitri_from_Paris|Dimitri_From_Paris| , as well as various non-electronic artists including  |Sly_and_the_Family_Stone|Sly_And_The_Family_Stone| ,  |Serge_Gainsbourg|Serge_Gainsbourg| ,  |The_Cardigans|The_Cardigans|  and  |Eels|Eels| .         Blue Jam was favourably reviewed on several occasions by  The Guardian      and also received a positive review by  The Independent .       |Digital_Spy|Digital_Spy|  wrote in 2014: Its a heady cocktail that provokes an odd, unsettling reaction in the listener, yet Blue Jam is still thumpingly and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious.   Hot Press  called it as odd as comedy gets .             A  |CD|Compact_Disc|  of a number of Blue Jam sketches was released on 23 October 2000 by record label  |Warp|Warp_Records| . Although the CD claims to have 22 tracks, the last one, www.bishopslips.com , is not a track, but rather a reference to the Bishopslips sketch, which was cut in the middle of a broadcast. Most of the sketches on the CD were remade for  Jam .          ; Track listing     Blue Jam Intro   Doc Phone   Lamacq sting   4  ft Car   Suicide Journalist   Acupuncture   Bad Sex   Mayo Sting   Unflustered Parents   Moyles Sting   TV Lizards   Doc Cock   Hobbs Sting   Morton Interview   Fix It Girl   Porn   Kids Party   Club News   Whiley Sting   Little Girl Balls   Blue Jam Outro   www.bishopslips.com         Blue Jam was later made for  |television|Television|  and broadcast on  |Channel_4|Channel_4|  as  Jam . It utilised unusual editing techniques to achieve an unnerving ambience in keeping with the radio show. Many of the sketches were lifted from the radio version, even to the extent of simply setting images to the radio soundtrack. A subsequent re-mixed airing, called Jaaaaam was even more extreme in its use of post-production gadgetry, often heavily distorting the footage.     Blue Jam shares parallels with early editions of a US  |public_radio|Public_Radio|  show Joe Frank: Work in Progress from the mid-1980s, that  |Joe_Frank|Joe_Frank|  did on the  |NPR|Npr|  affiliate station,  |KCRW|Kcrw| , in  |Santa_Monica_California|Santa_Monica_California| .
