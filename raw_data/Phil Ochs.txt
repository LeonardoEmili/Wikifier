     Philip David Ochs  was an American  |protest_singer|Protest_Song|  and songwriter who was known for his sharp wit, sardonic humor, earnest humanism, political activism, insightful and alliterative lyrics, and distinctive voice. He wrote hundreds of songs in the 1960s and 1970s and released eight albums.     Ochs performed at many political events during the  |1960s_counterculture_era|Counterculture_Of_The_1960S| , including  |anti-Vietnam_War|Opposition_To_The_Vietnam_War|  and  |civil_rights|Civil_Rights_Movement|  rallies, student events, and  |organized_labor|Labour_Movement|  events over the course of his career, in addition to many concert appearances at such venues as New York Citys  |Town_Hall|The_Town_Hall|  and  |Carnegie_Hall|Carnegie_Hall| . Politically, Ochs described himself as a left social democrat  who became an early revolutionary after the  |protests|1968_Democratic_National_Convention_Protest_Activity|  at the  |1968_Democratic_National_Convention|1968_Democratic_National_Convention|  in Chicago led to a  |police_riot|Police_Riot| , which had a profound effect on his state of mind.     After years of prolific writing in the 1960s, Ochss mental stability declined in the 1970s. He eventually succumbed to a number of problems including  |bipolar_disorder|Bipolar_Disorder|  and  |alcoholism|Alcoholism| , and died by suicide in 1976.     Some of Ochss major musical influences were  |Woody_Guthrie|Woody_Guthrie| ,  |Pete_Seeger|Pete_Seeger| ,  |Buddy_Holly|Buddy_Holly| ,  |Elvis_Presley|Elvis_Presley| ,  |Bob_Gibson|Bob_Gibson| ,  |Faron_Young|Faron_Young| , and  |Merle_Haggard|Merle_Haggard| . His best-known songs include  |I_Aint_Marching_Anymore|I_Aint_Marching_Anymore|  , Changes ,  |Crucifixion|Crucifixion|  ,  |Draft_Dodger_Rag|Draft_Dodger_Rag|  ,  |Love_Me,_Im_a_Liberal|Love_Me,_Im_A_Liberal|  ,  |Outside_of_a_Small_Circle_of_Friends|Outside_Of_A_Small_Circle_Of_Friends|  ,  |Power_and_the_Glory|Power_And_The_Glory|  ,  |There_but_for_Fortune|There_But_For_Fortune|  , and  |The_War_Is_Over|The_War_Is_Over|  .         Phil Ochs was born in  |El_Paso,_Texas|El_Paso,_Texas| , to Jacob Jack Ochs, a physician who was born in New York on August 11, 1910, Schumacher, p. 13. and Gertrude Phin Ochs, who was born on February 26, 1912, Cohen , p.2  in Scotland. Schumacher, pp. 11–12. His parents met and married in  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh|  where Jack was attending medical school. Brend, p. 100. After their marriage, they moved to the United States. Jack, drafted into the army, was sent overseas near the end of World War II, where he treated soldiers at the  |Battle_of_the_Bulge|Battle_Of_The_Bulge| . His war experiences affected his mental health and he received an honorable medical discharge in November 1945. Schumacher, p. 17. Suffering from  |bipolar_disorder|Bipolar_Disorder|  and  |depression|Depression|  on his return home, Jack was unable to establish a successful medical practice and instead worked at a series of hospitals around the country. As a result, the Ochs family moved frequently: to  |Far_Rockaway|Far_Rockaway,_Queens| , New York, when Ochs was a teenager; then to  |Perrysburg|Perrysburg_,_New_York|  in western New York, where he first studied music; and then to  |Columbus|Columbus,_Ohio| , Ohio. Schumacher, pp. 20, 23–24. Ochs grew up with an older sister,  |Sonia|Sonny_Ochs|  , and a younger brother,  |Michael|Michael_Ochs|  . The Ochs family was middle class and Jewish, but not religious. Eliot , p. 12. His father was distant from his wife and children, and was hospitalized for depression; Schumacher, pp. 16–17, 21. he died on April 30, 1963, from a cerebral hemorrhage; Schumacher, p. 57. His mother died on March 9, 1994.     As a teenager, Ochs was recognized as a talented clarinet player; in an evaluation, one music instructor wrote: You have exceptional musical feeling and the ability to transfer it on your instrument is abundant. Schumacher, p. 24. His musical skills allowed him to play clarinet with the orchestra at the  |Capital_University_Conservatory_of_Music|Capital_University|  in Ohio, where he rose to the status of principal soloist before he was 16. Although Ochs played classical music, he soon became interested in other sounds he heard on the radio, such as early rock icons  |Buddy_Holly|Buddy_Holly|  and  |Elvis_Presley|Elvis_Presley|  and country music artists including  |Faron_Young|Faron_Young| ,  |Ernest_Tubb|Ernest_Tubb| ,  |Hank_Williams,_Sr.|Hank_Williams| , and  |Johnny_Cash|Johnny_Cash| . Schumacher, pp. 24–27. Ochs also spent a lot of time at the movies. He especially liked big screen heroes such as  |John_Wayne|John_Wayne|  and  |Audie_Murphy|Audie_Murphy| .  Later on, he developed an interest in movie rebels, including  |Marlon_Brando|Marlon_Brando|  and  |James_Dean|James_Dean| . Eliot , pp. 5, 8, 13.     From 1956 to 1958, Ochs was a student at the  |Staunton_Military_Academy|Staunton_Military_Academy|  in rural Virginia, and when he graduated he returned to Columbus and enrolled in the  |Ohio_State_University|Ohio_State_University| . Schumacher, pp. 26–28. Unhappy after his first quarter, he took a leave of absence and went to Florida. While in  |Miami|Miami| , the 18-year-old Ochs was jailed for two weeks for sleeping on a park bench, an incident he would later recall:     Somewhere during the course of those fifteen days I decided to become a writer. My primary thought was journalism ... so in a flash I decided — Ill be a writer and a major in journalism.         Ochs returned to Ohio State to study journalism and developed an interest in politics, with a particular interest in the  |Cuban_Revolution|Cuban_Revolution|  of 1959. At Ohio State he met  |Jim_Glover|Jim_Glover| , a fellow student who was a devotee of  |folk_music|Folk_Music| . Glover introduced Ochs to the music of  |Pete_Seeger|Pete_Seeger| ,  |Woody_Guthrie|Woody_Guthrie| , and  |The_Weavers|The_Weavers| . Glover taught Ochs how to play guitar, and they debated politics. Ochs began writing newspaper articles, often on radical themes. When the student paper refused to publish some of his more radical articles, he started his own underground newspaper called The Word. His two main interests, politics and music, soon merged, and Ochs began writing topical political songs. Ochs and Glover formed a duet called The Singing Socialists ,  Page 60. later renamed The Sundowners , but the duo broke up before their first professional performance and Glover went to  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  to become a folksinger. Schumacher, pp. 33–41.     Ochss parents and brother had moved from Columbus to  |Cleveland|Cleveland| , and Ochs started to spend more time there, performing professionally at a local folk club called Farraghers Back Room. He was the opening act for a number of musicians in the summer of 1961, including the  |Smothers_Brothers|Smothers_Brothers| . Schumacher, pp. 41–42. Ochs met folksinger  |Bob_Gibson|Bob_Gibson|  that summer as well, and according to  |Dave_Van_Ronk|Dave_Van_Ronk| , Gibson became the seminal influence on Ochss writing. Schumacher, p. 43. Ochs continued at Ohio State into his senior year, but was bitterly disappointed at not being appointed editor-in-chief of the college newspaper, and dropped out in his last quarter without graduating. He left for New York, as Glover had, to become a folksinger. Schumacher, pp. 44–45.            Ochs arrived in New York City in 1962 and began performing in numerous small folk nightclubs, eventually becoming an integral part of the  |Greenwich_Village|Greenwich_Village|  folk music scene. Schumacher, p. 53. He emerged as an unpolished but passionate vocalist who wrote pointed songs about current events:  |war|War| ,  |civil_rights|Civil_Rights| ,  |labor_struggles|Labour_Movement|  and other topics. While others described his music as protest songs , Ochs preferred the term topical songs . Brend, pp. 101–102.     Ochs described himself as a singing journalist ,  saying he built his songs from stories he read in  Newsweek . Schumacher, p. 54. By the summer of 1963, he was sufficiently well known in folk circles to be invited to sing at the  |Newport_Folk_Festival|Newport_Folk_Festival| , where he performed Too Many Martyrs , Talking Birmingham Jam , and  |Power_and_the_Glory|Power_And_The_Glory|  —his patriotic Guthrie-esque anthem that brought the audience to its feet. Other performers at the 1963 folk festival included  |Peter,_Paul_and_Mary|Peter,_Paul_And_Mary| ,  |Joan_Baez|Joan_Baez| ,  |Bob_Dylan|Bob_Dylan| , and  |Tom_Paxton|Tom_Paxton| . Schumacher, pp. 59–63. Ochss return appearance at Newport in 1964, when he performed Draft Dodger Rag and other songs, was widely praised. Schumacher, p. 84. However, he was not invited to appear in 1965, the festival when Dylan infamously performed  |Maggies_Farm|Maggies_Farm|  with an electric guitar. Although many in the folk world decried Dylans choice, Ochs was amused, and admired Dylans courage in defying the folk establishment. Schumacher, pp. 98, 101–104.      During 1963, Ochs performed at New Yorks  |Carnegie_Hall|Carnegie_Hall|  and  |Town_Hall|The_Town_Hall|  in  |hootenannies|Hootenanny| . Schumacher, p. 67. He made his first solo appearance at Carnegie Hall in 1966. Schumacher, pp. 112–115. Throughout his career, Ochs would perform at a wide range of venues, including civil rights rallies, anti-war demonstrations, and concert halls. Cohen , pp. 12–15.     Ochs contributed many songs and articles to the influential  Broadside Magazine . Schumacher, pp. 54–55.  He recorded his first three albums for  |Elektra_Records|Elektra_Records|  All the News Thats Fit to Sing  ,  I Aint Marching Anymore  , and  Phil Ochs in Concert  . Cohen , pp. 189–191. Critics wrote that each album was better than its predecessors, and fans seemed to agree; record sales increased with each new release. Schumacher, pp. 91–92, 117.     On these records, Ochs was accompanied only by an acoustic guitar. The albums contain many of Ochss topical songs, such as Too Many Martyrs ,  |I_Aint_Marching_Anymore|I_Aint_Marching_Anymore|  , and Draft Dodger Rag ; and some musical reinterpretation of older poetry, such as  |The_Highwayman|The_Highwayman|   and  |The_Bells|The_Bells|  . Phil Ochs in Concert includes some more introspective songs, such as Changes and When Im Gone . Eliot , pp. 77, 86–89, 99–103. Schumacher, pp. 76–77, 90–91, 116–117.     During the early period of his career, Ochs and Bob Dylan had a friendly rivalry. Dylan said of Ochs, I just cant keep up with Phil. And he just keeps getting better and better and better .  On another occasion, when Ochs criticized  |Can_You_Please_Crawl_Out_Your_Window?|Can_You_Please_Crawl_Out_Your_Window?|  Dylan threw him out of his limousine, saying, Youre not a folksinger. Youre a journalist . Schumacher, p. 106.     In 1962, Ochs married Alice Skinner, who was pregnant with their daughter Meegan, in a  |City_Hall_ceremony|Civil_Marriage|  with  |Jim_Glover|Jim_Glover|  as best man and  |Jean_Ray|Jim_And_Jean|  as bridesmaid, and witnessed by Dylans sometime girlfriend,  |Suze_Rotolo|Suze_Rotolo| .  Eliot , pp. 61-63. Phil and Alice separated in 1965, but they never divorced. Schumacher, pp. 58, 67, 92. Eliot , p. 148.     Like many people of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President  |John_F._Kennedy|John_F._Kennedy| , even though he disagreed with the president on issues such as the  |Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion|Bay_Of_Pigs_Invasion| , the  |Cuban_Missile_Crisis|Cuban_Missile_Crisis| , and the growing  |involvement_of_the_United_States_in_the_Vietnamese_civil_war|Role_Of_The_United_States_In_The_Vietnam_War| . When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he thought he was going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry. Schumacher, p. 68. Schumacher, pp. 68–69.     Ochss managers during this part of his career were  |Albert_Grossman|Albert_Grossman|  followed by  |Arthur_Gorson|Arthur_Gorson| . Eliot , p. 64, 94. Gorson had close ties with such groups as  |Americans_For_Democratic_Action|Americans_For_Democratic_Action| , the  |Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee|Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee| , and  |Students_for_a_Democratic_Society|Students_For_A_Democratic_Society| . Eliot , pp. 66–67.     Ochs was writing songs at an amazing pace. Some of the songs he wrote during this period were held back and recorded on his later albums. Schumacher, pp. 118, 149.       In 1967, Ochs—now managed by his brother Michael—left Elektra for  |A_&_M_Records|A_&_M_Records|  and moved to  |Los_Angeles,_California|Los_Angeles,_California| . Schumacher, pp. 129–130, 134. He recorded four studio albums for A & M:  Pleasures of the Harbor  ,  Tape from California  ,  Rehearsals for Retirement  , and the ironically titled  Greatest Hits  . Cohen , pp. 191–193. For his A & M albums, Ochs moved away from simply produced solo acoustic guitar performances and experimented with ensemble and even orchestral instrumentation, baroque-folk , Brend, p. 106. in the hopes of producing a  |pop|Pop_Music| -folk hybrid that would be a  |hit|Hit_Single| . Eliot , pp. 131–133.     Critic  |Robert_Christgau|Robert_Christgau| , writing in  Esquire  of Pleasures of the Harbor in May 1968, did not consider this new direction a good turn. While describing Ochs as unquestionably a nice guy , he went on to say, too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed. Pleasures of the Harbor , Christgau continued, epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since  Sgt. Pepper . gaudy musical settings ... inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum.  With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgaus webbed hand comment in his 1968 songbook The War is Over on a page titled The Critics Raved , opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can. Ochs , p. 44. Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for. Schumacher, p. 166. Still, Ochs would joke on the back cover of Greatest Hits that there were 50 Phil Ochs fans , a sarcastic reference to an Elvis Presley album that bragged of  |50_million_Elvis_fans|50,000,000_Elvis_Fans_Cant_Be_Wrong| . Schumacher, p. 226.     None of Ochss songs became hits, although Outside of a Small Circle of Friends received a good deal of  |airplay|Airplay| . It reached 119 on  Billboard s national Hot Prospect listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics, which sarcastically suggested that smoking marijuana is more fun than drinking beer . Eliot , pp. 136–137. It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40. Joan Baez, however, did have a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in August 1965, reaching 8 with her cover of Ochss song There but for Fortune , which was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording . In the U.S. it peaked at 50 on the Billboard charts —a good showing, but not a hit. Schumacher, p. 95.     Although he was trying new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly concerned with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country. In 1967 he organized two rallies to declare that The War Is Over — Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I and thousands of other Americans have done—declare the war over. ; reprinted in Ochs , p. 92; excerpted in Schumacher, p. 171. —one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November. Schumacher, pp. 139–148, 170–173. He continued to write and record anti-war songs, such as The War Is Over and White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land . Other topical songs of this period include Outside of a Small Circle of Friends , inspired by the murder of Kitty Genovese , who was stabbed to death outside of her New York City apartment building while dozens of her neighbors reportedly ignored her cries for help, and William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed , about the despair he felt in the aftermath of the Chicago 1968 Democratic National Convention police riot . Schumacher, pp. 149, 208.     Ochs was writing more personal songs as well, such as Crucifixion , in which he compared the deaths of Jesus Christ and assassinated President John F. Kennedy as part of a cycle of sacrifice in which people build up heroes and then celebrate their destruction; Chords of Fame , a warning against the dangers and corruption of fame; Pleasures of the Harbor , a lyrical portrait of a lonely sailor seeking human connection far from home; and Boy in Ohio , a plaintive look back at Ochss childhood in Columbus. Eliot , p. 193. Schumacher, pp. 110, 160, 214–215, 223–224.     A lifelong movie fan, Ochs worked the narratives of justice and rebellion that he had seen in films into his music, describing some of his songs as cinematic . For example, in the spoken introduction to Ringing of Revolution on  |Phil_Ochs_in_Concert|Phil_Ochs_In_Concert| . He was disappointed and bitter when his onetime hero John Wayne embraced the Vietnam War with what Ochs saw as the blind patriotism of Waynes 1968 film,  |The_Green_Berets|The_Green_Berets| She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general. ; quoted in Schumacher, p. 178.     Ochs was involved in the creation of the Youth International Party , known as the Yippies, along with Jerry Rubin , Abbie Hoffman , Stew Albert , and Paul Krassner . Eliot , p. 140. At the same time, Ochs actively supported Eugene McCarthy s more mainstream bid for the 1968 Democratic nomination for President , a position at odds with the more radical Yippie point of view. Schumacher, p. 182–184. Despite their disagreements, the Yippies used several Ochs songs in their media, in particular the anti-war I Aint Marching Anymore . For example, see . Still, Ochs helped plan the Yippies Festival of Life which was to take place at the 1968 Democratic National Convention along with demonstrations by other anti-war groups including the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam . Brend, pp. 106–107. Despite warnings that there might be trouble, Ochs went to Chicago both as a guest of the McCarthy campaign and to participate in the demonstrations. He performed in Lincoln Park , Grant Park , and at the Chicago Coliseum , witnessed the violence perpetrated by the Chicago police against the protesters, and was himself arrested at one point. Schumacher, pp. 194–196. See also the documentary film at Vimeo     thu   The events of 1968—the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy , the police riot in Chicago, and the election of Richard Nixon —left Ochs feeling disillusioned and depressed. Schumacher, pp. 201, 204. The cover of his 1969 album  |Rehearsals_for_Retirement|Rehearsals_For_Retirement|  eerily portrays a tombstone with the words:     PHIL OCHS     BORN: EL PASO, TEXAS, 1940   DIED: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 1968 Schumacher, p. 211.       At the trial of the Chicago Seven in December 1969, Ochs testified for the defense. His testimony included his recitation of the lyrics to his song I Aint Marching Anymore . On his way out of the courthouse, Ochs sang the song for the press corps; to Ochss amusement, his singing was broadcast that evening by Walter Cronkite on the CBS Evening News . Eliot , pp. 175–188.       After the riot in Chicago and the subsequent trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public. Schumacher, pp. 222–223.     Ochs turned to his musical roots in country music and early rock and roll. Schumacher, p. 224. He decided he needed to be part Elvis Presley and part Che Guevara , Schumacher, p. 227. so he commissioned a gold lamé suit from Elvis Presleys costumer Nudie Cohn . Brend, p. 108. Ochs wore the gold suit on the cover of his 1970 album,  |Greatest_Hits|Greatest_Hits| , which consisted of new songs largely in rock and country styles.     Ochs went on tour wearing the gold suit, backed by a rock band, singing his own material along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard. His fans did not know how to respond. This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience. Ochss March 27, 1970, concerts at Carnegie Hall were the most successful, and by the end of that nights second show Ochs had won over many in the crowd. The show was recorded and released as  |Gunfight_at_Carnegie_Hall|Gunfight_At_Carnegie_Hall| . Schumacher, pp. 227–233.     During this period, Ochs was taking drugs to get through performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, and he was also drinking heavily. Schumacher, pp. 216–217, 233. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. Id never seen anything like that. Schumacher, p. 233. Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice for the rest of his life. Eliot , pp. 207, 213, 236. Schumacher, pp. 260, 265, 275, 301–302, 310–311.     Depressed by his lack of widespread appreciation and suffering from writers block , Ochs did not record any further albums. Schumacher, pp. 226, 235, 255. He slipped deeper into depression and alcoholism. His personal problems notwithstanding, Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for Greenpeace on October 16, 1970, at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver , British Columbia . A recording of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, was released by Greenpeace in 2009.       thu into Heres to the State of Richard Nixon . Typed at apartment of Chip Berlet in 1974 prior to Ochss performance of the song at Impeachment Ball. Copy sent to his brother Michael Ochs for registration. Original at Chicago History Museum .     In August 1971, Ochs went to Chile, where Salvador Allende , a Marxist , had been democratically elected in the 1970 election . There he met Chile an folksinger Víctor Jara , an Allende supporter, and the two became friends. In October, Ochs left Chile to visit Argentina . Later that month, after singing at a political rally in Uruguay , he and his American traveling companion David Ifshin were arrested and detained overnight. When the two returned to Argentina, they were arrested as they got off the airplane. After a brief stay in an Argentinian prison, Ochs and Ifshin were sent to Bolivia via a commercial airliner where authorities were to detain them. Ifshin had previously been warned by Argentinian leftist friends that when the authorities sent dissidents to Bolivia, they would disappear forever. When the airliner arrived in Bolivia, the American captain of the Braniff International Airways aircraft allowed Ochs and Ifshin to stay on the aircraft, and barred Bolivian authorities from entering. The aircraft then flew to Peru where the two disembarked and they were not detained. Fearful that Peruvian authorities might arrest him, Ochs returned to the United States a few days later. Schumacher, pp. 239–253.     Ochs was having difficulties writing new songs during this period, but he had occasional breakthroughs. He updated his sarcastic song Heres to the State of Mississippi as Heres to the State of Richard Nixon , with cutting lines such as the speeches of the Spiro are the ravings of a clown , a reference to Nixons vitriolic vice president, Spiro Agnew —sung as the speeches of the President are the ravings of a clown after Agnews resignation. Schumacher, p. 255. Eliot, p. 216. The Spiro lyrics can be heard in from the 1971 Free John Sinclair rally. The President lyrics can be heard in the 1974 single release.     Ochs was personally invited by John Lennon to sing at a large benefit at the University of Michigan in December 1971 on behalf of John Sinclair , an activist poet who had been arrested on minor drug charges and given a severe sentence. Ochs performed at the John Sinclair Freedom Rally along with Stevie Wonder , Allen Ginsberg , David Peel , Abbie Hoffman and many others. The rally culminated with Lennon and Yoko Ono , who were making their first public performance in the United States since the breakup of The Beatles . Schumacher, pp. 256–259.     Although the 1968 election had left him deeply disillusioned, Ochs continued to work for the election campaigns of anti-war candidates, such as George McGovern s unsuccessful Presidential bid in 1972 . Schumacher, pp. 262–263.     In 1972, Ochs was asked to write the theme song for the film  |Kansas_City_Bomber|Kansas_City_Bomber| . The task proved difficult, as Ochs struggled to overcome his writers block. Although his song was not used in the soundtrack, it was released as a single . Schumacher, pp. 263–264, 269, 271.     Ochs decided to travel. In mid-1972, he went to Australia and New Zealand . Schumacher, pp. 264–271. He traveled to Africa in 1973, where he visited Ethiopia , Kenya , Tanzania , Malawi , and South Africa . One night, Ochs was attacked and strangled by robbers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania , which damaged his vocal cords, causing a loss of the top three notes in his vocal range. The attack also exacerbated his growing mental problems, and he became increasingly paranoid. Ochs believed the attack may have been arranged by government agents—perhaps the CIA. Still, he continued his trip, even recording a single in Kenya, Bwatue . Schumacher, pp. 279–285.     On September 11, 1973, the Allende government of Chile was overthrown in a  |coup_détat|1973_Chilean_Coup_Détat| . Allende committed suicide during the bombing of the presidential palace, and singer Victor Jara was publicly tortured and killed. When Ochs heard about the manner in which his friend had been killed, he was outraged and decided to organize a benefit concert to bring to public attention the situation in Chile, and raise funds for the people of Chile. The concert, An Evening with Salvador Allende , included films of Allende; singers such as Pete Seeger , Arlo Guthrie , and Bob Dylan; and political activists such as former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark . Dylan had agreed to perform at the last minute when he heard that the concert had sold so few tickets that it was in danger of being canceled. Once his participation was announced, the event quickly sold out. Schumacher, pp. 287–297.     After the Chile benefit, Ochs and Dylan discussed the possibility of a joint concert tour, playing small nightclubs. Nothing came of the Dylan-Ochs plans, but the idea eventually evolved into Dylans Rolling Thunder Revue . Schumacher, pp. 298–299.     The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975. Ochs planned a final War Is Over rally, which was held in New Yorks Central Park on May 11. More than 100,000 people came to hear Ochs, joined by Harry Belafonte , Odetta , Pete Seeger and others. Ochs and Joan Baez sang a duet of There but for Fortune and he closed with his song The War Is Over —finally a true declaration that the war was over. Schumacher, pp. 304–306.       thu in Washington, D.C., in 1975   Ochss drinking became more and more of a problem, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. He frightened his friends both with his drunken rants about the FBI and CIA , and about his claiming to want to have Elviss manager Colonel Tom Parker or Kentucky Fried Chicken s Colonel Sanders manage his career. Schumacher, pp. 310–311.     In mid-1975, Ochs took on the identity of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train was convinced that someone was trying to kill him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe. Schumacher, pp. 312–318     Ochss friends tried to help him.
