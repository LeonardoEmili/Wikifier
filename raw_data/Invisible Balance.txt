The invisible balance or balance of trade on services is that part of the  |balance_of_trade|Balance_Of_Trade|  that refers to services and other products that do not result in the transfer of physical objects. Examples include consulting services, shipping services, tourism, and patent license revenues. This figure is usually generated by  |tertiary_industry|Tertiary_Industry| . The term invisible balance is especially common in the United Kingdom.     For countries that rely on service exports or on tourism, the invisible balance is particularly important. For instance the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia receive significant international income from financial services, while Japan and Germany rely more on exports of manufactured goods.         Invisibles are both international payments for services , as well as movements of money without exchange for goods or services. These invisibles are called transfer payments or remittances and may include money sent from one country to another by an individual, business, government or non-governmental organisations    often charities.     An individual remittance may include money sent to a relative overseas. Business transfers may include profits sent by a foreign subsidiary to a parent company or money invested by a business in a foreign country. Bank loans to foreign countries are also included in this category, as are license fees paid for the use of patents and trademarks. Government transfers may involve loans made or official aid given to foreign countries, while transfers made by NGOs include money designated for charitable work within foreign countries, respectively.       In many countries a useful distinction is drawn between the  |balance_of_trade|Balance_Of_Trade|  and the  |balance_of_payments|Balance_Of_Payments| . Balance of trade refers to the trade of both tangible objects as well as the trade in services   collectively known as exports and imports   while the balance of payments also includes transfers of Capital in the form of loans, investments in shares or direct investment in projects.     A nation may have a visibles balance surplus but this can be offset by a larger deficit in the invisibles balance â€“ if, for example, there are large payments made to foreign businesses for invisibles such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, a Visibles Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the invisibles balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.     In a similar way, a nation may also have a surplus balance of trade because it exports more than it imports but a negative balance of payments because, it has a much greater shortfall in transfers of capital. And, just as easily, a deficit in the balance of trade may be offset by a larger surplus in capital transfers from overseas to produce a balance of payments surplus overall.       Problems with a countrys balance of trade are often associated with an inappropriate valuation of its currency, its countrys foreign exchange rate.     If a countrys exchange rate is too high, its exports will become uncompetitive as buyers in foreign countries require more of their own currency to pay for them. In the meantime, it also becomes cheaper for the citizens of the country to buy goods from overseas,as opposed to buying locally produced goodsaid, etc.loans, etc.or pegged .
