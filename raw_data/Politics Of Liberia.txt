      Politics of Liberia takes place in a framework of a  |presidential|Presidential_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |republic|Republic|  modeled on the  |government|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_States|  of the  |United_States|United_States| , whereby the  |President|President_Of_Liberia|  is the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| ; unlike the United States, however, Liberia is a  |unitary_state|Unitary_State|  as opposed to a  |federation|Federation|  and has a pluriform  rather than the  |two-party_system|Two-Party_System|  that characterizes US politics.  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the government.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the  |government|Forms_Of_Government|  and the two chambers of the legislature.     Liberia is still in transition from dictatorship and civil war to democracy. Liberias government is based on the American model of a republic with three equal branches of government, though in reality, the  |President_of_Liberia|President_Of_Liberia|  has usually been the dominant force in Liberian politics. Following the dissolution of the  |Republican_Party|Republican_Party|  in 1876, the  |True_Whig_Party|True_Whig_Party|  dominated the Liberian government until the 1980 coup, eventually creating what was effectively a  |one-party_state|One-Party_State| .     Currently, no party has majority control of the legislature. The longest-serving president in Liberian history was  |William_Tubman|William_Tubman| , serving from 1944 until his death in 1971. The shortest term was held by  |James_Skivring_Smith|James_Skivring_Smith| , who was interim president for all of two months. However, the political process from Liberias founding in 1847, despite widespread corruption, was very stable until the end of the First Republic in 1980.                 Between 1980 and 2006,  |Liberia|Liberia|  was governed by a series of military and transitional governments. The president of the last of these,  |Charles_Taylor|Charles_G._Taylor| , was forced to step down in 2003, and the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  installed a  |transitional_government|Transitional_Government| . Elections to select a government to replace the transitional government took place in October and November 2005. .     In the 1980s,  |Samuel_K._Does|Samuel_K._Doe|  government increasingly adopted an ethnic outlook as members of his  |Krahn|Krahn|  ethnic group soon dominated political and military life in  |Liberia|Liberia| . This caused a heightened level of ethnic tension leading to frequent hostilities between the politically and militarily dominant Krahns and other ethnic groups in the country.      |Political_parties|List_Of_Political_Parties_In_Liberia|  remained banned until 1984.  |Elections|Liberia_Elections,_1985|  were held on 15 October 1985 in which Does  |National_Democratic_Party_of_Liberia|National_Democratic_Party_Of_Liberia|  was declared the winner. The elections were characterized by widespread fraud and rigging. The period after the elections saw increased human rights abuses, corruption, and ethnic tensions. The standard of living, which had been rising in the 1970s, declined drastically.     On 12 November 1985, former Army Commanding General  |Thomas_Quiwonkpa|Thomas_Quiwonkpa|  invaded Liberia by way of neighboring  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone|  and almost succeeded in toppling the government of Samuel Doe. Members of the Krahn-dominated Armed Forces of Liberia repelled Quiwonkpas attack and executed him in  |Monrovia|Monrovia,_Liberia| .     On 24 December 1989, a small band of rebels led by Does former procurement chief,  |Charles_Taylor|Charles_G._Taylor|  invaded Liberia from  |Ivory_Coast|Ivory_Coast| . Taylor and his  |National_Patriotic_Front|National_Patriotic_Front_Of_Liberia|  rebels rapidly gained the support of Liberians because of the repressive nature of Samuel Doe and his government. Barely six months after the rebels first attacked, they had reached the outskirts of Monrovia.     The  |First|First_Liberian_Civil_War|  and  |Second_Liberian_Civil_War|Second_Liberian_Civil_War| , which was one of Africas bloodiest, claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries.     The  |Economic_Community_of_West_African_States|Economic_Community_Of_West_African_States|  intervened and succeeded in preventing Charles Taylor from capturing Monrovia.  |Prince_Johnson|Prince_Johnson|  who had been a member of Taylors  |National_Patriotic_Front_of_Liberia|National_Patriotic_Front_Of_Liberia|  but broke away because of policy differences, formed the  |Independent_National_Patriotic_Front_of_Liberia|Independent_National_Patriotic_Front_Of_Liberia|  . Johnsons forces captured and killed Doe on 9 September 1990.      An Interim Government of National Unity was formed in  |Gambia|The_Gambia|  under the auspices of ECOWAS in October 1990 and Dr.  |Amos_Sawyer|Amos_Sawyer|  became President. Taylor refused to work with the interim government and continued war.     By 1992, several warring factions had emerged in the Liberian civil war, all of which were absorbed in the new transitional government. After several peace accords and declining military power, Taylor finally agreed to the formation of a five-man transitional government.     After considerable progress in negotiations conducted by the  |United_States|United_States| ,  |United_Nations|United_Nations| ,  |Organization_of_African_Unity|Organization_Of_African_Unity| , and the Economic Community of West African States, disarmament and demobilization of warring factions were hastily carried out and  |special_elections|Liberia_Elections,_1997|  were held on 19 July 1997 with Charles Taylor and his  |National_Patriotic_Party|National_Patriotic_Party|  emerging victorious. Taylor won the election by a large majority, primarily because Liberians feared a return to war had Taylor lost.     Unrest continued, and by 2003, two rebel groups were challenging Taylors control of the country. In August 2003, Taylor resigned and fled the country and vice-president  |Moses_Blah|Moses_Blah|  became acting president. On August 18, 2003, the warring parties signed the  |Accra_Comprehensive_Peace_Agreement|Accra_Comprehensive_Peace_Agreement|  which marked the political end of the conflict.     The international community again intervened and helped set up a transitional government which was led by  |Gyude_Bryant|Gyude_Bryant|  until the  |Liberian_general_election_of_2005|Liberian_General_Election,_2005| .     For more than a year, over 9,000 census-takers combed the densely forested nation mapping every structure. For three days starting 21 March 2008, they revisited each dwelling and counted the inhabitants.         |President|President_Of_Liberia| |George_Weah|George_Weah| |Congress_for_Democratic_Change|Congress_For_Democratic_Change| |Vice_President|Vice_President_Of_Liberia| |Jewel_Taylor|Jewel_Taylor| |Congress_for_Democratic_Change|Congress_For_Democratic_Change|  30 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve nine-year terms73 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms nonsignatory user .
