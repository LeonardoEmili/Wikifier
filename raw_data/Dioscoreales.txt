     The Dioscoreales are an  |order|Order|  of  |monocotyledon|Monocotyledon| ous  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plants|  in modern  |classification_systems|List_Of_Systems_Of_Plant_Classification| , such as the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  and the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Web|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Web| . Within the monocots Dioscoreales are grouped in the  |lilioid_monocots|Lilioid_Monocots|  where they are in a  |sister_group|Sister_Group|  relationship with the  |Pandanales|Pandanales| . Of necessity the Dioscoreales contain the  |family|Family| |_Dioscoreaceae|Dioscoreaceae|  which includes the  |yam|Yam|   that is used as an important food source in many regions around the globe. Older systems tended to place all lilioid monocots with  |reticulate_veined|Reticulate_Veined|  leaves  in Dioscoreales. As currently  |circumscribed|Circumscription|  by  |phylogenetic_analysis|Phylogenetic_Analysis|  using combined  |morphology|Plant_Morphology|  and  |molecular|Molecular_Phylogenetics|  methods, Dioscreales contains many reticulate veined  |vines|Vines|  in Dioscoraceae, it also includes the  |myco_heterotrophic|Myco_Heterotrophic| |_Burmanniaceae|Burmanniaceae|  and the  |autotrophic|Autotrophic| |_Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae| . The order consists of three families, 22  |genera|Genera|  and about 850  |species|Species| .       Dioscoreales are  |vines|Vines|  or  |herbaceous|Herbaceous|  forest floor plants. They may be  |achlorophyllous|Achlorophyllous|  or  |saprophytic|Saprophytic| .  |Synapomorphies|Synapomorphies|  include tuberous roots, glandular hairs,  |seed_coat|Seed_Coat|  characteristics and the presence of  |calcium_oxalate|Calcium_Oxalate| |_crystals|Crystals| . Other characteristics of the order include the presence of  |saponin|Saponin| |_steroids|Steroids| , annular  |vascular_bundles|Vascular_Bundles|  that are found in both the  |stem|Plant_Stem|  and  |leaf|Leaf| . The leaves are often unsheathed at the base, have a distinctive  |petiole|Petiole|  and  |reticulate_veined|Reticulate_Veined|  lamina. Alternatively they may be small and scale-like with a sheathed base. The  |flowers|Flowers|  are  |actinomorphic|Actinomorphic| , and may be  |bisexual|Plant_Reproductive_Morphology|  or  |dioecious|Dioecious| , while the flowers or  |inflorescence|Inflorescence|  bear glandular hairs. The  |perianth|Perianth|  may be conspicuous or reduced and the  |style|Stigma_Style|  is short with well developed style branches. The  |tepals|Tepals|  persist in the development of the  |fruit|Fruit| , which is a dry  |capsule|Capsule|  or  |berry|Berry| . In the seed, the  |endotegmen|Seedseed_Coat|  is  |tanniferous|Tannin|  and the  |embryo|Embryoplant_Embryos|  short.     All of the species except the genera placed in  |Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae|  express simultaneous  |microsporogenesis|Microsporogenesis| . Plants in  |Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae|  show successive  |microsporogenesis|Microsporogenesis|  which is one of the traits indicating that the family is sister to all the other members included in the order.           For the early history from  |Lindley|John_Lindley|   onwards, see Caddick et al. Table 1, Caddick et al. Table 1 and Table 2 in Bouman . The  |taxonomic|Taxonomy|  classification of Dioscoreales has been complicated by the presence of a number of  |morphological|Morphology|  features reminiscent of the  |dicotyledons|Dicotyledons| , leading some authors to place the order as intermediate between the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons.        While Lindley did not use the term Dioscoreales , he placed the family Dioscoraceae together with four other families in what he referred to as an Alliance called Dictyogens. He reflected the uncertainty as to the place of this Alliance by placing it as a class of its own between Endogens and Exogens The  |botanical_authority|Botanical_Authority|  is given to  |von_Martius|Von_Martius|  by APG for his description of the Dioscoreae family or Ordo, while other sources cite Hooker  for his use of the term Dioscorales in 1873 with a single family, Dioscoreae. However, in his more definitive work, the Genera plantara , he simply placed Dioscoraceae in the Epigynae Series .       Although  |Charles_Darwins|Charles_Darwin| |_Origin_of_Species|Origin_Of_Species|  preceded Bentham and Hookers publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and  |George_Bentham|George_Bentham|  was initially sceptical of  |Darwinism|Darwinism| . The new  |phyletic|Phyletic|  approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating  |evolutionary|Evolutionary|  information into their schemata, but this did little to further define the  |circumscription|Circumscription|  of Dioscoreaceae. The major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the  |German|German_Language|  literature. Authors such as  |Eichler|August_Eichler| ,  |Engler|Adolf_Engler|  and  |Wettstein|Richard_Wettstein|  placed this family in the  |Liliiflorae|Liliiflorae| , a major subdivision of monocotyledons. it remained to  |Hutchinson|John_Hutchinson|   to resurrect the Dioscoreales to group Dioscoreaceae and related families together. Hutchinsons circumscription of Dioscoreales included three other families in addition to Dioscoreaceae,  |Stenomeridaceae|Stenomeridaceae| ,  |Trichopodaceae|Trichopodaceae|  and  |Roxburghiaceae|Roxburghiaceae| . Of these only Trichopodaceae was included in the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  classification , but was subsumed into Dioscoraceae. Stenomeridaceae, as  Stenomeris  was also included in Dioscoreaceae as subfamily Stenomeridoideae, the remaining genera being grouped in  |subfamily|Subfamily|  Dioscoreoideae. Roxburghiaceae on the other hand was segregated in the  |sister_order|Sister_Group| |_Pandanales|Pandanales|  as  |Stemonaceae|Stemonaceae| . Most taxonomists in the twentieth century  recognised Dioscoreales as a distinct order, but demonstrated wide variations in its composition.      |Dahlgren|Rolf_Dahlgren| , in the second version of his taxonomic classification  raised the Liliiflorae to a  |superorder|Superorder|  and placed Dioscoreales as an order within it. In  |his_system|Dahlgren_System| , Dioscoreales contained only three families, Dioscoreaceae,  |Stemonaceae|Stemonaceae|   and  |Trilliaceae|Trilliaceae| . The latter two families had been treated as a separate order  by other authors, such as  |Huber|Herbert_Huber|  . The APG would later assign these to Pandanales and  |Liliales|Liliales|  respectively. Dahlgrens construction of Dioscoreaceae included the Stenomeridaceae and Trichopodaceae, doubting these were distinct, and Croomiaceae in Stemonaceae. Furthermore, he expressed doubts about the orders homogeneity, especially Trilliaceae. The Dioscoreales at that time were marginally distinguishable from the  |Asparagales|Asparagales| . In his examination of Hubers Stemonales, he found that the two constituent families had as close an affinity to Dioscoreaceae as to each other, and hence included them. He also considered closely related families and their relationship to Dioscoreales, such as the  |monogeneric|Monogeneric|  Taccaceae, then in its own order, Taccales. Similar considerations were discussed with respect to two Asparagales families, Smilacaceae and Petermanniaceae.     In Dahlgrens third and final version  that broader circumscription of Dioscoreales was created within the superorder  |Lilianae|Lilianae| , subclass  |Liliidae|Liliidae|  , class  |Magnoliopsida|Magnoliopsida|  and comprised the seven families  |Dioscoreaceae|Dioscoreaceae| ,  |Petermanniaceae|Petermanniaceae| ,  |Smilacaceae|Smilacaceae| ,  |Stemonaceae|Stemonaceae| ,  |Taccaceae|Taccaceae| ,  |Trichopodaceae|Trichopodaceae|  and  |Trilliaceae|Trilliaceae| .  |Thismiaceae|Thismiaceae|  has either been treated as a separate family closely related to  |Burmanniaceae|Burmanniaceae|  or as a  |tribe|Tribe|  within a more broadly defined Burmanniaceae, forming a separate  |Burmanniales|Burmanniales|  order in the Dahlgren system. The related  |Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae|  were treated as tribe Narthecieae within the  |Melanthiaceae|Melanthiaceae|  in a third order, the  |Melanthiales|Melanthiales| , by Dahlgren. Dahlgren considered the Dioscoreales to most strongly resemble the ancestral monocotyledons, and hence sharing dicotyledonous characteristics, making it the most central monocotyledon order. Of these seven families, Bouman considered Dioscoreaceae, Trichopodaceae, Stemonaceae and Taccaceae to represent the core families of the order. However, that study also indicated both a clear delineation of the order from other orders particularly Asparagales, and a lack of homogeneity within the order.       The increasing availability of  |molecular_phylogenetics|Molecular_Phylogenetics|  methods in addition to morphological characteristics in the 1990s led to major reconsiderations of the relationships within the monocotyledons. In that large multi-institutional examination of the  |seed_plants|Seed_Plants|  using the  |plastid|Plastid| |_gene|Gene| |_rbcL|Rubisco|  the authors used  |Dahlgrens_system|Dahlgrens_System|  as their basis, but followed  |Thorne|Robert_F_Thorne|   in altering the  |suffixes|Suffixes|  of the superorders from -iflorae to -anae . This demonstrated that the Lilianae comprised three lineages corresponding to Dahlgrens   Dioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagales orders.     Under the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group| |_system|Apg_System|  of 1998, which took Dahlgrens system as a basis, the order was placed in the  |monocot|Monocot| |_clade|Clade|  and comprised the five families  |Burmanniaceae|Burmanniaceae| , Dioscoreaceae, Taccaceae,  |Thismiaceae|Thismiaceae|  and Trichopodaceae.     In  |APG_II|Apg_Ii|  , a number of changes were made to Dioscoreales, as a result of an extensive study by Caddick and colleagues , using an analysis of three  |genes|Genes| ,  |rbcL|Rubisco| , atpB and  |18S_rDNA|18S_Rdna| , in addition to  |morphology|Morphology| . These studies resulted in a re-examination of the relationships between most of the genera within the order. Thismiaceae was shown to be a  |sister_group|Sister_Group|  to Burmanniaceae, and so was included in it. The  |monotypic|Monotypic|  families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae were included in Dioscoreaceae, while  |Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae|  could also be grouped within Dioscoreales.  |APG_III|Apg_Iii_System|   did not change this, so the order now comprises three families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae and Nartheciaceae.     Although further research on the deeper relationships within Dioscoreales continues, the  |APG_IV|Apg_Iv|  authors felt it was still premature to propose a restructuring of the order. Specifically these issues involve conflicting information as to the relationship between  Thismia  and Burmanniaceae, and hence whether Thismiaceae should be subsumed in the latter, or reinstated.        |Molecular_phylogenetics|Molecular_Phylogenetics|  in Dioscoreales poses special problems due to the absence of  |plastid|Plastid| |_genes|Genes|  in mycoheterotrophs. Dioscoreales is  |monophyletic|Monophyletic|  and is placed as a  |sister_order|Sister_Group|  to  |Pandanales|Pandanales| , as shown in Cladogram I.            The data for the evolution of the order is collected from molecular analyses since there are no such fossils found. It is estimated that Dioscoreales and its sister clade  |Pandanales|Pandanales|  split up around 121 million years ago during Early Cretaceous when the  |stem_group|Stem_Group|  was formed. Then it took 3 to 6 million years for the  |crown_group|Crown_Group|  to differentiate in Mid  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous| .       The three families of Dioscreales constitutes about 22 genera and about 849 species making it one of the smaller monocot orders. Of these, the largest group is  Dioscorea  with about 450 species. By contrast the second largest genus is  Burmannia  with about 60 species, and most have only one or two.     Some authors, preferring the original APG families, continue to treat Thismiaceae separately from Burmanniaceae and Taccaceae from Dioscoreaceae. But in the 2015 study of Hertwerk and colleagues, seven genera representing all three families were examined with an eight gene dataset. Dioscoreales was monophyletic and three subclades were represented corresponding to the APG families. Dioscoreaceae and Burmanniaceae were in a sister group relationship.            Named after the  |type_genus|Type_Genus|   Dioscorea , which in turn was named by  |Linnaeus|Carl_Linnaeus|  in 1753 to honour the Greek physician and botanist  |Dioscorides|Dioscorides| .       Species from this order are distributed across all of the continents except  |Antarctica|Antarctica| . They are mainly  |tropical|Tropical|  or  |subtropical|Subtropical|  representatives but however there are members of  |Dioscoreaceae|Dioscoreaceae|  and  |Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae|  families found in cooler regions of  |Europe|Europe|  and  |North_America|North_America| . Order Dioscoreales contains plants that are able to form an underground organ for reservation of  |nutritions|Nutrition|  as many other  |monocots|Monocot| . An exception is the family  |Burmanniaceae|Burmanniaceae|  which is entirely myco-heterotrophic and contains species that lack  |photosynthetic|Photosynthetic|  abilities.          The three families included in order Dioscoreales also represent three different ecological groups of plants.  |Dioscoreaceae|Dioscoreaceae|  contains mainly vines  and other crawling species .  |Nartheciaceae|Nartheciaceae|  on the other hand is a family composed of herbaceous plants with a rather lily-like appearance  while  |Burmanniaceae|Burmanniaceae|  is entirely  |myco_heterotrophic|Myco_Heterotrophic|  group.       Many members of  |Dioscoreaceae|Dioscoreaceae|  produce  |tuberous|Tuberous| |_starch|Starch| y  |roots|Root|   which form  |staple_foods|Staple_Foods|  in tropical regions. They have also been the source of  |steroids|Steroids|  for the  |pharmaceutical_industry|Pharmaceutical_Industry| , including the production of  |oral|Oral_Contraceptive_Pill| |_contraceptives|Contraceptives| .
