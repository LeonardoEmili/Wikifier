               Sulfur  is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   S and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|   16. It is  |abundant|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements| ,  |multivalent|Valence| , and  |nonmetal|Nonmetal| lic. Under  |normal_conditions|Standard_Conditions_For_Temperature_And_Pressure| , sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with a chemical formula  |S_8|Octasulfur| . Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow,  |crystal|Crystal| line solid at room temperature.     Sulfur is the tenth most common element by mass in the universe, and the fifth most common on Earth. Though sometimes found in pure,  |native|Native_Element_Minerals|  form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as  |sulfide|Sulfide_Minerals|  and  |sulfate_minerals|Sulfate_Minerals| . Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in  |ancient_India|Ancient_India| ,  |ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| ,  |China|History_Of_Chinaancient_China| , and  |Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| . In the  |Bible|Bible| , sulfur is called brimstone, which means burning stone .  Today, almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas|  and  |petroleum|Petroleum| . The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  for sulfate and phosphate  |fertilizers|Fertilizer| , and other chemical processes. The element sulfur is used in  |match|Match| es,  |insecticides|Insecticide| , and  |fungicides|Fungicide| . Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, grapefruit, and garlic are due to  |organosulfur|Organosulfur|  compounds.  |Hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.     Sulfur is an  |essential_element|Mineral|  for all life, but almost always in the form of  |organosulfur|Organosulfur_Compounds|  compounds or metal sulfides. Three  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|   and two vitamins  are organosulfur compounds. Many  |cofactors|Cofactor|  also contain sulfur, including  |glutathione|Glutathione| ,  |thioredoxin|Thioredoxin| , and  |iron–sulfur_proteins|Iron–Sulfur_Protein| .  |Disulfides|Disulfide| , S–S bonds, confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the protein  |keratin|Keratin| , found in outer skin, hair, and feathers. Sulfur is one of the core chemical elements needed for  |biochemical|Biochemical|  functioning and is an elemental  |macronutrient|Macronutrient|  for all living organisms.              Sulfur forms several polyatomic molecules. The best-known allotrope is  |octasulfur|Octasulfur| , cyclo-S 8 . The  |point_group|Point_Group|  of cyclo-S 8 is D 4d and its dipole moment is 0 D.  Octasulfur is a soft, bright-yellow solid that is odorless, but impure samples have an odor similar to that of  |match|Match| es. A strong odor called smell of sulfur actually is given off by several sulfur compounds, such as  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  and  |organosulfur|Organosulfur|  compounds. It melts at , boils at  and sublimes easily. At , below its melting temperature, cyclo-octasulfur changes from α-octasulfur to the β- |polymorph|Polymorphism| .  The structure of the S 8 ring is virtually unchanged by this phase change, which affects the intermolecular interactions. Between its melting and boiling temperatures, octasulfur changes its allotrope again, turning from β-octasulfur to γ-sulfur, again accompanied by a lower density but increased  |viscosity|Viscosity|  due to the formation of  |polymers|Polymer| . At higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs. Molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above . The density of sulfur is about 2  g/cm 3 , depending on the allotrope; all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators.       Sulfur burns with a blue flame with formation of  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide| , which has a suffocating and irritating odor. Sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in  |carbon_disulfide|Carbon_Disulfide|  and, to a lesser extent, in other nonpolar organic solvents, such as  |benzene|Benzene|  and  |toluene|Toluene| . The first and second ionization energies of sulfur are 999.6 and 2252  kJ/mol, respectively. Despite such figures, the +2 oxidation state is rare, with +4 and +6 being more common. The fourth and sixth ionization energies are 4556 and 8495.8  kJ/mol, the magnitude of the figures caused by electron transfer between orbitals; these states are only stable with strong oxidants such as  |fluorine|Fluorine| ,  |oxygen|Oxygen| , and  |chlorine|Chlorine| .    Sulfur reacts with nearly all other elements with the exception of the noble gases, even with the notoriously unreactive metal  |iridium|Iridium|  .    Some of those reactions need elevated temperatures.              Sulfur forms over 30 solid  |allotropes|Allotropy| , more than any other element.  Besides S 8 , several other rings are known.  Removing one atom from the crown gives S 7 , which is more of a deep yellow than the S 8 .  |HPLC|High-Performance_Liquid_Chromatography|  analysis of elemental sulfur reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly S 8 , but with S 7 and small amounts of S 6 .  Larger rings have been prepared, including S 12 and S 18 .        |Amorphous|Amorphous|  or plastic sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur—for example, by pouring it into cold water.  |X-ray_crystallography|X-Ray_Crystallography|  studies show that the amorphous form may have a  |helical|Helix|  structure with eight atoms per turn. The long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance  |elastic|Elasticity| , and in bulk this form has the feel of crude rubber. This form is  |metastable|Metastability_In_Molecules|  at room temperature and gradually reverts to crystalline molecular allotrope, which is no longer elastic. This process happens within a matter of hours to days, but can be rapidly catalyzed.             Sulfur has 23 known  |isotopes|Isotope| , four of which are stable: 32 S , 33 S , 34 S , and 36 S . .  |Commission_on_Isotopic_Abundances_and_Atomic_Weights|Commission_On_Isotopic_Abundances_And_Atomic_Weights|   Other than 35 S, with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 87 days and formed in  |cosmic_ray_spallation|Cosmic_Ray_Spallation|  of 40  |Ar|Argon| , the  |radioactive|Radioactivity|  isotopes of sulfur have half-lives less than 3  hours.     When  |sulfide_minerals|Sulfide_Mineral|  are precipitated, isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δS-34 values of co-genetic minerals. The differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration. The δ |C|Carbon| -13 and δS-34 of coexisting  |carbonate_minerals|Carbonate_Minerals|  and sulfides can be used to determine the  |pH|Ph|  and oxygen  |fugacity|Fugacity|  of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation.     In most  |forest|Forest|  ecosystems, sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere; weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur. Sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources, and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in  |hydrologic|Hydrology|  studies. Differences in the  |natural_abundances|Natural_Abundance|  can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34 S of ecosystem components.  |Rocky_Mountain|Rocky_Mountain|  lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have characteristic  |δ_34_S|Δ34S|  values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate.                32 S is created inside massive stars, at a depth where the temperature exceeds 2.5×10 9  K, by the  |fusion|Silicon_Burning|  of one nucleus of silicon plus one nucleus of helium.  As this nuclear reaction is part of the  |alpha_process|Alpha_Process|  that produces elements in abundance, sulfur is the 10th most common element in the universe.     Sulfur, usually as sulfide, is present in many types of  |meteorites|Meteorite| . Ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur, and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6%. It is normally present as  |troilite|Troilite|  , but there are exceptions, with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur, sulfates and other sulfur compounds.  The distinctive colors of  |Jupiters|Jupiter| |volcanic|Volcano|  moon  |Io|Io|  are attributed to various forms of molten, solid, and gaseous sulfur.           It is the fifth most common element by mass in the Earth. Elemental sulfur can be found near  |hot_springs|Hot_Spring|  and  |volcanic|Volcanic|  regions in many parts of the world, especially along the  |Pacific_Ring_of_Fire|Pacific_Ring_Of_Fire| ; such volcanic deposits are currently mined in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan. These deposits are polycrystalline, with the largest documented single crystal measuring 22×16×11  cm.  Historically,  |Sicily|Sicily|  was a major source of sulfur in the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| .      Native sulfur is synthesised by  |anaerobic_bacteria|Anaerobic_Bacteria|  acting on  |sulfate_minerals|Sulfate_Minerals|  such as  |gypsum|Gypsum|  in  |salt_domes|Salt_Dome| . Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut, Jr., Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 1985, 20th ed., p. 265-6   Significant deposits in salt domes occur along the coast of the  |Gulf_of_Mexico|Gulf_Of_Mexico| , and in  |evaporites|Evaporite|  in eastern Europe and western Asia. Native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone. Fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes were until recently the basis for commercial production in the United States, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Currently, commercial production is still carried out in the Osiek mine in Poland. Such sources are now of secondary commercial importance, and most are no longer worked.     Common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the  |sulfide_minerals|Mineralsulfides| , such as  |pyrite|Pyrite|  ,  |cinnabar|Cinnabar|  ,  |galena|Galena|  ,  |sphalerite|Sphalerite|  , and  |stibnite|Stibnite|  ; and the  |sulfate_minerals|Mineralsulfates| , such as  |gypsum|Gypsum|  ,  |alunite|Alunite|  , and  |barite|Barite|  . On Earth, just as upon Jupiters moon Io, elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions, including emissions from  |hydrothermal_vents|Hydrothermal_Vent| .          Common  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  of sulfur range from −2 to +6. Sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas| es.       Sulfur  |polycations|Polycation| , S 8 2+ , S 4 2+ and S 16 2+ are produced when sulfur is reacted with mild oxidising agents in a strongly acidic solution. Shriver, Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, 2010; pp 416 The colored solutions produced by dissolving sulfur in  |oleum|Oleum|  were first reported as early as 1804 by C.F. Bucholz, but the cause of the color and the structure of the polycations involved was only determined in the late 1960s. S 8 2+ is deep blue, S 4 2+ is yellow and S 16 2+ is red.       Treatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide| . When dissolved in water, hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic: Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. . Chemistry of the Elements , Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. .   :H 2 S  HS − + H +     Hydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals, due to their inhibition of the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain  |cytochromes|Cytochrome|  in a manner analogous to  |cyanide|Cyanide|  and  |azide|Azide|  .     Reduction of elemental sulfur gives  |polysulfides|Polysulfide| , which consist of chains of sulfur atoms terminated with S − centers:   :2 Na + S 8 → Na 2 S 8   This reaction highlights a distinctive property of sulfur: its ability to  |catenate|Catenation|  .  |Protonation|Protonation|  of these polysulfide anions produces the  |polysulfanes|Polysulfane| , H 2 S x where x 2, 3, and 4. Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 421. Ultimately, reduction of sulfur produces sulfide salts:   :16 Na + S 8 → 8 Na 2 S   The interconversion of these species is exploited in the  |sodium-sulfur_battery|Sodium-Sulfur_Battery| .     The  |radical_anion|Trisulfur|  S 3 − gives the blue color of the mineral  |lapis_lazuli|Lapis_Lazuli| .             The principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur:   :S + O 2 → SO 2    :2 SO 2 + O 2 → 2 SO 3    Multiple sulfur oxides are known; the  |sulfur-rich_oxides|Lower_Sulfur_Oxides|  include sulfur monoxide, disulfur monoxide, disulfur dioxides, and  |higher_oxides|Higher_Sulfur_Oxides|  containing peroxo groups.     Sulfur forms  |sulfur_oxoacids|Oxoacids| , some of which cannot be isolated and are only known through the salts.  |Sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide|  and  |sulfites|Sulfite|   are related to the unstable  |sulfurous_acid|Sulfurous_Acid|  .  |Sulfur_trioxide|Sulfur_Trioxide|  and  |sulfates|Sulfate|   are related to  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  . Sulfuric acid and SO 3 combine to give oleum, a solution of  |pyrosulfuric_acid|Pyrosulfuric_Acid|  in sulfuric acid.         |Thiosulfate|Thiosulfate|  salts , sometimes referred as hyposulfites , used in  |photographic_fixing|Photographic_Fixer|  and as reducing agents, feature sulfur in two oxidation states.  |Sodium_dithionite|Sodium_Dithionite|  , contains the more highly reducing  |dithionite|Dithionite|  anion .        Several sulfur halides are important to modern industry.  |Sulfur_hexafluoride|Sulfur_Hexafluoride|  is a dense gas used as an  |insulator_gas|Dielectric_Gas|  in high voltage  |transformers|Transformer| ; it is also a nonreactive and nontoxic propellant for pressurized containers.  |Sulfur_tetrafluoride|Sulfur_Tetrafluoride|  is a rarely used organic reagent that is highly toxic.   |Sulfur_dichloride|Sulfur_Dichloride|  and  |disulfur_dichloride|Disulfur_Dichloride|  are important industrial chemicals.  |Sulfuryl_chloride|Sulfuryl_Chloride|  and  |chlorosulfuric_acid|Chlorosulfuric_Acid|  are derivatives of sulfuric acid;  |thionyl_chloride|Thionyl_Chloride|  is a common reagent in  |organic_synthesis|Organic_Synthesis| .        An important S–N compound is the cage  |tetrasulfur_tetranitride|Tetrasulfur_Tetranitride|  . Heating this compound gives  |polymeric_sulfur_nitride|Polythiazyl|  , which has metallic properties even though it does not contain any  |metal|Metal|  atoms.  |Thiocyanates|Thiocyanate|  contain the SCN − group. Oxidation of thiocyanate gives  |thiocyanogen|Thiocyanogen| , 2 with the connectivity NCS-SCN.  |Phosphorus_sulfides|Phosphorus_Sulfide|  are numerous, the most important commercially being the cages P 4 S 10 and P 4 S 3 .            The principal ores of copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and other metals are sulfides. These materials tend to be dark-colored  |semiconductors|Semiconductor|  that are not readily attacked by water or even many acids. They are formed, both  |geochemically|Geochemical_Cycle|  and in the laboratory, by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with metal salts. The mineral  |galena|Galena|  was the first demonstrated semiconductor and was used as a signal  |rectifier|Rectifier|  in the  |cats_whiskers|Cats-Whisker_Detector|  of early  |crystal_radios|Crystal_Radio| . The iron sulfide called  |pyrite|Pyrite| , the so-called fools gold , has the formula FeS 2 . Vaughan, D. J.; Craig, J. R. Mineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides Cambridge University Press, Cambridge  Processing these ores, usually by  |roasting|Smelting| , is costly and environmentally hazardous. Sulfur corrodes many metals through  |tarnishing|Tarnishing| .         |Allicin|Allicin|  - |cysteine|Cysteine| , an  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid| |Methionine|Methionine| , an  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid| |Diphenyl_disulfide|Diphenyl_Disulfide| |Perfluorooctanesulfonic_acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonic_Acid| |Dibenzothiophene|Dibenzothiophene| |Penicillin|Penicillin| , an antibiotic where R is the variable group       Some of the main classes of sulfur-containing organic compounds include the following:     |Thiols|Thiol|  or mercaptans  are the sulfur analogs of  |alcohols|Alcohol| ; treatment of thiols with base gives  |thiolate|Thiolate|  ions.    |Thioethers|Thioether|  are the sulfur analogs of  |ethers|Ether| .    |Sulfonium|Sulfonium|  ions have three groups attached to a cationic sulfur center.  |Dimethylsulfoniopropionate|Dimethylsulfoniopropionate|  is one such compound, important in the marine organic  |sulfur_cycle|Sulfur_Cycle| .    |Sulfoxides|Sulfoxide|  and  |sulfones|Sulfone|  are thioethers with one and two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom, respectively. The simplest sulfoxide,  |dimethyl_sulfoxide|Dimethyl_Sulfoxide| , is a common solvent; a common sulfone is  |sulfolane|Sulfolane| .    |Sulfonic_acids|Sulfonic_Acid|  are used in many detergents.     Compounds with carbon-sulfur multiple bonds are uncommon, an exception being  |carbon_disulfide|Carbon_Disulfide| , a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide. It is used as a reagent to make the polymer  |rayon|Rayon|  and many organosulfur compounds. Unlike  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide| ,  |carbon_monosulfide|Carbon_Monosulfide|  is stable only as an extremely dilute gas, found between solar systems.      Organosulfur compounds are responsible for some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter. They are widely known as the  |odorant|Odorizer|  in domestic natural gas, garlic odor, and skunk spray. Not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations: the sulfur-containing  |monoterpenoid|Terpene|   in small concentrations is the characteristic scent of grapefruit, but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations.  |Sulfur_mustard|Sulfur_Mustard| , a potent  |vesicant|Blister_Agent| , was  |used_in_World_War_I|Chemical_Weapons_In_World_War_I|  as a disabling agent.      Sulfur-sulfur bonds are a structural component used to stiffen rubber, similar to the disulfide bridges that rigidify proteins . In the most common type of industrial curing or hardening and strengthening of natural  |rubber|Rubber| , elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form  |disulfide|Disulfide|  bridges between  |isoprene|Isoprene|  units of the polymer. This process, patented in 1843, made rubber a major industrial product, especially in automobile tires. Because of the heat and sulfur, the process was named  |vulcanization|Sulfur_Vulcanization| , after the Roman god of the forge and  |volcanism|Volcanism| .                Being abundantly available in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the  |Torah|Torah|  .  |English_translations_of_the_Bible|English_Translations_Of_The_Bible|  commonly referred to burning sulfur as brimstone , giving rise to the term  |fire-and-brimstone|Fire_And_Brimstone| |sermons|Sermon| , in which listeners are reminded of the fate of  |eternal_damnation|Damnation|  that await the unbelieving and unrepentant. It is from this part of the Bible that  |Hell|Hell|  is implied to smell of sulfur . According to the  |Ebers_Papyrus|Ebers_Papyrus| , a sulfur ointment was used in ancient  |Egypt|Egypt|  to treat granular eyelids. Sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical  |Greece|Greece| ;  this is mentioned in the  Odyssey . . www.perseus.tufts.edu. Retrieved on 16 August 2012.  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder|  discusses sulfur in book 35 of his  Natural History , saying that its best-known source is the island of  |Melos|Melos| . He mentions its use for fumigation, medicine, and bleaching cloth. Pliny the Elder on science and technology, John F. Healy, Oxford University Press, 1999, , pp. 247–249.     A natural form of sulfur known as shiliuhuang was known in China since the 6th century BC and found in  |Hanzhong|Hanzhong| .  By the 3rd century, the Chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from  |pyrite|Pyrite| . Chinese  |Daoists|Daoists|  were interested in sulfurs flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in  |traditional_Chinese_medicine|Traditional_Chinese_Medicine| . A  |Song_dynasty|Song_Dynasty|  military treatise of 1044 AD described various formulas for Chinese  |black_powder|Black_Powder| , which is a mixture of  |potassium_nitrate|Potassium_Nitrate|  ,  |charcoal|Charcoal| , and sulfur. It remains an ingredient of  |black_gunpowder|Gunpowder| .     Indian alchemists, practitioners of the science of chemicals , wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury, from the eighth century AD onwards.  In the  |rasaśāstra|Rasa_Shastra|  tradition, sulfur is called the smelly .     Early  |Europe|Europe| an  |alchemists|Alchemy|  gave sulfur a unique  |alchemical_symbol|Alchemical_Symbol| , a triangle at the top of a cross. In traditional skin treatment, elemental sulfur was used to alleviate such conditions as  |scabies|Scabies| ,  |ringworm|Ringworm| ,  |psoriasis|Psoriasis| ,  |eczema|Eczema| , and  |acne|Acne| . The mechanism of action is unknown—though elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid, which is  a mild reducing and antibacterial agent.             In 1777,  |Antoine_Lavoisier|Antoine_Lavoisier|  helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element, not a compound.     Sulfur deposits in  |Sicily|Sicily|  were the dominant source for more than a century. By the late 18th century, about 2,000 tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into  |Marseilles|Marseilles| , France, for the production of  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  for use in the  |Leblanc_process|Leblanc_Process| . In  |industrializing|Industrial_Revolution|  Britain, with the repeal of  |tariffs|Tariff|  on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged upward. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of the sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicilys backward and impoverished economy, led to the Sulfur Crisis of 1840, when  |King_Ferdinand_II|Ferdinand_Ii_Of_The_Two_Sicilies|  gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain. A peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by France.       In 1867, elemental sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in  |Louisiana|Louisiana|  and  |Texas|Texas| . The highly successful  |Frasch_process|Frasch_Process|  was developed to extract this resource.      In the late 18th century,  |furniture|Furniture|  makers used molten sulfur to produce  |decorative_inlays|Sulfur_Inlay|  in their craft. Because of the  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide|  produced during the process of melting sulfur, the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points. Pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative. With the advent of the  |contact_process|Contact_Process| , the majority of sulfur today is used to make  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  for a wide range of uses, particularly fertilizer.        Sulfur is derived from the Latin word , which was  |Hellenized|Hellenized|  to  in the erroneous belief that the Latin word came from Greek. This spelling was later reinterpreted as representing an /f/ sound and resulted in the spelling , which appears in Latin toward the end of the  |Classical_period|Classical_Antiquity| .  In 12th-century  |Anglo-French|Anglo-Norman_Language| , it was . In the 14th century, the erroneously Hellenized Latin  was restored in Middle English . By the 15th century, both full Latin spelling variants sulfur and sulphur became common in English. The parallel f~ph spellings continued in Britain until the 19th century, when the word was standardized as sulphur.  On the other hand, sulfur was the form chosen in the United States, whereas Canada uses both. The  |IUPAC|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry|  adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990 or 1971, depending on the source cited,  as did the Nomenclature Committee of the  |Royal_Society_of_Chemistry|Royal_Society_Of_Chemistry|  in 1992, restoring the spelling sulfur to Britain.  Oxford Dictionaries note that in chemistry and other technical uses ... the -f- spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in British as well as US contexts, and is increasingly used in general contexts as well.           Sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form; pyrite has also been a source of sulfur.  In volcanic regions in  |Sicily|Sicily| , in ancient times, it was found on the surface of the Earth, and the  Sicilian process  was used: sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides, with airspaces between them. Then, some sulfur was pulverized, spread over the stacked ore and ignited, causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills. Eventually the surface-borne deposits played out, and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the Sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines. Mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive, with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock, and mine-boys or  carusi  carrying baskets of ore to the surface, often through a mile or more of tunnels. Once the ore was at the surface, it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens. The conditions in Sicilian sulfur mines were horrific, prompting  |Booker_T._Washington|Booker_T._Washington|  to write I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulphur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life.      Elemental sulfur was extracted from  |salt_domes|Salt_Dome|  until the late 20th century. Sulfur is now produced as a side product of other industrial processes such as in oil refining, in which sulfur is undesired. As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource, produced by the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulfate deposits. It was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the  |Frasch_process|Frasch_Process| . In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification. Due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them, this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since 2002.          Today, sulfur is produced from petroleum,  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas| , and related fossil resources, from which it is obtained mainly as  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide| .  |Organosulfur_compounds|Organosulfur_Compound| , undesirable impurities in petroleum, may be upgraded by subjecting them to  |hydrodesulfurization|Hydrodesulfurization| , which cleaves the C–S bonds:   :R-S-R + 2 H 2 → 2 RH + H 2 S   The resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process, and also as it occurs in natural gas, is converted into elemental sulfur by the  |Claus_process|Claus_Process| . This process entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the  |comproportionation|Comproportionation|  of the two:   :3 O 2 + 2 H 2 S → 2 SO 2 + 2 H 2 O   :SO 2 + 2 H 2 S → 3 S + 2 H 2 O      Owing to the high sulfur content of the  |Athabasca_Oil_Sands|Athabasca_Oil_Sands| , stockpiles of elemental sulfur from this process now exist throughout  |Alberta|Alberta| , Canada.  Another way of storing sulfur is as a  |binder|Binder|  for concrete, the resulting product having many desirable properties .  Sulfur is still mined from surface deposits in poorer nations with volcanoes, such as Indonesia, and worker conditions have not improved much since Booker T. Washingtons days.      The world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69 million tonnes , with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1 Mt each. Countries producing more than 5 Mt are China , US , Canada and Russia . Apodaca, Lori E. . Mineral Commodity Summaries. USGS Production has been slowly increasing from 1900 to 2010; the price was unstable in the 1980s and around 2010.           Elemental sulfur is used mainly as a precursor to other chemicals. Approximately 85% is converted to  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|     In 2010, the United States produced more sulfuric acid than any other inorganic industrial chemical.  The principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing. Other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining, wastewater processing, and mineral extraction.       Sulfur reacts directly with methane to give  |carbon_disulfide|Carbon_Disulfide| , which is used to manufacture  |cellophane|Cellophane|  and  |rayon|Rayon| .  One of the uses of elemental sulfur is in  |vulcanization|Vulcanization|  of rubber, where  |polysulfide|Polysulfide|  chains crosslink organic polymers. Large quantities of  |sulfites|Sulfite|  are used to  |bleach|Bleach| |paper|Paper|  and to preserve  |dried_fruit|Dried_Fruit| . Many  |surfactants|Surfactant|  and  |detergents|Detergent|   are sulfate derivatives.  |Calcium_sulfate|Calcium_Sulfate| , gypsum, is mined on the scale of 100 million  |tonnes|Tonne|  each year for use in  |Portland_cement|Portland_Cement|  and fertilizers.     When silver-based  |photography|Photography|  was widespread, sodium and ammonium  |thiosulfate|Sodium_Thiosulfate|  were widely used as fixing agents . Sulfur is a component of  |gunpowder|Gunpowder|  .       Sulfur is increasingly used as a component of  |fertilizers|Fertilizer| . The most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is the mineral  |calcium_sulfate|Calcium_Sulfate| . Elemental sulfur is  |hydrophobic|Hydrophobic|  and cannot be used directly by plants. Over time, soil bacteria can convert it to soluble derivatives, which can then be used by plants. Sulfur improves the efficiency of other essential plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. . Sulphurinstitute.org. Retrieved on 16 August 2012. Biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating and are easier to disperse over the land in a spray of diluted slurry, resulting in a faster uptake.     The botanical requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus. It is an  |essential_nutrient_for_plant|Plant_Nutrition|  growth, root nodule formation of legumes, and immunity and defense systems. Sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in Europe.    Because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease, the deficit in the sulfur input/output is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used.          Organosulfur compounds are used in  |pharmaceuticals|Pharmaceutical| ,  |dyestuffs|Dyestuff| , and  |agrochemicals|Agrochemical| . Many drugs contain sulfur; early examples being antibacterial  |sulfonamides|Sulfonamide| , known as sulfa drugs. Sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules. Most  |β-lactam|Β-Lactam|  antibiotics, including the  |penicillins|Penicillin| ,  |cephalosporins|Cephalosporins|  and  |monolactams|Monolactam|  contain sulfur.      |Magnesium_sulfate|Magnesium_Sulfate| , known as Epsom salts when in hydrated crystal form, can be used as a  |laxative|Laxative| , a bath additive, an  |exfoliant|Exfoliant| ,  |magnesium|Magnesium|  supplement for plants, or as a  |desiccant|Desiccant| .           Elemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides. Dusting sulfur , elemental sulfur in powdered form, is a common fungicide for grapes, strawberry, many vegetables and several other crops. It has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot. In organic production, sulfur is the most important fungicide. It is the only fungicide used in  |organically|Organic_Agriculture|  farmed apple production against the main disease  |apple_scab|Apple_Scab|  under colder conditions. Biosulfur can also be used for these applications.     Standard-formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane. Wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water  |miscible|Miscibility| .   It has similar applications and is used as a  |fungicide|Fungicide|  against  |mildew|Mildew|  and other mold-related problems with plants and soil.     Elemental sulfur powder is used as an  |organic|Organic_Farming| |insecticide|Insecticide|   against  |ticks|Tick|  and  |mites|Mite| . A common method of application is dusting the clothing or limbs with sulfur powder.     A diluted solution of  |lime_sulfur|Lime_Sulfur|   is used as a dip for pets to destroy  |ringworm|Ringworm| ,  |mange|Mange| , and other  |dermatoses|Cutaneous_Conditions|  and  |parasites|Parasitism| .     Sulfur candles of almost pure sulfur were burned to  |fumigate|Fumigant|  structures and wine barrels, but are now considered too toxic for residences.       Small amounts of  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide|  gas addition  to fermented wine to produce traces of  |sulfurous_acid|Sulfurous_Acid|  and its  |sulfite|Sulfite|  salts in the mixture, has been called the most powerful tool in winemaking . Spencer, Benjamin . intowine.com. Retrieved 26 October 2011. After the yeast-fermentation stage in  |winemaking|Winemaking| , sulfites absorb oxygen and inhibit  |aerobic|Aerobic_Organism|  bacterial growth that otherwise would turn ethanol into acetic acid, souring the wine. Without this preservative step, indefinite refrigeration of the product before consumption is usually required. Similar methods go back into antiquity but modern historical mentions of the practice go to the fifteenth century. The practice is used by large industrial wine producers and small organic wine producers alike.     Sulfur dioxide and various sulfites have been used for their antioxidant antibacterial preservative properties in many other parts of the food industry. The practice has declined since reports of an allergy-like reaction of some persons to sulfites in foods.          Sulfur  is used in pharmaceutical skin preparations for the treatment of  |acne|Acne|  and other conditions. It acts as a  |keratolytic|Keratolytic|  agent and also kills bacteria, fungi,  |scabies|Scabies|  mites, and other parasites.  Precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used, in form of  |lotions|Lotion| , creams, powders, soaps, and bath additives, for the treatment of  |acne_vulgaris|Acne_Vulgaris| ,  |acne_rosacea|Acne_Rosacea| , and  |seborrhoeic_dermatitis|Seborrhoeic_Dermatitis| .      Common adverse effects include irritation of the skin at the application site, such as dryness, stinging, itching and peeling.    Sulfur can be used to create decorative  |inlays|Inlay|  in wooden furniture. After a design has been cut into the wood, molten sulfur is poured in and then scraped away so it is flush. Sulfur inlays were particularly popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, notably amongst  |Pennsylvania_German|Pennsylvania_German|  cabinetmakers. The practice soon died out, as less toxic and flammable substances were substituted. However, some modern craftsmen have occasionally revived the technique in the creation of replica pieces. ,  Popular Science , January 1, 2005.            Sulfur is an essential component of all living  |cells|Cell| . It is either the seventh or eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight, about equal in abundance to  |potassium|Potassium| , and slightly greater than sodium and chlorine. A  human body contains about 140  grams of sulfur.     In  |plants|Plant|  and  |animals|Animal| , the  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid| |cysteine|Cysteine|  and  |methionine|Methionine|  contain most of the sulfur, and the element is present in all  |polypeptides|Polypeptide| ,  |proteins|Protein| , and  |enzymes|Enzyme|  that contain these amino acids. In humans, methionine is an essential amino acid that must be ingested. However, save for the vitamins  |biotin|Biotin|  and  |thiamine|Thiamine| , cysteine and all sulfur-containing compounds in the human body can be synthesized from methionine. The enzyme  |sulfite_oxidase|Sulfite_Oxidase|  is needed for the metabolism of methionine and cysteine in humans and animals.      |Disulfide_bonds|Disulfide_Bond|  between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure. These covalent bonds between peptide chains confer extra toughness and rigidity. For example, the high strength of feathers and hair is due in part to the high content of S-S bonds with cysteine and sulfur. Eggs are high in sulfur to nourish feather formation in chicks, and the characteristic odor of rotting eggs is due to  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide| . The high disulfide bond content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and to their characteristic disagreeable odor when burned.      |Homocysteine|Homocysteine|  and  |taurine|Taurine|  are other sulfur-containing acids that are similar in structure, but not coded by  |DNA|Dna| , and are not part of the  |primary_structure|Primary_Structure|  of proteins. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -SH moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are  |coenzyme_A|Coenzyme_A|  and  |alpha-lipoic_acid|Alpha-Lipoic_Acid| .  Two of the 13 classical vitamins,  |biotin|Biotin| , and  |thiamine|Thiamine| , contain sulfur, with the latter being named for its sulfur content.     In intracellular chemistry, sulfur operates as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation. Reduced  |glutathione|Glutathione| , a sulfur-containing tripeptide, is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl moiety derived from  |cysteine|Cysteine| . The  |thioredoxins|Thioredoxin| , a class of small proteins essential to all known life, use neighboring pairs of reduced cysteines to work as general protein reducing agents, with similar effect.      |Methanogenesis|Methanogenesis| , the route to most of the worlds methane, is a multistep biochemical transformation of  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| . This conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors. These include  |coenzyme_M|Coenzyme_M| , CH 3 SCH 2 CH 2 SO 3 − , the immediate precursor to  |methane|Methane| .        Inorganic sulfur forms a part of  |iron–sulfur_clusters|Iron–Sulfur_Cluster|  as well as many copper, nickel, and iron proteins. Most pervasive are the  |ferrodoxins|Ferrodoxin| , which serve as electron shuttles in cells. In bacteria, the important  |nitrogenase|Nitrogenase|  enzymes contains an Fe–Mo–S cluster and is a  |catalyst|Catalyst|  that performs the important function of  |nitrogen_fixation|Nitrogen_Fixation| , converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins, DNA, RNA, alkaloids, and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life.    :          The sulfur cycle was the first of the  |biogeochemical_cycles|Biogeochemical_Cycle|  to be discovered. In the 1880s, while studying  |Beggiatoa|Beggiatoa|  ,  |Sergei_Winogradsky|Sergei_Winogradsky|  found that it oxidized  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  as an energy source, forming intracellular sulfur droplets. Winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation . He continued to study it together with  |Selman_Waksman|Selman_Waksman|  until the 1950s.     Sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur,  |sulfite|Sulfite| ,  |thiosulfate|Thiosulfate| , and various polythionates .  They depend on enzymes such as  |sulfur_oxygenase|Sulfur_Dioxygenase|  and  |sulfite_oxidase|Sulfite_Oxidase|  to oxidize sulfur to sulfate. Some  |lithotrophs|Lithotroph|  can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as  |chemosynthesis|Chemosynthesis| . Some  |bacteria|Bacteria|  and  |archaea|Archaea|  use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the  |electron_donor|Electron_Donor|  in chemosynthesis, a process similar to  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis|  that produces sugars and utilizes oxygen as the  |electron_acceptor|Electron_Acceptor| . The  |photosynthetic|Photosynthesis| |green_sulfur_bacteria|Green_Sulfur_Bacteria|  and  |purple_sulfur_bacteria|Purple_Sulfur_Bacteria|  and some  |lithotrophs|Lithotroph|  use elemental oxygen to carry out such oxidization of hydrogen sulfide to produce elemental sulfur , oxidation state 0. Primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean  |volcanic_vents|Hydrothermal_Vent|  oxidize hydrogen sulfide in this way with oxygen; the  |giant_tube_worm|Giant_Tube_Worm|  is an example of a large organism that uses hydrogen sulfide as food to be oxidized.     The so-called  |sulfate-reducing_bacteria|Sulfate-Reducing_Bacteria| , by contrast, breathe sulfate instead of oxygen. They use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source. They use sulfur as the electron acceptor, and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide, often into hydrogen sulfide. They can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds . The hydrogen sulfide produced by these bacteria is responsible for some of the smell of intestinal gases  and decomposition products.     Sulfur is absorbed by  |plants|Plant| |roots|Root|  from soil as  |sulfate|Sulfate|  and transported as a phosphate ester. Sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into  |cysteine|Cysteine|  and other organosulfur compounds.    :SO 4 2− → SO 3 2− → H 2 S → cysteine → methionine                Elemental sulfur is non-toxic, as are most of the soluble  |sulfate|Sulfate|  salts, such as  |Epsom_salts|Epsom_Salt| . Soluble sulfate salts are poorly absorbed and laxative. When injected parenterally, they are freely filtered by the kidneys and eliminated with very little toxicity in multi-gram amounts.     When sulfur burns in air, it produces  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide| . In water, this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites; sulfites are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and a useful  |food_additive|Food_Additive|  in small amounts. At high concentrations these acids harm the  |lungs|Human_Lungs| ,  |eyes|Human_Eyes| , or other  |tissues|Biological_Tissue| . In organisms without lungs such as insects or plants, sulfite in high concentration prevents  |respiration|Respiration| .      |Sulfur_trioxide|Sulfur_Trioxide|  and  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  are similarly highly acidic and corrosive in the presence of water. Sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent that can strip available water molecules and water components from sugar and organic tissue.      The burning of  |coal|Coal|  and/or  |petroleum|Petroleum|  by industry and  |power_plants|Power_Plants|  generates sulfur dioxide that reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid and  |sulfurous_acid|Sulfurous_Acid|  . These acids are components of  |acid_rain|Acid_Rain| , lowering the  |pH|Ph|  of  |soil|Soil|  and freshwater bodies, sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the  |environment|Environment|  and  |chemical_weathering|Chemical_Weathering|  of statues and structures. Fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from  |fossil_fuels|Fossil_Fuel|  to prevent acid rain formation. This extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production. In coal-fired power plants,  |flue_gas|Flue_Gas| es are sometimes purified. More modern power plants that use  |synthesis_gas|Synthesis_Gas|  extract the sulfur before they burn the gas.      |Hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  is as  |toxic|Toxic|  as  |hydrogen_cyanide|Hydrogen_Cyanide| , and kills by the same mechanism ,  though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause surprise poisonings from small inhaled amounts because of its disagreeable odor. Hydrogen sulfide quickly deadens the sense of smell and a victim may breathe increasing quantities without noticing the increase until severe symptoms cause death.
