        Charles Messier  was a French  |astronomer|Astronomer| . He published an  |astronomical_catalog|Astronomical_Catalog| ue consisting of 110   |nebulae|Nebula|  and faint  |star_clusters|Star_Cluster| , which came to be known as the  Messier object s. The purpose of  |the_catalogue|List_Of_Messier_Objects|  was to help astronomical observers, in particular  |comet|Comet|  hunters like himself, distinguish between permanent and  |transient|Transient_Astronomical_Event|  visually diffuse  |objects_in_the_sky|Astronomical_Object| .       Messier was born in  |Badonviller|Badonviller|  in the  |Lorraine|Lorraine|  region of  |France|Kingdom_Of_France| , the tenth of twelve children of Françoise B. Grandblaise and Nicolas Messier, a  |Court_usher|Court_Usher| . Six of his brothers and sisters died while young, and his father died in 1741. Charles interest in astronomy was stimulated by the appearance of the  |great_six_tailed_comet_in_1744|Great_Comet_Of_1744|  and by an annular  |solar_eclipse|Solar_Eclipse|  visible from his hometown on 25  July 1748.     In 1751 Messier entered the employ of  |Joseph_Nicolas_Delisle|Joseph_Nicolas_Delisle| , the astronomer of the  |French_Navy|French_Navy| , who instructed him to keep careful records of his observations. Messiers first documented observation was that of the  |Mercury_transit|Transit_Of_Mercury|  of 6  May 1753, followed by his observations journals at Cluny Hotel and at the French Navy observatories.     In 1764, Messier was made a fellow of the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society| ; in 1769, he was elected a foreign member of the  |Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences|Royal_Swedish_Academy_Of_Sciences| ; and on 30  June 1770, he was elected to the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences| .     Messier discovered 13 comets:    C/1760 B1 c/2760   C/1763 S1   C/1764 A1   C/1766 E1    |C_1769_P1|C_1769_P1| |_D_1770_L1|Lexells_Comet|     C/1771 G1   C/1773 T1   C/1780 U2   C/1788 W1   C/1793 S2   C/1798 G1   C/1785 A1      He also co-discovered Comet C/1801 N1, a discovery shared with several other observers including  |Pons|Jean_Louis_Pons| , Méchain, and Bouvard.       Near the end of his life, Messier self-published a booklet connecting the great comet of 1769 to the birth of Napoleon, who was in power at the time of publishing. According to Meyer:       Messier is buried in  |Père_Lachaise_Cemetery|Père_Lachaise_Cemetery| , Paris, in Section  11. The grave is faintly inscribed, and is near the grave of  |Frédéric_Chopin|Frédéric_Chopin| , slightly to the west and directly north, and behind the small mausoleum of the jeweller  |Abraham_Louis_Breguet|Abraham_Louis_Breguet| .             Messiers occupation as a  |comet|Comet|  hunter led him to continually come across fixed diffuse objects in the night sky which could be mistaken for comets. He compiled a  |list_of_them|List_Of_Messier_Objects| ,  in collaboration with his friend and assistant  |Pierre_Méchain|Pierre_Méchain|  , to avoid wasting time sorting them out from the comets they were looking for. The entries are now known to be 39   |galaxies|Galaxies| , 5   |planetary_nebulae|Planetary_Nebula| , 7  other types of  |nebulae|Nebula| , and 55   |star_clusters|Star_Cluster| .     Messier did his observing with a 100  mm  |refracting_telescope|Refracting_Telescope|  from Hôtel de Cluny , in downtown  |Paris|Paris| ,  |France|France| . The list he compiled only contains objects found in the area of the sky Messier could observe, from the north  |celestial_pole|Celestial_Pole|  to a declination of about −35.7°  . They are not organized scientifically by object type, or by location. The first version of Messiers catalogue contained 45  objects and was published in 1774 in the journal of the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in Paris. In addition to his own discoveries, this version included objects previously observed by other astronomers, with only 17 of the 45  objects being Messiers.  By 1780 the catalog had increased to 80  objects.     The final version of the catalogue was published in 1781, in the 1784 issue of  Connaissance des Temps .    The final  |list_of_Messier_objects|List_Of_Messier_Objects|  had grown to 103. On several occasions between 1921 and 1966, astronomers and historians discovered evidence of another seven objects that were observed either by Messier or by Méchain, shortly after the final version was published. These seven objects,  |M_104|Messier_104|  through  |M_110|Messier_110| , are accepted by astronomers as official Messier objects.     The objects Messier designations, from  |M_1|Crab_Nebula|  to M  110, are still used by professional and  |amateur_astronomers|Amateur_Astronomy|  today and their relative brightness makes them popular objects in the amateur astronomical community.          The  |lunar|Moon|  crater  |Messier|Messier|  and the  |asteroid|Asteroid| |_7359_Messier|7359_Messier|  were named in his honor.
