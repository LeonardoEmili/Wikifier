In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wongs experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didnt like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women.   In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who dont fit either of these beauty ideals. Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide over time between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers.
