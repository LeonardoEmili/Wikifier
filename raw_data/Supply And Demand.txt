           In  |microeconomics|Microeconomics| , supply and demand is an  |economic_model|Economic_Model|  of  |price_determination|Price_Determination|  in a  |market|Market| . It postulates that,  |holding_all_else_equal|Ceteris_Paribus| , in a  |competitive_market|Perfect_Competition| , the  |unit_price|Unit_Price|  for a particular  |good|Good| , or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded will equal the quantity supplied , resulting in an  |economic_equilibrium|Economic_Equilibrium|  for price and quantity transacted.       Although it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as  |functions|Function|  of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to  |Alfred_Marshall|Alfred_Marshall| , has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis.     Since determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves . By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.       A supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied by producers, depicted graphically as a supply curve. Under the assumption of  |perfect_competition|Perfect_Competition| , supply is determined by  |marginal_cost|Marginal_Cost| perfect competitors, having no influence over the market price. This is because each point on the supply curve ianswers the question If this firm is faced with this potential price, how much output will it be willing and able to sell? If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, and the firm is not faced with any fixed price, so the relevant model must become more complex.     Economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is the sum of the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price: individual firms supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.     Economists also distinguish the short-run and the long-run market supply curve. Here short run means a constant availability of one or more fixed inputs , and a fixed number of firms in the industry. In the long run, firms have a chance to adjust their producing capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long run competitors can  |enter|Market_Entry_Strategy|  or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.     The determinants of supply are:     Production costs: how much a good costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production, and/or technological advances. See  |Productivity|Productivity| .   Firms expectations about future prices   Number of suppliers       A demand schedule, depicted graphically as a  |demand_curve|Demand_Curve| , represents the amount of certain    |goods|Goods|  that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming constant all other determinants of demand, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of  |substitute_goods|Substitute_Good| , and the price of  |complementary_goods|Complementary_Good| . According to the  |law_of_demand|Law_Of_Demand| , the demand curve is always downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good. Note that regardless of the way Supply and Demand may be described, Price is plotted as the dependent variable because in a market todays prices are determined by the quantity available today , not the other way around. Tomorrows prices are a different function.     Just as the supply curve parallels the  |marginal_cost|Marginal_Cost|  curve, demand curves are parallel  |marginal_utility|Marginal_Utility| .  Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the  |opportunity_cost|Opportunity_Cost|  determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product at a certain time.     The demand curve is generally downward-sloping, but some goods have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are  |Giffen_goods|Giffen_Good|   and  |Veblen_goods|Veblen_Good|  .     By its very nature, conceptualizing a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor—that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase? If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not faced with any price, and the question is meaningless.     Like with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price. Thus, in the graph of the demand curve, individuals demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.     The determinants of demand are:   Income.   Tastes and preferences.   Prices of related goods and services.   Consumers expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.   Number of potential consumers.              Generally speaking, an equilibrium is defined to be the price-quantity pair where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.  The analysis of various equilibria is a fundamental aspect of  |microeconomics|Microeconomics| Market equilibrium     Changes in market equilibrium |Comparative_statics|Comparative_Statics|  of such a shift traces the effects from the initial equilibrium to the new equilibrium.     Demand curve shifts   When consumers increase the quantity demanded at a given price, it is referred to as an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve  to the new curve . In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from  to the higher . This raises the equilibrium quantity from  to the higher . The increase in demand has caused an increase in quantity. The increase in demand could come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point  to the point .     If the demand decreases, then the opposite happens: a shift of the curve to the left. If the demand starts at , and decreases to , the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price is the same as before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different as a result of the change in demand.     Supply curve shifts   When technological progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. For example, assume that someone invents a better way of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve  outward, to —an increase in supply. This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from  to . The equilibrium quantity increases from  to  as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. If the quantity supplied decreases, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at , and shifts leftward to , the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.     The movement of the supply curve in response to a change in a non-price determinant of supply is caused by a change in the y-intercept, the constant term of the supply equation. The supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as non-price determinants of demand change.          Partial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.     Jain proposes      The supply-and-demand model is a partial equilibrium model of  |economic_equilibrium|Economic_Equilibrium| , where the clearance on the  |market|Market|  of some specific  |goods|Good|  is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all  |substitutes|Substitute_Good|  and  |complements|Complement_Good| , as well as  |income|Income|  levels of  |consumers|Consumer|  are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a  |general_equilibrium|General_Equilibrium|  model which includes an entire economy.     Here the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study  |equilibrium|Economic_Equilibrium| ,  |efficiency|Pareto_Efficiency|  and  |comparative_statics|Comparative_Statics| . The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach makes the model considerably more tractable, but may produce results which, while seemingly precise, do not effectively model real world economic   phenomena.     Partial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.     Hence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.      |Léon_Walras|Léon_Walras|  first formalized the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist  |Antoine_Augustin_Cournot|Antoine_Augustin_Cournot|  and English political economist  |Alfred_Marshall|Alfred_Marshall|  who developed tractable models to analyze an economic system.       The model of supply and demand also applies to various specialty markets.     The model is commonly applied to  |wages|Wage| , in the market for  |labor|Labour| . The typical roles of supplier and demander are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The equilibrium price for a certain type of labor is the wage rate.  However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence. For instance, he cites Kaufman and Hotchkiss : For adult men, nearly all studies find the labour supply curve to be negatively sloped or backward bending.      In both  |classical|Classical_Economics|  and  |Keynesian|Keynesian_Economics|  economics, the  |money_market|Money_Market|  is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with  |interest_rates|Interestmarket_Interest_Rates|  being the price. The  |money_supply|Money_Supply|  may be a vertical supply curve, if the  |central_bank|Central_Bank|  of a country chooses to use  |monetary_policy|Monetary_Policy|  to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; in this case the money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand, Basij J. Moore, Horizontalists and Verticalists: The Macroeconomics of Credit Money, Cambridge University Press, 1988 the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a fixed interest rate and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The demand for money intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate.        Demand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity, and other  |data|Data|  with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with  simultaneous-equation methods of estimation in  |econometrics|Econometrics| . Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant structural coefficients, the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The  Parameter identification problem  is a common issue in structural estimation. Typically, data on  |exogenous|Exogenous_Variable|  variables  are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to structural estimation is  |reduced-form|Reduced_Form|  estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.       Demand and supply have also been generalized to explain  |macroeconomic|Macroeconomic|  variables in a  |market_economy|Market_Economy| , including the  |quantity_of_total_output|Real_Gdp|  and the general  |price_level|Price_Level| . The  |aggregate_demand-aggregate_supply_model|Ad-As_Model|  may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to  |microeconomic|Microeconomic|  uses of demand and supply, different theoretical considerations apply to such  |macroeconomic|Macroeconomic|  counterparts as  |aggregate_demand|Aggregate_Demand|  and  |aggregate_supply|Aggregate_Supply| . Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate  |money_supply|Money_Supply|  and money demand to  |interest_rates|Interest_Rate| , and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.       The 256th couplet of  |Tirukkural|Tirukkural| , which was composed at least 2000 years ago, says that if people do not consume a product or service, then there will not be anybody to supply that product or service for the sake of price . C Chendroyaperumal .      According to Hamid S. Hosseini, the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century Syrian scholar  |Ibn_Taymiyyah|Ibn_Taymiyyah| , who wrote: If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down.  .          |John_Lockes|John_Locke|  1691 work Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money. John Locke  includes an early and clear description of supply and demand and their relationship. In this description demand is  |rent|Economic_Rent| |James_Denham-Steuart|James_Denham-Steuart|  in his Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy, published in 1767.  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith|  used the phrase in his 1776 book  The Wealth of Nations , and  |David_Ricardo|David_Ricardo|  titled one chapter of his 1817 work  Principles of Political Economy and Taxation  On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price .  Thomas Robert Malthus used the phrase supply and demand twenty times in the second edition of the Essay on Population in 1803. Groenewegen P. ‘Supply and Demand’. In: Palgrave Macmillan The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London     In The Wealth of Nations, Smith generally assumed that the supply price was fixed but that its merit would decrease as its scarcity increased, in effect what was later called the law of demand also. Ricardo, in Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand.  |Antoine_Augustin_Cournot|Antoine_Augustin_Cournot|  first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, including diagrams.     During the late 19th century the marginalist school of thought emerged. The main innovators of this approach where  |Stanley_Jevons|William_Stanley_Jevons| ,  |Carl_Menger|Carl_Menger| , and  |Léon_Walras|Léon_Walras| . The key idea was that the price was set by the subjective value of a good at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smiths thoughts on determining the supply price.

Much of the buying and selling are now conducted online using platforms such as Amazon and eBay, where the profiles of the customers are captured and analyzed.  |Tshilidzi_Marwala|Tshilidzi_Marwala|  and  |Evan_Hurwitz|Evan_Hurwitz|  in their book  observed that the advent of artificial intelligence and related technologies such as flexible manufacturing offers the opportunity for individualized demand and supply curves to be generated. This has been found to reduce the degree of arbitrage in the market, allow for individualized pricing for the same product and brings  |fairness|Equality_Of_Outcome|  and efficiency into the market.       The philosopher  |Hans_Albert|Hans_Albert|  has argued that the  |ceteris_paribus|Ceteris_Paribus|  conditions of the marginalist theory rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing.
