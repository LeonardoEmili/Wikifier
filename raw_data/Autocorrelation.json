In this calculation we do not perform the carry-over operation during addition as is usual in normal multiplication. Note that we can halve the number of operations required by exploiting the inherent symmetry of the autocorrelation. If the signal happens to be periodic, i.e. x, then we get a circular autocorrelation  where the left and right tails of the previous autocorrelation sequence will overlap and give R which has the same period as the signal sequence x.
