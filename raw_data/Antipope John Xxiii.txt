          Baldassarre Cossa was  |Pisan|Council_Of_Pisa| |antipope|Antipope|  John XXIII during the  |Western_Schism|Western_Schism| . The Catholic Church regards him as an  |antipope|Antipope| , as he opposed  |Pope_Gregory_XII|Pope_Gregory_Xii|  whom the Catholic Church now recognizes as the rightful successor of Saint Peter.     Cossa was born in the  |Kingdom_of_Naples|Kingdom_Of_Naples| . In 1403, he served as a  |papal_legate|Papal_Legate|  in Romagna. He participated in the  |Council_of_Pisa|Council_Of_Pisa|  in 1408, which sought to end the Western Schism with the election of a third alternate pope. In 1410, he succeeded  |Antipope_Alexander_V|Antipope_Alexander_V| , taking the name John XXIII. At the instigation of  |Sigismund,_King_of_the_Romans|Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , Pope John called the  |Council_of_Constance|Council_Of_Constance|  of 1413, deposed John XXIII and Benedict XIII, accepted Gregory XIIs resignation, and elected  |Pope_Martin_V|Pope_Martin_V|  to replace them, thus ending the schism. John XXIII was tried for various crimes, though later accounts question the veracity of those accusations.       Baldassarre Cossa was born on the island of  |Procida|Procida|  in the  |Kingdom_of_Naples|Kingdom_Of_Naples|  to the family of Giovanni Cossa, lord of Procida. Initially he followed a military career, taking part in the  |Angevin-Neapolitan_war|Kingdom_Of_Naples| . His two brothers were sentenced to death for  |piracy|Piracy|  by  |Ladislaus_of_Naples|Ladislaus_Of_Naples| .      He studied law at the  |University_of_Bologna|University_Of_Bologna|  and obtained doctorates in both civil and canon law. Probably at the prompting of his family, in 1392 he entered the service of  |Pope_Boniface_IX|Pope_Boniface_Ix| , first working in Bologna and then in Rome.  In 1386 he is listed as canon of the cathedral of Bologna. In 1396, he became archdeacon in Bologna. He became  |Cardinal_deacon|Cardinal_Cardinal_Deacon|  of Saint Eustachius in 1402 and  |Papal_legate|Papal_Legate|  in  |Romagna|Romagna|  in 1403.  |Johann_Peter_Kirsch|Johann_Peter_Kirsch|  describes Cossa as utterly worldly-minded, ambitious, crafty, unscrupulous, and immoral, a good soldier but no churchman .  Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 January 2016 At this time Cossa also had some links with local robber bands, which were often used to intimidate his rivals and attack carriages. These connections added to his influence and power in the region.           Cardinal Cossa was one of the seven  |cardinals|Cardinal|  who, in May 1408, withdrew their allegiance from  |Pope_Gregory_XII|Pope_Gregory_Xii| , stating that he had broken his solemn oath not to create new cardinals without consulting them in advance. In company with those cardinals who had been following  |Antipope_Benedict_XIII|Antipope_Benedict_Xiii|  of Avignon, they convened the  |Council_of_Pisa|Council_Of_Pisa| , of which Cossa became a leading figure. The aim of the council was to end the schism; to this end they deposed both Gregory XII and Benedict XIII and elected a new pope  |Alexander_V|Antipope_Alexander_V|  in 1409. Gregory and Benedict ignored this decision, however, so that there were now three simultaneous claimants to the  |papacy|Papacy| .       Alexander V died soon after, and on 25 May 1410 Cossa was consecrated a bishop, taking the name John XXIII. He had become an  |ordained_priest|Priesthood|  only one day earlier. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by  |France|Kingdom_Of_France| ,  |England|Kingdom_Of_England| ,  |Bohemia|Kingdom_Of_Bohemia| ,  |Portugal|Kingdom_Of_Portugal| , parts of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and  |Venice|Republic_Of_Venice|  and the  |Patriarchate_of_Aquileia|Patriarchate_Of_Aquileia| ; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the  |Kingdoms_of_Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon| ,  |Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile| ,  |Sicily|Kingdom_Of_Sicily|  and  |Scotland|Kingdom_Of_Scotland|  and Gregory XII was still favored by  |Ladislaus_of_Naples|Ladislaus_Of_Naples| ,  |Carlo_I_Malatesta|Carlo_I_Malatesta| , the  |princes_of_Bavaria|List_Of_Rulers_Of_Bavaria| ,  |Louis_III|Louis_Iii,_Elector_Palatine| ,  |Elector_Palatine|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate| , and parts of Germany and  |Poland|Kingdom_Of_Poland| . Lightbown, R.W. Donatello & Michelozzo. London: Harvey Miller. pp. 4–5. John XXIII made the  |Medici_Bank|Medici_Bank|  the bank of the papacy, contributing considerably to the familys wealth and prestige.      The main enemy of John was  |Ladislaus_of_Naples|Ladislaus_Of_Naples| , who protected Gregory XII in Rome. Following his election as pope, John spent a year in Bologna and then joined forces with  |Louis_II_of_Anjou|Louis_Ii_Of_Anjou|  to march against Ladislaus. An initial victory proved short-lived and Ladislaus retook Rome in May 1413, forcing John to flee to Florence. In Florence he met  |Sigismund|Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , King of the Romans. Sigismund wanted to end the schism and urged John to call a general council. John did so with hesitation, at first trying to have the council held in Italy . The  |Council_of_Constance|Council_Of_Constance|  was convened on 30 October 1413. During the third session, rival  |Pope_Gregory_XII|Pope_Gregory_Xii|  authorized the council as well. The council resolved that all three popes should abdicate and a new pope be elected.        In March, John escaped from Constance disguised as a postman. According to the Klingenberger Chronicle, written by a noble client of  |Frederick_IV,_Duke_of_Austria|Frederick_Iv,_Duke_Of_Austria| , John XXIII travelled down the Rhine to Schaffhausen in a boat, while Frederick accompanied him with a small band of men on horseback. There was a huge outcry in Constance when it was discovered that John had fled, and Sigismund was furious about this setback to his plans for ending the Schism. The King of the Romans issued orders to all the powers on the Upper Rhine and in Swabia stating that he had declared Frederick to be an outlaw and that his lands and possessions were forfeit. In due course this led to a great deal of political upheaval and many Austrian losses in the region, notably in  |Aargau|Aargau|  to the  |Swiss_Confederation|Swiss_Confederation| .     In the meantime, Pope John XXIII and Frederick fled further downriver along the Rhine to the town of  |Freiburg_im_Breisgau|Freiburg_Im_Breisgau| , which recognised the duke of Austria as its lord. There Sigismunds lieutenant  |Ludwig_III,_Elector_Palatine|Ludwig_Iii,_Elector_Palatine|  caught up with them. He convinced Frederick that he stood to lose too much by harbouring the fugitive pope, and the Austrian duke agreed to give himself and John up and return to Constance. Brandmüller, Walter. Das Konzil von Konstanz, 1414–1418        During his absence John was deposed by the council, and upon his return he was tried for heresy, simony, schism and immorality, and found guilty on all counts.  |Gibbon|Edward_Gibbon|  wrote, The more scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of Christ was accused only of piracy, rape, sodomy, murder and incest. Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, New York: The Heritage Press, 1946, vol. 3, p. 2417 John was given over to  |Ludwig_III,_Elector_Palatine|Ludwig_Iii,_Elector_Palatine| , who imprisoned him for several months in  |Heidelberg|Heidelberg|  and  |Mannheim|Mannheim| .   The last remaining claimant in Avignon,  |Benedict_XIII|Antipope_Benedict_Xiii| , refused to resign and was excommunicated.  |Martin_V|Pope_Martin_V|  was elected as new pope in 1417.            Cossa was again imprisoned in Germany. He was freed in 1418 after a heavy ransom was paid by the Medici. He went to Florence, where he submitted to Martin V, who made him  |Cardinal_Bishop_of_Frascati|Cardinal_Bishop_Of_Frascati| . Cossa died only a few months later.     The Medici oversaw the construction of  |his_magnificent_tomb|Tomb_Of_Antipope_John_Xxiii|  by  |Donatello|Donatello|  and  |Michelozzo|Michelozzo|  in the  |Battistero_di_San_Giovanni|Battistero_Di_San_Giovanni|  in Florence. Pope Martin V protested in vain against the inscription on the sarcophagus: John the former pope .     J.P. Kirsch remarks that Undeniably secular and ambitious, his moral life was not above reproach, and his unscrupulous methods in no wise accorded with the requirements of his high office  ... the heinous crimes of which his opponents in the council accused him were certainly gravely exaggerated. One historian concluded that John was a great man in temporal things, but a complete failure and worthless in spiritual things .       John is portrayed by  |Steven_Waddington|Steven_Waddington|  in the 2016 television series  Medici: Masters of Florence .    John is also a main character in  A Trembling Upon Rome  by  |Richard_Condon|Richard_Condon| .     The 1932 thriller ‘Safe Custody’ by  |Dornford_Yates|Dornford_Yates| , references John. Listing the members of an objectionable family, a character in the story says:     “Then we come to his nephew—a promising lad of fifteen. He lies, steals, smells, assaults the servants and abuses any animal which he is satisfied will not retaliate. If Gibbon may be believed, Pope John the Twenty-third as a stripling must have resembled him.”          He should not be confused with  |Pope_John_XXIII|Pope_John_Xxiii|  of the twentieth century. When  |Angelo_Roncalli|Pope_John_Xxiii|  was elected pope in 1958, there was some confusion as to whether he would be John XXIII or John XXIV; he then declared that he was John XXIII to put this question to rest. There was no  |John_XX|Pope_John_Xx| .
