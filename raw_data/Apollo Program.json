Space historian James Hansen concludes that:       The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship. Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, The LM .. was finally dropped, because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the SPS . Letterman, p. 404 . Ironically, just such a failure happened on Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the CSM without electrical power. The lunar module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely.           thu command module is on exhibit in the Meteor Crater Visitor Center in Winslow, Arizona .     Fagets preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module, supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedys Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a command and service Module in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module.

Preliminary cost analysis by NASA estimated $7 billion - $12 billion for a crewed lunar landing effort. NASA Administrator James Webb increased this estimate to $20 billion before reporting it to Vice President Johnson in April 1961.      Project Apollo was a massive undertaking, representing the largest research and development project in peacetime. At its peak, it employed over 400,000 employees and contractors around the country and accounted for more than half of NASAs total spending in the 1960s.  It proved unsustainable.     After the first Moon landing, public and political interest waned, including that of President Nixon, who wanted to rein in federal spending.
