In both law and common understanding, a choice made under duress is discounted as lacking in free will. Mahler converted as a mere formality under compulsion of a bigoted law that barred Jews from directorship of the Vienna Hofoper. Mahler himself joked about the conversion with his Jewish friends, and, no doubt, would view with bitter amusement the obtuseness of Ms. Raabes understanding of the cruel choice forced on him: either convert to Christianity or forfeit the professional post for which you are supremely destined. When Mahler was asked why he never composed a Mass, he answered bluntly that he could never, with any degree of artistic or spiritual integrity, voice the Credo. He was a confirmed agnostic, a doubter and seeker, never a soul at rest or at peace. Joel Martel, , New York Times.   He was born a Jew but has been described as a life-long agnostic. At one point he converted to Catholicism, purely for the purpose of obtaining a job that he coveted – director of the Court Opera of Vienna. It was unthinkable for a Jew to hold such a prestigious position, hence the utilitarian conversion to the state religion.

Thomas Henry Huxley : English biologist and coiner of the term agnosticism. Every variety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented there, and expressed itself with entire openness; most of my colleagues were ists of one sort or another; and, however kind and friendly they might be, I, the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with, could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset the historical fox when, after leaving the trap in which his tail remained, he presented himself to his normally elongated companions. So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of agnostic. http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/thomashuxley/huxleywace/part02.html Part 2 – Agnosticism, by T. H.

He studied science because he considered that by doing this he could better understand the nature of the god that he believed in – he thought that a supernatural agent had created the laws of nature. The same is true of virtually all the leading scientists in the Western world, such as Galileo and Newton, who lived after al-Haytham, until about the middle of the twentieth century. There were a few exceptions – Pierre Laplace, Siméon Poisson, Albert Einstein, Paul Dirac and Marie Curie were naturalists for example.

Eugenie Richet was a highly religious woman; Charles made his first communion with real devotion and fleetingly promised to enter the priesthood, but he abandoned his childhood faith during his adolescence. As an adult, he became an agnostic, a freethinker and a Freemason, who was nonetheless fairly tolerant of his wife Amelies continued faith. Mark S.

Along with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. Rotblat: I have to admit, however, that there are really many things that I do not know. I am not a particularly religious person, and this is the reason for my agnosticism. To be an agnostic simply means that I do not know and will keep seeking the answer for eternity. This is my response to questions about religion.

By his early teens, Simpson had given up being a Christian, although he had not formally declared himself an atheist. At college he began the gradual development of what might best be called positivistic agnosticism: a belief that the world could be known and explained by ordinary empirical observation without recourse to supernatural forces.

Known for producing a number of discoveries about processes in the atmosphere. Though research activities dominated his working days, Faraday never neglected to meet with his Christian friends for worship and prayer. We quote again from John Tyndall who, it should be said, was an agnostic: I think that a good deal of Faradays week-day strength and persistency might be referred to his Sunday Exercises. He drinks from a fount on Sunday which refreshes his soul for a week. The Biblical Creation Society,  , 2002. The odd subtext of that offer was that Faraday was intensely religious, and Tyndall was as fascinated with Faradays convictions as he was with prayer, miracles, and cosmology. Faraday drinks from a fount on Sunday which refreshes his soul for a week, said the agnostic Tyndall with obvious fascination – and, perhaps, a trace of envy. John H.

We found Virchow to be an agnostic as early as 1845.

Wigner is important for having laid the foundation for the theory of  |symmetries|Symmetry_In_Physics|  in  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  as well as for his research into the structure of the  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus| . It was Eugene Wigner who first identified  |Xe-135|Xe-135|  poisoning in nuclear reactors, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as Wigner poisoning. Wigner is also important for his work in pure mathematics, having authored a number of  |theorems|Mathematical_Theorem| .     |Frank_Wilczek|Frank_Wilczek|  : American theoretical physicist.
