Buchanan and the PRANG Muñiz Air Base .

The United States  |Coast_Guard|Coast_Guard|  has a significant presence in Puerto Rico. Located on what was formerly  |Ramey_Air_Force_Base|Ramey_Air_Force_Base| , the Coast Guard maintains what is now referred to as Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen . HH-65C helicopters operate out of Borinquen performing search-and-rescue as well as law-enforcement missions. On a continual basis, Coast Guard fixed-wing airplanes, such as the  |C-130_Hercules|C-130_Hercules|  search-and-rescue plane, stationed primarily in  |Florida|Florida|  fly to Puerto Rico to support these missions.      |U.S._Coast_Guard|U.S._Coast_Guard|  cutters visit Puerto Rican waters periodically in their missions of coastal patrol and search-and-rescue.  |U.S._Navy|U.S._Navy|  ships visit Puerto Rican waters on an as-required basis, just like they visit all American waters, international oceans, and foreign ones, too.     On La Puntilla in  |Old_San_Juan|Old_San_Juan|  the Coast Guard base its small, but capable surface fleet of several  long cutters and other patrol boats. These boats and cutters work hand in hand with the air station responding to any mission that they may be called upon to perform.
