     :This page refers only to birds that have gone extinct since 1500; for the list of birds known only from fossils, see List of fossil bird genera . For birds extinct in Late Quaternary prehistoric times and usually known from specimens not completely fossilized, see List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species .     Over 190 species of  |birds|Bird|  have become  |extinct|Extinction|  since 1500, and the rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by  |Hawaii|Hawaii| , where 30% of all known recently extinct bird  |taxa|Taxa|  originally lived. Other areas, such as  |Guam|Guam| , have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced  |brown_tree_snake|Brown_Tree_Snake| .     Currently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.     Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The disproportionate number of  |rails|Rallidae|  in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in  |List_of_Late_Quaternary_prehistoric_bird_species|List_Of_Late_Quaternary_Prehistoric_Bird_Species| .     The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day . Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record ; for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists.               |Aepyornithiformes|Aepyornithiformes| |Elephant_bird|Elephant_Bird| , Aepyornis maximus and/or A. medius      |Dinornithiformes|Dinornithiformes| |Upland_moa|Upland_Moa| , Megalapteryx didinus    |Apterygiformes|Apterygiformes| Apteryx occidentalis   :A doubtful form known from a single bird; may be a  |little_spotted_kiwi|Little_Spotted_Kiwi|  subspecies or a hybrid between that species and the  |rowi|Rowi| .      |Anseriformes|Anseriformes| |Ducks|Duck| ,  |geese|Goose|  and  |swans|Swan| |Crested_shelduck|Crested_Shelduck| , Tadorna cristata   :A  |relict_species|Relict|  from northeastern Asia. Officially  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species|  due to recent unconfirmed reports.    |Réunion_sheldgoose|Réunion_Sheldgoose| , Alopochen kervazoi    |Mauritius_sheldgoose|Mauritius_Sheldgoose| , Alopochen mauritianus    |Amsterdam_wigeon|Amsterdam_Wigeon| , Mareca marecula   Saint Paul Island duck, Anas sp.   : Only known by a painting from 1793. Might be identical with the Amsterdam wigeon or a distinct species or subspecies.    |Mascarene_teal|Mascarene_Teal| , Anas theodori    |Mariana_mallard|Mariana_Mallard| , Anas oustaleti    |Finschs_duck|Finschs_Duck| , Chenonetta finschi    |Pink-headed_duck|Pink-Headed_Duck| , Rhodonessa caryophyllacea – a reclassification into the genus Netta is recommended, but not generally accepted.   :Officially  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| ; recent surveys have failed to rediscover it.   Réunion pochard, Aythya cf. innotata   :A bone of a pochard found on Réunion seems to resolve the reports of canards other than the  |Mauritian_duck|Mauritian_Duck|  having occurred on the island. The taxonomic status of this form cannot be resolved until more material is found, however.    |Labrador_duck|Labrador_Duck| , Camptorhynchus labradorius     |New_Zealand_merganser|New_Zealand_Merganser| , Mergus australis      |Galliformes|Galliformes| |Quails|Quail|  and relatives   See also Bokaak bustard under  |Gruiformes|Gruiformes|  below   The  |pile-builder_megapode|Pile-Builder_Megapode| , Megapodius molistructor may have survived on New Caledonia to the late 18th century as evidenced by descriptions of the bird named  Tetrao australis  and later  Megapodius andersoni .   The  |Viti_Levu_scrubfowl|Viti_Levu_Scrubfowl| , Megapodius amissus of  |Viti_Levu|Viti_Levu|  and possibly  |Kadavu|Kadavu_Island| ,  |Fiji|Fiji| , may have survived to the early 19th or even the 20th century as suggested by circumstantial evidence.   Raoul Island scrubfowl, Megapodius sp.   :A megapode is said to have inhabited Raoul Island until the population was wiped out in a volcanic eruption. It is not clear whether the birds represent a distinct taxon or derive from a prehistoric introduction by Polynesian seafarers.    |New_Zealand_quail|New_Zealand_Quail| , Coturnix novaezelandiae    |Himalayan_quail|Himalayan_Quail| , Ophrysia superciliosa   :Officially  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| . Not recorded with certainty since 1876, but thorough surveys are still required, and there was a recent set of possible sightings around  |Naini_Tal|Naini_Tal|  in 2003. A little-known native name from Western  |Nepal|Nepal|  probably refers to this bird, but for various reasons, no survey for Ophrysia has ever been conducted in that country, nor is it generally assumed to occur there .      |Charadriiformes|Charadriiformes| |Shorebirds|Shorebird| ,  |gulls|Gull|  and  |auks|Auk| |Javan_lapwing|Javan_Lapwing| , Vanellus macropterus   :Officially classified as  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| , but as this conspicuous bird has not been recorded since 1940, it is almost certainly extinct.    |Christmas_sandpiper|Christmas_Sandpiper| , Prosobonia cancellata     |Tahiti_sandpiper|Tahiti_Sandpiper| , Prosobonia leucoptera    |White-winged_sandpiper|White-Winged_Sandpiper| , Prosobonia ellisi   :Doubtfully distinct from P. leucoptera.    |North_Island_snipe|North_Island_Snipe| , Coenocorypha barrierensis     |South_Island_snipe|South_Island_Snipe| , Coenocorypha iredalei    |Eskimo_curlew|Eskimo_Curlew| , Numenius borealis   :May still exist; officially classified as  |critically_endangered,_possibly_extinct|Endangered_Species| .    |Slender-billed_curlew|Slender-Billed_Curlew| , Numenius tenuirostris   :May still exist; officially classified as  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| . A few birds were recorded in 2004, following several decades of increasing rarity. There was an unconfirmed sighting in Albania in 2007. A survey to find out whether this bird still exists is currently being undertaken by the RSPB .    |Great_auk|Great_Auk| , Pinguinus impennis    |Canary_Islands_oystercatcher|Canary_Islands_Oystercatcher| , Haematopus meadewaldoi   :Later sightings of black oystercatchers off  |Senegal|Senegal|  were not likely to be of this sedentary species, but two records from  |Tenerife|Tenerife|  - the last in 1981 - may be.      |Gruiformes|Gruiformes| |Rails|Rallidae|  and allies - probably  |paraphyletic|Paraphyletic| |Antillean_cave_rail|Antillean_Cave_Rail| , Nesotrochis debooyi, known by pre-Columbian bones from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Stories of an easy-to-catch bird named carrao heard by Alexander Wetmore in 1912 on Puerto Rico might refer to this species.    |Hawkins_rail|Hawkinss_Rail| , Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi    |Red_rail|Red_Rail| , Aphanapteryx bonasia    |Rodrigues_rail|Rodrigues_Rail| , Erythromachus leguati    |Bar-winged_rail|Bar-Winged_Rail| , Nesoclopeus poecilopterus    |Dieffenbachs_rail|Dieffenbachs_Rail| , Gallirallus dieffenbachii    |Tahiti_rail|Tahiti_Rail| , Hypotaenidia pacificus    |Wake_Island_rail|Wake_Island_Rail| , Hypotaenidia wakensis    |Tongatapu_rail|Tongatapu_Rail| , Gallirallus hypoleucus    |New_Caledonian_rail|New_Caledonian_Rail| , Gallirallus lafresnanayanus   :Officially classified as  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| , the last records were in 1984 and it seems that all available habitat is overrun by feral pigs and dogs, which prey on this bird.   Vavau rail, Gallirallus cf. vekamatolu   :This bird is known only from a drawing by the 1793  |Malaspina|Alessandro_Malaspina|  expedition, apparently depicting a species of Gallirallus. The Eua rail, Gallirallus vekamatolu, is known from prehistoric bones found on  |Eua|Eua| , but this species is almost certainly not G. vekamatolu, as that bird was flightless and hence is unlikely to have settled three distant islands. However, it probably was a close relative.   Norfolk Island rail, Gallirallus sp., may be the bird shown on a bad watercolor illustration made around 1800.    |Chatham_rail|Chatham_Rail| , Cabalus modestus    |Réunion_rail|Réunion_Rail|  or Dubois wood-rail, Dryolimnas augusti    |Ascension_crake|Ascension_Crake| , Mundia elpenor – formerly Atlantisia  |Saint_Helena_crake|Saint_Helena_Crake| , Porzana astrictocarpus    |Laysan_rail|Laysan_Rail| , Porzana palmeri    |Hawaiian_rail|Hawaiian_Rail| , Porzana sandwichensis    |Kosrae_crake|Kosrae_Crake| , Porzana monasa    |Millers_rail|Millers_Rail| , Porzana nigra   :Known only from paintings and descriptions; taxonomic status uncertain, as the material is often believed to refer to the extant  |spotless_crake|Spotless_Crake| .    |Saint_Helena_swamphen|Saint_Helena_Swamphen| , Aphanocrex podarces – formerly Atlantisia  |Lord_Howe_swamphen|Lord_Howe_Swamphen| , Porphyrio albus     |Réunion_swamphen|Réunion_Swamphen|  or Oiseau bleu, Porphyrio coerulescens   :Known only from descriptions. Former existence of a Porphyrio on Réunion is fairly certain, but not proven to date.    |Marquesas_swamphen|Marquesas_Swamphen| , Porphyrio paepae   :May have survived to c.  1900. In the lower right corner of  |Paul_Gauguins|Paul_Gauguin|  1902 painting Le Sorcier dHiva Oa ou le Marquisien à la cape rouge there is a bird which resembles native descriptions of P. paepae.    |North_Island_takahē|North_Island_Takahē| , Porphyrio mantelli, known from subfossil bones found in New Zealands North Island; may have survived to 1894 or later.    |New_Caledonian_gallinule|New_Caledonian_Gallinule| , Porphyrio kukwiedei from New Caledonia, Melanesia, may have survived into historic times. The native name ndino is thought to refer to this bird.    |Samoan_wood_rail|Samoan_Wood_Rail| , Gallinula pacifica   :Probably better placed in the genus Pareudiastes, unconfirmed reports from the late 20th century suggest it still survives in small numbers and therefore it is officially classified as  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| .    |Makira_woodhen|Makira_Woodhen| , Gallinula silvestris   :Only known from a single specimen, this rail is probably better placed in its own genus, Edithornis. There are some unconfirmed recent records that suggest it still survives, and thus it is officially classified as  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| .    |Tristan_moorhen|Tristan_Moorhen| , Gallinula nesiotis    |Mascarene_coot|Mascarene_Coot| , Fulica newtonii   Fernando de Noronha rail, Rallidae gen. et sp. indet.   :A distinct species of rail inhabited Fernando de Noronha island, but it has not been formally described yet. Probably was extant at first Western contact.   Tahitian goose , Rallidae gen. et sp. indet.   :Early travelers to Tahiti reported a goose that was found in the mountains. Altogether, a species of rail in the genus Porphyrio seems to be the most likely choice.   Bokaak bustard , Rallidae? gen. et sp. indet. Bokaak   :An unidentified terrestrial bird is mentioned in an early report from Bokaak in the Marshall Islands. It is described as a  |bustard|Bustard|  and may have been a rail or a  |megapode|Megapode| . In the former case it may have been a vagrant of an extant species; in any case, no bird that could be described as bustard-like is found on Bokaak today. Spennemann   Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. Amsterdam Island   :Unknown rail from  |Amsterdam_Island|Île_Amsterdam| ; one specimen found, but not recovered. Extinct by 1800, or it may have been a vagrant of an extant species.      |Podicipediformes|Podicipediformes| |Grebes|Grebe| |Colombian_grebe|Colombian_Grebe| , Podiceps andinus    |Alaotra_grebe|Alaotra_Grebe| , Tachybaptus rufolavatus   :Officially declared extinct in 2010, 25 years after the last official sighting. Declined through habitat destruction and hybridization with the  |little_grebe|Little_Grebe| . Disappeared from only known location in the 1980s.    |Atitlán_grebe|Atitlán_Grebe| , Podilymbus gigas      |Cathartiformes|Cathartiformes|  Sarcoramphus sacra   A bird supposedly similar to the king vulture identified by  |William_Bartram|William_Bartram|  on his travels in the 1770s. Skeptics have stated that it is likely based on a misidentification of the  |northern_caracara|Northern_Caracara| , although evidence has increasingly shifted towards it being a valid species that existed, based on an independent illustration of a near-identical bird made several decades earlier by  |Eleazar_Albin|Eleazar_Albin| . See  |King_vulture|King_Vulture|  article for discussion.      |Pelecaniformes|Pelecaniformes| |Pelicans|Pelican|  and related birds      |Bermuda_night_heron|Bermuda_Night_Heron| , Nyctanassa carcinocatactes   :Sometimes assigned to the genus Nycticorax.    |Réunion_night_heron|Réunion_Night_Heron| , Nycticorax duboisi    |Mauritius_night_heron|Mauritius_Night_Heron| , Nycticorax mauritianus    |Rodrigues_night_heron|Rodrigues_Night_Heron| , Nycticorax megacephalus    |Ascension_night_heron|Ascension_Night_Heron| , Nycticorax olsoni   :Known only from subfossil bones, but the description of a flightless Ascension bird by  |André_Thévet|André_Thévet|  cannot be identified with anything other than this species.    |New_Zealand_little_bittern|New_Zealand_Little_Bittern| , Ixobrychus novaezelandiae   :Long considered to be vagrant individuals of the Australian  |little_bittern|Little_Bittern| , bones recovered from Holocene deposits indicate that this was indeed a distinct taxon, but it might not be a separate species.    |Réunion_ibis|Réunion_Ibis| , Threskiornis solitarius   :This species was the basis of the Réunion solitaire , a supposed relative of the  |dodo|Dodo|  and the  |Rodrigues_solitaire|Rodrigues_Solitaire| . Given the fact that ibis bones were found on  |Réunion|Réunion|  and that old descriptions match a flightless  |sacred_ibis|Sacred_Ibis|  quite well, the Réunion solitaire hypothesis has been refuted.      |Suliformes|Suliformes| |Boobies|Booby|  and related birds      |Spectacled_cormorant|Spectacled_Cormorant| , Phalacrocorax perspicillatus   Mascarene booby, Papasula sp.   An undescribed booby species that was formerly considered a population of  |Abbotts_booby|Abbotts_Booby| . Known physically only from subfossil bones, but is likely the bird referred to as a boeuf by early settlers. The boeuf was last recorded on Rodrigues in 1832 and likely went extinct following the deforestation of the island.      |Procellariiformes|Procellariiformes| |Petrels|Petrel| ,  |shearwaters|Shearwater| ,  |albatross|Albatross| es and  |storm_petrels|Storm_Petrel| .    |Olsons_petrel|Olsons_Petrel| , Bulweria bifax    |Bermuda_shearwater|Bermuda_Shearwater| , Puffinus parvus     |Saint_Helena_petrel|Saint_Helena_Petrel| , Pseudobulweria rupinarum    |Jamaica_petrel|Jamaica_Petrel| , Pterodroma caribbaea   :Possibly a subspecies of the  |black-capped_petrel|Black-Capped_Petrel| ; unconfirmed reports suggest it might survive. Officially classified as  |critically_endangered,_possibly_extinct|Endangered_Species| .   Pterodroma cf. leucoptera    :A wing of a carcass similar to  |Goulds_petrel|Goulds_Petrel|  was recovered on Mangareva in 1922, where it possibly bred. No such birds are known to exist there today.    |Guadalupe_storm_petrel|Guadalupe_Storm_Petrel| , Oceanodroma macrodacyla   :Officially  |critically_endangered,_possibly_extinct|Endangered_Species| , but a thorough survey in 2000 concluded the species was certainly extinct.    |Imbers_petrel|Imbers_Petrel| , Pterodroma imberi  |Sphenisciformes|Sphenisciformes| |Penguins|Penguins| |Chatham_penguin|Chatham_Penguin| , Eudyptes sp. , is only known from subfossil bones, but a bird kept captive at some time between 1867 and 1872 might refer to this taxon.      |Columbiformes|Columbiformes| |Pigeons|Pigeon| , doves and  |dodos|Dodo|    For the Réunion solitaire , see  |Réunion_ibis|Réunion_Ibis| .    |Saint_Helena_dove|Saint_Helena_Dove| , Dysmoropelia dekarchiskos, possibly survived into the Modern Era.    |Passenger_pigeon|Passenger_Pigeon| , Ectopistes migratorius   :The passenger pigeon was once among the most common birds in the world, a single flock numbering up to 2.2 billion birds. It was hunted close to extinction for food and sport in the late 19th century. The last individual,  |Martha|Martha| , died in the  |Cincinnati_Zoo|Cincinnati_Zoo|  in 1914.    |Bonin_wood_pigeon|Bonin_Wood_Pigeon| ,  Columba versicolor    |Ryukyu_wood_pigeon|Ryukyu_Wood_Pigeon| , Columba jouyi    |Réunion_pink_pigeon|Réunion_Pink_Pigeon| , Nesoenas duboisi   :Formerly in Streptopelia. There seems to have been at least another species of pigeon on Réunion , but bones have not yet been found. It disappeared at the same time.    |Rodrigues_pigeon|Rodrigues_Pigeon| , Nesoenas rodericana   :Formerly in Streptopelia. A possible subspecies of the  |Madagascar_turtle_dove|Madagascar_Turtle_Dove|  , this seems not to be the bird observed by  |Leguat|François_Leguat| . Introduced rats might have killed it off in the late 17th century.    |Liverpool_pigeon|Liverpool_Pigeon| ,  Caloenas maculata  |Liverpool|Liverpool|  Museum since 1851 and was probably collected on a  |Pacific|Pacific|  island for  |Edward_Stanley,_13th_Earl_of_Derby|Edward_Stanley,_13Th_Earl_Of_Derby| . It has been suggested that this bird came from  |Tahiti|Tahiti|  based on native lore about a somewhat similar extinct bird called the titi, but this has not been verified.    |Purple-winged_ground_dove|Purple-Winged_Ground_Dove| , Claravis geoffroyi    |Sulu_bleeding-heart|Sulu_Bleeding-Heart| , Gallicolumba menagei   :Officially listed as  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| . Only known from two specimens taken in 1891. There have been a number of unconfirmed reports from all over the  |Sulu_Archipelago|Sulu_Archipelago|  in 1995, however, these reports stated that the bird had suddenly undergone a massive decline, and by now, habitat destruction is almost complete. If not extinct, this species is very rare, but the ongoing  |civil_war|Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front|  prevents comprehensive surveys.    |Norfolk_ground_dove|Norfolk_Ground_Dove| , Gallicolumba norfolciensis    |Tanna_ground_dove|Tanna_Ground_Dove| , Gallicolumba ferruginea   :Only known from descriptions of two now-lost specimens.    |Thick-billed_ground_dove|Thick-Billed_Ground_Dove| , Gallicolumba salamonis   :Last recorded in 1927, only two specimens exist. Declared extinct in 2005.    |Choiseul_pigeon|Choiseul_Pigeon| , Microgoura meeki    |Red-moustached_fruit_dove|Red-Moustached_Fruit_Dove| , Ptilinopus mercierii   :Two subspecies, the little-known P. m. mercierii of Nuku Hiva and P. m. tristrami of Hiva Oa.    |Negros_fruit_dove|Negros_Fruit_Dove| , Ptilinopus arcanus   :Known only from one specimen taken at the only documented sighting in 1953, the validity of this species has been questioned, but no good alternative to distinct species status has been proposed. Officially  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| , it might occur on Panay, but no survey has located it. One possible record in 2002 does not seem to have been repeated.    |Mauritius_blue_pigeon|Mauritius_Blue_Pigeon| , Alectroenas nitidissima   Farquhar blue pigeon, Alectroenas sp.   :Only known from early reports; possibly a subspecies of the  |Comoros|Comoros_Blue_Pigeon|  or  |Seychelles_blue_pigeon|Seychelles_Blue_Pigeon| .    |Rodrigues_grey_pigeon|Rodrigues_Grey_Pigeon| ,  Alectroenas rodericana   :A mysterious bird of unknown affinities, known from a few bones and, as it seems, two historical reports.    |Dodo|Dodo| , Raphus cucullatus   :Called Didus ineptus by  |Linnaeus|Carl_Linnaeus| . A metre-high flightless bird found on  |Mauritius|Mauritius| . Its forest habitat was lost when Dutch settlers moved to the island and the dodos nests were destroyed by the monkeys, pigs and cats that the Dutch brought with them. The last specimen was killed in 1681, only 80 years after the arrival of the new predators.    |Rodrigues_solitaire|Rodrigues_Solitaire| , Pezophaps solitaria      |Psittaciformes|Psittaciformes| |Parrots|Parrot| |New_Caledonian_lorikeet|New_Caledonian_Lorikeet| , Charmosyna diadema   :Officially  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species| , there have been no reliable reports of this bird since the early 20th century. It is, however, small and inconspicuous.    |Norfolk_kaka|Norfolk_Kaka| ,  Nestor productus    |Society_parakeet|Society_Parakeet| , Cyanoramphus ulietanus    |Black-fronted_parakeet|Black-Fronted_Parakeet| , Cyanoramphus zealandicus    |Paradise_parrot|Paradise_Parrot| , Psephotus pulcherrimus    |Oceanic_eclectus_parrot|Oceanic_Eclectus_Parrot| , Eclectus infectus, known from subfossil bones found on Tonga, Vanuatu, and possibly Fiji, may have survived until the 18th century: a bird which seems to be a male Eclectus parrot was drawn in a report on the Tongan island of  |Vavaʻu|Vavau|  by the  |Malaspina|Alessandro_Malaspina|  expedition. Also a 19th-century Tongan name ʻāʻā for a beautiful bird found only at  |ʻEua|Eua|  is attested . This seems to refer either E. infectus which in Tonga is only known from Vavaʻu and ʻEua, or the extirpated population of the  |collared_lory|Collared_Lory|  which also occurred there. It is possible but unlikely that the species survived on ʻEua until the 19th century.    |Seychelles_parakeet|Seychelles_Parakeet| , Psittacula wardi    |Newtons_parakeet|Newtons_Parakeet| , Psittacula exsul    |Mascarene_grey_parakeet|Mascarene_Grey_Parakeet| , Psittacula bensoni . Formerly described as Mauritius grey parrot, Lophopsittacus bensoni. Known from a 1602 sketch by Captain Willem van Westzanen and by subfossil bones described by  |David_Thomas_Holyoak|David_Thomas_Holyoak|  in 1973. Might have survived to the mid-18th century.    |Mascarene_parrot|Mascarene_Parrot| , Mascarinus mascarin   :Last known individual was a captive bird which was alive before 1834.    |Broad-billed_parrot|Broad-Billed_Parrot| , Lophopsittacus mauritianus   :May have survived to the late 18th century.    |Rodrigues_parrot|Rodrigues_Parrot| , Necropsittacus rodericanus   :The species N. francicus is fictional,  N. borbonicus  most likely so.    |Glaucous_macaw|Glaucous_Macaw| , Anodorhynchus glaucus   :Officially  |critically_endangered|Endangered_Species|  due to persistent rumors of wild birds, but probably extinct.    |Cuban_macaw|Cuban_Macaw| , Ara tricolor   :A number of related species have been described from the West Indies, but are not based on good evidence. Several prehistoric forms are now known to have existed in the region, however.    |Carolina_parakeet|Carolina_Parakeet| , Conuropsis carolinensis   :Although the date of the last captive birds death in the Cincinnati Zoo, 1918, is generally given as its extinction date, there are convincing reports of some wild populations persisting until later. Two subspecies, C. c. carolinensis and C. c. ludovicianus .    |Guadeloupe_parakeet|Guadeloupe_Parakeet| , Aratinga labati   :Only known from descriptions, the former existence of this bird is likely for biogeographic reasons and because details as described cannot be referred to known species.    |Martinique_amazon|Martinique_Amazon| , Amazona martinica    |Guadeloupe_amazon|Guadeloupe_Amazon| , Amazona violacea   :These extinct amazon parrots were originally described after travelers descriptions. Both are now considered valid extinct species that are closely related to the  |imperial_amazon|Imperial_Amazon| .      |Cuculiformes|Cuculiformes| |Cuckoos|Cuckoo| |Delalandes_coua|Delalandes_Coua| , Coua delalandei    |Saint_Helena_cuckoo|Saint_Helena_Cuckoo| , Nannococcyx psix      |Falconiformes|Falconiformes| |Birds_of_prey|Bird_Of_Prey| |Guadalupe_caracara|Guadalupe_Caracara| , Caracara lutosa    |Réunion_kestrel|Réunion_Kestrel| , Falco duboisi      |Strigiformes|Strigiformes| |Typical_owls|Typical_Owl|  and  |barn_owls|Barn_Owl| .    |Pernambuco_pygmy_owl|Pernambuco_Pygmy_Owl| , Glaucidium mooreorum    :Might still exist, classified as critically endangered. A 2018  |BirdLife|Birdlife|  study citing extinction patterns recommended reclassifying this species as possibly extinct.    |Réunion_owl|Réunion_Owl| , Mascarenotus grucheti    |Mauritius_owl|Mauritius_Owl| , Mascarenotus sauzieri    |Rodrigues_owl|Rodrigues_Owl| , Mascarenotus murivorus   :The preceding three species were variously placed in Bubo, Athene,  Scops  , Strix and Tyto before their true affinity was realized.   New Caledonian boobook, Ninox cf. novaeseelandiae   :Known only from prehistoric bones, but might still survive.    |Laughing_owl|Laughing_Owl| , Sceloglaux albifacies   :Two subspecies, S. a. albifacies and S. a. rufifacies ; circumstantial evidence suggests that small remnants survived until the early/mid-20th century.   The  |Puerto_Rican_barn_owl|Puerto_Rican_Barn_Owl| , Tyto cavatica, known from prehistoric remains found in caves of Puerto Rico, West Indies; may still have existed in 1912, given reports of the presence of cave-roosting owls.   The Andros Island barn owl,  Tyto pollens , known from prehistoric remains found on Andros ; may have survived to the 16th century, as indicated by the  |chickcharney|Chickcharney|  legend.    |Siau_scops_owl|Siau_Scops_Owl| , Otus siaoensis   : Only known from the holotype collected in 1866. Endemic to the small volcanic island of  |Siau|Siau_Island|  north of  |Sulawesi|Sulawesi|  in  |Indonesia|Indonesia| ; might still survive, as there are ongoing rumors of scops owls at Siau.      |Caprimulgiformes|Caprimulgiformes|  Caprimulgidae  - nightjars and nighthawks   Reclusive ground-nesting birds that sally out at night to hunt for large  |insects|Insects|  and similar prey. They are easily located by the males song, but this is not given all year.
