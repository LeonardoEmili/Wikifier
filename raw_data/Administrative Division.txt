              An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or  country subdivision, is a portion of a  |country|Country|  or other region delineated for the purpose of  |administration|Administration| . Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of  |autonomy|Autonomous_Administrative_Division|  and are usually required to manage themselves through their own  |local_governments|Local_Government| . Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. A country may be divided into  |provinces|Province| ,  |states|Federated_State| ,  |counties|County| ,  |cantons|Canton|  or other sub-units, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into  |municipalities|Municipality| , counties or others.     Administrative divisions are conceptually separate from  |dependent_territories|Dependent_Territory| , with the former being an integral part of the  |state|Sovereign_State|  and the other being only under some lesser form of control. However, the term administrative division can include dependent territories as well as accepted administrative divisions .     For clarity and convenience the standard neutral reference for the largest administrative subdivision of a country is called the first-level administrative division or first administrative level . Next smaller is called second-level administrative division or second administrative level .              In many of the following terms originating from British cultural influence, areas of relatively low mean population density might bear a title of an entity one would expect to be either larger or smaller. There is no fixed rule, for  |all_politics_is_local|All_Politics_Is_Local|  as is perhaps well demonstrated by their relative lack of systemic order. In the realm of self-government, any of these can and does occur along a stretch of roadâ€”which for the most part is passing through rural unsettled countryside. Since the terms are administrative political subdivisions of the local regional government their exact relationship and definitions are subject to  |home_rule|Home_Rule|  considerations, tradition, as well as  |state|Sovereign_State| |_statute_law|Statute_Law|  and local governmental definition and control. In British cultural legacy, some  |territorial_entities|Territorial_Entities|  began with fairly expansive counties which encompass an appreciably large area, but were divided over time into a number of smaller entities.   Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the  |county_seat|County_Seat| . Some of the worlds larger cities culturally, if not officially, span several counties, and those crossing state or provincial boundaries have much in common culturally as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government. Many sister cities share a water boundary, which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties. For example,  |Cambridge|Cambridge_Massachusetts|  and  |Boston|Boston| ,  |Massachusetts|Massachusetts|  appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties.         |Area|Area| |_Autonomous_community|Autonomous_Community| |_Barony|Barony| |_Capital_city|Capital_City| |_Canton|Canton| |_County|County| |_Community|Community| |_Country|Country| |_Constituency|Constituency| |_Crown_dependency|Crown_Dependencies| |_Department|Department| |_District|District| |_Division|Division| |_Duchy|Duchy| |_Governorate|Governorate| |_Entity|Legal_Entity| |_Hundred|Hundred| |_Kingdom|Federal_Monarchy| |_Local_council|Local_Council| |_Municipality|Municipality| |_Rural|Rural_Municipality| |_Regional|Regional_Municipality| |_Regional_county|Regional_County_Municipality| |_Parish|Parish| |_Oblast|Oblast| |_Prefecture|Prefecture| |_Principality|Principality| |_Province|Province| |_Public_body|Public_Body| |_Region|Region| |_Republic|Autonomous_Republic| |_Riding|Riding| |_State|Constituent_State| |_Special_administrative_region|Special_Administrative_Region| |_Territory|Territory| |_Theme|Theme| |_Voivodeship|Voivodeship|           General terms for these incorporated places include municipality , settlement , locality, and populated place.    |Borough|Borough| ,  |burgh|Burgh|  or boro    |City|City| |_Shire|Shire| |_Town|Town| |_Township|Township| |_Village|Village| |_Tribe|Tribe| |_Indian_reservation|Indian_Reservation| |_Indian_reserve|Indian_Reserve| |_Band|Band_Society| |_Rancheria|Rancheria|             Due to variations in their use worldwide, consistency in the translation of terms from non-English to English is sometimes difficult to maintain.        |Sovereign_state|Sovereign_State| , a national or supra-national division.    |Country|Country| , a national or sub-national division.    |Empire|Empire| .
