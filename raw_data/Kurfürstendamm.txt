Although the exact date of the building is unknown, an unnamed causeway leading from the  |Stadtschloss|Stadtschloss_Berlin|  through the swampy area between the settlements of Charlottenburg  and Wilmersdorf to Grunewald is already depicted in a 1685 map. The name Churfürsten Damm was first mentioned between 1767 and 1787.          From 1875 the former bridlepath was embellished as a boulevard with a breadth of  on the personal initiative of chancellor  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck| , who also proposed the building of the Grunewald mansions colony at its western end. In 1882,  |Ernst_Werner_von_Siemens|Ernst_Werner_Von_Siemens|  presented his  |Elektromote|Elektromote|  trolley bus concept at an experimental track near Halensee station. The nearby Lunapark opened in 1909, then Europes largest  |amusement_park|Amusement_Park| , modelled on  |Coney_Island|Coney_Island| , where boxer  |Max_Schmeling|Max_Schmeling|  won his first title of a German Lightheavyweight Champion in 1926. After a long period of decline the park was finally closed in 1933. Large parts are today covered by the Stadtautobahn.         In 1913 the new  |Marmorhaus|Marmorhaus|  cinema opened. A number of major film premieres were held here during the  |silent_era|Silent_Era| .     Especially during the  |Golden_Twenties|1920S_Berlin|  the Kurfürstendamm area of the New West was a centre of leisure and nightlife in Berlin, an era that ended with the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  and the Nazi  Machtergreifung  in 1933. The shops and businesses owned by Jewish tradespeople became the target of several pogroms, culminating in the  |Reichskristallnacht|Reichskristallnacht|  of 9 November 1938. In World War II the boulevard suffered severe damage from  |air_raids|Bombing_Of_Berlin_In_World_War_Ii|  and the  |Battle_of_Berlin|Battle_Of_Berlin| .     Nevertheless, after the war rebuilding started quickly, and when Berlin was separated into  |East|East_Berlin|  and  |West_Berlin|West_Berlin| , the Kurfürstendamm became the leading commercial street of West Berlin in its  |Wirtschaftswunder|Wirtschaftswunder|  days. It was therefore the site of  |protests|Protest|  and major  |demonstrations|Demonstration|  by the  |German_student_movement|German_Student_Movement| , while on 11 April 1968 spokesman  |Rudi_Dutschke|Rudi_Dutschke|  was shot in the head while leaving the office of the  |Sozialistischer_Deutscher_Studentenbund|Sozialistischer_Deutscher_Studentenbund|  on Kurfürstendamm No. 140.     After  |German_reunification|German_Reunification|  the Kurfürstendamm had to compete with central places like  |Potsdamer_Platz|Potsdamer_Platz| ,  |Friedrichstraße|Friedrichstraße| , and  |Alexanderplatz|Alexanderplatz| , which led to the closing of numerous cafés and cinemas. It retained the character of a  |flâneur|Flâneur|  and upscale shopping street as the western continuation of the  |Tauentzienstraße|Tauentzienstraße|  with its large department stores.
