               Medicine is the  |science|Science|  and practice of establishing the  |diagnosis|Diagnosis| ,  |prognosis|Prognosis| ,  |treatment|Therapy| , and  |prevention|Preventive_Medicine|  of  |disease|Disease| . Medicine encompasses a variety of  |health_care|Health_Care|  practices evolved to maintain and restore  |health|Health|  by the  |prevention|Prevention|  and  |treatment|Therapy|  of  |illness|Illness| . Contemporary medicine applies  |biomedical_sciences|Biomedical_Sciences| ,  |biomedical_research|Biomedical_Research| ,  |genetics|Medical_Genetics| , and  |medical_technology|Medical_Technology|  to  |diagnose|Diagnosis| , treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through  |pharmaceuticals|Pharmaceutical|  or  |surgery|Surgery| , but also through therapies as diverse as  |psychotherapy|Psychotherapy| ,  |external_splints_and_traction|Splint| ,  |medical_devices|Medical_Device| ,  |biologics|Biologic_Medical_Product| , and  |ionizing_radiation|Radiation| , amongst others.      Medicine has been around for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art frequently having connections to the  |religious|Religion|  and  |philosophical|Philosophy|  beliefs of local culture. For example, a  |medicine_man|Medicine_Man|  would apply herbs and say  |prayers|Prayer|  for healing, or an ancient philosopher and  |physician|Physician|  would apply  |bloodletting|Bloodletting|  according to the theories of  |humorism|Humorism| . In recent centuries, since the  |advent_of_modern_science|History_Of_Science| , most medicine has become a combination of art and science . While stitching technique for  |sutures|Surgical_Suture|  is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the  |cellular|Cytology|  and  |molecular|Molecular_Medicine|  level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.     Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as  |traditional_medicine|Traditional_Medicine|  and  |folk_medicine|Folk_Medicine| , though they do not fall within the modern definition of “medicine” which is based in medical science. Traditional medicine and folk medicine remain commonly used with, or instead of, scientific medicine and are thus called  |alternative_medicine|Alternative_Medicine|  . For example, evidence on the effectiveness of  |acupuncture|Acupuncture|  is variable and inconsistent for any condition,  but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.  In contrast, alternative treatments outside the bounds not just of scientific medicine, but also outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed  |quackery|Quackery| .  Quackery can encompass an array of practices and practitioners, irrespective of whether they are prescientific or modern  |pseudo_scientific|Pseudo_Scientific| , including  |chiropractic|Chiropractic|  which rejects modern scientific  |germ_theory_of_disease|Germ_Theory_Of_Disease|  , with just over half of chiropractors also rejecting the science of  |immunization|Immunization| .         Medicine  is the  |science|Science|  and practice of the  |diagnosis|Diagnosis| ,  |prognosis|Prognosis| ,  |treatment|Therapy| , and  |prevention|Preventive_Medicine|  of  |disease|Disease| .   The word medicine is derived from  |Latin|Latin|  medicus, meaning a physician . Etymology: , from ars medicina the medical art , from medicus physician .  Cf. mederi to heal , etym. know the best course for , from  |PIE|Proto_Indo_European_Language|  base med- to measure, limit. Cf.  |Greek|Greek_Language|  medos counsel, plan ,  |Avestan|Avestan_Language|  vi-mad physician  Online Etymology Dictionary          Medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the  |Western_world|Western_World| , while in  |developing_countries|Developing_Country|  such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on  |traditional_medicine|Traditional_Medicine|  with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.  In the  |developed_world|Developed_Country| ,  |evidence_based_medicine|Evidence_Based_Medicine|  is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.      In modern clinical practice, physicians personally assess patients in order to  |diagnose|Medical_Diagnosis| ,  |prognose|Prognosis| , treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The  |doctor_patient_relationship|Doctor_Patient_Relationship|  typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patients  |medical_history|Medical_History|  and  |medical_record|Medical_Record| , followed by a medical interview  and a  |physical_examination|Physical_Examination| . Basic diagnostic  |medical_devices|Medical_Device|   are typically used. After examination for  |signs|Medical_Sign|  and interviewing for  |symptoms|Symptoms| , the doctor may order  |medical_tests|Medical_Test|  , take a  |biopsy|Biopsy| , or prescribe  |pharmaceutical_drugs|Pharmaceutical_Drug|  or other therapies.  |Differential_diagnosis|Differential_Diagnosis|  methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.    Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue.     The components of the medical interview and encounter are:   Chief complaint : the reason for the current medical visit. These are the  |symptoms|Symptom| . They are in the patients own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called chief concern or presenting complaint.   History of present  |illness|Illness|  : the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history .  |Medical_history|Medical_History|  comprises HPI and PMH.   Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.    |Medications|Medication|  : what drugs the patient takes including  |prescribed|Medical_Prescription| ,  |over_the_counter|Over_The_Counter_Drug| , and  |home_remedies|Home_Remedy| , as well as alternative and  |herbal_medicines_herbal_remedies|Herbalism| .  |Allergies|Allergy|  are also recorded.   Past medical history : concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past  |infectious_diseases|Infectious_Disease|  or  |vaccinations|Vaccination| , history of known allergies.   Social history : birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits .    |Family_history|Family_History|  : listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A  |family_tree|Family_Tree|  is sometimes used.   Review of systems or systems inquiry, followed by questions on the bodys main organ systems .     The  |physical_examination|Physical_Examination|  is the examination of the patient for  |medical_signs|Medical_Sign|  of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable. .  |Medical_News_Today|Medical_News_Today| . The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell . Four actions are the basis of physical examination:  |inspection|Inspection| ,  |palpation|Palpation|  ,  |percussion|Percussion|  , and  |auscultation|Auscultation|  , generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.      The clinical examination involves the study of:   Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature,  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure| ,  |pulse|Pulse| , respiration rate, and hemoglobin  |oxygen_saturation|Oxygen_Saturation| |_clubbing|Nail_Clubbing|  HEENT |heart|Heart|  and  |blood_vessels|Blood_Vessel|  large airways and  |lungs|Human_Lung|  including spine and extremitiesconsciousness, awareness, brain, vision,  |cranial_nerves|Cranial_Nerves| , spinal cord and  |peripheral_nerves|Peripheral_Nervous_System| orientation,  |mental_state|Mental_State_Examination| , mood, evidence of abnormal perception or thoughtMDMthe  |differential_diagnoses|Differential_Diagnosis| |e|E| with the exception of the  |United_States|United_States| either directly or as part of an employment contract |7111594|7111594| |ju|Ju| |_olo|Olo| |_neti|Neti| |olo|Olo| theoretical focuspractical focussuch as the development of effective anaestheticssuch as emergency departmentsMRCPMRCS |aching_sta|Aching_Sta| for which MRCS/FRCS would have been requiredFRCAfor example,  |a_perforated_ear_drum|Perforated_Eardrum| for historical and logistical reasonsin the narrow sense, common outside North Americaor internistsor subdisciplinesmedical specialtyas opposed to surgical trainingPCRFISHradiopharmaceuticalse.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or otherusually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter12also known as anaestheticsi.e. brain, heart, kidneys |3304672|3304672|  often abbreviated as  OB/GYN  or Obs & Gynae AEBEor physiatryor  |hyperbaric_medicine|Hyperbaric_Medicine| skullMRP |literature|Literature| ,  |philosophy|Philosophy| ,  |ethics|Ethics| , history and religion |anthropology|Anthropology| ,  |cultural_studies|Cultural_Studies| ,  |psychology|Psychology| ,  |sociology|Sociology| |literature|Literature| , theater, film, and  |visual_arts|Visual_Arts| also called  pain medicine , or algiatryligament tears or rupturespractice |605774|605774| |dici|Dici| |S_13_07_20|S_13_07_20| Voluntas aegroti suprema lex. |hi|Hi| Salus aegroti suprema lex. |hi|Hi| fairness and equalityprimum non-nocereand the person treating the patienti.e., the hospital and its staff |herbalism|Herbalism| the notion of inanimate objects having spiritsan appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spiritsthe vesting of an individual with mystic powersmagically obtaining the truthin the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent| predecessor to the modern  |traditional_Chinese_medicine|Traditional_Chinese_Medicine| 3rd millennium BCE |dic|Dic| |dici|Dici| |idemiolo|Idemiolo| |zanti|Zanti| |e|E| which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see  |Copernicuss|Nicolaus_Copernicus|  rejection of  |Ptolemys|Ptolemy|  theories on astronomy1708where results are testable and  |reproducible|Reproducible| inspired by the method of  |inoculation|Inoculation|  earlier practiced in AsiaUnited StatesItalySwitzerlandJapanFranceBrazilRussiaCanadaUnited States |atropine|Atropine| ,  |ephedrine|Ephedrine| ,  |warfarin|Warfarin| ,  |aspirin|Aspirin| ,  |digoxin|Digoxin| ,  |vinca_alkaloids|Vinca_Alkaloid| ,   |taxo|Taxo| l,  |hyoscine|Hyoscine_Hydrobromide| , etc.Salvarsan |dici|Dici| ways of doing thingsand other  |iatrogenesis|Iatrogenesis|  also known as indigenous or folk medicineWHO .
