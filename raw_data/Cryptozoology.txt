   Cryptozoology is a  |pseudoscience|Pseudoscience|  and  |subculture|Subculture|  that aims to prove the existence of entities from the  |folklore|Folklore|  record, such as  |Bigfoot|Bigfoot| , the  |chupacabra|Chupacabra| , or  |Mokele-mbembe|Mokele-Mbembe| . Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as  cryptids , a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the  |scientific_method|Scientific_Method| , cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of  |zoology|Zoology|  nor  |folkloristics|Folkloristics| . It was originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists  |Bernard_Heuvelmans|Bernard_Heuvelmans|  and  |Ivan_T._Sanderson|Ivan_T._Sanderson| .     Scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence , noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as  |ghost_hunting|Ghost_Hunting|  and  |ufology|Ufology| , and highlighted uncritical media propagation of cryptoozologist claims.       As a field, cryptozoology originates from the works of  |Bernard_Heuvelmans|Bernard_Heuvelmans| , a  |Belgian|Belgium|  zoologist, and  |Ivan_T._Sanderson|Ivan_T._Sanderson| , a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published  On the Track of Unknown Animals   in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life . Regal .     The term cryptozoology dates from 1959 or before  â€“ Heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term cryptozoology to Sanderson. Additionally, see discussion at cryptozoology, n. OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016. Patterned after cryptozoology, the term cryptid was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E. Wall in the summer issue of the  |International_Society_of_Cryptozoology|International_Society_Of_Cryptozoology|  newsletter. Regal . According to Wall suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like monster. My suggestion is cryptid, meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown ... describing those creatures which are subjects of cryptozoological investigation. Wall, J. E. : The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like monster. My suggestion is cryptid, meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word, describing those creatures which are subjects of cryptozoological investigation. The  Oxford English Dictionary  defines the noun cryptid as an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist . cryptid, n. OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016. While used by most cryptozoologists, the term cryptid is not used by academic zoologists. Paxton . In a textbook aimed at undergraduates, academics Caleb W. Lack and Jacques Rousseau note that the subcultures focus on what it deems to be cryptids is a pseudoscientic extension of older belief in monsters and other similar entities from the folklore record, yet with a new, more scientific-sounding name: cryptids . Lack & Rousseau .     While biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the  |folklore|Folklore|  record. Most famously, these include the  |Loch_Ness_Monster|Loch_Ness_Monster| ,  |Bigfoot|Bigfoot| , the  |chupacabra|Chupacabra| , as well as other imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters . In their search for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids . Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.     Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer  |Daniel_Loxton|Daniel_Loxton|  and paleontologist  |Donald_Prothero|Donald_Prothero| , Cryptozoologists have often promoted Professor  |Roy_Mackal|Roy_Mackal| , PhD. as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of credential mongering, by which an individual or organization feints a persons graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration. Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, other notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include  |Grover_Krantz|Grover_Krantz| ,  |Karl_Shuker|Karl_Shuker| , and  |Richard_Greenwell|Richard_Greenwell| . Loxton & Prothero .     Historically, notable cryptozoologists have often identified instances featuring irrefutable evidence , only for the evidence to be revealed as the product of a hoax. This may occur during a closer examination by experts or upon confession of the hoaxer. Radford .       A subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of  |Young_Earth_creationism|Young_Earth_Creationism| , rejecting conventional science in favor of a Biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as  |living_dinosaurs|Young_Earth_Creationismflood_Geology,_The_Fossil_Record,_And_Dinosaurs|  .  |Science_writer|Science_Journalism| |Sharon_A._Hill|Sharon_A._Hill|  observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution. Hill .  |Anthropologist|Anthropology|  Jeb J. Card says that Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution. Card . In a 2013 interview,  |paleontologist|Paleontology| |Donald_Prothero|Donald_Prothero|  notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists. He observes that ople who actively search for Loch Ness monsters or Mokele Mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers. They think that if they found a dinosaur in the Congo it would overturn all of evolution. It wouldnt. It would just be a late-occurring dinosaur, but thats their mistaken notion of evolution. Shea .       Media outlets have often uncritically disseminated information from cryptozoologist sources, including newspapers that repeat false claims made by cryptozoologists or television shows that feature cryptozoologists as monster hunters . Media coverage of purported cryptids often fails to provide more likely explanations, further propagating claims made by cryptozoologists. Lack .       The 2003 discovery of the  |fossil|Fossil|  remains of  Homo floresiensis  was cited by paleontologist  |Henry_Gee|Henry_Gee| , a senior editor at the journal  Nature , as possible evidence that in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth. Cryptozoology, Gee says, can come in from the cold. Gee .     However, cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world. There is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a  |pseudoscience|Pseudoscience| . Lee . Roesch & Moore : Pointing to this rampant speculation and ignorance of established scientific theories in cryptozoology, as well as the fields poor record of success and its reliance on unsystematic, anecdotal evidence, many scientists and skeptics classify cryptozoology as a pseudoscience. Church : Cryptozoology has acquired a bad reputation as a pseudoscience... Until detailed, methodical research becomes standard practice among cryptozoologists, the field will remain disrespected by more traditional biologists and zoologists. Lack & Rosseau : Cryptids are the focus of study in cryptozoology, a field most scientists label as pseudoscientific. The field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information Shermer . and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed, cryptozoologists do not follow the  |scientific_method|Scientific_Method| . Dash . Hill notes that there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title cryptozoologist.     Anthropologist Jeb J. Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and  |pseudoarchaeology|Pseudoarchaeology| |ghost_hunting|Ghost_Hunting|  and  |ufology|Ufology| , and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, Most  |cryptids|List_Of_Cryptids|  are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the heyday of  |comparative_folklore|Comparative_Folklore| , though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoologys complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture is also found in  |New_Age|New_Age|  circles and dubious  |Indian_burial_grounds|Indian_Burial_Grounds|  and other  |legends|Legend|  ... invoked in  |hauntings|Haunting|  such as the  |Amityville_hoax|The_Amityville_Horror|  ... . Card .     In a 2011 foreword for The American Biology Teacher, then  |National_Association_of_Biology_Teachers|National_Association_Of_Biology_Teachers|  president  |Dan_Ward|Dan_Ward|  uses cryptozoology as an example of technological pseudoscience that may confuse students about the scientific method. Ward says that Cryptozoology ... is not valid science or even science at all. It is monster hunting. Ward .  |Historian_of_science|History_Of_Science| |Brian_Regal|Brian_Regal|  includes an entry for cryptozoology in his Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia . Regal says that as an intellectual endeavor, cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals . Nagel .     In a 1992 issue of  Folklore ,  |folklorist|Folkloristics|  VÃ©ronique Campion-Vincent says:     :Unexplained appearances of mystery animals are reported all over the world today. Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon. Campion-Vincent .     Campion-Vincent says that four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances : Forteans , occultists , folklorists , and cryptozoologists . Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like  |parapsychology|Parapsychology| Encyclopedia of American Folklore, academic  |Linda_Watts|Linda_Watts|  says that folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry and describes cryptozoology as an example of American narrative traditions that feature many monsters . Watts .     In his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist  |Peter_Dendle|Peter_Dendle|  says that cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science and that:     :The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs. Dendle .       In a paper published in 2013, Dendle refers to cryptozoologists as contemporary monster hunters that keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted, mapped, and tracked, and that is largely available for close scrutiny on Google Earth and satellite imaging and that on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus . Dendle .     According to historian  |Mike_Dash|Mike_Dash| , few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of  |ants|Ant|  or  |beetles|Beetle| , instead focusing their efforts towards more elusive creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.     Paleontologist  |George_Gaylord_Simpson|George_Gaylord_Simpson|  lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility, along with  |creationism|Creationism| |Holocaust_denial|Holocaust_Denial|  and  |UFO_abductions_claims|Ufologyas_A_Pseudoscience|  as aspects of American culture that are clearly baloney . Prothero .     In Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers , Hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture, noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of  |Young_Earth_creationists|Young_Earth_Creationists|  and a prevalence of hoaxes. She concludes that many cryptozoologists are passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without critical questioning. As with the  |ghost_seekers|Ghost_Hunting| , cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history. With the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research, the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems. Hill .       There have been several organizations, of varying types, dedicated or related to cryptozoology. These include:     |Centre_for_Fortean_Zoology|Centre_For_Fortean_Zoology|  - a non-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom    |International_Fortean_Organization|International_Fortean_Organization|  - a network of professional Fortean researchers and writers based in the United States    |International_Society_of_Cryptozoology|International_Society_Of_Cryptozoology|  - an American organisation that existed from 1982 to 1998    |Kosmopoisk|Kosmopoisk|  - a Russian organisation whose interests include cryptozoology and  |Ufology|Ufology|.
