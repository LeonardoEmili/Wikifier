        A round  is a  |musical_composition|Musical_Composition| , a limited type of  |canon|Canon_Simple| , in which a minimum of three  |voices|Part|  sing exactly the same  |melody|Melody|  at the  |unison|Unison|  , but with each voice  |beginning_at_different_times|Imitation|  so that different parts of the melody coincide in the different voices, but nevertheless fit  |harmoniously|Harmony|  together . It is one of the easiest forms of  |part_singing|Part_Song| , as only one line of melody need be learned by all parts, and is part of a popular musical tradition. They were particularly favoured in  |glee|Glee|  clubs, which combined amateur singing with regular drinking . The earliest known rounds date from 12th century Europe.      |Row,_Row,_Row_Your_Boat|Row,_Row,_Row_Your_Boat|  is a well-known childrens round for four voices. Other well-known examples are  |Frère_Jacques|Frère_Jacques|  ,  |Three_Blind_Mice|Three_Blind_Mice|  , and, more recently,  |God_Only_Knows|God_Only_Knows|  by  |The_Beach_Boys|The_Beach_Boys|  .     A  |catch|Catch|  is a round in which a phrase that is not apparent in a single line of lyrics emerges when the lyrics are split between the different voices. Perpetual canon refers to the end of the melody leading back to the beginning, allowing easy and immediate repetition. Often, the final cadence is the same as the first measure .               The term round first appears in English in the early 16th century, though the form was found much earlier. In medieval England, they were called rota or  rondellus . Later, an alternative term was roundel . Special types of rounds are the catch , and a specialized use of the word canon , in 17th- and 18th-century England designating rounds with religious texts . The oldest surviving round in English is  |Sumer_Is_Icumen_In|Sumer_Is_Icumen_In|   , which is for four voices, plus two bass voices singing a  |ground|Ostinato|  , also in canon. However, the earliest known rounds are two works with Latin texts found in the eleventh  |fascicle|Serial|  of the  |Notre_Dame|Notre_Dame_School|  manuscript  |Pluteo_29.1|Pluteo_29.1| . They are Leto leta concio and O quanto consilio . The former dates from before 1180 and may be of German origin . The first published rounds in English were printed by  |Thomas_Ravenscroft|Thomas_Ravenscroft|  in 1609... Three Blind Mice  appears in this collection, although in a somewhat different form from todays childrens round:                 What makes a round work is that after the work is divided into equal-sized blocks of a few  |measures|Bar|  each, corresponding notes in each block either are the same, or are different notes in the same  |chord|Chord| . This is easiest with one chord, as in Row, Row, Row Your Boat      A new part can join the singing by starting at the beginning whenever another part reaches any asterisk in the above music. If one ignores the sixteenth notes that  |pass|Nonchord_Tone|  between the main chords, every single note is in the  |tonic|Tonic|  triad—in this case, a C, E, or G.     Many rounds involve more than one chord, as in Frère Jacques    The texture is simpler, but it uses a few more notes; this can perhaps be more easily seen if all four parts are run together into the same two measures:      The second  |beat|Beat|  of each measure does not sketch out a tonic triad, it outlines a  |dominant|Dominant|  seventh chord .            Serious composers who turned their hand to the round format include  |Thomas_Arne|Thomas_Arne| ,  |John_Blow|John_Blow| ,  |William_Byrd|William_Byrd| ,  |Henry_Purcell|Henry_Purcell| ,  |Louis_Hardin|Louis_Hardin| ,  |Joseph_Haydn|Joseph_Haydn| ,  |Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart| ,  |Ludwig_van_Beethoven|Ludwig_Van_Beethoven| , and  |Benjamin_Britten|Benjamin_Britten|   . Examples by  |J._S._Bach|J._S._Bach|  include the regular canons, Var. 3 and Var. 24 of the  |Goldberg_Variations|Goldberg_Variations| , and the perpetual canons, Canon 7 of  |The_Musical_Offering|The_Musical_Offering|  and Canon a 2 Perpetuus  . Several rounds are included amongst  |Arnold_Schoenbergs|Arnold_Schoenberg|  thirty-plus canons, which within their natural limitations ... are brilliant pieces, containing too much of the composers characteristically unexpected blend of seriousness, humour, vigour and tenderness to remain unperformed  .
