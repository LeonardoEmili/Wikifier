Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended  |Rose_and_Alex_Pilibos_Armenian_School|Rose_And_Alex_Pilibos_Armenian_School|  as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio. Meyers, Ben. System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood , p.  14. They formed a band named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan  on bass and Domingo Dingo Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.       After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled Victims of a Down .  The word victims was changed to system because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes,  |Slayer|Slayer| . Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to  |Velvet_Hammer_Music_and_Management_Group|Velvet_Hammer_Music_And_Management_Group|  and its founder David Beno Benveniste.  The band recruited drummer  |Ontronik_Andy_Khachaturian|Ontronik_Khachaturian| , an old school friend of Malakians and Odadjians who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.     In early 1995, System played as Soil at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| . Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as Untitled 1995 Demo Tape, which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the bands success with  Toxicity  about six years later. Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, Demo Tape 3. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury . Khachaturian was replaced by  |John_Dolmayan|John_Dolmayan| .     The bands first official release of a professionally recorded song was on a collection called Hye Enk , an  |Armenian_Genocide|Armenian_Genocide|  recognition compilation, in 1997. Soon after playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the  |Whisky-A-Go-Go|Whisky-A-Go-Go|  and  |Viper_Room|Viper_Room|  the band caught famed producer  |Rick_Rubins|Rick_Rubin|  attention who asked them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, the group recorded Demo Tape 4 near the end of 1997. Unlike the previous demo tapes, however, Demo Tape 4 was made only to be sent to  |record_companies|Record_Label|  . Rubin signed the group onto his  |American/Columbia_Records|American_Recordings| , and System of a Down began to record in Rubins studio with engineer  |Sylvia_Massy|Sylvia_Massy| , laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album.     Also in 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.        In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album,  System of a Down . They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles  |Sugar|Sugar|  and  |Spiders|Spiders|  became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and  |Metallica|Metallica|  before making their way to the second stage of  |Ozzfest|Ozzfest| . Following Ozzfest, they toured with  |Fear_Factory|Fear_Factory|  and  |Incubus|Incubus|  before headlining the  |Sno-Core_Tour|Sno-Core_Tour|  with  |Puya|Puya| ,  |Mr._Bungle|Mr._Bungle| , The Cat and Incubus providing support.     In November 1998, System of a Down appeared on  |South_Parks|South_Park|   Chef Aid  album, providing the music for the song Will They Die 4 You? Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, Why must we kill our own kind? a line that would later be used in the song Boom! Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character  |Chef|Chef|  does not introduce them as he does every other artist featured on the record.     System of a Downs former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at  |The_Troubadour|The_Troubadour|  in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian. In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the  |Black_Sabbath|Black_Sabbath|  song  |Snowblind|Snowblind|  to the Black Sabbath tribute album  Nativity in Black 2 .     Toxicity and Steal This Album!    On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a thank you to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read System of a Down was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the bands touring gear and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The bands manager, David Beno Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Downs scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.       The groups big break arrived when their second album,  Toxicity , debuted at No. 1 on the American and Canadian charts, despite the events of 9/11. The album has eventually achieved 3x  |multi-platinum|Multi-Platinum|  certification in the United States  It was still on top in America during the week of the  |9/11_attacks|September_11,_2001_Attacks|  and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the albums hit single  |Chop_Suey!|Chop_Suey!|  The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics according to the  |2001_Clear_Channel_memorandum|2001_Clear_Channel_Memorandum|  at the time such as trust in my self-righteous suicide. Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the albums second single,  |Toxicity|Toxicity|  . Even with the controversy surrounding Chop Suey! , System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with Toxicity and  |Aerials|Aerials|  . In May 2006,  |VH1|Vh1|  listed Toxicity in the number 14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs.     In 2001, the band went on tour with  |Slipknot|Slipknot|  throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.  Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour with  |Rammstein|Rammstein|  in 2001.     In late 2001, unreleased tracks from the Toxicity sessions made their way onto the internet.  This collection of tracks was dubbed Toxicity II by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album,  Steal This Album! , which was released in November 2002. Steal This Album! resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to  |Abbie_Hoffmans|Abbie_Hoffman|  counter-culture book,  Steal This Book  as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song  |Innervision|Innervision|  was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for Boom! was filmed with director  |Michael_Moore|Michael_Moore|  as a protest against the  |War_in_Iraq|War_In_Iraq| .     Mezmerize, Hypnotize and separation    Between 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to Steal This Album!, a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart from each other. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakians father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album,  Mezmerize , was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Downs second No. 1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single  |B.Y.O.B.|B.Y.O.B.|  , which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single,  |Question!|Question!|  was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of Mezmerize, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with  |The_Mars_Volta|The_Mars_Volta|  and  |Bad_Acid_Trip|Bad_Acid_Trip|  supporting.     The second part of the double album,  Hypnotize , was released on November 22, 2005. Like  Mezmerize , it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with  |The_Beatles|The_Beatles| ,  |Guns_N_Roses|Guns_N_Roses| , and rappers  |2Pac|2Pac|  and  |DMX|Dmx| , the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year.  In February 2006, System of a Down won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for  |B.Y.O.B.|B.Y.O.B.|  , beating out other established artists such as  |Nine_Inch_Nails|Nine_Inch_Nails|  and  |Robert_Plant|Robert_Plant| . Their second single off the Hypnotize album,  |Lonely_Day|Lonely_Day|  was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released  |Kill_Rock_N_Roll|Kill_Rock_N_Roll|  and  |Vicinity_of_Obscenity|Vicinity_Of_Obscenity|  as their next  |promo|Promotional_Recording|  singles. The band headlined  |Ozzfest|Ozzfest|  2006 in cities where tour founder  |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne|  opted not to appear or was not playing on the main stage .     Whereas on System of a Downs previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian , much of the music and lyrics on Mezmerize/Hypnotize were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.     System of a Downs song  |Lonely_Day|Lonely_Day|  was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the  |49th_Grammy_Awards|49Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards|  in 2007, but lost to  |Woman|Woman|  by  |Wolfmother|Wolfmother| .     May 2006 saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood by writer  |Ben_Myers|Ben_Myers| . It was published in the US in 2007 through  |The_Disinformation_Company|The_Disinformation_Company| . Also in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the  |Armenian_Genocide|Armenian_Genocide|  were featured in the film  Screamers , directed by  |Carla_Garapedian|Carla_Garapedian| . An interview with Tankians grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankians and Dolmayans meeting with Speaker of the House  |Dennis_Hastert|Dennis_Hastert|  during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States governments official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in Screamers.     In May also, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with Guitar magazine. He told MTV, Were not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldnt be doing this Ozzfest. Were going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. Weve done System for over ten years, and I think its healthy to take some rest.  System of a Downs final performance before their separation took place on August 13, 2006 in  |West_Palm_Beach|West_Palm_Beach| , Florida. Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together, Malakian told the crowd during Sundays last performance. Well be back. We just dont know when.      During the bands hiatus, Malakian formed a band called  |Scars_on_Broadway|Scars_On_Broadway| , which was joined by Dolmayan. After one  |self-titled_album|Scars_On_Broadway|  the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. However, the band released their long-awaited  |sophomore_album|Dictator|  in 2018, under the name Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator, as well as opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store. Odadjian pursued his project with  |RZA|Rza|  of  |Wu-Tang_Clan|Wu-Tang_Clan| , a hip-hop group named  |AcHoZeN|Achozen| , worked on his urSESSION website/record label, and performed as a member of funk legend  |George_Clintons|George_Clinton|  backing band. Tankian opted for solo career and released his debut solo album  Elect the Dead  in the autumn of 2007. He has continued releasing solo albums, recording them almost entirely by himself, after System of a Down reunited.       On November 29, 2010, following several weeks of Internet rumors, System of a Down officially announced that they would be reuniting for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011.  Among the announced tour dates included UKs  |Download_Festival|Download_Festival| , Switzerlands  |Greenfield_Festival|Greenfield_Festival| , Germanys  |Rock_am_Ring/Rock_im_Park|Rock_Am_Ring_And_Rock_Im_Park| , Swedens  |Metaltown|Metaltown| , Austrias  |Nova_Rock_Festival|Nova_Rock_Festival|  and Finlands  |Provinssirock|Provinssirock| .  |The_reunion_tour|System_Of_A_Down_Reunion_Tour|  commenced on May 10, 2011 in  |Edmonton|Edmonton| , Alberta.  Systems first tour through Mexico and South America began on September 28, 2011 in  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City| , ending in  |Santiago|Santiago|   on October 7, 2011.  From late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at  |Soundwave|Soundwave|  festival.  This was the bands first visit to  |Australia|Australia|  since 2005. The band have continued playing around the world. On August 11 and 12, 2012, they played the  |Heavy_MTL|Heavy_Mtl|  and  |Heavy_T.O.|Heavy_T.O.|  music festivals in Montreal and Toronto, respectively.  In August 2013 System of a Down played at the UKs  |Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals|Reading_And_Leeds_Festivals| , among other festivals and venues that year.       System of a Down played their only 2013 US performance at the Hollywood Bowl on July 29; tickets sold out hours after going on sale on March 22.     On November 23, 2014, System of a Down announced the  |Wake_Up_The_Souls_Tour|Wake_Up_The_Souls_Tour|  to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the  |Armenian_Genocide|Armenian_Genocide| . The tour included a free concert in Republic Square in  |Yerevan|Yerevan| , Armenia on April 23, 2015, their first show in the country.             In a November 2016 interview with  Kerrang! , drummer John Dolmayan revealed that System of a Down was working on more than a dozen songs for their follow-up to the  Mezmerize  and  Hypnotize  albums. Although he stated that the band does not know when the album will be released, he added that, I want everyone on board and feeling good about it. Thats what were trying to accomplish right now. Theres a tremendous amount of pressure on us, though, because its been 11 years—at least 12 by the time it comes out.      In a video Q & A session with fans on July 2, 2017, Shavo Odadjian was asked about the status of the next album, and he responded, Im waiting for a new album too. Its not happening. I dont know. I dont know when its gonna be. Not right now.  In a December 2017 interview with  |Rolling_Stone|Rolling_Stone| , Serj Tankian said that System of a Down wrote some new material but was uncertain of what to do with it. He then said that he doesnt want to commit to a new album due to the lack of committing to longform touring.      In an April 2018 interview, Daron Malakian said that the band did not abandon the idea of making new material,  and made a passing mention that System of a Down is not making any music at the moment.  Dolmayan said that he is ready to start work on the next album, but that certain members of my band haven’t been able to make it work for themselves , expressing uncertainty on if it would ever be made.      Malakian singled Tankian out as the reason no new album had yet been released.  Tankian detailed his view of the bands past and present conflicts and their overall situation, saying we couldn’t see eye to eye on all these points we decided to put aside the idea of a record altogether for the time being.  Dolmayan blamed all of the members due to the personal and creative differences that have been preventing them from recording a new studio album.  Tankian also expressed uncertainty on if the new album would be made or not, but did not rule out the possibility. He then described on how the sound would be, Its gotta be organic, its gotta feel right in every way.      Odadjian said that the band has material written from like the last 10, 12 years , but is uncertain on if it would form into a System of a Down album or not. He also said that Malakian and Tankian have visual differences on what the album should sound like, and that the bands inner tension have been building far longer than fans would be aware of, despite having love and respect for one another nonetheless.  He would later say that there is no conflict between the members, expressing confidence that System of a Down would eventually record a new album, and claims that they have material written which would be their best to date.  However, Tankian stated that there was no talk of the band recording a new album.       Malakian explained that there is a mixture between the matter of different creative perspectives for the bands hesitation to record a new studio album and the lack of desire to tour; however he did not dismiss the possibility of an album being made, but that it would likely not happen anytime soon.  He feels that the fans dont care that the band isnt making an album, but I think a lot of the fans just want an album. He expressed hopes that the members would get together and record new music, but is content with the direction of his band Scars on Broadway, noting about the members good friendship, But at the same time, I dont see that happening anytime soon that were all going to get together and make a new System of a Down album.  Malakian said that Tankian and the rest of the band members have been unable to come to an agreement over how to go about making new music, but insists that there is no negativity between them.      Despite System of a Downs ability to perform live, Odadjian expressed disappointment in their inability to record new music, explaining that there have been material written from the other members in the form of a possible new album, but without Tankians presence and no recordings made. He questioned why the band still hasnt made an album, citing creative differences as the problem.            System of a Downs lyrics are often oblique  or  |dadaist|Dadaism| , and have discussed topics such as  |drug_abuse|Drug_Abuse| ,  |politics|Politics|   and  |sexual_intercourse|Sexual_Intercourse| . Prison Song criticizes the  |War_on_Drugs|War_On_Drugs|   whereas  Rolling Stone  describes Roulette as a scared, wounded love letter .  Boom! , among the bands most straightforward and unambiguous songs, lambasts  |globalization|Globalization|  and spending on bombs and armament.  Commenting on the track I-E-A-I-A-I-O , drummer John Dolmayan said it was inspired by an encounter he had with  Knight Rider  s actor  |David_Hasselhoff|David_Hasselhoff|  in a liquor store in Los Angeles when he was around 12.  On  Mezmerize , Cigaro makes explicit references to  |phallic_imagery|Phalus|  and  |bureaucracy|Bureaucracy| , while Violent Pornography harshly views television  and degradation of women.  System of a Downs discontent towards the controversial  |Iraq_War|Iraq_War|  arises in B.Y.O.B. ,   which includes a  |double_entendre|Double_Entendre|  reference to both  |beer|Beer|  and bombs,  containing the forthright lyric Why dont presidents fight the war? Why do they always send the poor? Old School Hollywood describes a celebrity baseball game.  On their album Hypnotize , Tentative describes  |war|War| ,   Hypnotize refers to the  |Tiananmen_Square_events|Tiananmen_Square_Protests_Of_1989|    and Lonely Day describes  |angst|Angst| . The album title  Steal This Album!  is a play on the book  Steal This Book  by  |left-wing_political_activist|Left-Wing_Politics| |Abbie_Hoffman|Abbie_Hoffman| .   System of a Downs firm commitment for the recognition of the  |Armenian_Genocide|Armenian_Genocide|  emerges in two songs: P.L.U.C.K. and Holy Mountains , which rank among the bands most political songs.       Stephen Thomas Erlewine of  |AllMusic|Allmusic|  stated Like many late-90s  |metal|Heavy_Metal_Music|  bands System of a Down struck a balance between 80s underground  |thrash_metal|Thrash_Metal|  and metallic early-90s  |alternative_rock|Alternative_Rock| ers like  |Janes_Addiction|Janes_Addiction|  . System of a Downs music has variously been termed  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music| ,   |alternative_metal|Alternative_Metal| ,       |nu_metal|Nu_Metal| ,       |hard_rock|Hard_Rock| ,     |progressive_metal|Progressive_Metal| ,     |thrash_metal|Thrash_Metal| ,     |art_rock|Art_Rock|   and  |avant-garde_metal|Avant-Garde_Metal| .     Malakian has stated that We dont belong to any one scene  and that I dont like the nu-metal  |drop-A|Dropped_A_Tuning| |7-string_guitar|Seven-String_Guitar|  sound; it is not my thing, at least not yet.  In interview with Mike Lancaster, he also said, People always seem to feel the need to put us into a category, but we just dont fit into any category.  According to Tankian, As far as arrangement and everything, is pretty much  |pop|Popular_Music| . To me, System of a Down isnt a progressive band. But its not a typical pop project, obviously. We definitely pay attention to the music to make sure that its not something someones heard before.      The band has used a wide range of instruments, such as  |electric_mandolins|Electric_Mandolin| ,  |baritone_electric_guitars|Baritone_Guitar| ,  |acoustic_guitars|Acoustic_Guitar| ,  |ouds|Oud| ,  |sitars|Sitar|  and  |twelve_string_guitars|Twelve_String_Guitar| .  According to Malakian, he would often write songs in  |E♭_tuning|E♭_Tuning| , which would later be changed to  |drop_C_tuning|Drop_C_Tuning|  in order to be performed by the band. Malakian states that For me, the drop-C tuning is right down the center. It has enough of the clarity and the crisp sound—most of our riffy stuff is done on the top two strings, anyway—but its also thicker and ballsier.       System of a Downs influences include  |Middle_Eastern_music|Middle_Eastern_Music| ,   |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne| ,  |Black_Sabbath|Black_Sabbath| ,  |Led_Zeppelin|Led_Zeppelin| ,  |Def_Leppard|Def_Leppard| ,  |Scorpions|Scorpions| ,  |Morbid_Angel|Morbid_Angel| ,  |Death|Death| ,  |Obituary|Obituary| ,  |Eazy-E|Eazy-E| ,  |N.W.A|N.W.A| ,  |Run-DMC|Run-Dmc| ,  |Umm_Kulthum|Umm_Kulthum| ,  |Abdel_Halim_Hafez|Abdel_Halim_Hafez| ,  |the_Bee_Gees|The_Bee_Gees| ,  |Grateful_Dead|Grateful_Dead| ,   |The_Beatles|The_Beatles| ,   |Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers|Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers| ,   |Dead_Kennedys|Dead_Kennedys| ,  |Metallica|Metallica| ,   |Miles_Davis|Miles_Davis| ,  |Alice_In_Chains|Alice_In_Chains| ,   |Bad_Brains|Bad_Brains| ,   |Slayer|Slayer| ,  and  |Kiss|Kiss| .  One reviewer claimed that their music encompasses different sounds, from sounding like  |Fugazi|Fugazi|  playing  |Rush|Rush|  to sometimes tread close to Frank Zappa territory.  Malakian has stated that Im a fan of music. Im not necessarily a fan of any one band.  Dolmayan stated I dont think we sound like anybody else. I consider us System of a Down. Odadjian stated You can compare us to whoever you want. I dont care. Comparisons and labels have no effect on this band. Fact is fact: We are who we are and they are who they are.                System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, of which has won one in 2006 for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song B.Y.O.B. The band has also been nominated for several  Kerrang!  and MTV awards.
