He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as  Wired . He has also written novels with his uncle,  |George_Jewsbury|George_Jewsbury|  , under the collective pseudonym Stephen Bury.     Stephenson has worked part-time as an advisor for  |Blue_Origin|Blue_Origin| , a company  developing a spacecraft and a space launch system,  and is also a cofounder of Subutai Corporation, whose first offering is the  |interactive_fiction|Interactive_Fiction|  project  The Mongoliad . He is currently  |Magic_Leaps|Magic_Leap|  Chief Futurist.       Born on October 31, 1959 in  |Fort_Meade|Fort_George_G_Meade| ,  |Maryland|Maryland| , Stephenson came from a family of engineers and  |scientists|Science| ; his father is a professor of  |electrical_engineering|Electrical_Engineering|  while his paternal grandfather was a  |physics|Physics|  professor. His mother worked in a  |biochemistry|Biochemistry|  laboratory, and her father was a  |biochemistry|Biochemistry|  professor. Stephensons family moved to  |Champaign_Urbana_Illinois|Champaign_Urbana_Illinois| , in 1960 and then in 1966 to  |Ames_Iowa|Ames_Iowa| . He graduated from  |Ames_High_School|Ames_High_School|  in 1977.     Stephenson studied at  |Boston_University|Boston_University| , first specializing in physics, then switching to geography after he found that it would allow him to spend more time on the university mainframe. He graduated in 1981 with a  |B_A_|Bachelor_Of_Arts|  in  |geography|Geography|  and a minor in physics. Since 1984, Stephenson has lived mostly in the  |Pacific_Northwest|Pacific_Northwest|  and currently lives in  |Seattle|Seattle|  with his family.          Stephensons first novel,  The Big U , published in 1984, was a satirical take on life at American Megaversity, a vast, bland, and alienating research university beset by chaotic riots. His next novel,  Zodiac  , was a thriller following the exploits of a radical environmentalist protagonist in his struggle against corporate polluters. Neither novel attracted much critical attention on first publication, but showcased concerns that Stephenson would further develop in his later work.     Stephensons breakthrough came in 1992 with  Snow Crash , a comic novel in the late  |cyberpunk|Cyberpunk|  or  |post_cyberpunk|Post_Cyberpunk|  tradition fusing  |memetics|Memetics| ,  |computer_virus|Computer_Virus| es, and other high-tech themes with  |Sumerian_mythology|Sumerian_Mythology| , along with a sociological extrapolation of extreme  |laissez_faire_capitalism|Laissez_Faire_Capitalism|  and  |collectivism|Collectivism| .  Snow Crash was the first of Stephensons epic science fiction novels. Stephenson at this time would later be described by  |Mike_Godwin|Mike_Godwin|  as a slight, unassuming grad-student type whose soft-spoken demeanor gave no obvious indication that he had written the manic apotheosis of cyberpunk science fiction. In 1994, Stephenson joined with his uncle,  |J_Frederick_George|J_Frederick_George| , to publish a political thriller,  Interface , under the  |pen_name|Pen_Name|  Stephen Bury ; they followed this in 1996 with  The Cobweb .     Stephensons next solo novel, published in 1995, was  The Diamond Age: or A Young Ladys Illustrated Primer , which introduced many of todays real-world technological discoveries. Seen back then as futuristic, Stephensons novel includes broad-range universal self-learning  |nanotechnology|Nanotechnology| ,  |dynabooks|Dynabook| , robotics, cybernetics, and cyber cities. In a plot involving weapons implanted in characters skulls, near-limitless replicators for everything from mattresses to foods,  |smartpaper|Smartpaper| , air and blood-sanitizing nanobots, set in a grim future world of limited resources populated by hard-edged survivalists, an amalgamation hero is accidentally conceptualized by a few powerful and wealthy creatives, programmers, and hackers.     This was followed by  Cryptonomicon  in 1999, a novel concerned with concepts ranging from computing and  |Alan_Turings|Alan_Turing|  research into  |codebreaking|Codebreaking|  and cryptography during the  |Second_World_War|World_War_Ii|  at  |Bletchley_Park|Bletchley_Park| , to a modern attempt to set up a  |data_haven|Data_Haven| . It has subsequently been reissued in three separate volumes in some countries, including in French and Spanish translations. In 2013, Cryptonomicon won the  |Prometheus_Hall_of_Fame_Award|Prometheus_Hall_Of_Fame_Award| .      The Baroque Cycle  is a series of  |historical_novels|Historical_Fiction|  set in the 17th and 18th centuries, and is in some respects a  |prequel|Prequel|  to Cryptonomicon. It was originally published in three volumes of two or three books each –  Quicksilver  ,  The Confusion , and  The System of the World  – but was subsequently republished as eight separate books: Quicksilver, King of the Vagabonds, Odalisque, Bonanza, Juncto, Solomons Gold, Currency, and System of the World.  The System of the World  won the  |Prometheus_Award|Prometheus_Award|  in 2005.     Stephenson worked at  |Blue_Origin|Blue_Origin| — |Jeff_Bezos|Jeff_Bezos|  spaceflight company—for seven years in the early 2000s when its focus was on novel alternate approaches to  |space|Outer_Space| ,  |alternate_propulsion_systems|Spacecraft_Propulsionspeculative_Methods| , and business models , but left after Blue became a more standard aerospace company.        Following this, Stephenson published a novel titled  Anathem  , a very long and detailed work, perhaps best described as  |speculative_fiction|Speculative_Fiction| . It is set in an Earthlike world , deals with metaphysics, and refers heavily to  |Ancient_Greek_philosophy|Ancient_Greek_Philosophy| , while at the same time being a complex commentary on the insubstantiality of todays society.     In May 2010, the Subutai Corporation, of which Stephenson was named chairman, announced the production of an experimental multimedia fiction project called  The Mongoliad , which centered upon a narrative written by Stephenson and other speculative fiction authors.     Stephensons novel  REAMDE  was released on September 20, 2011. The title is a play on the common filename  |README|Readme| . This thriller, set in the present, centers around a group of  |MMORPG|Mmorpg|  developers caught in the middle of Chinese cyber-criminals, Islamic terrorists, and Russian mafia.      On August 7, 2012, Stephenson released a collection of essays and other previously published fiction entitled Some Remarks: Essays and Other Writing.  This collection also includes a new essay and a short story created specifically for this volume.     In 2012, Stephenson launched a  |Kickstarter|Kickstarter|  campaign for CLANG, a realistic sword-fighting fantasy game. The concept of the game was to use motion control to provide an immersive experience. The campaigns funding goal of $500,000 was reached by the target date of July 9, 2012 on Kickstarter, but funding options remained open and the project continued to accept contributions on its official site.  . Twitter.com. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. The project ran out of money in September 2013.  . Kotaku.com. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. This, and the circumstances around it, has angered some backers.  . Rock, Paper, Shotgun. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. There has even been talk, among the backers, of a potential class-action lawsuit.  The project to develop the game ended in September 2014 without the game being completed. Stephenson took part of the responsibility for the projects failure, stating, I probably focused too much on historical accuracy and not enough on making it sufficiently fun to attract additional investment .      In late 2013, Stephenson stated that he was working on a multi-volume work of historical novels that would have a lot to do with scientific and technological themes and how those interact with the characters and civilisation during a particular span of history . He expected the first two volumes to be released in mid-to-late 2014. Kelion, Leo.  . Bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. However, at about the same time, he shifted his attention to a science fiction novel,  Seveneves , which was completed about a year later and was published in May 2015.  On June 8, 2016, plans were announced to adapt Seveneves for the screen.      In 2014, Stephenson was hired as Chief Futurist by the Florida-based company  |Magic_Leap|Magic_Leap| .  Magic Leap claims to be developing a revolutionary form of augmented reality, not too different from technologies Stephenson previously has described in his science fiction books.     In May 2016, as part of a video discussion with  |Bill_Gates|Bill_Gates| , Stephenson revealed that he had just submitted the manuscript for a new historical novel— a time travel book —co-written with  |Nicole_Galland|Nicole_Galland| , one of his Mongoliad coauthors.  This was released as  The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.  on June 13, 2017.      In June 2019 his next novel  Fall; or, Dodge in Hell  was published. It is a near-future novel that explores mind uploading into the cloud, and contains characters from 2011s  Reamde , 1999s  Cryptonomicon , and other books.        In his earlier novels Stephenson deals heavily in  |pop_culture|Popular_Culture| –laden metaphors and imagery and in quick, hip dialogue, as well as in extended narrative monologues. The tone of his books is generally more irreverent and less serious than that of previous  |cyberpunk|Cyberpunk|  novels such as those of  |William_Gibson|William_Gibson| .          Stephensons books tend to have elaborate, inventive plots drawing on numerous technological and sociological ideas at the same time. The discursive nature of his writing, together with significant plot and character complexity and an abundance of detail suggests a  |baroque|Baroque|  writing style, which Stephenson brought fully to bear in the three-volume Baroque Cycle. His book  The Diamond Age  follows a simpler plot but features  |neo_Victorian|Neo_Victorian|  characters and employs Victorian-era  |literary_conceits|Conceit| . In keeping with the baroque style, Stephensons books have become longer as he has gained recognition. For example, the paperback editions of  Cryptonomicon  are over eleven hundred pages long ex:  with the novel containing various digressions, including a lengthy erotic story about  |antique_furniture|Antique_Furniture|  and  |stockings|Stocking| .
