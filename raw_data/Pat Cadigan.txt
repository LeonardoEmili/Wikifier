        Pat Cadigan is an American  |science_fiction_author|Science_Fiction_Author| , whose work is most often identified with the  |cyberpunk|Cyberpunk|  movement. Her novels and short stories all share a common theme of exploring the relationship between the human mind and technology.       Cadigan was born in  |Schenectady,_New_York|Schenectady,_New_York| , and grew up in  |Fitchburg,_Massachusetts|Fitchburg,_Massachusetts| . She was educated at the  |University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst|University_Of_Massachusetts_Amherst|  in theater and the  |University_of_Kansas|University_Of_Kansas|  , where she studied science fiction and science fiction writing under author and editor Prof.  |James_Gunn|James_Gunn| .     Cadigan met her first husband Rufus Cadigan while in college; they divorced shortly after she graduated from KU in 1975. That same year Cadigan joined the convention committee for  |MidAmeriCon|Midamericon| , the  |34th_World_Science_Fiction_Convention|34Th_World_Science_Fiction_Convention|  being held in  |Kansas_City|Kansas_City,_Missouri| ,  |Missouri|Missouri| , over the 1976  |Labor_Day|Labor_Day|  weekend; she served on the committee as the conventions guest liaison to writer guest of honor  |Robert_A._Heinlein|Robert_A._Heinlein| , while also working for fantasy writer  |Tom_Reamy|Tom_Reamy|  at his Nickelodeon Graphics  |typesetting|Typesetting|  and  |graphic_design|Graphic_Design|  firm. Following Reamys death in 1977, Cadigan went to work as a writer for Kansas Citys  |Hallmark_Cards|Hallmark_Cards| . In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she also edited the  |small_press|Small_Press|  fantasy and science fiction magazines Chacal and later Shayol with her second husband, Arnie Fenner.       Cadigan sold her first professional science fiction story in 1980; her success as an author encouraged her to become a full-time writer in 1987. She emigrated to London in the UK with her son Rob Fenner in 1996, where she is married to her third husband, Christopher Fowler . She became a UK citizen in late 2014.     Cadigans first novel,  Mindplayers , introduces what becomes the common theme to all her works: her stories blur the line between reality and perception by making the human mind a real, explorable place. Her second novel, Synners, expands upon the same theme; both feature a future where direct access to the mind via technology is possible. While her stories include many of the gritty, unvarnished characteristics of the cyberpunk genre, she further specializes in this exploration of the speculative relationship between technology and the perceptions of the human mind.     Cadigan has won a number of awards. These include a 2013  |Hugo_Award|Hugo_Award|  for  |The_Girl-Thing_Who_Went_Out_for_Sushi|The_Girl-Thing_Who_Went_Out_For_Sushi|  in the Best  |Novelette|Hugo_Award_For_Best_Novelette|  category, presented at  |LoneStarCon_3|Lonestarcon_3| , the 71st World Science Fiction Convention, held in San Antonio, Texas over the 2013  |Labor_Day|Labor_Day|  weekend, and the  |Arthur_C._Clarke_Award|Arthur_C._Clarke_Award|  both in 1992 and 1995 for her novels Synners and Fools.      |Robert_A._Heinlein|Robert_A._Heinlein|  in part dedicated his 1982 novel  Friday  to Cadigan after becoming her friend, following her being the guest liaison to him for the 34th  |Worldcon|Worldcon|  in Kansas City.             In the 1960s Cadigan and a childhood girlfriend invented a whole secret life in which we were twins from the planet Venus , she told  |National_Public_Radio|National_Public_Radio| .   |The_Beatles|The_Beatles|  came to us for advice about their songs and how to deal with fame and other important matters, Cadigan says. On occasion, they would ask us to use our highly developed  |shape-shifting|Shape-Shifting|  ability to become them, and finish recording sessions and concert tours when they were too tired to go on themselves. The Venusian twins had other  |superpowers|Superpower| , that they would sometimes use to help out  |Superman|Superman| ,  |Wonder_Woman|Wonder_Woman|  and other heroes, she said.       In 2013, Cadigan announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer. , archived from the original at , by Pat Cadigan, at  |LiveJournal|Livejournal| ; published June 27, 2013; retrieved September 10, 2017                Mindplayers , /; revised and expanded from the following linked stories:   The Pathosfinder , The Berkley Showcase: New Writings in Science Fiction & Fantasy, ed.
