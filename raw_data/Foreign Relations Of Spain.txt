After the return of  |democracy|Democracy|  following the death of  |General_Franco|Francisco_Franco|  in 1975,  |Spains|Spain| |_foreign_policy|Foreign_Policy|  priorities were to break out of the  |diplomatic|Diplomacy|  isolation of the  |Franco_years|Francoist_Spain|  and expand diplomatic relations, enter the  |European_Community|European_Union| , and define  |security|National_Security|  relations with NATO, later joining the organization in 1982.     Spain has established itself as a major participant in  |multilateral|Multilateralism|  international security activities. Spains  |European_Union|European_Union|  membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe| , Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political cooperation mechanisms.                  Spain has maintained its special identification with its fellow  |Spanish|Spanish_Language| -speaking countries. Its policy emphasizes the concept of an  |Ibero_American|Ibero_American|  community, essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of  |Hispano_Americanismo|Hispanoamericanism|  , which has sought to link the  |Iberian_peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  to the  |Spanish_speaking_countries_in_Central_and_South_America|Hispanic_America|  through language, commerce, history and culture. Spain has been an effective example of transition from dictatorship to democracy, as shown in the many trips that  |Spains_King|King_Of_Spain|  and  |Prime_Ministers|Prime_Minister_Of_Spain|  have made to the region.       Spain maintains economic and technical cooperation programs and cultural exchanges with  |Latin_America|Latin_America| , both bilaterally and within the EU. During  |José_María_Aznars|José_María_Aznar|  government, Spanish relations with some Latin-American countries like  |Mexico|Mexico| ,  |Venezuela|Venezuela|  and  |Cuba|Cuba|  worsened, but were exceptionally good with others like  |Colombia|Colombia| ,  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic|  and several  |Central_America|Central_America|  republics.  |José_Luis_Rodríguez_Zapateros|José_Luis_Rodríguez_Zapatero|  victory in the 2004 general elections changed this setting. Despite long-standing close linguistic, economic and cultural relations with most of Latin America, some aspects of Spanish foreign policy during this time, such as its support for the  |Iraq_War|Iraq_War| , were not supported or widely favored.     Today, relations with Venezuela are quite good, which has caused some controversy with the United States, who have been in recent disagreements with Venezuela under  |Hugo_Chávez|Hugo_Chávez|  and its growing relations with  |Anti_American|Anti_Americanism|  Nations , such as Cuba,  |China|China| ,  |Russia|Russia|  and several  |Islamic|Islam| |_Middle_Eastern|Middle_East|  countries. However, due to  |a_notable_public_incident_in_2007|¿Por_Qué_No_Te_Callas?| ,  |Venezuelan_Spanish_ties|Venezuela_Spain_Relations|  were briefly suspended, though were later re-established.       Spain has gradually begun to broaden its contacts with  |Sub_Saharan_Africa|Sub_Saharan_Africa| . It has a particular interest in its former colony of  |Equatorial_Guinea|Equatorial_Guinea| , where it maintains a large  |aid|Aid|  program. More recently, it has sought closer relation with  |Senegal|Senegal| ,  |Mauritania|Mauritania| ,  |Mali|Mali|  and others to find solutions for the issue of  |illegal_immigration|Illegal_Immigration|  to the  |Canary_Islands|Canary_Islands| .  citation needed        In the Middle East, Spain is known as a  |broker|Broker|  between powers. In its relations with the  |Arab_world|Arab_World| , Spain frequently supports Arab positions on  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  issues. The Arab countries are a priority interest for Spain because of  |oil|Petroleum|  and  |gas|Gas|  imports and because several Arab nations have substantial  |investments|Foreign_Direct_Investment|  in Spain.  citation needed        Spain has been successful in managing its relations with its three immediate European neighbours,  |France|France| ,  |Andorra|Andorra| , and  |Portugal|Portugal| . The accession of Spain and Portugal to the EU in 1986 has helped ease some of their periodic trade frictions by putting these into an EU context.  |Franco_Spanish|Franco_Spanish_Cooperation|  bilateral cooperation has been enhanced by joint action against recurring violence by separatist  |Basque|Basque_People|  group  |ETA|Eta|  since the 1960s. Ties with the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  are generally good, although the question of  |Gibraltar|Gibraltar|  remains a sensitive issue, especially since the UK vote on  |Brexit|Brexit| .       Today, Spain is trying to expand its still narrow relations with  |East_Asian|East_Asian|  nations Política exterior española, un balance de futuro. José María Beneyto, 2011, p 425, ch 11 by  |Florentino_Rodao|Florentino_Rodao|  , with  |China|China| ,  |Japan|Japan|  and  |South_Korea|South_Korea|  as its main points of interest in the region.  citation needed   |Thailand|Thailand|  and  |Indonesia|Indonesia|  are Spains main allies in the  |ASEAN|Asean|  region, having a considerable number of agreements and a very good relationship. In the recent years Spain has also been boosting its contacts, relations and investment in other Asian countries, most notably  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  and  |Malaysia|Malaysia| .  citation needed  Relations with the  |Philippines|Philippines|  are, despite a very long  |colonial_past|Spanish_Colonization_Of_The_Philippines| , considerably weaker than the ones Spain has with other countries in the area, dealing mostly with  |cultural_aspects|Cultural_Diplomacy|  and humanitarian assistance programs.              Whilst the  |disputed_on_Gibraltar|Disputed_Status_Of_Gibraltar|  with the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  is perhaps the best known territorial dispute of Spain, the country also has disputes with Portugal and  |Morocco|Morocco| .       Ever since it was  |captured_in_1704_by_Anglo_Dutch_forces|Capture_Of_Gibraltar|  during the  |War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War_Of_The_Spanish_Succession| , Gibraltar has been the subject of a dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain. Situated at the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, overseeing the  |Strait_of_Gibraltar|Strait_Of_Gibraltar|  which connects the  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean|  with the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea| , the territory has great strategic importance. Today, Gibraltar is a  |British_Overseas_Territory|British_Overseas_Territories|  and houses an important base of  |British_Armed_Forces|British_Armed_Forces| .       The strategic position of the Strait of Gibraltar has left a legacy of a number of sovereignty disputes, including those with Morocco concerning the five places of sovereignty  on and off the coast of Morocco - the coastal  |enclaves|Enclave_And_Exclave|  of  |Ceuta|Ceuta|  and  |Melilla|Melilla| , which Morocco contests, as well as the islands of  |Peñon_de_Alhucemas|Penon_De_Alhucemas| ,  |Peñon_de_Vélez_de_la_Gomera|Penon_De_Velez_De_La_Gomera| , and  |Islas_Chafarinas|Islas_Chafarinas| . Spain maintains sovereignty over  |Ceuta|Ceuta| ,  |Melilla|Melilla| , Peñon de Velez de la Gomera, Alhucemas and the Chafarinas Islands based upon historical grounds, security reasons and on the basis of the UN principle of  |territorial_integrity|Territorial_Integrity| . Spain also maintains that the majority of residents are Spanish. Morocco claims these territories on the basis of the UN principles of  |decolonisation|Decolonization| , territorial integrity and that Spanish arguments for the recovery of Gibraltar substantiate Morocco’s claim.        |Olivenza|Olivenza|   or Olivença  is a town and seat of a municipality, on a disputed section of the border between  |Portugal|Portugal|  and  |Spain|Spain| , which is claimed  de jure  by both countries and administered  de facto  as part of the Spanish  |autonomous_community|Autonomous_Communities_Of_Spain|  of  |Extremadura|Extremadura| . The population is 80% ethnic Portuguese and 30% of Portuguese language. Olivenza/Olivença was under continuous  |Portuguese|Portugal|  sovereignty since 1297 until it was  |occupied_by_the_Spanish_in_1801|War_Of_The_Oranges|  and formally ceded by Portugal later that year by the  |Treaty_of_Badajoz|Treaty_Of_Badajoz| . Spain claims the  de jure  sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked. Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza/Olivença should be as demarcated by that treaty. Portugal claims the de jure sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz was revoked by its own terms when Spain invaded Portugal in the  |Peninsular_War|Peninsular_War|  of 1807.     Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the  |Treaty_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna|  of 1815, which Spain signed in 1817, that states that the winning countries are to  endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza/Olivença to Portuguese authority . Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza/Olivença should be as demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297. Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza/Olivença to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, but has equally never directly acknowledged the Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença.     Portugal continues to claim  |Olivenza|Olivenza| /Olivença, asserting that under the  |Vienna_Treaty|Treaty_Of_Vienna|  of 1815, Spain recognized the Portuguese claims as legitimate . The historic disputes with Portugal over the  |Savage_Islands|Savage_Islands|  in the  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean|  were resolved in recent times.     Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza/Olivença . On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public.
