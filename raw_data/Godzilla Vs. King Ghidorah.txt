      is a 1991 Japanese  |kaiju_film|Kaiju|  written and directed by  |Kazuki_Ōmori|Kazuki_Ōmori|  and produced by  |Shōgo_Tomiyama|Shōgo_Tomiyama| . The film, produced and distributed by  |Toho_Studios|Toho| , is the 18th film in the  |Godzilla_franchise|Godzilla| , and is the third film in the franchises  |Heisei_period|Godzilla_Heisei_Period| . The film features the fictional monster characters  |Godzilla|Godzilla|  and  |King_Ghidorah|King_Ghidorah| , and stars  |Kōsuke_Toyohara|Kōsuke_Toyohara| ,  |Anna_Nakagawa|Anna_Nakagawa| ,  |Megumi_Odaka|Megumi_Odaka| ,  |Katsuhiko_Sasaki|Katsuhiko_Sasaki| ,  |Akiji_Kobayashi|Akiji_Kobayashi| ,  |Yoshio_Tsuchiya|Yoshio_Tsuchiya| , and  |Robert_Scott_Field|Robert_Scott_Field| .     The production crew of Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah remained largely unchanged from that of the previous film in the series,  Godzilla vs. Biollante . Because the previous installment was a box office disappointment, due to a lack of child viewership and alleged competition with the  |Back_to_the_Future_franchise|Back_To_The_Future| , the producers of Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah were compelled to create a film with more  |fantasy|Fantasy|  elements, along with  |time_travel|Time_Travel| .      Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah was the first Godzilla film since 1975s  Terror of Mechagodzilla  to feature a newly orchestrated score by  |Akira_Ifukube|Akira_Ifukube| . The film was released theatrically in Japan on December 14, 1991, and was followed by  Godzilla vs. Mothra  the following year. It was released  |direct_to_video|Direct_To_Video|  in North America in 1998 by  |Columbia_TriStar_Home_Entertainment|Sony_Pictures_Home_Entertainment| . Though Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah was more financially successful than Godzilla vs. Biollante, the film became somewhat controversial in the United States as a result of perceived  |anti_Americanism|Anti_Americanism|  stemming from a scene where Godzilla kills several American soldiers.        In 1992, science fiction writer Kenichiro Terasawa is writing a book about  |Godzilla|Godzilla|  and learns of a group of Japanese soldiers stationed on Lagos Island during the  |Gilbert_and_Marshall_Islands_campaign|Gilbert_And_Marshall_Islands_Campaign| . In February 1944, while threatened by American soldiers, the Japanese soldiers were saved by a mysterious dinosaur. He theorizes that the dinosaur was subsequently mutated into Godzilla in 1954 after a  |hydrogen_bomb_test|Castle_Bravo|  on the island. Yasuaki Shindo, a wealthy businessman who commanded the Japanese soldiers on  |Lagos_Island|List_Of_Fictional_Locations_In_The_Godzilla_Filmslagos_Island| , confirms that the dinosaur did indeed exist.     Meanwhile, a  |UFO|Unidentified_Flying_Object|  lands on  |Mount_Fuji|Mount_Fuji| . When the Japanese army investigates, they are greeted by Wilson, Grenchiko, Emmy Kano and the android M-11. The visitors, known as the Futurians , explain that they are humans from the year  |2204|23Rd_Century| , where Godzilla has completely destroyed Japan. The Futurians plan to  |travel_back_in_time|Time_Travel|  to 1944 and remove the dinosaur from Lagos Island before the island is irradiated in 1954, thus preventing the mutation of the creature into Godzilla. As proof of their story, Emmy presents a copy of Terasawas book, which has not yet been completed in the present.     The Futurians, Terasawa,  |Miki_Saegusa|Miki_Saegusa| , and Professor Mazaki, board a time shuttle and travel back to 1944 to Lagos Island. There, as American forces land and engage the Japanese forces commanded by Shindo, the dinosaur attacks and kills the American soldiers. The American navy then bombs the dinosaur from the sea and gravely wounds it. After Shindo and his men leave the island, M-11 teleports the dinosaur from Lagos Island to the  |Bering_Strait|Bering_Strait| . Before returning to 1992, the Futurians secretly leave three small creatures called Dorats on Lagos Island, which are exposed to radiation from the hydrogen bomb test in 1954 and merge to become  |King_Ghidorah|King_Ghidorah| , which then appears in present-day Japan. After returning to 1992, the Futurians use King Ghidorah to subjugate Japan and issue an ultimatum, but Japan refuses to surrender.     Feeling sympathy for the Japanese people, Emmy reveals to Terasawa the truth behind the Futurians mission: in the future, Japan is an economic superpower that has surpassed the United States, Russia, and China. The Futurians traveled back in time in order to change history and prevent Japans future economic dominance by creating King Ghidorah and using it to destroy present day Japan. At the same time, they also planned to erase Godzilla from history so it would not pose a threat to their plans. After M-11 brings Emmy back to the UFO, she reprograms the android so it will help her.     Terasawa discovers that a Russian nuclear submarine sank in the Bering Strait in the 1970s and released enough radiation to mutate the dinosaur into  |Godzilla|The_Return_Of_Godzilla| . Shindo plans to use his nuclear submarine to rejuvenate Godzilla. En route to the Bering Strait, Shindos submarine is destroyed by Godzilla, who absorbs its radiation and becomes larger and more powerful. Godzilla arrives in Japan and is met by King Ghidorah. They fight at equal strength, each immune to the others attacks. With M-11 and Terasawas aid, Emmy sabotages the UFOs control over King Ghidorah, causing the three-headed monster to lose focus during the battle. Godzilla eventually ends the battle by blasting off Ghidorahs middle head. Before sending King Ghidorah crashing into the ocean, Godzilla destroys the UFO, killing Wilson and Grenchiko before turning its attention on Tokyo, destroying the city and killing Shindo.     Emmy travels to the future with M-11 and returns to the present day with Mecha-King Ghidorah, a cybernetic version of King Ghidorah. The cybernetic Ghidorah blasts Godzilla with energy beams, which proves useless. Godzilla then counters by relentlessly blasting Ghidorah with its atomic breath before Ghidorah launches clamps to restrain Godzilla. Ghidorah carries Godzilla out of Japan, but Godzilla breaks from its restraints and causes Ghidorah to send both crashing into the ocean. Emmy then returns to the future but not before informing Terasawa that she is his descendant.     At the bottom of the ocean, Godzilla awakens and roars over  |Ghidorahs_remains|Godzilla_Vs_Mechagodzilla_Ii|  before swimming away.                     Although the previously filmed  Godzilla vs. Biollante  had been the most expensive Godzilla film produced at the time, its low audience attendance and loss of revenue convinced executive producer and Godzilla series creator  |Tomoyuki_Tanaka|Tomoyuki_Tanaka|  to revitalize the series by bringing back iconic monsters from pre-1984 Godzilla movies, specifically Godzillas archenemy  |King_Ghidorah|King_Ghidorah| .     Godzilla vs. Biollante director and writer  |Kazuki_Ōmori|Kazuki_Ōmori|  had initially hoped to start a standalone series centered on  |Mothra|Mothra| , and was in the process of rewriting a 1980 script for the unrealized film Mothra vs. Bagan. The film was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that, unlike Godzilla, Mothra would have been a difficult character to market overseas. The planning stages for a sequel to Godzilla vs. Biollante were initially hampered by Tanakas deteriorating health, thus prompting the takeover of  |Shōgo_Tomiyama|Shōgo_Tomiyama|  as producer. The new producer felt that the financial failure of Godzilla vs. Biollante was due to the plot being too sophisticated for child audiences, and thus intended to return some of the fantasy elements of the pre-1984 Godzilla films to the series. Ōmori himself blamed the lackluster performance of Godzilla vs. Biollante on competition with  Back to the Future Part II , and thus concluded that audiences wanted plots involving time travel. His approach to the film also differed from Godzilla vs. Biollante in his greater emphasis on developing the personalities of the monsters rather than the human characters.       |Akira_Ifukube|Akira_Ifukube|  agreed to compose the films score on the insistence of his daughter, after as he was dissatisfied with the way his compositions had been treated in Godzilla vs. Biollante.          The Godzilla suits used in Godzilla vs. Biollante were reused in Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, though with slight modifications. The original suit used for land-based and full body shots had its head replaced with a wider and flatter one, and the body cut in half. The upper half was used in scenes where Godzilla emerges from the sea and during close-ups during the characters first fight with King Ghidorah. The suit used previously for scenes set at sea was modified with rounder shoulders, a more prominent chest, and an enhanced face, and was used throughout the majority of the films Godzilla scenes. Robert Biondi, The Evolution of Godzilla – G-Suit Variations Throughout the Monster King’s Twenty One Films , G-FAN 16     The redesigned King Ghidorah featured much more advanced wirework puppetry than its predecessors, and effects team leader  |Koichi_Kawakita|Koichi_Kawakita|  designed the Godzillasaurus as a more paleontologically accurate-looking dinosaur than Godzilla itself as a nod to American filmmakers aspiring to direct their own Godzilla films with the intention of making the monster more realistic. Ōmoris original draft specified that the dinosaur that would become Godzilla was a  Tyrannosaurus , though this was rejected by creature designer Shinji Nishikawa, who stated that he couldnt accept that a tyrannosaur could become Godzilla . The final suit combined features of Tyrannosaurus with Godzilla, and real  |octopus|Octopus|  blood was used during the bombardment scene. Because the Godzillasaurus arms were much smaller than Godzillas, suit performer  |Wataru_Fukuda|Wataru_Fukuda|  had to operate them with levers within the costume. The creatures distress calls were recycled  |Gamera|Gamera|  cries.       The Columbia/TriStar Home Video DVD version was released in 1998 as a single disc double feature with  Godzilla vs. Mothra . The picture was  |full_frame|Full_Frame|  and the audio in English . There were no subtitles. Extras included the trailer for Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah and Godzilla vs. Mothra.     The Sony Blu-ray version was released on May 6, 2014 as a two-disc double feature with  Godzilla vs. Mothra .  The picture was MPEG-4 AVC and the audio was in Japanese and English . Subtitles were added in English, English SDH and French. Extras included the theatrical trailer and three teasers in HD with English subtitles.       Joseph Savitski of Beyond Hollywood said This entry in the popular monster series is a disappointing and flawed effort unworthy of the “Godzilla” name.        The film was considered controversial at the time of its release, being contemporary to a period of  |economic_tension|Japan_United_States_Relations1990S_After_The_Cold_War|  between America and Japan, but mainly due to its fictional  |World_War_II|Pacific_Ocean_Theater_Of_World_War_Ii|  depictions. Gerald Glaubitz of the  |Pearl_Harbor_Survivors_Association|Pearl_Harbor_Survivors_Association|  appeared alongside director  |Kazuki_Ōmori|Kazuki_Ōmori|  on  Entertainment Tonight  and condemned the film as being in very poor taste and detrimental to American-Japanese relations, allegations that Ōmori denied, stating that the American extras in the film had been happy about being crushed and squished by Godzilla.   |Ishirō_Honda|Ishirō_Honda|  also criticized Ōmori, stating that the scene in question went too far .
