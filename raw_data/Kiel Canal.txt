     The Kiel Canal  is a  long  |freshwater|Freshwater| |_canal|Canal|  in the  |German|Germany| |_state|States_Of_Germany|  of  |Schleswig_Holstein|Schleswig_Holstein| . The canal was finished in 1895, but later widened, and links the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  at  |Brunsbüttel|Brunsbüttel|  to the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  at  |Kiel_Holtenau|Kiel| . An average of  is saved by using the Kiel Canal instead of going around the  |Jutland|Jutland|  Peninsula. This not only saves time but also avoids storm-prone seas and having to pass through  |the_Sound|Øresund|  or  |Belts|Danish_Straits| .     Besides its two sea entrances, the Kiel Canal is linked, at  |Oldenbüttel|Oldenbüttel| , to the navigable  |River_Eider|Eider|  by the short  |Gieselau_Canal|Gieselau_Canal| .        The first connection between the North and Baltic Seas was constructed while the area was ruled by  |Denmark–Norway|Denmark–Norway| . It was called the  |Eider_Canal|Eider_Canal| , which used stretches of the  |Eider_River|Eider_River|  for the link between the two seas. Completed during the reign of  |Christian_VII_of_Denmark|Christian_Vii_Of_Denmark|  in 1784, the Eiderkanal was a  part of a  waterway from Kiel to the Eider Rivers mouth at  |Tönning|Tönning|  on the west coast. It was only  wide with a depth of , which limited the vessels that could use the canal to 300  |tonnes|Tonnage| .     After 1864  |Second_Schleswig_War|Second_Schleswig_War|  put Schleswig-Holstein under the government of  |Prussia|Prussia|  , a new canal was sought by merchants and by the  |German_navy|Kaiserliche_Marine| , which wanted to link its bases in the Baltic and the North Sea without the need to sail around  |Denmark|Denmark| .        In June 1887, construction started at  |Holtenau|Holtenau|  , near Kiel. The canal took over 9,000 workers eight years to build. On 20 June 1895 the canal was officially opened by  |Kaiser|Kaiser| |_Wilhelm_II|William_Ii_German_Emperor|  for transiting from  |Brunsbüttel|Brunsbüttel|  to Holtenau. The next day, a ceremony was held in Holtenau, where Wilhelm II named it the Kaiser Wilhelm Kanal , and laid the final stone.  The opening of the canal was filmed by British director  |Birt_Acres|Birt_Acres| ;  |surviving_footage|Opening_Of_The_Kiel_Canal|  of this early film is preserved in the  |Science_Museum|Science_Museum|  in London.  The first vessel to pass through the canal was the  |aviso|Aviso|  ; she was sent through in late April, before the canal officially opened, to determine if it was ready for use.     The first Trans-Atlantic sailing ship to pass through the canal was Lilly, commanded by  |Johan_Pitka|Johan_Pitka| . Lilly, a  |barque|Barque| , was a wooden sailing ship of about 390 tons built 1866 in  |Sunderland|Sunderland_Tyne_And_Wear| , U.K. She had a length of , beam , depth of  and a  keel.

In order to meet the increasing traffic and the demands of the  |Imperial_German_Navy|Imperial_German_Navy| , between 1907 and 1914 the canal width was increased. The widening of the canal allowed the passage of a  Dreadnought -sized  |battleship|Battleship| . This meant that these battleships could travel from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea without having to go around Denmark. The enlargement projects were completed by the installation of two larger  |canal_locks|Canal_Lock|  in Brunsbüttel and Holtenau.        After  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  required the canal to be open to vessels of commerce and of war of any nation at peace with Germany, while leaving it under German administration.   The government under  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  repudiated its international status in 1936, but the canal was reopened to all traffic after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . In 1948, the current name was adopted.     The canal was partially closed in March 2013 after two lock gates failed at the western end near Brunsbüttel. Ships larger than  were forced to navigate via  |Skagerrak|Skagerrak| , a  detour. The failure was blamed on neglect and a lack of funding by the  |German_Federal_Government|Cabinet_Of_Germany|  which has been in financial dispute with the state of Schleswig-Holstein regarding the canal. Germanys Transport Ministry promised rapid repairs.        There are detailed traffic rules for the canal. Each vessel in passage is classified in one of six traffic groups according to its dimensions. Larger ships are obliged to accept  |pilots|Maritime_Pilot|  and specialised canal helmsmen, in some cases even the assistance of a  |tugboat|Tugboat| . Furthermore, there are regulations regarding the passing of oncoming ships. Larger ships may also be required to moor at the bollards provided at intervals along the canal to allow the passage of oncoming vessels. Special rules apply to pleasure craft.          All permanent, fixed bridges crossing the canal since its construction have a clearance of .     Maximum length for ships passing the Kiel Canal is ; with the maximum width  of  these ships can have a draught of up to . Ships up to a length of  may have a draught up to .  The bulker Ever Leader is considered to be the cargo ship that to date has come closest to the overall limits.                 Several railway lines and federal roads  cross the canal on eleven  |fixed_links|Fixed_Link| . The bridges have a clearance of  allowing for ship heights up to . The oldest bridge still in use is the Levensau High Bridge from 1893; however, the bridge will have to be replaced in the course of a canal expansion already underway. In sequence and in the direction of the official kilometre count from west to east these crossings are:     Brunsbüttel High Bridge, four lane crossing of  |Bundesstraße_5|Bundesstraße_5|   Hochdonn High Bridge  of the  |Marsh_Railway|Marsh_Railway|  Hohenhörn High Bridge for  |Autobahn_23|Bundesautobahn_23|  Grünental High Bridge for railway line  |Neumünster|Neumünster| - |Heide|Heide|  and Bundesstraße 204    Rendsburg High Bridge  for the  |Neumünster–Flensburg_railway|Neumünster–Flensburg_Railway| , suspended from which is a  |transporter_bridge|Transporter_Bridge|  for local traffic   Kanaltunnel Rendsburg, road tunnel for Bundesstraße 77   Rendsburg pedestrian tunnel    Rade High Bridge for  |Autobahn_A7|Bundesautobahn_7|   Levensau High Bridge  from 1893 for the  |Kiel–Flensburg_railway|Kiel–Flensburg_Railway|  and a local road   New Levensau High Bridge for Bundesstraße 76   Holtenau High Bridges, two parallel bridges with three car lanes each as well as pavements for pedestrians and cyclists     Local traffic is also catered for by 14 ferry lines. Most noteworthy is the “ |hanging_ferry|Transporter_Bridge| ”  beneath the Rendsburg High Bridge .
