Arecales is an  |order|Order|  of  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plant| . The order has been widely recognised only for the past few decades; until then, the accepted name for the order including these plants was  |Principes|Principes| .         The  |Cronquist_system|Cronquist_System|  of 1981 assigned the order to the subclass  |Arecidae|Arecidae|  in the class  |Liliopsida|Liliopsida|  .     The  |Thorne_system|Thorne_System|  and the  |Dahlgren_system|Dahlgren_System|  assigned the order to the superorder Areciflorae, also called  |Arecanae|Arecanae|  in the subclass  |Liliidae|Liliidae|  , with the single family Arecaceae.     The  |APG_II_system|Apg_Ii_System|  of 2003 recognised the order and placed it in the clade  |commelinids|Commelinids|  in the  |monocots|Monocots|  and uses this circumscription:     order Arecales   : family  |Arecaceae|Arecaceae| , alternative name  |Palmae|Palmae|      This was unchanged from the  |APG_system|Apg_System|  of 1998, although it used the spelling commelinoids instead of commelinids.     The  |APG_IV_system|Apg_Iv_System|  of 2016 places  |Dasypogonaceae|Dasypogonaceae|  in this order, after studies shown Dasypogonaceae as sister to Arecaceae.
