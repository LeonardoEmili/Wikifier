The Polish form of his birth name was .  He used his mothers first name in an initial literary pseudonym, Izaak Baszewis, which he later expanded. Several of his professional identification cards using localized spellings and further variants of these names are reproduced in:  He was a leading figure in the  |Yiddish_literary_movement|Yiddish_Literature| , writing and publishing only in  |Yiddish|Yiddish| . He was also awarded two U.S.  |National_Book_Awards|National_Book_Award| ,  |one_in_Childrens_Literature|National_Book_Award_For_Young_Peoples_Literature|  for his memoir A Day Of Pleasure: Stories of a Boy Growing Up in Warsaw and  |one_in_Fiction|National_Book_Award_For_Fiction|  for his collection  A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories  .                   Isaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1902 in  |Leoncin|Leoncin|  village near  |Warsaw|Warsaw| ,  |Poland|Congress_Poland| , under  |military_partitions|Partitions_Of_Poland|  by the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| . A few years later, the family moved to a nearby Polish town of  |Radzymin|Radzymin| . The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most probably it was November 11 a date similar to the one that Singer gave both to his official biographer Paul Kresh, his secretary Dvorah Telushkin, and Rabbi William Berkowitz.  The year 1902 is consistent with the historical events that his brother refers to in their childhood memoirs, including the death of Theodor Herzl. The often-quoted birth date, July 14, 1904 was made up by the author in his youth, most probably to make himself younger to avoid the draft.     His father was a  |Hasidic|Hasidic_Judaism| |_rabbi|Rabbi|  and his mother, Bathsheba, was the daughter of the rabbi of  |Biłgoraj|Biłgoraj| . Singer later used her name in his pen name Bashevis . Both his older siblings, sister  |Esther_Kreitman|Esther_Kreitman|  and brother  |Israel_Joshua_Singer|Israel_Joshua_Singer|  , became writers as well. Esther was the first of the family to write stories.     The family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva. After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to a flat at ul. Krochmalna 10. In the spring of 1914, the Singers moved to No. 12.      The street where Singer grew up was located in the impoverished,  |Yiddish|Yiddish_Language| -speaking Jewish quarter of Warsaw. There his father served as a rabbi, and was called on to be a judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader in the Jewish community. The unique atmosphere of pre-war Krochmalna Street can be found both in the collection of Varshavsky-stories, which tell stories from Singers childhood, Best known: My Fathers Court 1966 as well as in those novels and stories which take place in pre-war Warsaw. Die familye Mushkat/The Family Moskat 1950, Shoym 1967/Scum 1991, etc.       In 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up. Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to his mothers hometown of Biłgoraj, a traditional  shtetl , where his mothers brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis. When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer returned to  |Warsaw|Warsaw| . He entered the  |Tachkemoni|Tachkemoni|  Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him. He returned to Biłgoraj, where he tried to support himself by giving  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language|  lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure. In 1923 his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Jewish Literarische Bleter, of which the brother was an editor.       In 1935, four years before the  |German|Nazi_Germany| |_invasion|Invasion_Of_Poland| , Singer emigrated from  |Poland|Second_Polish_Republic|  to the United States. He was fearful of the growing Nazi threat in neighboring Germany. . The move separated the author from his common-law first wife Runia Pontsch and son Israel Zamir ; they emigrated to  |Moscow|Moscow|  and then  |Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine| . The three met again twenty years later in 1955.     Singer settled in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , where he took up work as a journalist and columnist for  The Jewish Daily Forward  , a Yiddish-language newspaper. After a promising start, he became despondent and for some years felt Lost in America .     In 1938, he met Alma Wassermann  |née|Née|  Haimann , a German-Jewish refugee from  |Munich|Munich| . They married in 1940, and their union seemed to release energy in him; he returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the Forward. In addition to his pen name of Bashevis, he published under the pen names of Warszawski during World War  II, and D. Segal. See both bibliographies . They lived for many years in the  |Belnord|Belnord|  apartment building on Manhattans  |Upper_West_Side|Upper_West_Side| . .     In 1981, Singer delivered a commencement address at the  |University_at_Albany|University_At_Albany| , and was presented with an honorary doctorate. .

He was buried in  |Cedar_Park_Cemetery_Emerson|Cedar_Park_Cemetery_Emerson| , New Jersey. . . A street in Surfside, Florida is named Isaac Singer Boulevard in his honor; and so is a city square in  |Lublin|Lublin| , Poland. The full academic scholarship for undergraduate students at the  |University_of_Miami|University_Of_Miami|  is also named in his honor.       Singers first published story won the literary competition of the literarishe bletter and garnered him a reputation as a promising talent. A reflection of his formative years in the kitchen of literature  can be found in many of his later works. IB Singer published his first novel, Satan in Goray, in installments in the literary magazine Globus, which he had co-founded with his life-long friend, the Yiddish poet  |Aaron_Zeitlin|Aaron_Zeitlin|  in 1935. The book recounts events of 1648 in the village of Goraj , where the Jews of Poland lost a third of their population in a wholesale attack by  |Cossacks|Cossacks| . It explores the effects of the seventeenth-century faraway false messiah,  |Shabbatai_Zvi|Shabbatai_Zvi| , on the local population. Its last chapter imitates the style of a medieval Yiddish chronicle. With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger. In his later work, The Slave , Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648, in a love story between a Jewish man and a  |Gentile|Gentile|  woman. He portrays the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding.     The Family Moskat The Jewish Daily Forward  only after his older brother Israel died in 1945. That year, Singer published The Family Moskat in his brothers honor. His own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with double adultery during the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur|  . He was almost forced to stop writing the novel by his legendary editor-in-chief,  |Abraham_Cahan|Abraham_Cahan| , but was saved by readers who wanted the story to go on. After this, his stories—which he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before—were printed in the Forward as well. Throughout the 1940s, Singers reputation grew.     Singer believed in the power of his native language and thought that there was still a large audience, including in New York, who longed to read in Yiddish. In an interview in Encounter , he claimed that although the  |Jews_of_Poland|History_Of_The_Jews_In_Poland|  had died, something—call it spirit or whatever—is still somewhere in the universe. This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it.     Some of his colleagues and readers were shocked by his all-encompassing view of human nature. He wrote about female homosexuality , published in The Seance and Other Stories Yentl the Yeshiva Boy in Short Friday Zeidlus the Pope in Short Fridaywith some degree of accuracy195019671969 The Magic Mountain 1966197319611970magazinemagazine19891983 |otograph|Otograph| 1986really hypnotized himself |ited_Stat|Ited_Stat| one of twoW. 86th st.ul.
