In  |topology|Topology|  and related areas of  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a product space is the  |Cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|  of a family of  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  equipped with a  |natural_topology|Natural_Topology|  called the product topology. This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the  |box_topology|Box_Topology| , which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces. However, the product topology is correct in that it makes the product space a  |categorical_product|Product|  of its factors, whereas the box topology is  |too_fine|Comparison_Of_Topologies| ; this is the sense in which the product topology is natural .       Given X such that     : X :   Xi     is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces X i ,  |indexed|Index_Set|  by i   I , and the  canonical projections  p i  : X & rarr; X i , the product topology on X is defined to be the  |coarsest_topology|Coarsest_Topology|  for which all the projections p i  are  |continuous|Continuous| . The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.     The open sets in the product topology are unions of sets of the form   Ui , where each U i  is open in X i  and U i  ≠  X i for only finitely many i. In particular, for a finite product , the set of all Cartesian products between one basis element from each X i  gives a basis for the product topology of   Xi . That is, for a finite product, the set of all   Ui , where Ui is an element of the basis of Xi , is a basis for the product topology of   Xi .     The product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form p i  & minus;1 , where i is in I  and U i  is an open subset of X i . In other words, the sets  form a  |subbase|Subbase|  for the topology on X. A  |subset|Subset|  of X is open if and only if it is a  |union|Union|  of  |intersections|Intersection|  of finitely many sets of the form p i  & minus;1 . The p i  & minus;1  are sometimes called  |open_cylinders|Open_Cylinder| , and their intersections are  |cylinder_sets|Cylinder_Set| .     In general, the product of the topologies of each X i  forms a basis for what is called the  |box_topology|Box_Topology|  on X. In general, the box topology is  |finer|Finer_Topology|  than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.         If one starts with the  |standard_topology|Standard_Topology|  on the  |real_line|Real_Line|  R and defines a topology on the product of n copies of R in this fashion, one obtains the ordinary  |Euclidean_topology|Euclidean_Topology|  on R n .     The  |Cantor_set|Cantor_Set|  is  |homeomorphic|Homeomorphic|  to the product of  |countably_many|Countable|  copies of the  |discrete_space|Discrete_Space|  and the space of  |irrational_numbers|Irrational_Number|  is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number| , where again each copy carries the discrete topology.     Several additional examples are given in the article on the  |initial_topology|Initial_Topology| .         The product space X, together with the canonical projections, can be characterized by the following  |universal_property|Universal_Property| Y is a topological space, and for every i in I, f i  : Y & rarr; X i  is a continuous map, then there exists precisely one continuous map f : Y & rarr; X such that for each i in I the following diagram  |commutes|Commutative_Diagram|    This shows that the product space is a  |product|Product|  in the  |category_of_topological_spaces|Category_Of_Topological_Spaces| . It follows from the above universal property that a map f : Y & rarr; X is continuous  |if_and_only_if|If_And_Only_If|  f i  p i  ∘ f is continuous for all i in I. In many cases it is easier to check that the component functions f i  are continuous. Checking whether a map f : Y & rarr; X is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the p i  are continuous in some way.     In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections p i  : X & rarr; X i  are  |open_maps|Open_Map| . This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when projected down to the X i . The converse is not true: if W is a  |subspace|Subspace|  of the product space whose projections down to all the X i  are open, then W need not be open in X.  The canonical projections are not generally  |closed_maps|Closed_Map|  .     The product topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because of the following fact: a  |sequence|Sequence|   in X converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces X i converge. In particular, if one considers the space X R I of all  |real|Real_Number|  valued  |functions|Function|  on I, convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.     Any product of closed subsets of X i  is a closed set in X.     An important theorem about the product topology is  |Tychonoffs_theorem|Tychonoffs_Theorem| |compact_spaces|Compact_Space|  is compact. This is easy to show for finite products, while the general statement is equivalent to the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| .       Separation   Every product of  |T_0_spaces|T0_Space|  is T 0   Every product of  |T_1_spaces|T1_Space|  is T 1   Every product of  |Hausdorff_spaces|Hausdorff_Space|  is Hausdorff    Every product of  |regular_spaces|Regular_Space|  is regular   Every product of  |Tychonoff_spaces|Tychonoff_Space|  is Tychonoff   A product of  |normal_spaces|Normal_Space|  need not be normal   Compactness   Every product of compact spaces is compact    A product of  |locally_compact_spaces|Locally_Compact_Space|  need not be locally compact. However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact is locally compact .   Connectedness   Every product of  |connected|Connectedness|  spaces is connected   Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected.   Metric spaces   Countable products of  |metric_spaces|Metric_Space|  are  |metrizable|Metric_Space|        The  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice|  is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.     The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of product spaces; for example,  |Tychonoffs_theorem|Tychonoffs_Theorem| .
