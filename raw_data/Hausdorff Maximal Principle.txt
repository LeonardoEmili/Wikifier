In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the Hausdorff maximal principle is an alternate and earlier formulation of  |Zorns_lemma|Zorns_Lemma|  proved by  |Felix_Hausdorff|Felix_Hausdorff|  in 1914 . It states that in any  |partially_ordered_set|Partial_Order| , every  |totally_ordered|Total_Order| |_subset|Subset|  is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.     The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice|  over ZF . The principle is also called the Hausdorff maximality theorem or the Kuratowski lemma .         The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any  |partially_ordered_set|Partial_Order| , every  |totally_ordered|Total_Order| |_subset|Subset|  is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.     An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.     To prove that it follows from the original form, let A be a  |poset|Poset| . Then   is a totally ordered subset of A, hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing   , in particular A contains a maximal totally ordered subset.     For the converse direction, let A be a partially ordered set and T a totally ordered subset of A. Then   :     is partially ordered by set inclusion   , therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset P. Then the set M  P satisfies the desired properties.     The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorns lemma is very similar to this proof.       EXAMPLE 1. If A is any collection of sets, the relation is a proper subset of is a  |strict_partial_order|Strict_Partial_Order|  on A. Suppose that A is the collection of all circular regions in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of A consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.     EXAMPLE 2.
