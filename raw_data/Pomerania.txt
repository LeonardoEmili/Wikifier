              Pomerania  is a  |historical_region|Historical_Region|  on the southern shore of the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  in  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe| , split between  |Poland|Poland|  and  |Germany|Germany| .     The name derives from the  |Polish|Polish_Language|  term po morze, meaning by the sea or on the sea .  Pomerania stretches roughly from the  |Recknitz|Recknitz|  and  |Trebel|Trebel|  rivers in the west to the  |Vistula|Vistula|  river in the east. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000, Pomerania      The largest Pomeranian islands are  |Rügen|Rügen| ,  |Usedom/Uznam|Usedom|  and  |Wolin|Wolin| . The largest Pomeranian city is  |Gdańsk|Gdańsk| , or, when using a narrower definition of the region,  |Szczecin|Szczecin| . Outside its urban areas, Pomerania is characterized by farmland, dotted with numerous lakes, forests, and towns. The region has a rich and complicated political and demographic history, and was ruled by various countries, often simultaneously, including local dynasties, although over the centuries Polish and German influences remained the strongest. The region was strongly affected by numerous disastrous wars and border shifts since the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| , but also saw long periods of great prosperity, reflected in its rich architecture, mainly thanks to maritime trade.              Pomerania is the area along the  |Bay_of_Pomerania|Bay_Of_Pomerania|  of the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  between the rivers  |Recknitz|Recknitz|  and  |Trebel|Trebel|  in the west and  |Vistula|Vistula|  in the east. It formerly reached perhaps as far south as the  |Noteć|Noteć|  river, but since the 13th century its southern boundary has been placed further north.       Most of the region is coastal lowland, being part of the  |Central_European_Plain|North_European_Plain| , but its southern, hilly parts belong to the  |Baltic_Ridge|Baltic_Ridge| , a belt of terminal  |moraines|Moraine|  formed during the  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene| . Within this ridge, a chain of  |moraine-dammed_lakes|Moraine-Dammed_Lake|  constitutes the  |Pomeranian_Lake_District|Pomeranian_Lake_District| . The soil is generally rather poor, sometimes sandy or marshy.     The western coastline is jagged, with many peninsulas  and islands  enclosing numerous bays  and lagoons .     The eastern coastline is smooth.  |Łebsko|Łebsko_Lake|  and several other lakes were formerly bays, but have been cut off from the sea. The easternmost coastline along the  |Gdańsk_Bay|Gdańsk_Bay|   and  |Vistula_Lagoon|Vistula_Lagoon| , has the  |Hel_Peninsula|Hel_Peninsula|  and the  |Vistula_peninsula|Vistula_Peninsula|  jutting out into the Baltic.       The Pomeranian region has the following administrative divisions:      |Hither_Pomerania|Western_Pomerania|   in northeastern Germany, stretching from the Recknitz river to the  |Oder–Neisse_line|Oder–Neisse_Line| . This region is part of the  |federal_state|States_Of_Germany|  of  |Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Vorpommern| . The southernmost part of historical Vorpommern  is now in  |Brandenburg|Brandenburg| , while its historical eastern parts  are now in Poland. Vorpommern comprises the historical regions inhabited by Slavic tribes Rugians and Volinians, otherwise the  |Principality_of_Rügen|Principality_Of_Rügen|  and the  |County_of_Gützkow|County_Of_Gützkow| .   The  |West_Pomeranian_Voivodeship|Zachodniopomorskie|   in Poland, stretching from the Oder–Neisse line to the  |Wieprza|Wieprza|  river, encompassing most of historical Pomerania in the narrow sense .   The  |Pomeranian_Voivodeship|Pomeranian_Voivodeship| , with similar borders to  |Pomerelia|Pomerelia| , stretching from the Wieprza river to the  |Vistula|Vistula|  delta in the vicinity of  |Gdańsk|Gdańsk| .   The northern half of the  |Kuyavian-Pomeranian_Voivodeship|Kuyavian-Pomeranian_Voivodeship| , comprising most of  |Chełmno_Land|Chełmno_Land| .     The bulk of  |Farther_Pomerania|Farther_Pomerania|  is included within the modern West Pomeranian Voivodeship, but its easternmost parts  now constitute the northwest of Pomeranian Voivodeship. Farther Pomerania in turn comprises several other historical subregions, most notably the  |Principality_of_Cammin|Principality_Of_Cammin| , the  |County_of_Naugard|County_Of_Naugard| , the  |Lands_of_Schlawe_and_Stolp|Lands_Of_Schlawe_And_Stolp| , and also the  |Lauenburg_and_Bütow_Land|Lauenburg_And_Bütow_Land|  .     Parts of Pomerania and surrounding regions have constituted a  |euroregion|Euroregion|  since 1995. The  |Pomerania_euroregion|Pomerania_Euroregion|  comprises Hither Pomerania and  |Uckermark|Uckermark|  in Germany, West Pomerania in Poland, and  |Scania|Scania| |Wdzydze_Lake|Wdzydze_Lake| |Wolin_National_Park|Wolin_National_Park| |Słowiński_National_Park|Słowiński_National_Park| |Usedom/Uznam|Usedom| |Cape_Arkona|Cape_Arkona|           Pomerania and its cognates in other languages are derived from Old  |Slavic|Slavic_Languages|  po, meaning by/next to/along , and morze, meaning sea , thus Pomerania literally means seacoast or land by the sea , referring to its proximity to the Baltic Sea. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000, Pomerania Pommern, itself a loanword in German from Slavic. The Polish word for Pomerania is Pomorze, composed of the preposition po, along, by, and morze, sea. The Slavic word for sea, more, which becomes morze in Polish, comes from the Indo-European noun mori–, sea, the source of Latin mare, sea, and the mer- of English mermaid.     Pomerania was first mentioned in an  |imperial|Holy_Roman_Empire|  document of 1046, referring to a Zemuzil dux Bomeranorum . Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.23,24,  Pomerania is mentioned repeatedly in the chronicles of  |Adam_of_Bremen|Adam_Of_Bremen|  and  |Gallus_Anonymous|Gallus_Anonymus|  .       The term West Pomerania is ambiguous, since it may refer to either Hither Pomerania or to combined Hither and Farther Pomerania or the West Pomeranian Voivodeship .     The term East Pomerania may similarly carry different meanings, referring either to  |Farther_Pomerania|Farther_Pomerania|  , or to Pomerelia or the Pomeranian Voivodeship .                        Settlement in the area called Pomerania for the last 1,000 years started by the end of the  |Vistula_Glacial_Stage|Vistula_Glacial_Stage| , some 13,000 years ago. Archeological traces have been found of various cultures during the  |Stone|Stone_Age|  and  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| ,  |Baltic_peoples|Baltic_Peoples| ,  |Germanic_peoples|Germanic_Peoples|  and  |Veneti|Vistula_Veneti|  during the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  and, in the  |Dark_Ages|Middle_Ages| ,  |Slavic_tribes|Slavs|  and  |Vikings|Vikings| .

As a result of the Teutonic rule, in German terminology the name of Prussia was also extended to conquered Polish lands like  |Gdańsk_Pomerania|Gdańsk_Pomerania| , although it was not inhabited by  |Baltic|Balts| |Prussians|Old_Prussians|  but Slavic Poles. Meanwhile, the  |Ostsiedlung|Ostsiedlung|  started to turn Slavic narrow Pomerania into an increasingly  |German|Germans| -settled area; the remaining  |Wends|Wends|  and Polish people, often known as  |Kashubians|Kashubians| , continued to settle within Pomerelia.
