        A file viewer is an  |application_software|Application_Software|  that presents the data stored in a  |computer_file|Computer_File|  in a human-friendly form. The file contents are generally displayed on the  |screen|Display_Device| , or they may be  |printed|Computer_Printer| . Also, they may be read aloud using  |speech_synthesis|Speech_Synthesis| .       File viewers do not edit files, yet it is common for them to be able to export data in a different  |file_format|File_Format| , or to copy information from the viewed to the system-wide  |clipboard|Clipboard| . A file viewer is limited-functionality software in the sense that it does not have a capability to create a file, or modify the content of an existing one. Instead, it is used only to display or print the content.     File viewers have to have sufficient knowledge about the file format to be viewed in order to handle different  |byte_orders|Byte_Order| ,  |code_pages|Code_Page|  or  |newline|Newline|  styles.     Some file viewer may be classified as  |filters|Filter|  that translate binary files into plain text . However, depending on the competence of the translating routines, some information may be lost.      |Image_viewers|Image_Viewer|  display graphics files onscreen. Most viewers are capable of reading multiple  |graphics_file_formats|Graphics_File_Format|  but some such as  |JPEGview|Jpegview|  are dedicated to a single format. Common image viewer features include  |thumbnail|Thumbnail|  preview and creation, and image zooming.     For more complex or proprietary file formats, file viewers are usually provided by the same companies that make the editing software using those formats. Viewers are usually distributed free of charge, while editors have to be bought. For example, the full version of  |Adobe_Acrobat|Adobe_Acrobat|  can be used to create content for most computer platforms. To ensure that people can access the documents created with Adobe Acrobat, the software publisher created a viewer program, the  |Acrobat_Reader|Acrobat_Reader| , and made it available for free.  |Microsoft|Microsoft|  also makes viewers for  |Word|Microsoft_Word|  and  |PowerPoint|Microsoft_Powerpoint|  documents freely available. These viewer applications allow the file format to be readable on all supported operating-systems, free of charge, making the commercial product a more attractive solution.     A  |web_browser|Web_Browser|  is a type of file viewer, which renders  |HTML|Html|  markup into a human-friendly presentation. Although HTML is stored in plain text files, viewing an HTML file in a browser and in a  |text_editor|Text_Editor|  produces significantly different results. Web browsers may also be used to view image and multimedia files.       There are also types of data that are not intended for static display — these incorporate the  |time|Time|  dimension. Viewers for such formats are named players. But the essence is the same — presenting file contents in human-friendly form . And the same consideration of different file formats is present.            |Less|Less| |Most|Most| |pg|Pg| |More|More| |Microsoft_Word_Viewer|Microsoft_Word_Viewer| |Microsoft_Excel_Viewer|Microsoft_Excel_Viewer| |Antiword|Antiword| |Evince|Evince| |PDF.js|Pdf.Js| |:Category:PDF_readers|:Category:Pdf_Readers| |Midnight_Commander|Midnight_Commander| |ExifTool|Exiftool| |Hex_editors|Hex_Editor|  like  |Beye|Beye| |Microsoft_Project|Microsoft_Project| |Seavus_Project_Viewer|Seavus_Project_Viewer|.
