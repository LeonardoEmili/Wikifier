           Buffalo is the  |second_largest_city|List_Of_Cities_In_New_York|  in the  |U.S._state|United_States|  of  |New_York|New_York|  and the largest city in  |Upstate_New_York|Upstate_New_York| . , the population was 256,304. The city is the  |county_seat|County_Seat|  of  |Erie_County|Erie_County,_New_York|  and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the  |Canada–United_States_border|Canada–United_States_Border| , forming part of the bi-national  |Buffalo_Niagara_Region|Buffalo_Niagara_Region| .     The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the  |Native_American|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States| |Iroquois|Iroquois|  tribe and later by French colonizers. The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration, the construction of the  |Erie_Canal|Erie_Canal|  and  |rail_transportation|Rail_Transportation_In_The_United_States| , and its close proximity to  |Lake_Erie|Lake_Erie| . This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the  |Midwestern_United_States|Midwestern_United_States|  while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries that dominated the citys economy in the 20th century. Since the citys economy relied heavily on manufacturing,  |deindustrialization|Deindustrialization|  in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population. While some manufacturing activity remains, Buffalos economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare, research and higher education, which emerged following the  |Great_Recession|Great_Recession| .     Buffalo is on the eastern shore of  |Lake_Erie|Lake_Erie| , at the head of the  |Niagara_River|Niagara_River| , 16 miles south of  |Niagara_Falls|Niagara_Falls| . Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname The City of Light . The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by  |Joseph_Ellicott|Joseph_Ellicott| , an extensive system of parks designed by  |Frederick_Law_Olmsted|Frederick_Law_Olmsted| , as well as  |significant_architectural_works|National_Register_Of_Historic_Places_Listings_In_Buffalo,_New_York| . Its culture blends  |Northeastern|Northeastern_United_States|  and  |Midwestern|Midwestern_United_States|  traditions, with annual festivals including  |Taste_of_Buffalo|Taste_Of_Buffalo|  and  |Allentown_Art_Festival|Allentown,_Buffaloallentown_Art_Festival| , two professional sports teams , and a thriving and progressive music and arts scene.         The city of Buffalo received its name from a nearby creek called  |Buffalo_Creek|Buffalo_River| . British military engineer Captain  |John_Montresor|John_Montresor|  made reference to Buffalo Creek in his 1764 journal, which may be the earliest recorded appearance of the name.      There are several theories regarding how Buffalo Creek received its name. , Toronto Star, Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Toronto Star, September 24, 1992, Stefaniuk, W., Retrieved April 23, 2014. , Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, March 19, 1993, Okun, J., Retrieved April 23, 2014. , Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, July 21, 2003, Retrieved April 23, 2014. While it is possible its name originated from French fur traders and Native Americans calling the creek Beau Fleuve , it is also possible Buffalo Creek was named after the  |American_buffalo|American_Bison| , whose historical range may have extended into  |western_New_York|Western_New_York| .                         The first inhabitants of the State of New York are believed to have been nomadic  |Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indians| , who migrated after the disappearance of  |Pleistocene_glaciers|Quaternary_Glaciation|  during or before 7000 BCE.     Around 1000 CE, 1,000 years ago, the  |Woodland_period|Woodland_Period|  began, marked by the rise of the  |Iroquois_Confederacy|Iroquois|  and its tribes throughout the state.     During French exploration of the region in 1620, the region was occupied simultaneously by the  |agrarian|Agrarian_Society| |Erie_people|Erie_People| , a tribe outside of the Five Nations of the Iroquois southwest of Buffalo Creek, and the  |Wenro_people|Wenrohronon|  or Wenrohronon, an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot of the large  |Neutral_Nation|Neutral_Nation|  who lived along the inland south shore of  |Lake_Ontario|Lake_Ontario|  and at the east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its northern shore. For trading, the Neutral people made a living by growing tobacco and  |hemp|Hemp|  to trade with the Iroquois, using animal paths or warpaths to travel and move goods across the state. These paths were later paved, and now function as major roads.     Later, during the  |Beaver_Wars|Beaver_Wars|  of the 1640s-1650s, the combined warriors of the  |Five_Nations_of_the_Iroquois|Five_Nations_Of_The_Iroquois|  Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals  and their peninsular territory, while the  |Senecas|Seneca_People|  alone took out the Wenro and their territory, c. 1651   –1653. Soon after, the Iroquois destroyed Erie nation and territory  over their assistance to  |Huron_people|Huron_People|  during the Beaver Wars.      |Louis_Hennepin|Louis_Hennepin|  and  |Sieur_de_La_Salle|René-Robert_Cavelier,_Sieur_De_La_Salle|  made the earliest European discoveries of the upper Niagara and Ontario regions in the late 1600s. On August 7, 1679, La Salle launched a vessel,  |Le_Griffon|Le_Griffon| , that became the first full-sized ship to sail across the Great Lakes before it disappeared in  |Green_Bay,_Wisconsin|Green_Bay,_Wisconsin| .     After the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| , the colony of New York—now a state—began westward expansion, looking for habitable land by following trends of the Iroquois. Land near fresh water was of considerable importance. New York and Massachusetts were fighting for the territory Buffalo lies on, and Massachusetts had the right to purchase all but a one-mile wide portion of land. The rights to the Massachusetts territories were sold to  |Robert_Morris|Robert_Morris|  in 1791, and two years later to the  |Holland_Land_Company|Holland_Land_Company| .     As a result of the war, in which the Iroquois tribe sided with the  |British_Army|British_Army_During_The_American_Revolutionary_War| , Iroquois territory was gradually reduced in the mid-to-late-1700s by European settlers through successive treaties statewide, such as the  |Treaty_of_Fort_Stanwix|Treaty_Of_Fort_Stanwix| , the  |First_Treaty_of_Buffalo_Creek|First_Treaty_Of_Buffalo_Creek|  , and the Treaty of Geneseo . The Iroquois were corralled onto reservations, including  |Buffalo_Creek|Buffalo_Creek_Reservation| . By the end of the 18th century, only  of reservation territory remained.                  Former slave Joseph Black Joe Hodges, and Cornelius Winney, a Dutch trader from  |Albany|Albany,_New_York|  who arrived in 1789, were early settlers along the mouth of Buffalo Creek. The first white settlers along the creek were prisoners captured during the  |Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| . The first resident and landowner of Buffalo with a permanent presence was Captain William Johnston, a white Iroquois interpreter who had been in the area since the days after the Revolutionary War and who the Senecas granted creekside land as a gift of appreciation. His house stood at present-day Washington and Seneca streets.     On July 20, 1793, the  |Holland_Land_Purchase|Holland_Land_Purchase|  was completed, containing the land of present-day Buffalo, brokered by Dutch investors from  |Holland|Holland| . The  |Treaty_of_Big_Tree|Treaty_Of_Big_Tree|  removed Iroquois title to lands west of the  |Genesee_River|Genesee_River|  in 1797. In the fall of 1797,  |Joseph_Ellicott|Joseph_Ellicott| , the architect who helped survey Washington D.C. with brother  |Andrew|Andrew_Ellicott| ,   was appointed as the Chief of Survey for the Holland Land Company. Over the next year, he began to survey the tract of land at the mouth of Buffalo Creek. This was completed in 1803, and the new village boundaries extended from the creekside in the south to present-day Chippewa Street in the north and Carolina Street to the west,  which is where most settlers remained for the first decade of the 19th century. Although the company named the settlement New Amsterdam, the name did not catch on, reverting to Buffalo within ten years.  Buffalo had the first road to Pennsylvania built in 1802 for migrants passing through to the  |Connecticut_Western_Reserve|Connecticut_Western_Reserve|  in Ohio.     In 1804, Ellicott designed a radial  |grid_plan|Grid_Plan|  that would branch out from the village forming bicycle-like spokes, interrupted by diagonals, like the system used in the nations capital.  In the middle of the village was the intersection of eight streets, in what would become  |Niagara_Square|Niagara_Square| . Several blocks to the southeast he designed a semicircle fronting Main Street with an elongated park green, formerly his estate.  This would be known as Shelton Square,  at that time the center of the city ,  with the intersecting streets bearing the names of Dutch Holland Land Company members,   today Erie, Church and Niagara streets.  |Lafayette_Square|Lafayette_Square|  also lies one block to the north, which was then bounded by streets bearing Iroquois names.     According to an early resident, the village had sixteen residences, a schoolhouse and two stores in 1806, primarily near Main, Swan and Seneca streets. There were also blacksmith shops, a tavern and a drugstore. The streets were small at 40 feet wide, and the village was still surrounded by woods. The first lot sold by the Holland Land Company was on September 11, 1806, to Zerah Phelps. By 1808, lots would sell from $25 to $50.     In 1804, Buffalos population was estimated at 400, similar to  |Batavia|Batavia,_New_York| , but Erie Countys growth was behind  |Chautauqua|Chautauqua_County,_New_York| ,  |Genesee|Genesee_County,_New_York|  and  |Wyoming|Wyoming_County,_New_York|  counties. Neighboring village  |Black_Rock|Black_Rock,_New_York|  to the northwest was also an important center. Horatio J. Spafford noted in A Gazetteer of the State of New York that in fact, despite the growth the village of Buffalo had, Black Rock is deemed a better trading site for a great trading town than that of Buffalo, especially when considering the regional profile of mundane roads extending eastward. Before the east-to-west turnpike was completed, travelling from Albany to Buffalo would take a week, while even a trip from nearby  |Williamsville|Williamsville,_New_York|  to Batavia could take upwards of three days.          Although  |slavery_was_rare_in_the_state|History_Of_Slavery_In_New_York| , limited instances of slavery had taken place in Buffalo during the early part of the 19th century. General  |Peter_Buell_Porter|Peter_Buell_Porter|  is said to have had five slaves during his time in Black Rock, and several news ads also advertised slaves for sale.     In 1810, a courthouse was built. By 1811, the population was 500, with many people farming or doing manual labor. The first newspaper to be published was the Buffalo Gazette in October that same year.     On December 31, 1813, Buffalo and the village of Black Rock were burned by the British after the  |Battle_of_Buffalo|Battle_Of_Buffalo| .   The battle and subsequent fire was in response to the unprovoked destruction of  |Niagara-on-the-Lake|Niagara-On-The-Lake| , then known as Newark, by American forces.   On August4, 1814, British forces under Lt. Colonel John Tucker and Lt. Colonel William Drummond, General  |Gordon_Drummonds|Gordon_Drummond|  nephew, attempted to raid Black Rock and Buffalo as part of a diversion to force an early surrender  |at_Fort_Erie|Siege_Of_Fort_Erie|  the next day, but were defeated by a small force of American riflemen under Major Lodwick Morgan at the  |Battle_of_Conjocta_Creek|Battle_Of_Conjocta_Creek| , and withdrew back into Canada. Consequently, Fort Eries siege under Gordon Drummond later failed, and British forces withdrew. Though only three buildings remained in the village, rebuilding was swift, finishing in 1815.       The population in 1840 was 18,213. The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III, London , Charles Knight, p.915 The village of Buffalo was part of and the seat of  |Niagara_County|Niagara_County|  until the legislature passed an act separating the two on April 2, 1861.     On October 26, 1825,  the  |Erie_Canal|Erie_Canal|  was completed, formed from part of Buffalo Creek,  with Buffalo a port-of-call for settlers heading westward.  At the time, the population was about 2,400.  By 1826, the 130 sq. mile Buffalo Creek Reservation at the western border of the village was transferred to Buffalo. The Erie Canal brought a surge in population and commerce, which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832.  The canal area was mature by 1847, with passenger and cargo ship activity leading to congestion in the harbor.              The mid-1800s saw a population boom, with the city doubling in size from 1845 to 1855. In 1855, almost two-thirds of the citys population were foreign-born immigrants, largely a mix of unskilled or educated  |Irish|Irish_Americans|  and  |Germans|German_Americans|  Catholics, who began self-segregating in different parts of the city. The Irish immigrants planted their roots along the railroad-heavy Buffalo River and Erie Canal to the southeast, to which there is still a heavy presence today; German immigrants found their way to the East Side, living a more laid-back, residential life. Some immigrants were apprehensive about the change of environment and left the city for the western region, while others tried to stay behind in the hopes of expanding their native cultures.      |Fugitive_black_slaves|Fugitive_Slaves_In_The_United_States|  began to make their way northward to Buffalo in the 1840s, and many of them settled on the citys East Side. In 1845, construction began on the  |Macedonia_Baptist_Church|Macedonia_Baptist_Church| , a meeting spot in the Michigan and William Street neighborhood where blacks first settled.  It was also an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. Buffalo was a terminus point of the  |Underground_Railroad|Underground_Railroad|  with many  |fugitive_slaves|Fugitive_Slaves_In_The_United_States|  crossing the  |Niagara_River|Niagara_River|  to  |Fort_Erie,_Ontario|Fort_Erie,_Ontario|  in search of freedom.      During the 1840s, Buffalos port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo.   Grain and commercial goods shipments led to repeated expansion of the harbor. In 1843, the worlds first steam-powered  |grain_elevator|Grain_Elevator|  was constructed by local merchant  |Joseph_Dart|Joseph_Dart|  and engineer  |Robert_Dunbar|Robert_Dunbar| .   |Darts_Elevator|Darts_Elevator|  enabled faster unloading of  |lake_freighters|Lake_Freighter|  along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from barges, canal boats, and rail cars.  By 1850, the citys population was 81,000.     In 1860, many railway companies and lines crossed through and terminated in Buffalo. Major ones were the  |Buffalo,_Bradford_and_Pittsburgh_Railroad|Buffalo,_Bradford_And_Pittsburgh_Railroad|  ,  |Buffalo_and_Erie_Railroad|Buffalo_And_Erie_Railroad|  and the  |New_York_Central_Railroad|New_York_Central_Railroad|  . During this time, Buffalonians controlled a quarter of all shipping traffic on Lake Erie, and shipbuilding was a thriving industry for the city.     Later, the  |Lehigh_Valley_Railroad|Lehigh_Valley_Railroad|  would have its line terminate at Buffalo in 1867.                       At the dawn of the 20th century, local mills were among the first to benefit from  |hydroelectric_power|Hydroelectric_Power|  generated by the Niagara River.

The city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic Party. Lansky, Lewis. Buffalo and the Great Depression, 1929–1933, in Milton Plesur, ed., American Historian: Essays to Honor Selig Adler , pp 204–13     During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Buffalo saw the return of prosperity and full employment due to its position as a manufacturing center.   As one of the  |most_populous_cities_of_the_1950s|1950_United_States_Censuscity_Rankings| , Buffalos economy revolved almost entirely on its manufacturing base. Major companies such as  |Republic_Steel|Republic_Steel|  and  |Lackawanna_Steel|Lackawanna_Steel_Company|  employed tens of thousands of Buffalonians. Integrated national shipping routes would use the  |Soo_Locks|Soo_Locks|  near  |Lake_Superior|Lake_Superior|  and a vast network of railroads and yards that crossed the city.     Lobbying by local businesses and interest groups against the  |St._Lawrence_Seaway|St._Lawrence_Seaway|  began in the 1920s, long before its construction in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes. Its approval was reinforced by legislation shortly before its construction. Shipbuilding in Buffalo, such as the  |American_Ship_Building_Company|American_Ship_Building_Company| , shut down in 1962, ending an industry that had been a sector of the citys economy since 1812, and a direct result of reduced waterfront activity. With deindustrialization, and the nationwide trend of suburbanization; the citys economy began to deteriorate.   Like much of the  |Rust_Belt|Rust_Belt| , Buffalo, home to more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline as heavy industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.                   Buffalo is on  |Lake_Eries|Lake_Erie|  eastern end, opposite Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada.  It is at the origin of the Niagara River, which flows northward over  |Niagara_Falls|Niagara_Falls|  and into  |Lake_Ontario|Lake_Ontario| .  The city is  south-southeast from  |Toronto|Toronto| .

According to the  |United_States_Census_Bureau|United_States_Census_Bureau| , the city has an area of , of which  is land and the rest water. The total area is 22.66% water.                         Buffalos architecture is diverse, with a collection of buildings from the 19th and 20th centuries.

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the  |Northeast|Northeastern_United_States| , but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush. Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate  |humidity|Humidity|  and temperature. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalos winter snow is the fact Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, temperatures only rise above  three times in the average year, and the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of  or more.  Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night. Lake Eries stabilizing effect continues to inhibit  |thunderstorms|Thunderstorms|  and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July.

Like most former industrial cities of the  |Great_Lakes|Great_Lakes|  region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression from suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The citys population peaked in 1950 when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, down from the 8th largest city in America in 1900, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then.
