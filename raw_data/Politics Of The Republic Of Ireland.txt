|Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland|  is a  |parliamentary|Parliamentary_System| ,  |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy|  republic and a member state of the  |European_Union|European_Union| . While the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  is the popularly elected  |President_of_Ireland|President_Of_Ireland| , it is a largely ceremonial position, with real political power being vested in the indirectly elected  |Taoiseach|Taoiseach|  , who is the head of the  |government|Government_Of_Ireland| .      |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the  |government|Irish_Government| , which consists of no more than 15 cabinet ministers, inclusive of the Taoiseach and  |Tánaiste|Tánaiste|  .  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in the  |Oireachtas|Oireachtas| , the  |bicameral|Bicameralism|  national parliament, which consists of  |Dáil_Éireann|Dáil_Éireann| ,  |Seanad_Éireann|Seanad_Éireann|  and the  |President_of_Ireland|President_Of_Ireland| . The  |judiciary|Judiciary|  is  |independent|Judicial_Independence|  of the executive and the legislature. The head of the judiciary is the  |Chief_Justice|Chief_Justice_Of_Ireland| , who presides over the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_Ireland| .     While there are a number of political parties in the state, the political landscape has been  |dominated|Two-Party_System|  for decades by  |Fianna_Fáil|Fianna_Fáil|  and  |Fine_Gael|Fine_Gael| , historically opposed and competing entities, which both occupy the traditional centre ground. From the 1930s until  |2011|2011_Irish_General_Election|  they were the largest and second-largest parties respectively. Both parties trace their roots back to the opposing sides of the  |Irish_Civil_War|Irish_Civil_War| . The  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party| , historically the states third political party, has only ever been in power as part of a  |coalition|Coalition_Government|  with either of the two main parties. In 2011, there was a major political realignment in Ireland, with Fine Gael becoming the largest party, Labour the second, and Fianna Fáil dropping to third following a collapse in support, while  |Sinn_Féin|Sinn_Féin|  saw a substantial increase in support.     However, in 2016 Fianna Fáil managed to regain support and become the second-largest party, while Labour collapsed to fourth place following backlash over its role in the coalition government. Sinn Féin continued making gains, becoming the third-largest party, while Fine Gael remained the largest party, despite losing seats.                      The state operates under the Constitution of Ireland  which was adopted in 1937 by means of a plebiscite. The constitution falls within the  |liberal_democratic|Liberal_Democracy|  tradition. It defines the organs of government and guarantees certain fundamental rights. The Constitution can only be amended by means of a  |referendum|Amendments_To_The_Constitution_Of_Ireland| . Important constitutional referenda have concerned issues such as  |abortion|Abortion_In_The_Republic_Of_Ireland| , the  |status_of_the_Roman_Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church_In_Ireland| ,  |divorce|Fifteenth_Amendment_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Ireland| ,  |European_Union|Ireland_And_The_European_Union|  and  |same-sex_marriage|Same-Sex_Marriage_In_The_Republic_Of_Ireland| .               The head of state is the President of Ireland. In keeping with the states  |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System|  of government the President exercises a mainly ceremonial role but does possess certain specific powers. The presidency is open to all Irish citizens who are at least 35. They are directly elected by secret ballot under the  |alternative_vote|Instant-Runoff_Voting| . A candidate may be nominated for election as President by no fewer than 20 members of the Oireachtas or by four or more of  |Irelands_31_County_and_City_Councils|Local_Government_In_The_Republic_Of_Ireland| . A retiring President may nominate themselves as a candidate for re-election. If only one valid candidate is nominated for election, for example if there is consensus among the political parties to nominate a single candidate, it is unnecessary to proceed to a ballot and that candidate is deemed elected. The President is elected to a seven-year term of office and no person may serve more than two terms.     In carrying out certain of their constitutional functions, the President is aided by the  |Council_of_State|Council_Of_State| . There is no Vice-President in Ireland. If for any reason the President is unable to carry out his/her functions, or if the Office of President is vacant, the duties of the President are carried out by the  |Presidential_Commission|Presidential_Commission| .               Executive authority is exercised by a cabinet known simply as the Government. Article 28 of the Constitution states that the Government may consist of no less than seven and no more than fifteen members, namely the  |Taoiseach|Taoiseach|  , the  |Tánaiste|Tánaiste|  and up to thirteen other ministers. The Taoiseach is appointed by the President, after being nominated by  |Dáil_Éireann|Dáil_Éireann|  . The remaining ministers are nominated by the Taoiseach and appointed by the President following their approval by the Dáil. The Government must enjoy the confidence of Dáil Éireann and, in the event that they cease to enjoy the support of the lower house, the Taoiseach must either resign or request the President to dissolve the Dáil, in which case a general election follows.               Article 15 of the  |Constitution_of_Ireland|Constitution_Of_Ireland|  established the Oireachtas as the national parliament of Ireland. The Oireachtas consists of the  |President_of_Ireland|President_Of_Ireland|  and two elected houses: Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann . As the Oireachtas also consists of the President the official title of the two law making houses is the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Dáil is by far the dominant House of the legislature. The President may not veto bills passed by the Oireachtas, but may refer them to the  |Supreme_Court_of_Ireland|Supreme_Court_Of_Ireland|  for a ruling on whether they comply with the constitution.            Members of the Dáil are directly elected at least once in every five years under the  |single_transferable_vote|Single_Transferable_Vote|  form of  |proportional_representation|Proportional_Representation|  from multi-seat constituencies. Membership of the house is open to all Irish citizens who are at least 21 and permanently resident in the State. The electorate consists of all Irish and British citizens resident in Ireland over the age of 18. Members of the Dáil are known as  |Teachta_Dála|Teachta_Dála|  or TDs. Currently there are 158 TDs, of which one, the  |Ceann_Comhairle|Ceann_Comhairle|  , is automatically returned at an election. The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance must be members of the Dáil. All other members of the Government must be members of the Dáil, however up to two members may be members of the Seanad. The Dáil is the only House which can introduce and amend money bills . Since the early 1990s no single party has had a majority in Dáil Éireann, so that  |coalition_governments|Coalition_Government|  have been the norm.            The Senate is a largely advisory body. It consists of sixty members called Senators. An election for the Seanad must take place no later than 90 days after a general election for the members of the Dáil. Eleven Senators are nominated by the Taoiseach while a further six are elected by certain national universities. The remaining 43 are elected from special vocational panels of candidates, the electorate for which consists of the 60 members of the outgoing Senate, the 158 TDs of the incoming Dáil and the 883 elected members of  |5_city_and_29_county_councils|Local_Government_In_The_Republic_Of_Ireland| . The Senate has the power to delay legislative proposals and is allowed 90 days to consider and amend bills sent to it by the Dáil . The Senate is only allowed 21 days to consider money bills sent to it by the Dáil. The Senate cannot amend money bills but can make recommendations to the Dáil on such bills.               Ireland is a  |common_law|Common_Law|  jurisdiction. The judiciary consists of the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_Ireland| , the  |High_Court|High_Court_Of_The_Republic_Of_Ireland|  and other lower courts established by law. Judges are appointed by the President after being nominated by the Government and can be removed from office only for misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only by resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas. The final court of appeal is the Supreme Court, which consists of the Chief Justice, seven ordinary judges and ex officio the President of the High Court. The Supreme Court rarely sits as a full bench and normally hears cases in chambers of three, five or seven judges.     Both the Supreme Court and the High Court have the power of  |judicial_review|Judicial_Review|  and may declare to be invalid both laws and acts of the state which are repugnant to the constitution.            The Government, through the civil and public services and state-sponsored bodies, is a significant employer in the state; these three sectors are often called the public sector. Management of these various bodies vary, for instance in the civil service there will be clearly defined routes and patterns whilst among public services a sponsoring minister or the  |Minister_for_Finance|Minister_For_Finance|  may appoint a board or commission. Commercial activities, where the state involves itself, are typically through the state-sponsored bodies which are usually organised in a similar fashion to private companies.     A 2005 report on public sector employment, showed that in June 2005 the numbers employed in the public sector stood at 350,100; of these by sector they were 38,700 , 254,100 and 57,300 . The total workforce of the state was 1,857,400 that year, thus the public sector represents approximately 20% of the total workforce.             The civil service of Ireland consists of two broad components, the Civil Service of the Government and the Civil Service of the State. Whilst these two components are largely theoretical, they do have some fundamental operational differences. The civil service is expected to maintain the political impartiality in its work, and some sections of it are entirely independent of Government decision making.            The  |public_service|Public_Services|  is a relatively broad term and is not clearly defined and sometimes is taken to include the civil service. The public service proper consists of Government agencies and bodies which provide services on behalf of the Government but are not the core civil service. For instance  |local_authorities|Local_Government_In_The_Republic_Of_Ireland| ,  |Education_and_Training_Boards|Education_And_Training_Board|  and  |Garda_Síochána|Garda_Síochána|  are considered to be public services.          Article 28A of the constitution of Ireland provides a constitutional basis for local government. The Oireachtas is empowered to establish the number, size and powers of local authorities by law. Under Article 28A, members of local authorities must be directly elected by voters at least once every five years.     Local government in Ireland is governed by a series of Local Government Acts, beginning with the  |Local_Government_Act_1898|Local_Government_Act_1898| . The most significant of these is the  |Local_Government_Act_2001|Local_Government_Act_2001| , which established a two-tier structure of local government. The  |Local_Government_Reform_Act_2014|Local_Government_Reform_Act_2014|  abolished the bottom tier, the town councils, leaving 31 local authorities. There are 26 County Councils , 3 City Councils , and 2 City and County Councils .          A number of political parties are represented in the Dáil and  |coalition_governments|Coalition_Government|  are common. The Irish electoral system has been characterised by the two and a half party system, with two large catch all parties dominating. This changed after the 2011 Irish General Election, following the large drop in support for  |Fianna_Fáil|Fianna_Fáil|  and the rise in support for other parties.     The current largest party in the state is  |Fine_Gael|Fine_Gael| , which has its origins in the pro-treaty movement of Michael Collins in the  |Irish_Civil_War|Irish_Civil_War| . Traditionally the party of  |law_and_order|Law_And_Order| , it is associated with strong belief in pro-enterprise and reward. Despite expressions of  |Social_Democracy|Social_Democracy|  by previous leader Garrett Fitzgerald, today, it remains a  |Christian_democratic|Christian_Democratic| , economically liberal party along European lines, with a strongly pro-European outlook. Fine Gael was formed out of a merger of  |Cumann_na_nGaedheal|Cumann_Na_Ngaedheal| , the  |Centre_Party|National_Centre_Party|  and the  |Blueshirts|Blueshirts| . In recent years it has generally been associated with a liberal outlook. It has formed government in the periods 1922–32 , 1948–51, 1954–57, 1973–77, 1981–82, 1982–87, 1994–97, and 2011 to present.      |Fianna_Fáil|Fianna_Fáil| , a traditionally  |Irish_republican|Irish_Republicanism|  party founded in 1927 by  |Éamon_de_Valera|Éamon_De_Valera| , is the second largest party and also considered centre-right. It first formed a government on the basis of a  |populist|Populism|  programme of land redistribution and national preference in trade and republican populism remains a key part of its appeal. It has formed government seven times since Ireland gained independence: 1932–48, 1951–54, 1957–73, 1977–81, 1982, 1987–94, and 1997–2011.  |Fianna_Fáil|Fianna_Fáil|  was the largest party in the Dáil to 2011. It lost a huge amount of support in the  |2011_general_election|2011_Irish_General_Election|  but has since regained some support.     The third largest party is  |Sinn_Féin|Sinn_Féin| , established in its current form in 1970. The original Sinn Féin played a huge role in the  |Irish_War_of_Independence|Irish_War_Of_Independence|  and the  |First_Dáil|First_Dáil| .  |Fine_Gael|Fine_Gael|  and  |Fianna_Fáil|Fianna_Fáil|  trace their origins to that party. The current-day party has been historically linked to the  |Provisional_IRA|Provisional_Ira| . The party is a  |Republican|Irish_Republicanism|  party which takes a more left wing stance on economics and social policy than the Labour Party.     The fourth largest party in the state is the centre-left  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  which was founded by  |James_Connolly|James_Connolly|  and  |Jim_Larkin|Jim_Larkin|  in 1912. Labour have formal links with the trade union movement and have governed in seven coalition governments – six led by Fine Gael and one by Fianna Fáil. This role as a junior coalition partner has led to Labour being classed as the half party of Irelands two and a half party system.     The  |Solidarity–People_Before_Profit|Solidarity–People_Before_Profit|  electoral alliance, consisting of the  |Solidarity|Solidarity|  and  |People_Before_Profit|People_Before_Profit|  currently occupy the 5th largest grouping within Dáil Éireann. Formed in 2015, the group represents a left-wing, socialist viewpoint, with particular focus on the abolition of domestic water charges.     Other parties and political alliances represented in the Dáil after the  |2016_general_election|2016_Irish_General_Election|  are the  |Independents_4_Change|Independents_4_Change| ,  |Social_Democrats|Social_Democrats|  and  |Green_Party|Green_Party| .     A number of  |independent|Independent_Politicians_In_Ireland|  TDs such as  |Maureen_OSullivan|Maureen_Osullivan| ,  |Mick_Wallace|Mick_Wallace| ,  |Finian_McGrath|Finian_Mcgrath| ,  |John_Halligan|John_Halligan|  and  |Thomas_Pringle|Thomas_Pringle|  largely hold left-wing views.  The  |Independent_Alliance|Independent_Alliance| , a loose alliance of independents formed in 2015, returned 6 TDs after the 2016 general election. 5 of the 6 helped elect  |Enda_Kenny|Enda_Kenny|  as Taoiseach again after the election, and have since entered government in various forms.
