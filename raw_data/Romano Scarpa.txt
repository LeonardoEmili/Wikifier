         Romano Scarpa  was one of the most famous Italian creators of  |Disney_comics|Disney_Comics| .       Growing up in Venice he developed a particular love for American  |cartoons|Cartoon|  and Disney comics, that, at the time, were published in the big format of the  |Topolino_Giornale|Topolino_Giornale|  which was then printing now classic  |Floyd_Gottfredsons|Floyd_Gottfredson|  stories. In the Forties he opened an Animation Studio in Venice in which he produced his first works: some commercials, a short titled E poi venne il diluvio and another one titled La piccola fiammiferaia , distributed in Italy together with  |Robert_Aldrichs|Robert_Aldrich|   Attack!  .     Right after that he stopped working in animation for a while and dedicated wholly to creating Disney comics. When in 1956 Italian editors had no more new Floyd Gottfredsons stories to reprint, he was given the responsibility to continue Gottfredsons stories about  |Mickey_Mouse|Mickey_Mouse| . Also influenced by  |Carl_Barks|Carl_Barks|  in the late Fifties and up to about 1963 he wrote and penciled stories like Topolino e la collana Chirikawa or The Flying Scot that have, later, been translated in many different languages throughout the world. Many of these stories have their backgrounds in movies, for example Topolino nel favoloso regno di Shan Grill√† is based upon  |Frank_Capras|Frank_Capra|   Lost Horizon  ; not to talk about all the stories starring Snow White or the Seven Dwarfs, obviously based on  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  . Sometimes the exact opposite happened; the Italian movie  Riusciranno i nostri eroi a ritrovare lamico misteriosamente scomparso in Africa?  is based on Scarpas story Topolino e il Pippotarzan .     Around 1963, Scarpa stopped writing for 6 or 7 years. In the seventies, he moved to Spain and started working for a different publisher. Among the last things he made while he was still in Italy, at the end of the Eighties and at beginning of the Nineties, there are the so-called Paperolimpiadi  and some strip stories, the same kind of stories that he loved when he was a child. One of these, Topolino e lenigma di Brigaboom was partially based on  Brigadoon  .     In the meanwhile he has had time enough for some more animation, so we have Aihnoo degli Icebergs ,  The Fourth King  and a new TV series,  The Adventures of Marco and Gina    .     Mainly Scarpa worked on Disney comics, but many years ago he used to do something non-Disney once in a while, so he did one  Lupo story and one   Yogi Bear  story. In the 1950s he also drew some Angelino story, and Italian character.     Since 1988 some of his comic stories have been published in the USA by  Gladstone Publishing ; it was the first time that this happened to an Italian Disney author. Later, when  |Disney_Comics|Disney_Comics|  took Gladstones place, they published some more of his stories, and in 2003, the same happened with  |Gemstone_Publishing|Gemstone_Publishing| , that is publishing his stories in the US at the moment.     He has influenced many younger creators  and many have attempted to imitate his style.       In his career Scarpa created many Disney characters that are now accepted by some as part of the Disney Universe. Those include, but are not limited to:      |Brigitta_MacBridge|Brigitta_Macbridge| ,  |Scrooge_McDucks|Scrooge_Mcduck|  self-appointed girlfriend with whom she shares a love/hate relationship;    |Bruto|Bruto| ,  |Ellsworths|Ellsworth|  adopted son.;    |Dickie_Duck|Dickie_Duck| , a dynamic female teenage-duck which was introduced as the granddaughter of Glittering  |Goldie_OGilt|Goldie_Ogilt| ;    |Gideon_McDuck|Gideon_Mcduck| , a newspaper editor and Scrooges brother;    |Jubal_Pomp|Jubal_Pomp| , an unlucky wanna-be businessman always trying to imitate Scrooge and failing miserably;    |Kildare_Coot|Kildare_Coot| , a crazy cousin of  |Donald_Ducks|Donald_Duck| ;   Portis ,  |Black_Petes|Pete|  cousin, a genius of crime;    |Trudy_Van_Tubb|Trudy_Van_Tubb| , Black Petes mate and accomplice in crime.         In 2017  |Fantagraphics_Books|Fantagraphics_Books|  published a collection containing four stories of Scarpas  |Snow_White|Snow_White|  comics, titled The Return of Snow-White and the Seven Dwarfs,  |ISBN|Isbn|  .     In 2018 Fantagraphics Books began publishing a hardcover series titled  Disney Masters , in which Romano Scarpa has to date had three volumes dedicated to his Disney works.
