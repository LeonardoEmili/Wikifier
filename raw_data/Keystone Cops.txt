   The Keystone Cops  were fictional, humorously incompetent  |policemen|Policemen| , featured in  |silent_film|Silent_Film|  slapstick comedies produced by  |Mack_Sennett|Mack_Sennett|  for his  |Keystone_Film_Company|Keystone_Studios|  between 1912 and 1917.             The idea for the Keystone Cops came from  |Hank_Mann|Hank_Mann| , who also played police chief Tehiezel in the first film before being replaced by  |Ford_Sterling|Ford_Sterling| . Their first film was  Hoffmeyers Legacy  but their popularity stemmed from the 1913 short  The Bangville Police  starring  |Mabel_Normand|Mabel_Normand| .     As early as 1914, Sennett shifted the Keystone Cops from starring roles to background ensemble, in support of comedians like  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin|  and  |Fatty_Arbuckle|Roscoe_Arbuckle| . The Keystone Cops served as supporting players for  |Marie_Dressler|Marie_Dressler| , Mabel Normand, and Chaplin in the first full-length Sennett comedy feature,  Tillies Punctured Romance  , as well as in  Mabels New Hero  with Normand and Arbuckle;  Making a Living  with Chaplin in his first screen appearance ;  In the Clutches of the Gang  with Normand, Arbuckle, and  |Al_St_John|Al_St_John| ; and  Wished on Mabel  with Arbuckle and Normand, among others. Comedian/actors  |Chester_Conklin|Chester_Conklin| ,   |Jimmy_Finlayson|Jimmy_Finlayson| ,   |Ford_Sterling|Ford_Sterling|   and director  |Del_Lord|Del_Lord|   were also Keystone Cops.     In 2010, the previously  |lost|Lost_Film|  short  A Thief Catcher  was rediscovered at an antique sale in  |Michigan|Michigan| . The short, filmed in 1914, stars  |Ford_Sterling|Ford_Sterling| ,  |Mack_Swain|Mack_Swain| ,  |Edgar_Kennedy|Edgar_Kennedy| , and  |Al_St_John|Al_St_John|  and includes a previously unknown appearance of  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin|  as a Keystone Kop.      Bag o Rags, the Keystone Kops unofficial theme music, was composed in 1912 by William Mac McKanless , an African-American orchestra leader, pianist and songwriter.         In Silent Stars,  |Jeanine_Basinger|Jeanine_Basinger|  writes:            The original Keystone Cops numbered only seven:  |George_Jeske|George_Jeske| ,  |Bobby_Dunn|Bobby_Dunn| ,  |Mack_Riley|Mack_Riley| ,  |Charles_Avery|Charles_Avery| ,  |Slim_Summerville|Slim_Summerville| ,  |Edgar_Kennedy|Edgar_Kennedy| ,  |Hank_Mann|Hank_Mann| . Lahue, Kalton ; Mack Sennetts Keystone: The man, the myth and the comedies; New York: Barnes; ; p. 194       Mack Sennett continued to use the Keystone Cops intermittently through the 1920s. By the time sound movies arrived, the Keystone Cops popularity had waned. In 1935, director Ralph Staub staged a revival of the Sennett gang for his  |Warner_Brothers|Warner_Brothers|  short subject  Keystone Hotel , featuring a re-creation of the Kops clutching at their hats, leaping in the air in surprise, running energetically in any direction, and taking extreme pratfalls. This footage has been used countless times in later productions purporting to use silent-era material.     The Staub version of the Keystone Cops became a template for later re-creations.  |20th_Century_Foxs|20Th_Century_Fox|  1939 film  Hollywood Cavalcade  had  |Buster_Keaton|Buster_Keaton|  in a Keystone chase scene. However, during his own silent film career, the only time he had been in a chase in the Keystone style was in  The Rough House , by  |Roscoe_Arbuckle|Roscoe_Arbuckle| . His own police chase scenes, such as in  The Goat  and  Cops  , were highly realistic.  Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops  included a lengthy chase scene, showcasing a group of stuntmen dressed as Sennetts squad.   |Mel_Brooks|Mel_Brooks|  directed a car chase scene in the Keystone Cops style in his comedy film  Silent Movie .     By the 1950s surviving silent movie comedians could be pressed into service as Keystone Cops regardless of whether they appeared with the troupe authentically. In the  This Is Your Life  TV tribute to  |Mack_Sennett|Mack_Sennett| , several Sennett alumni ran on stage dressed as Keystone Cops.     In 1969, Warner Bros announced a series of  Looney Tunes  shorts starring cartoon versions of the Cops were to be produced, but the studio closed its animation department before anything could develop from it.       The name has since been used to criticize any group for its mistakes, particularly if the mistakes happened after a great deal of energy and activity, or for a lack of coordination among the members. For example, the  |June_2004_election|2004_Canadian_Federal_Election|  campaign of the  |Liberal_Party_of_Canada|Liberal_Party_Of_Canada|  was compared with the Keystone Kops running around by one of its parliamentary members,  |Carolyn_Parrish|Carolyn_Parrish| .  In criticizing the  |Department_of_Homeland_Securitys|Department_Of_Homeland_Security|  response to  |Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane_Katrina| , Senator  |Joseph_Lieberman|Joseph_Lieberman|  claimed that emergency workers under DHS chief  |Michael_Chertoff|Michael_Chertoff|  ran around like Keystone Kops, uncertain about what they were supposed to do or uncertain how to do it.  Another example is a statement by Peter Beattie, Premier of the Australian state of Queensland, on the counter-terrorism investigation into Gold Coast doctor  |Mohamed_Haneef|Mohamed_Haneef|  in July 2007; after the Australian Federal Police committed a series of blunders, the Premier likened their actions to those of the Keystone Kops . A 2012 U.S.  |National_Transportation_Safety_Board|National_Transportation_Safety_Board|  report investigating Canadian energy company  |Enbridges|Enbridge|  handling of a July 2010 pipeline spill in the  |Kalamazoo_River|Kalamazoo_River|  compared it to the Keystone Cops.      In sport, the term has come into common usage by television commentators, particularly in the United Kingdom and  |Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland| . The rugby commentator Liam Toland uses the term to describe a teams incompetent performance on the pitch. The phrase Keystone cops defending has become a favorite catchphrase for describing a situation in an English football match where a defensive error or a series of defensive errors leads to a goal.  The term was also used to describe the play of the New York Jets against the New England Patriots in the  Buttfumble game , with sportscaster Cris Collinsworth declaring This is the Keystone Cops after the Jets gave up 21 points in 51 seconds.      According to  |Dave_Filoni|Dave_Filoni| , supervising director of the animated television series  Star Wars: The Clone Wars , the look of the police droid is based on the appearance of the Keystone Kops.  In 2018 David Blair stars as officer keystone in Silent Times Directed by Christopher Annino and Written by Geoff Blanchette. It also stars Olga Kurkulina and WWE legend Ron Bass      The 1983 video game  Keystone Kapers , released for the  |Atari_2600|Atari_2600| ,  |5200|Atari_5200| ,  |MSX|Msx|  and  |Colecovision|Colecovision| , by  |Activision|Activision| .
