                 Robin Hood is a legendary  |hero|Hero| ic  |outlaw|Outlaw|  originally depicted in  |English_folklore|English_Folklore|  and subsequently featured in literature and film. According to legend, he was a highly skilled  |archer|Archery|  and  |swordsman|Swordsman| . In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the  |Crusades|Crusades|  before returning to  |England|England|  to find his lands taken by the  |Sheriff|Sheriff_Of_Nottingham| . In the oldest known versions he is instead a member of the  |yeoman|Yeoman|  class. Traditionally depicted dressed in  |Lincoln_green|Lincoln_Green| , he is said to have robbed from the rich and given to the poor.     Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created. These include his lover,  |Maid_Marian|Maid_Marian| , his band of outlaws, the  |Merry_Men|Merry_Men| , and his chief opponent, the  |Sheriff_of_Nottingham|Sheriff_Of_Nottingham| . The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting  |Prince_John|John,_King_Of_England|  in usurping the rightful but absent  |King_Richard|Richard_I_Of_England| , to whom Robin Hood remains loyal. His partisanship of the common people and his hostility to the Sheriff of Nottingham are early recorded features of the legend, but his interest in the rightfulness of the king is not, and neither is his setting in the reign of Richard I. He became a popular folk figure in the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| , and the earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century .     There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television. Robin Hood is considered one of the best known tales of English folklore.     The historicity of Robin Hood is not proven and has been debated for centuries. There are numerous references to historical figures with similar names that have been proposed as possible evidence of his existence, some dating back to the late 13th century. At least eight plausible origins to the story have been mooted by historians and folklorists, including suggestions that Robin Hood was a stock alias used by or in reference to bandits.       The first clear reference to rhymes of Robin Hood is from the alliterative poem  Piers Plowman , thought to have been composed in the 1370s, but the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of the 15th century, or the first decade of the 16th century. In these early accounts, Robin Hoods partisanship of the lower classes, his  |devotion_to_the_Virgin_Mary|Devotion_To_The_Virgin_Mary|  and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an  |archer|Archery| , his  |anti-clericalism|Anti-Clericalism| , and his particular animosity towards the  |Sheriff_of_Nottingham|Sheriff_Of_Nottingham|  are already clear.  A Gest of Robin Hood  stanzas  10–15, stanza  292 . Retrieved 15 April 2008.  |Little_John|Little_John| ,  |Much_the_Millers_Son|Much_The_Millers_Son|  and  |Will_Scarlet|Will_Scarlet|  all appear, although not yet  |Maid_Marian|Maid_Marian|  or  |Friar_Tuck|Friar_Tuck| . The latter has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script. Dobson and Taylor, p. 203. Friar Tuck is mentioned in the play fragment Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham dated to c.  1475.     In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king  |Richard_the_Lionheart|Richard_I_Of_England| , Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richards brother  |John|John,_King_Of_England|  while Richard was away at the  |Third_Crusade|Third_Crusade| . This view first gained currency in the 16th century. Dobson and Taylor, pp. 5, 16. It is not supported by the earliest ballads. The early compilation,  A Gest of Robyn Hode , names the king as Edward; and while it does show Robin Hood accepting the Kings pardon, he later repudiates it and returns to the greenwood.     The oldest surviving ballad,  Robin Hood and the Monk , gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king. The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent. Dobson and Taylor, pp. 14–16.     The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hoods social status: he is a  |yeoman|Yeoman| . While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was neither a knight nor a peasant or husbonde but something in between . Dobson and Taylor, p. 34.  |Artisans|Artisan|  were among those regarded as yeomen in the 14th century. Dobson and Taylor, pp. 34–35. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility and in two extremely influential plays,  |Anthony_Munday|Anthony_Munday|  presented him at the very end of the 16th century as the  |Earl_of_Huntingdon|Robert_Fitzooth| , as he is still commonly presented in modern times. Dobson and Taylor, pp. 33, 44, and 220–223.     As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by Robin Hood games or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in  |Exeter|Exeter| , but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time. The Robin Hood games are known to have flourished in the later 15th and 16th centuries. Singmam, 1998, Robin Hood; The Shaping of the Legend p.  62. It is commonly stated as fact that Maid Marian and a jolly friar entered the legend through the May Games. Dobson and Taylor, p. 41. It was here that he encountered and assimilated into his own legend the jolly friar and Maid Marian, almost invariably among the performers in the 16th century morris dance, Dobson and Taylor have suggested that theories on the origin of Friar Tuck often founder on a failure to recognise that he was the product of the fusion between two very different friars, a bellicose outlaw, and the May Games figure.       The earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad is the 15th-century  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Monk|Robin_Hood_And_The_Monk|  .  This is preserved in  |Cambridge_University|Cambridge_University|  manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450,  accompanying Knight and Ohlgrens 1997 ed. it contains many of the elements still associated with the legend, from the Nottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff.        The first printed version is A Gest of Robyn Hode , a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative. Ohlgren, Thomas, Robin Hood: The Early Poems, 1465–1560, , From Script to Print: Robin Hood and the Early Printers, pp. 97–134. After this comes  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Potter|Robin_Hood_And_The_Potter|  ,  contained in a manuscript of c.  1503. The Potter is markedly different in tone from The Monk : whereas the earlier tale is a thriller the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force.     Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary  Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham   . These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robins integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham, among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.     The plots of neither the Monk nor the Potter are included in the Gest; and neither is the plot of  |Robin_Hood_and_Guy_of_Gisborne|Robin_Hood_And_Guy_Of_Gisborne|  , which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy. Each of these three ballads survived in a single copy, so it is unclear how much of the medieval legend has survived, and what has survived may not be typical of the medieval legend. It has been argued that the fact that the surviving ballads were preserved in written form in itself makes it unlikely they were typical; in particular, stories with an interest for the gentry were by this view more likely to be preserved. Singman, Jeffrey L. Robin Hood: The Shaping of the Legend , Greenwood Publishing Group, p.  51. . The story of Robins aid to the poor knight that takes up much of the Gest may be an example.     The character of Robin in these first texts is rougher edged than in his later incarnations. In Robin Hood and the Monk , for example, he is shown as quick tempered and violent, assaulting Little John for defeating him in an archery contest; in the same ballad Much the Millers Son casually kills a little  |page|Page|  in the course of rescuing Robin Hood from prison.  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Monk|Robin_Hood_And_The_Monk| . From Childs edition of the ballad, online at Sacred Texts,  Stanza  16:     :   :   :   :   No extant ballad early actually shows Robin Hood giving to the poor, although in a A Gest of Robyn Hode Robin does make a large loan to an unfortunate  |knight|Knight| , which he does not in the end require to be repaid; Holt, p. 11. and later in the same ballad Robin Hood states his intention of giving money to the next traveller to come down the road if he happens to be poor.   :   :  |Child_Ballads|Child_Ballads|  117A:210, ie A Gest of Robyn Hode stanza 210.     As it happens the next traveller is not poor, but it seems in context that Robin Hood is stating a general policy. The first explicit statement to the effect that Robin Hood habitually robbed from the rich to give the poor can be found in  |John_Stows|John_Stow|  Annales of England , about a century after the publication of the Gest.  |Stephen_Thomas_Knight|Stephen_Thomas_Knight|  2003 Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography p. 43 quoting John Stow, 1592,Annales of England . for it being the earliest clear statement see Dobson and Taylor , Rhymes of Robyn Hood p. 290. But from the beginning Robin Hood is on the side of the poor; the Gest quotes Robin Hood as instructing his men that when they rob:   :   :   :   :   :   :      And in its final lines the Gest sums up:   :   :     Within Robin Hoods band, medieval forms of courtesy rather than modern ideals of equality are generally in evidence. In the early ballad, Robins men usually kneel before him in strict obedience: in A Gest of Robyn Hode the king even observes that  Their social status, as yeomen, is shown by their weapons: they use  |swords|Sword|  rather than  |quarterstaffs|Quarterstaff| . The only character to use a quarterstaff in the early ballads is the potter, and Robin Hood does not take to a staff until the 17th-century  Robin Hood and Little John . Holt, p. 36.     The political and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. It has been influentially argued by  |J._C._Holt|J._C._Holt|  that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, and that it would be mistaken to see in him a figure of  |peasant|Peasant|  revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. Holt, pp. 37–38. He appears not so much as a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Holt, p. 10. Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a  |plebeian|Plebs|  literature hostile to the  |feudal|Feudalism|  order. Singman, Jeffrey L Robin Hood: The Shaping of the Legend, 1998, Greenwood Publishing Group, p.  46, and first chapter as a whole. .       By the early 15th century at the latest, Robin Hood had become associated with May Day celebrations, with revellers dressing as Robin or as members of his band for the festivities. This was not common throughout England, but in some regions the custom lasted until  |Elizabethan|Elizabethan_Era|  times, and during the reign of  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii_Of_England| , was briefly popular at  |court|Noble_Court| . Hutton, 1997, pp. 270–271. Robin was often allocated the role of a  |May_King|King_Of_The_May| , presiding over games and processions, but plays were also performed with the characters in the roles, Hutton , p. 32. sometimes performed at  |church_ales|Parish_Ale| , a means by which churches raised funds. Hutton , p. 31.     A complaint of 1492, brought to the  |Star_Chamber|Star_Chamber| , accuses men of acting riotously by coming to a fair as Robin Hood and his men; the accused defended themselves on the grounds that the practice was a long-standing custom to raise money for churches, and they had not acted riotously but peaceably. Holt, pp. 148–149.        It is from the association with the May Games that Robins romantic attachment to  |Maid_Marian|Maid_Marian|  apparently stems. A Robin and Marion figured in 13th-century French  |pastourelles|Pastourelle|   and presided over the French May festivities, this Robin and Marion tended to preside, in the intervals of the attempted seduction of the latter by a series of knights, over a variety of rustic pastimes. Dobson and Taylor, p. 42. In the Jeu de Robin and Marion, Robin and his companions have to rescue Marion from the clutches of a lustful knight. Maurice Keen The Outlaws of Medieval England Appendix  1, 1987, Routledge, . This play is distinct from the English legends. although Dobson and Taylor regard it as highly probable that this French Robins name and functions travelled to the English May Games where they fused with the Robin Hood legend. Dobson and Taylor , p. 42. Both Robin and Marian were certainly associated with May Day festivities in England , but these may have been originally two distinct types of performance –  |Alexander_Barclay|Alexander_Barclay|  in his Ship of Fools, writing in c.  1500, refers to  – but the characters were brought together. Jeffrey Richards, Swordsmen of the Screen: From Douglas Fairbanks to Michael York, p. 190, Routledge & Kegan Paul, Lond, Henly and Boston . Marian did not immediately gain the unquestioned role; in  Robin Hoods Birth, Breeding, Valor, and Marriage , his sweetheart is Clorinda the Queen of the Shepherdesses. Holt, p.  165 Clorinda survives in some later stories as an alias of Marian. Allen W. Wright,      The earliest preserved script of a Robin Hood play is the fragmentary  Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham  This apparently dates to the 1470s and circumstantial evidence suggests it was probably performed at the household of  |Sir_John_Paston|John_Paston| . This fragment appears to tell the story of  |Robin_Hood_and_Guy_of_Gisborne|Robin_Hood_And_Guy_Of_Gisborne| . Dobson and Taylor , Rhymes of Robyn Hood , p. 204. There is also an early playtext appended to a 1560 printed edition of the Gest. This includes a dramatic version of the story of  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Curtal_Friar|Robin_Hood_And_The_Curtal_Friar|  and a version of the first part of the story of  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Potter|Robin_Hood_And_The_Potter| . . The publisher describes the text as a , but does not seem to be aware that the text actually contains two separate plays. Dobson and Taylor , Rhymes of Robyn Hood , p. 215. An especial point of interest in the Friar play is the appearance of a ribald woman who is unnamed but apparently to be identified with the bawdy  |Maid_Marian|Maid_Marian|  of the May Games. Dobson and Taylor, Rhymes of Robyn Hood , p. 209. She does not appear in extant versions of the ballad.       In 1598,  |Anthony_Munday|Anthony_Munday|  wrote a pair of plays on the Robin Hood legend,  The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington  . These plays drew on a variety of sources, including apparently A Gest of Robin Hood , and were influential in fixing the story of Robin Hood to the period of  |Richard_I|Richard_I| .  |Stephen_Thomas_Knight|Stephen_Thomas_Knight|  has suggested that Munday drew heavily on  |Fulk_Fitz_Warin|Fulk_Fitz_Warin| , a historical 12th century outlawed nobleman and enemy of  |King_John|John,_King_Of_England| , in creating his Robin Hood. Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography p. 63. The play identifies Robin Hood as Robert,  |Earl_of_Huntingdon|Earl_Of_Huntingdon| , probably for the first time, and identifies Maid Marian with one of the semi-mythical Matildas persecuted by  |King_John|John,_King_Of_England| . Dobson and Taylor , p. 44. The plays are complex in plot and form, the story of Robin Hood appearing as a play-within-a-play presented at the court of  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii|  and written by the poet, priest and courtier  |John_Skelton|John_Skelton| . Skelton himself is presented in the play as acting the part of Friar Tuck. Some scholars have conjectured that Skelton may have indeed written a lost Robin Hood play for Henry VIIIs court, and that this play may have been one of Mundays sources. Dobson and Taylor , Rhymes of Robin Hood , pp. 43, 44, and 223. Henry VIII himself with eleven of his nobles had impersonated Robyn Hodes men as part of his Maying in 1510. Robin Hood is known to have appeared in a number of other lost and extant Elizabethan plays. In 1599, the play George a Green, the Pinner of Wakefield places Robin Hood in the reign of  |Edward_IV|Edward_Iv| . Dobson and Taylor , pp. 42–44. Edward I, a play by  |George_Peele|George_Peele|  first performed in 1590–91, incorporates a Robin Hood game played by the characters. Lleweleyn, the last independent Prince of Wales, is presented playing Robin Hood. Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography, p. 51.      Fixing the Robin Hood story to the 1190s had been first proposed by  |John_Major|John_Major|  in his Historia Majoris Britanniæ , This was the period in which  |King_Richard|Richard_I_Of_England|  was absent from the country, fighting in the  |Third_Crusade|Third_Crusade| . Holt, p. 170.      |William_Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare|  makes reference to Robin Hood in his late-16th-century play  The Two Gentlemen of Verona . In it, the character Valentine is banished from  |Milan|Milan|  and driven out through the forest where he is approached by outlaws who, upon meeting him, desire him as their leader. They comment, By the bare scalp of Robin Hoods fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction! Act IV, Scene 1, line 36–37. Robin Hood is also mentioned in  As You Like It . When asked about the exiled Duke Senior, the character of Charles says that he is already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. Justice Silence sings a line from an unnamed Robin Hood ballad, the line is Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John in Act 5 scene 3 of  |Henry_IV,_part_2|Henry_Iv,_Part_2| . In  |Henry_IV_part_1|Henry_Iv_Part_1|  Act 3 scene 3, Falstaff refers to  |Maid_Marian|Maid_Marian|  implying she is a by-word for unwomanly or unchaste behaviour.      |Ben_Jonson|Ben_Jonson|  produced the incomplete  |masque|Masque|  The Sad Shepherd, or a Tale of Robin Hood  in part as a satire on  |Puritan|Puritan| ism. It is about half finished and writing may have been interrupted by his death in 1637. It is Jonsons only pastoral drama, it was written in sophisticated verse and included supernatural action and characters. Dobson and Taylor , p. 231. It has had little impact on the Robin Hood tradition but needs mention as the work of a major dramatist.     The 1642  |London_theatre_closure|London_Theatre_Closure_1642|  by the Puritans interrupted the portrayal of Robin Hood on the stage. The theatres would reopen with the  |Restoration|Restoration|  in 1660. Robin Hood did not appear on the Restoration stage unless one includes Robin Hood and his Crew of Souldiers acted in Nottingham on the day of the coronation of Charles II in 1661. This short play adapts the story of the kings pardon of Robin Hood to refer to the Restoration. Dobson and Taylor, pp. 45, 247     However, Robin Hood appeared on the 18th-century stage in various farces and comic operas. Dobson and Taylor, p. 45  |Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson|Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson|  would write a four act Robin Hood play at the end of the 19th century, The Forrestors . It is fundamentally based on the Gest but follows the tradition of placing Robin Hood as the Earl of Huntingdon in the time of Richard I, and making the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John rivals with Robin Hood for Maid Marians hand. Dobson and Taylor, p. 243 The return of King Richard brings about a happy ending.       With the advent of printing came the Robin Hood  |broadside_ballads|Broadside_Ballads| . Exactly when they displaced the oral tradition of Robin Hood ballads is unknown but the process seems to have been completed by the end of the 16th century. Near the end of the 16th century an unpublished prose life of Robin Hood was written, and included in the  |Sloane_Manuscript|Sloane_Manuscript| . Largely a paraphrase of the Gest, it also contains material revealing that the author was familiar with early versions of a number of the Robin Hood broadside ballads. Dobson and Taylor, Rhymes of Robyn Hood , p. 286. Not all of the medieval legend was preserved in the broadside ballads, there is no broadside version of  |Robin_Hood_and_Guy_of_Gisborne|Robin_Hood_And_Guy_Of_Gisborne|  or of  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Monk|Robin_Hood_And_The_Monk| , which did not appear in print until the 18th and 19th centuries respectively. However, the Gest was reprinted from time to time throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.     No surviving broadside ballad can be dated with certainty before the 17th century, but during that century, the commercial broadside ballad became the main vehicle for the popular Robin Hood legend. Dobson and Taylor , Rhymes of Robin Hood , p. 47. These broadside ballads were in some cases newly fabricated but were mostly adaptations of the older verse narratives. The broadside ballads were fitted to a small repertoire of pre-existing tunes resulting in an increase of stock formulaic phrases making them repetitive and verbose , Dobson and Taylor, Rhymes of Robyn Hood , p. 49. they commonly feature Robin Hoods contests with artisans: tinkers, tanners, and butchers. Among these ballads is  |Robin_Hood_and_Little_John|Robin_Hood_And_Little_John|  telling the famous story of the quarter-staff fight between the two outlaws.     Dobson and Taylor wrote, More generally the Robin of the broadsides is a much less tragic, less heroic and in the last resort less mature figure than his medieval predecessor. Rhymes of Robyn Hood , p. 50. In most of the broadside ballads Robin Hood remains a plebeian figure, a notable exception being  |Martin_Parkers|Martin_Parker|  attempt at an overall life of Robin Hood,  |A_True_Tale_of_Robin_Hood|A_True_Tale_Of_Robin_Hood| , which also emphasises the theme of Robin Hoods generosity to the poor more than the broadsheet ballads do in general.     The 17th century introduced the  |minstrel|Minstrel| |Alan-a-Dale|Alan-A-Dale| . He first appeared in a 17th-century  |broadside_ballad|Broadside| , and unlike many of the characters thus associated, managed to adhere to the legend. The prose life of Robin Hood in Sloane Manuscript contains the substance of the Alan-a-Dale ballad but tells the story about  |Will_Scarlet|Will_Scarlet| .        In the 18th century, the stories began to develop a slightly more  |farcical|Farce|  vein. From this period there are a number of ballads in which Robin is severely drubbed by a succession of tradesmen including  |a_tanner|Robin_Hood_And_The_Tanner| ,  |a_tinker|Robin_Hood_And_The_Tinker| , and  |a_ranger|Robin_Hood_And_The_Ranger| . In fact, the only character who does not get the better of Hood is the luckless Sheriff. Yet even in these ballads Robin is more than a mere simpleton: on the contrary, he often acts with great shrewdness. The tinker, setting out to capture Robin, only manages to fight with him after he has been cheated out of his money and the  |arrest_warrant|Arrest_Warrant|  he is carrying. In  Robin Hoods Golden Prize , Robin disguises himself as a  |friar|Friar|  and cheats two priests out of their cash. Even when Robin is defeated, he usually tricks his foe into letting him sound his horn, summoning the Merry Men to his aid. When his enemies do not fall for this ruse, he persuades them to drink with him instead .     In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Robin Hood ballads were mostly sold in Garlands of 16 to 24 Robin Hood ballads; these were crudely printed chap books aimed at the poor. The garlands added nothing to the substance of the legend but ensured that it continued after the decline of the single broadside ballad. Dobson and Taylor, Rhymes of Robin Hood , pp. 51–52. In the 18th century also, Robin Hood frequently appeared in criminal biographies and histories of highwaymen compendia.        In 1765,  |Thomas_Percy|Thomas_Percy|  published  Reliques of Ancient English Poetry , including ballads from the 17th-century  |Percy_Folio|Percy_Folio|  manuscript which had not previously been printed, most notably  |Robin_Hood_and_Guy_of_Gisborne|Robin_Hood_And_Guy_Of_Gisborne|  which is generally regarded as in substance a genuine late medieval ballad.     In 1795,  |Joseph_Ritson|Joseph_Ritson|  published an enormously influential edition of the Robin Hood ballads Robin Hood: A collection of all the Ancient Poems Songs and Ballads now extant, relative to that celebrated Outlaw. 1887 reprint, publisher J.C. Nimmo,  accessed 18 January 2016, digitized 2008 from book provided by University of California Libraries. By providing English poets and novelists with a convenient source book, Ritson gave them the opportunity to recreate Robin Hood in their own imagination, Dobson and Taylor , p. 54. Ritsons collection included the Gest and put the  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Potter|Robin_Hood_And_The_Potter|  ballad in print for the first time. The only significant omission was  |Robin_Hood_and_the_Monk|Robin_Hood_And_The_Monk|  which would eventually be printed in 1806. Ritsons interpretation of Robin Hood was also influential, having influenced the modern concept of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor as it exists today. J.C. Holt, Robin Hood, 1982, pp. 184, 185 , Joseph Ritson   Himself a supporter of the principles of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  and admirer of  |Thomas_Paine|Thomas_Paine| , Ritson held that Robin Hood was a genuinely historical, and genuinely heroic, character who had stood up against tyranny in the interests of the common people.     In his preface to the collection, Ritson assembled an account of Robin Hoods life from the various sources available to him, and concluded that Robin Hood was born in around 1160, and thus had been active in the reign of Richard I. He thought that Robin was of aristocratic extraction, with at least some pretension to the title of Earl of Huntingdon, that he was born in an unlocated Nottinghamshire village of Locksley and that his original name was  |Robert_Fitzooth|Robert_Fitzooth| . Ritson gave the date of Robin Hoods death as 18 November 1247, when he would have been around 87 years old. In copious and informative notes Ritson defends every point of his version of Robin Hoods life.  Retrieved 12 January 2016. In reaching his conclusion Ritson relied or gave weight to a number of unreliable sources, such as the Robin Hood plays of Anthony Munday and the Sloane Manuscript. Nevertheless, Dobson and Taylor credit Ritson with having an incalculable effect in promoting the still continuing quest for the man behind the myth, and note that his work remains an indispensable handbook to the outlaw legend even now. Dobson and Taylor , pp. 54–55.     Ritsons friend  |Walter_Scott|Walter_Scott|  used Ritsons anthology collection as a source for his picture of Robin Hood in  |Ivanhoe|Ivanhoe| , written in 1818, which did much to shape the modern legend. Dobson and Taylor , p. 56.     The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood      In the 19th century, the Robin Hood legend was first specifically adapted for children. Childrens editions of the garlands were produced and in 1820, a childrens edition of Ritsons Robin Hood collection was published. Childrens novels began to appear shortly thereafter. It is not that children did not read Robin Hood stories before, but this is the first appearance of a Robin Hood literature specifically aimed at them. Dobson and Taylor , pp. 58ff. A very influential example of these childrens novels was  |Pierce_Egan_the_Youngers|Pierce_Egan_The_Younger|  Robin Hood and Little John . Dobson and Taylor , p. 47. Egan, Pierce the Younger . Robin Hood and Little John or The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest. Pub. George Peirce, London. This was adapted into French by  |Alexandre_Dumas|Alexandre_Dumas,_Fils|  in Le Prince des Voleurs and Robin Hood Le Proscrit . Egan made Robin Hood of noble birth but raised by the forestor Gilbert Hood.     Another very popular version for children was  |Howard_Pyles|Howard_Pyle|   The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood , which influenced accounts of Robin Hood through the 20th century.   . From The  |Robin_Hood_Project|Robin_Hood_Project|  at the  |University_of_Rochester|University_Of_Rochester| . Retrieved 22 November 2008. Pyles version firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor. Nevertheless, the adventures are still more local than national in scope: while King Richards participation in the Crusades is mentioned in passing, Robin takes no stand against Prince John, and plays no part in raising the ransom to free Richard. These developments are part of the 20th-century Robin Hood myth. Pyles Robin Hood is a yeoman and not an aristocrat.     The idea of Robin Hood as a high-minded  |Saxon|Anglo-Saxons|  fighting  |Norman|Normans|  lords also originates in the 19th century. The most notable contributions to this idea of Robin are  |Jacques_Nicolas_Augustin_Thierrys|Jacques_Nicolas_Augustin_Thierry|   and Sir  |Walter_Scotts|Walter_Scott|   Ivanhoe  . In this last work in particular, the modern Robin Hood—King of Outlaws and prince of good fellows! as Richard the Lionheart calls him—makes his debut. Allen W. Wright,        The 20th century grafted still further details on to the original legends. The 1938 film,  The Adventures of Robin Hood , starring  |Errol_Flynn|Errol_Flynn|  and  |Olivia_de_Havilland|Olivia_De_Havilland| , portrayed Robin as a hero on a national scale, leading the oppressed Saxons in revolt against their Norman overlords while Richard the Lionheart fought in the Crusades; this movie established itself so definitively that many studios resorted to movies about his son rather than compete with the image of this one. Allen W. Wright,      In 1953, during the  |McCarthy_era|Mccarthy_Era| , the Republican members of the Indiana Textbook Commission called for a ban of Robin Hood from all Indiana school books for promoting communism because he stole from the rich to give to the poor.             Robin Hood   In the 1973 animated  |Disney|The_Walt_Disney_Company|  film,  Robin Hood , the title character is portrayed as an  |anthropomorphic|Anthropomorphism|  fox voiced by  |Brian_Bedford|Brian_Bedford| . Years before Robin Hood had even entered production, Disney had considered doing a project on  |Reynard_the_Fox|Reynard_The_Fox| . However, due to concerns that Reynard was unsuitable as a hero, animator  |Ken_Anderson|Ken_Anderson|  adapted some elements from Reynard into  Robin Hood , thus making the title character a fox.      Robin and Marian Robin and Marian , starring  |Sean_Connery|Sean_Connery|  as Robin Hood and  |Audrey_Hepburn|Audrey_Hepburn|  as Maid Marian, portrays the figures in later years after Robin has returned from service with  |Richard_the_Lionheart|Richard_The_Lionheart|  in a foreign crusade and Marian has gone into seclusion in a nunnery. This is the first in popular culture to portray King Richard as less than perfect.       Since the 1980s, it has become commonplace to include a  |Saracen|Saracen|   among the Merry Men, a trend that began with the character  |Nasir|Nasir|  in the 1984 ITV  Robin of Sherwood  television series. Later versions of the story have followed suit: the 1991 movie  Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves  and 2006  |BBC|Bbc|  TV series  Robin Hood  each contain equivalents of Nasir, in the figures of Azeem and  |Djaq|Robin_Hood_Charactersdjaq| , respectively. Spoofs have also followed this trend, with the 1990s BBC  |sitcom|Sitcom|   Maid Marian and her Merry Men  parodying the Moorish character with Barrington, a  |Rastafarian|Rastafarian| |rapper|Hip-Hop|  played by  |Danny_John-Jules|Danny_John-Jules| ,  and  |Mel_Brooks|Mel_Brooks|  comedy  Robin Hood: Men in Tights  featuring  |Isaac_Hayes|Isaac_Hayes|  as Asneeze and  |Dave_Chappelle|Dave_Chappelle|  as his son Ahchoo. The 2010 movie version  Robin Hood , did not include a Saracen character. The 2018 adaptation  Robin Hood  portrays the character of Little John as a Muslim named Yahya, played by  |Jamie_Foxx|Jamie_Foxx| . The character Azeem in the 1991 movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was originally called Nasir, until a crew member who had worked on Robin of Sherwood pointed out that the Nasir character was not part of the original legend and was created for the show Robin of Sherwood. The name was immediately changed to Azeem to avoid any potential copyright issues.       Between 1963 and 1966,  |French_television|Office_De_Radiodiffusion_Télévision_Française|  broadcast a medievalist series entitled  Thierry La Fronde  . This successful series, which was also shown in Canada, Poland , Australia , and the Netherlands , transposes the English Robin Hood narrative into  |late_medieval_France|France_In_The_Middle_Ages|  during the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War| . See Richard Utz, Robin Hood, Frenched , in: Medieval Afterlives in Popular Culture, ed. by Gail Ashton and Daniel T. Kline : 145–58.       The  |historicity|Historicity|  of Robin Hood has been debated for centuries. A difficulty with any such historical research is that Robert was a very common  |given_name|Given_Name|  in  |medieval_England|Great_Britain_In_The_Middle_Ages| , and Robin was its very common  |diminutive|Diminutive| , especially in the 13th century; Oxford Dictionary of Christian Names, EG Withycombe, 1950. it is a French  |hypocorism|Hypocorism| ,  |Albert_Dauzat|Albert_Dauzat| , Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de familles et prénoms de France, Librairie Larousse, Paris, 1980, Nouvelle édition revue et commentée par  |Marie-Thérèse_Morlet|Marie-Thérèse_Morlet| , p. 523b. already mentioned in the  Roman de Renart  in the 12th century. The surname Hood was also fairly common because it referred either to a hooder, who was a maker of  |hoods|Hood| , or alternatively to somebody who wore a hood as a head-covering. It is therefore unsurprising that medieval records mention a number of people called Robert Hood or Robin Hood, some of whom are known to have fallen foul of the law.     Another view on the origin of the name is expressed in the  |1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica|Encyclopædia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition|  which remarks that hood was a common dialectical form of wood; and that the outlaws name has been given as Robin Wood. There are a number of references to Robin Hood as Robin Wood, or Whood, or Whod, from the 16th and 17th centuries. The earliest recorded example, in connection with May games in  |Somerset|Somerset| , dates from 1518. Dobson and Taylor, p. 12, 39n, and chapter on place-names.       The oldest references to Robin Hood are not historical records, or even ballads recounting his exploits, but hints and allusions found in various works. From 1261 onward, the names Robinhood, Robehod or Robbehod occur in the rolls of several English Justices as nicknames or descriptions of malefactors. The majority of these references date from the late 13th century. Between 1261 and 1300, there are at least eight references to Rabunhod in various regions across England, from  |Berkshire|Berkshire|  in the south to  |York|York|  in the north. Holt     Leaving aside the reference to the rhymes of Robin Hood in  |Piers_Plowman|Piers_Plowman|  in the 1370s,   the first mention of a quasi-historical Robin Hood is given in  |Andrew_of_Wyntouns|Andrew_Of_Wyntoun|  Orygynale Chronicle, written in about 1420. The following lines occur with little contextualisation under the year 1283:     :Lytil Jhon and Robyne Hude   :Wayth-men ware commendyd gude   :In  |Yngil-wode|Inglewood_Forest|  and Barnysdale   :Thai oysyd all this tyme thare trawale.     The next notice is a statement in the  Scotichronicon , composed by  |John_of_Fordun|John_Of_Fordun|  between 1377 and 1384, and revised by  |Walter_Bower|Walter_Bower|  in about 1440. Among Bowers many interpolations is a passage that directly refers to Robin. It is inserted after Forduns account of the defeat of  |Simon_de_Montfort|Simon_De_Montfort,_6Th_Earl_Of_Leicester|  and the punishment of his adherents. Robin is represented as a fighter for de Montforts cause. Dobson and Taylor, p. 5. This was in fact true of the historical outlaw of Sherwood Forest  |Roger_Godberd|Roger_Godberd| , whose points of similarity to the Robin Hood of the ballads have often been noted. J. R. Maddicott, Sir Edward the First and the Lessons of Baronial Reform in Coss and Loyd ed, Thirteenth century England:1 Proceedings of the Newcastle Upon Tyne Conference 1985, Boydell and Brewer, p. 2. Maurice Hugh Keen The Outlaws of Medieval England , Routledge. Bower writes:     Then arose the famous murderer, Robert Hood, as well as Little John, together with their accomplices from among the disinherited, whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating both in tragedies and comedies, and about whom they are delighted to hear the jesters and minstrels sing above all other ballads.     The word translated here as murderer is the Latin sicarius , from the Latin sica for dagger. Bower goes on to tell a story about Robin Hood in which he refuses to flee from his enemies while hearing  |Mass|Mass|  in the greenwood, and then gains a surprise victory over them, apparently as a reward for his piety. Passage quoted and commented on in Stephen Knights, Robin Hood; A Mythic Biography, Cornell University Press , p. 5.     Another reference, discovered by Julian Luxford in 2009, appears in the margin of the  |Polychronicon|Ranulf_Higdon|  in the  |Eton_College|Eton_College|  library. Written around the year 1460 by a monk in Latin, it says:     :Around this time i.e., reign of  |Edward_I|Edward_I| , according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies.      In a petition presented to  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_England|  in 1439, the name is used to describe an itinerant  |felon|Felony| . The petition cites one Piers Venables of  |Aston,_Derbyshire|Aston,_Derbyshire| , who having no liflode, ne sufficeante of goodes, gadered and assembled unto him many misdoers, beynge of his clothynge, and, in manere of insurrection, wente into the wodes in that countrie, like as it hadde be Robyn Hude and his meyne. Rot. Parl. v. 16. The name was still used to describe sedition and treachery in 1605, when  |Guy_Fawkes|Guy_Fawkes|  and his associates were branded Robin Hoods by  |Robert_Cecil|Robert_Cecil,_1St_Earl_Of_Salisbury| . In 1644, jurist  |Edward_Coke|Edward_Coke|  described Robin Hood as a historical figure who had operated in the reign of King Richard I around Yorkshire; he interpreted the contemporary term roberdsmen as meaning followers of Robin Hood.             The earliest known legal records mentioning a person called Robin Hood are from 1226, found in the York  |Assizes|Assizes| , when that persons goods, worth 32 shillings and 6 pence, were confiscated and he became an outlaw. Robert Hod owed the money to St Peters in  |York|York| . The following year, he was called Hobbehod . Robert Hod of York is the only early Robin Hood known to have been an outlaw. L.V.D. Owen in 1936 floated the idea that Robin Hood might be identified with an outlawed Robert Hood, or Hod, or Hobbehod, all apparently the same man, referred to in nine successive Yorkshire  |Pipe_Rolls|Pipe_Rolls|  between 1226 and 1234. Crook, David The Sheriff of Nottingham and Robin Hood: The Genesis of the Legend? In Peter R. Coss, S.D. Lloyd, ed. Thirteenth Century England University of Newcastle . , 12 lines from bottom. There is no evidence however that this Robert Hood, although an  |outlaw|Outlaw| , was also a  |bandit|Bandit| . Dobson and Taylor, p. xvii.       Historian Oscar de Ville discusses the career of John Deyville and his brother Robert, along with their kinsmen Jocelin and Adam, during the  |Second_Barons_War|Second_Barons_War| , specifically their activities after the  |Battle_of_Evesham|Battle_Of_Evesham| . John Deyville was granted authority by the faction led by  |Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester|Simon_De_Montfort,_6Th_Earl_Of_Leicester|  over  |York_Castle|York_Castle|  and the Northern Forests during the war in which they sought refuge after Evesham. John, along with his relatives, led the remaining rebel faction on the  |Isle_of_Ely|Isle_Of_Ely|  following the  |Dictum_of_Kenilworth|Dictum_Of_Kenilworth| .  De Ville connects their presence there with Bowers mention of Robert Hood during the aftermath of Evesham in his annotations to the Scotichronicon.     While John was eventually pardoned and continued his career until 1290, his kinsmen are no longer mentioned by historical records after the events surrounding their resistance at Ely, and de Ville speculates that Robert remained an outlaw. Other points de Ville raises in support of John and his brothers exploits forming the inspiration for Robin Hood include their properties in Barnsdale, Johns settlement of a mortgage worth £400 paralleling Robin Hoods charity of identical value to Sir  |Richard_at_the_Lee|Richard_At_The_Lee| , relationship with Sir Richard Foliot, a possible inspiration for the former figure, and ownership of a fortified home at Hood Hill, near  |Kilburn,_North_Yorkshire|Kilburn,_North_Yorkshire| . The last of these is suggested to be the inspiration for Robin Hoods second name as opposed to the more common theory of a head covering.  Perhaps not coincidentally, a Robertus Hod is mentioned in records among the holdouts at Ely. Rennison, Nick. https://books.google.com/books?id5fWEAAAAQBAJ Robin Hood: Myth, History and Culture .     Although de Ville does not explicitly connect John and Robert Deyville to Robin Hood, he discusses these parallels in detail and suggests that they formed prototypes for this ideal of heroic outlawry during the tumultuous reign of Henry IIIs grandson and Edward Is son,  |Edward_II_of_England|Edward_Ii_Of_England| . de Ville 1999, pp. 108–09        |David_Baldwin|David_Baldwin|  identifies Robin Hood with the historical outlaw  |Roger_Godberd|Roger_Godberd| , who was a die-hard supporter of  |Simon_de_Montfort|Simon_De_Montfort,_6Th_Earl_Of_Leicester| , which would place Robin Hood around the 1260s. See BBC website, accessed 19 August 2008 on the Godberd theory. . There are certainly parallels between Godberds career and that of Robin Hood as he appears in the Gest.  |John_Maddicott|John_Maddicott|  has called Godberd that prototype Robin Hood . J.R. Maddicott, Edward the First and the Lessons of Baronial Reform in Coss and Loyd ed, Thirteenth century England:1 Proceedings of the Newcastle Upon Tyne Conference 1985, Boydell and Brewer, p. 2. Some problems with this theory are that there is no evidence that Godberd was ever known as Robin Hood and no sign in the early Robin Hood ballads of the specific concerns of de Montforts revolt. Dobson and Taylor, introduction.       The antiquarian  |Joseph_Hunter|Joseph_Hunter|  believed that Robin Hood had inhabited the forests of Yorkshire during the early decades of the fourteenth century. Hunter pointed to two men whom, believing them to be the same person, he identified with the legendary outlaw:     Robert Hood who is documented as having lived in the city of  |Wakefield|Wakefield|  at the start of the fourteenth century.   Robyn Hode who is recorded as being employed by  |Edward_II_of_England|Edward_Ii_Of_England|  during 1323.     Hunter developed a fairly detailed theory implying that Robert Hood had been an adherent of the rebel  |Earl_of_Lancaster|Thomas,_2Nd_Earl_Of_Lancaster| , who was defeated by Edward II at the  |Battle_of_Boroughbridge|Battle_Of_Boroughbridge|  in 1322. According to this theory, Robert Hood was thereafter pardoned and employed as a bodyguard by King Edward, and in consequence he appears in the 1323 court roll under the name of Robyn Hode . Hunters theory has long been recognised to have serious problems, one of the most serious being that recent research has shown that Hunters Robyn Hood had been employed by the king before he appeared in the 1323 court roll, thus casting doubt on this Robyn Hoods supposed earlier career as outlaw and rebel. Hunter, Joseph, Robin Hood , in Robin Hood: An Anthology of Scholarship and Criticism, ed. by Stephen Knight pp. 187–96. Holt, pp.  75–76, summarised in Dobson and Taylor, p. xvii.       It has long been suggested, notably by  |John_Maddicott|John_Maddicott| , that Robin Hood was a  |stock_alias|Stock_Character|  used by thieves. Dobson and Taylor, pp. xxi–xxii. What appears to be the first known example of Robin Hood as a stock name for an outlaw dates to 1262 in  |Berkshire|Berkshire| , where the surname Robehod was applied to a man apparently because he had been outlawed. D. Crook English Historical Review XCIX pp. 530–34; discussed in Dobson and Taylor, pp. xi–xxii. This could suggest two main possibilities: either that an early form of the Robin Hood legend was already well established in the mid-13th century; or alternatively that the name Robin Hood preceded the outlaw hero that we know; so that the Robin Hood of legend was so called because that was seen as an appropriate name for an outlaw.       There is at present little or no scholarly support for the view that tales of Robin Hood have stemmed from mythology or folklore, from fairies or other mythological origins, any such associations being regarded as later development. Holt, p. 55. Dobson and Taylor , p. 63. It was once a popular view, however. A number of such theories are mentioned at . The mythological theory dates back at least to 1584, when  |Reginald_Scot|Reginald_Scot|  identified Robin Hood with the Germanic goblin Hudgin or  |Hodekin|Hodekin|  and associated him with  |Robin_Goodfellow|Robin_Goodfellow| . Reginald Scot Discourse upon divels and spirits Chapter 21, quoted in Charles P. G. Scott The Devil and His Imps: An Etymological Investigation p. 129 Transactions of the American Philological Association Vol. 26, , pp. 79–146 Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press  2004, Imagining Robin Hood: The Late-Medieval Stories in Historical Context, Routledge .  |Maurice_Keen|Maurice_Keen|  The Outlaws of Medieval England Appendix 1, 1987, Routledge, . provides a brief summary and useful critique of the evidence for the view Robin Hood had mythological origins. While the outlaw often shows great skill in archery, swordplay and disguise, his feats are no more exaggerated than those of characters in other ballads, such as  Kinmont Willie , which were based on historical events. Holt, p. 57.     Robin Hood has also been claimed for the  |pagan|Paganism| |witch-cult|Witch-Cult_Hypothesis|  supposed by  |Margaret_Murray|Margaret_Murray|  to have existed in medieval Europe, and his anti-clericalism and Marianism interpreted in this light. Robert Graves English and Scottish Ballads. London: William Heinemann, 1957; New York: Macmillan, 1957. See, in particular, Graves notes to his reconstruction of  |Robin_Hoods_Death|Robin_Hoods_Death| . The existence of the witch cult as proposed by Murray is now generally discredited.              The early ballads link Robin Hood to identifiable real places. In popular culture, Robin Hood and his band of merry men are portrayed as living in  |Sherwood_Forest|Sherwood_Forest| , in  |Nottinghamshire|Nottinghamshire| . Notably, the Lincoln Cathedral Manuscript, which is the first officially recorded Robin Hood song , makes an explicit reference to the outlaw that states that Robyn hode in scherewode stod. Thomas H. Ohlgren, Robin Hood: The Early Poems, 1465–1560, Texts, Contexts and Ideology p. 18. In a similar fashion, a monk of  |Witham_Priory|Witham_Charterhouse|  suggested that the archer had infested shirwode. His chronicle entry reads:     :Around this time, according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies. Luxford, Julian. An English Chronicle entry on Robin Hood , Journal of Medieval History, 35 pp. 70–76.       Specific sites in the county of Nottinghamshire that are directly linked to the Robin Hood legend include Robin Hoods Well, located near Newstead Abbey , the Church of St. Mary in the village of  |Edwinstowe|Edwinstowe|  and most famously of all, the  |Major_Oak|Major_Oak|  also located at the village of Edwinstowe.  The Major Oak, which resides in the heart of Sherwood Forest, is popularly believed to have been used by the Merry Men as a hide-out. Dendrologists have contradicted this claim by estimating the trees true age at around eight hundred years; it would have been relatively a sapling in Robins time, at best.        Nottinghamshires claim to Robin Hoods heritage is disputed, with Yorkists staking a claim to the outlaw. In demonstrating Yorkshires Robin Hood heritage, the historian  |J._C._Holt|J._C._Holt|  drew attention to the fact that although Sherwood Forest is mentioned in Robin Hood and the Monk, there is little information about the topography of the region, and thus suggested that Robin Hood was drawn to Nottinghamshire through his interactions with the citys sheriff. Holt, Robin Hood pp. 90–91. Moreover, the linguist Lister Matheson has observed that the language of the Gest of Robyn Hode is written in a definite northern dialect, probably that of Yorkshire. Matheson, Lister, The Dialects and Language of Selected Robin Hood Poems , in Robin Hood: The Early Poems, 1465–1560 Texts, Contexts and Ideology ed. by Thomas Ohlgren . In consequence, it seems probable that the Robin Hood legend actually originates from the county of Yorkshire. Robin Hoods Yorkshire origins are generally accepted by professional historians. Bellamy, John, Robin Hood: An Historical Enquiry . Bradbury, Jim, Robin Hood . Dobson, R.B., The Genesis of a Popular Hero in Robin Hood in Popular Culture: Violence, Transgression and Justice, ed. by Thomas Hahn pp. 61–77. Keen, Maurice, The Outlaws of Medieval Legend, 2nd edn . Maddicot, J.R., Simon De Montfort .          A tradition dating back at least to the end of the 16th century gives Robin Hoods birthplace as  |Loxley|Loxley,_South_Yorkshire| ,  |Sheffield|Sheffield| , in South Yorkshire. The original Robin Hood ballads, which originate from the fifteenth century, set events in the medieval forest of  |Barnsdale|Barnsdale| . Barnsdale was a wooded area covering an expanse of no more than thirty square miles, ranging six miles from north to south, with the  |River_Went|River_Went|  at Wentbridge near  |Pontefract|Pontefract|  forming its northern boundary and the villages of  |Skelbrooke|Skelbrooke|  and  |Hampole|Hampole|  forming the southernmost region. From east to west the forest extended about five miles, from  |Askern|Askern|  on the east to  |Badsworth|Badsworth|  in the west. Bradbury, p. 180. At the northernmost edge of the forest of Barnsdale, in the heart of the Went Valley, resides the village of  |Wentbridge|Wentbridge| . Wentbridge is a village in the City of Wakefield district of West Yorkshire, England. It lies around  southeast of its nearest township of size, Pontefract, close to the A1 road. During the medieval age Wentbridge was sometimes locally referred to by the name of Barnsdale because it was the predominant settlement in the forest. Dr Eric Houlder, PontArch Archaeological Society. Wentbridge is mentioned in an early Robin Hood ballad, entitled, Robin Hood and the Potter, which reads, Y mete hem bot at Went breg, syde Lyttyl John . And, while Wentbridge is not directly named in A Gest of Robyn Hode, the poem does appear to make a cryptic reference to the locality by depicting a poor knight explaining to Robin Hood that he went at a bridge where there was wrestling. The Gest, stanza 135, p. 88. A commemorative  |Blue_Plaque|Blue_Plaque|  has been placed on the bridge that crosses the River Went by Wakefield City Council.            The Gest makes a specific reference to the Saylis at Wentbridge. Credit is due to the nineteenth-century antiquarian  |Joseph_Hunter|Joseph_Hunter| , who correctly identified the site of the Saylis. Joseph Hunter, The Great Hero of the Ancient Minstrelsy of England , Critical and Historical Tracts, 4 . From this location it was once possible to look out over the Went Valley and observe the traffic that passed along the  |Great_North_Road|Great_North_Road| . The Saylis is recorded as having contributed towards the aid that was granted to  |Edward_III|Edward_Iii_Of_England|  in 1346–47 for the knighting of the  |Black_Prince|Edward,_The_Black_Prince| . An acre of landholding is listed within a  |glebe_terrier|Glebe_Terrier|  of 1688 relating to  |Kirk_Smeaton|Kirk_Smeaton| , which later came to be called Sailes Close . Borthowick Institute of Historical Research, St Anthonys Hall, York: R.III. F I xlvi b; R. III. F.16 xlvi . Professor Dobson and Mr. Taylor indicate that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the Saylis that was so well known to Robin Hood is preserved today as Sayles Plantation . Dobson, Dobson and Taylor, p. 22. It is this location that provides a vital clue to Robin Hoods Yorkshire heritage. One final locality in the forest of Barnsdale that is associated with Robin Hood is the village of  |Campsall|Campsall| .            The historian John Paul Davis wrote of Robins connection to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene at Campsall. Davis, John Paul, Robin Hood: The Unknown Templar See locations associated with Robin Hood below for further details. A Gest of Robyn Hode states that the outlaw built a chapel in Barnsdale that he dedicated to Mary Magdalene,     :I made a chapel in Bernysdale,   :That seemly is to se,   :It is of Mary Magdaleyne,   :And thereto wolde I be. The Gest, Stanza 440 p. 111.     Davis indicates that there is only one church dedicated to Mary Magdalene within what one might reasonably consider to have been the medieval forest of Barnsdale, and that is the church at  |Campsall|Campsall| . The church was built in the late eleventh century by Robert de Lacy, the 2nd Baron of Pontefract.   Local legend suggests that Robin Hood and Maid Marion were married at the church.       The backdrop of Saint Marys Abbey at York plays a central role in the Gest as the poor knight who Robin aids owes money to the abbot.            At  |Kirklees_Priory|Kirklees_Priory|  in Yorkshire stands an alleged grave with a spurious inscription, which relates to Robin Hood. The fifteenth-century ballads relate that before he died, Robin told Little John where to bury him. He shot an arrow from the Priory window, and where the arrow landed was to be the site of his grave. The Gest states that the Prioress was a relative of Robins. Robin was ill and staying at the Priory where the Prioress was supposedly caring for him. However, she betrayed him, his health worsened, and he eventually died there. The inscription on the grave reads,     :Hear underneath dis laitl stean   :Laz robert earl of Huntingtun   :Ne’er arcir ver as hie sa geud   :An pipl kauld im robin heud   :Sick utlawz as he an iz men   :Vil england nivr si agen   :Obiit 24 kal: Dekembris, 1247     Despite the unconventional spelling, the verse is in  |Modern_English|Modern_English| , not the  |Middle_English|Middle_English|  of the thirteenth century. The date is also incorrectly formatted—using the  |Roman_calendar|Roman_Calendar| , 24 kal Decembris would be the twenty-third day before the beginning of December, that is, 8 November. The tomb probably dates from the late eighteenth century.      The grave with the inscription is within sight of the ruins of the Kirklees Priory, behind the Three Nuns pub in Mirfield, West Yorkshire. Though local folklore suggests that Robin is buried in the grounds of  |Kirklees_Priory|Kirklees_Priory| , this theory has now largely been abandoned by professional historians.         Another theory is that Robin Hood died at Kirkby, Pontefract. Draytons Poly-Olbion Song 28 composed in 1622 speaks of Robin Hoods death and clearly states that the outlaw died at Kirkby. David Hepworth, A Grave Tale , in Robin Hood: Medieval and Post-Medieval, ed. by Helen Phillips pp. 91–112 This is consistent with the view that Robin Hood operated in the Went Valley, located three miles to the southeast of the town of Pontefract. The location is approximately three miles from the site of Robins robberies at the now famous Saylis. In the Anglo-Saxon period, Kirkby was home to All Saints Church. All Saints Church had a priory hospital attached to it. The Tudor historian Richard Grafton stated that the prioress who murdered Robin Hood buried the outlaw beside the road,     Where he had used to rob and spoyle those that passed that way ... and the cause why she buryed him there was, for that common strangers and travailers, knowing and seeing him there buryed, might more safely and without feare take their journeys that way, which they durst not do in the life of the sayd outlaes. Grafton, Richard, A Chronicle at Large p. 84 in Early English Books Online.     All Saints Church at Kirkby, modern Pontefract, which was located approximately three miles from the site of Robin Hoods robberies at the Saylis, is consistent with Richard Graftons description because a road ran directly from Wentbridge to the hospital at Kirkby. La Chance, A, The Origins and Development of Robin Hood . Kapelle, William E., The Norman Conquest of the North: The Region and Its Transformation, 1000–1135 .            Within close proximity of Wentbridge reside several notable landmarks relating to Robin Hood. One such place-name location occurred in a cartulary deed of 1422 from Monkbretton Priory, which makes direct reference to a landmark named Robin Hoods Stone, which resided upon the eastern side of the Great North Road, a mile south of Barnsdale Bar. Monkbretton Priory, Abstracts of the Chartularies of the Priory of Monkbretton, Vol. LXVI, ed. by J.W. Walker p. 105. The historians Barry Dobson and John Taylor suggested that on the opposite side of the road once stood Robin Hoods Well, which has since been relocated six miles north-west of Doncaster, on the south-bound side of the Great North Road. Over the next three centuries, the name popped-up all over the place, such as at  |Robin_Hoods_Bay|Robin_Hoods_Bay| , near Whitby in Yorkshire, Robin Hoods Butts in Cumbria, and Robin Hoods Walk at Richmond, Surrey.     Robin Hood type place-names occurred particularly everywhere except Sherwood. The first place-name in Sherwood does not appear until the year 1700. Dobson and Taylor, p. 18. The fact that the earliest Robin Hood type place-names originated in West Yorkshire is deemed to be historically significant because, generally, place-name evidence originates from the locality where legends begin. Dobson and Taylor, p. 22. The overall picture from the surviving early ballads and other early references Dobson and Taylor, p. 18: On balance therefore these 15th-century references to the Robin Hood legend seem to suggest that during the later Middle Ages the outlaw hero was more closely related to Barnsdale than Sherwood. indicate that Robin Hood was based in the Barnsdale area of what is now  |South_Yorkshire|South_Yorkshire| , which borders Nottinghamshire.            The Sheriff of Nottingham also had jurisdiction in Derbyshire that was known as the Shire of the Deer , and this is where the Royal Forest of the Peak is found, which roughly corresponds to todays  |Peak_District_National_Park|Peak_District| . The Royal Forest included  |Bakewell|Bakewell| ,  |Tideswell|Tideswell| ,  |Castleton|Castleton,_Derbyshire| ,  |Ladybower|Ladybower_Reservoir|  and the  |Derwent_Valley|River_Derwent,_Derbyshire|  near Loxley. The Sheriff of Nottingham possessed property near Loxley, among other places both far and wide including  |Hazlebadge_Hall|Hazlebadge_Hall| ,  |Peveril_Castle|Peveril_Castle|  and  |Haddon_Hall|Haddon_Hall| .  |Mercia|Mercia| , to which Nottingham belonged, came to within three miles of  |Sheffield_City_Centre|Sheffield_City_Centre| . But before the Law of the Normans was the Law of the Danes, The Danelaw had a similar boundary to that of Mercia but had a population of Free Peasantry that were known to have resisted the Norman occupation. Many outlaws could have been created by the refusal to recognise Norman Forest Law.  The supposed grave of Little John can be found in  |Hathersage|Hathersage| , also in the Peak District.     Further indications of the legends connection with West Yorkshire are noted in the fact that there are pubs called the Robin Hood in both nearby  |Brighouse|Brighouse|  and at  |Cragg_Vale|Cragg_Vale| ; higher up in the Pennines beyond  |Halifax|Halifax,_West_Yorkshire| , where Robin Hood Rocks can also be found. Robin Hood Hill is near  |Outwood,_West_Yorkshire|Outwood,_West_Yorkshire| , not far from  |Lofthouse|Lofthouse,_West_Yorkshire| . There is a village in West Yorkshire called  |Robin_Hood|Robin_Hood,_West_Yorkshire| , on the  |A61|A61_Road|  between  |Leeds|Leeds|  and  |Wakefield|Wakefield|  and close to  |Rothwell|Rothwell,_West_Yorkshire|  and Lofthouse. Considering these references to Robin Hood, it is not surprising that the people of both South and West Yorkshire lay some claim to Robin Hood, who, if he existed, could easily have roamed between Nottingham,  |Lincoln|Lincoln,_Lincolnshire| ,  |Doncaster|Doncaster|  and right into West Yorkshire.     A  |British_Army|British_Army| |Territorial|Territorial_Army|  battalion formed in Nottingham in 1859 was known as  |The_Robin_Hood_Battalion|The_Robin_Hood_Battalion|  through various reorganisations until the Robin Hood name finally disappeared in 1992. With the 1881  |Childers_Reforms|Childers_Reforms|  that linked regular and reserve units into regimental families, the Robin Hood Battalion became part of  |The_Sherwood_Foresters|Sherwood_Foresters| .     A  |Neolithic|Neolithic| |causewayed_enclosure|Causewayed_Enclosure|  on  |Salisbury_Plain|Salisbury_Plain|  has acquired the name  |Robin_Hoods_Ball|Robin_Hoods_Ball| , although had Robin Hood existed it is doubtful that he would have travelled so far south.          Ballads dating back to the 15th century are the oldest existing form of the Robin Hood legends, although none of them were recorded at the time of the first allusions to him, and many are from much later. They share many common features, often opening with praise of the greenwood and relying heavily on disguise as a  |plot_device|Plot_Device| , but include a wide variation in tone and plot. Holt, pp. 34–35. The ballads are sorted into three groups, very roughly according to date of first known free-standing copy. Ballads whose first recorded version appears in the  |Percy_Folio|Percy_Folio|  may appear in later versions Dobson and Taylor, Appendix 1. and may be much older than the mid-17th century when the Folio was compiled. Any ballad may be older than the oldest copy that happens to survive, or descended from a lost older ballad. For example, the plot of  |Robin_Hoods_Death|Robin_Hoods_Death| , found in the Percy Folio, is summarised in the 15th-century  |A_Gest_of_Robyn_Hode|A_Gest_Of_Robyn_Hode| , and it also appears in an 18th-century version. Dobson and Taylor, p. 133.        |A_Gest_of_Robyn_Hode|A_Gest_Of_Robyn_Hode| |Robin_Hood_and_the_Monk|Robin_Hood_And_The_Monk| |Robin_Hood_and_the_Potter|Robin_Hood_And_The_Potter|        NB. The first two ballads listed here , although preserved in 17th-century copies, are generally agreed to preserve the substance of late medieval ballads. The third and the fourth , also probably have late medieval origins.

Child, v.  1, p.  178 He was added to one variant of  Rose Red and the White Lily , apparently on no more connection than that one hero of the other variants is named Brown Robin . Child, v.  2, p.  416  |Francis_James_Child|Francis_James_Child|  indeed retitled  |Child_ballad|Child_Ballads|  102; though it was titled The Birth of Robin Hood, its clear lack of connection with the Robin Hood cycle led him to title it  Willie and Earl Richards Daughter  in his collection.
