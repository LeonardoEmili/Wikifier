     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a diffeomorphism is an  |isomorphism|Isomorphism|  of  |smooth_manifolds|Smooth_Manifold| . It is an  |invertible_function|Invertible_Function|  that  |maps|Map|  one  |differentiable_manifold|Differentiable_Manifold|  to another such that both the function and its inverse are  |smooth|Smooth_Function| .              Given two  |manifolds|Manifolds|  M and N, a  |differentiable|Differentiable_Manifolddifferentiable_Functions|  map f  : M  → N is called a diffeomorphism if it is a  |bijection|Bijection|  and its inverse f −1  : N  → M is differentiable as well. If these functions are r times continuously differentiable, f is called a C r -diffeomorphism.     Two manifolds M and N are diffeomorphic if there is a diffeomorphism f from M to N. They are C r diffeomorphic if there is an r times continuously differentiable bijective map between them whose inverse is also r times continuously differentiable.         Given a subset X of a manifold M and a subset Y of a manifold N, a function f  : X  → Y is said to be smooth if for all p in X there is a neighborhood U  ⊂ M of p and a smooth function g  : U  → N such that the restrictions agree g f . f is said to be a diffeomorphism if it is bijective, smooth and its inverse is smooth.            ; Model example   If U, V are connected open subsets of R n such that V is  |simply_connected|Simply_Connected| , a  |differentiable|Derivative|  map f  : U  → V is a diffeomorphism if it is  |proper|Proper_Map|  and if the  |differential|Pushforward|  Df x   : R n  → R n is  |bijective|Bijection|  at each point x in U.       ; First remark   It is essential for V to be  |simply_connected|Simply_Connected|  for the function f to be globally invertible . For example, consider the realification of the complex square function   :     f :                           Then f is surjective and it satisfies   :   Dfx4    Thus, though Df x  is bijective at each point, f is not invertible because it fails to be injective  .
