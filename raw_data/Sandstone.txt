                       Sandstone is a  |clastic_sedimentary_rock|Clastic_Sedimentary_Rock|  composed mainly of  |sand-sized|Grain_Size| |mineral|Mineral|  particles or  |rock_fragments|Rock_Fragment| .     Most sandstone is composed of  |quartz|Quartz|  or  |feldspar|Feldspar|   because they are the most resistant minerals to  |weathering|Weathering|  processes at the Earths surface, as seen in the  |Goldich_dissolution_series|Goldich_Dissolution_Series| . Like uncemented  |sand|Sand| , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other  |topographic|Topography|  features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions.     Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the  |percolation|Percolation|  of water and other fluids and are  |porous|Porosity|  enough to store large quantities, making them valuable  |aquifers|Aquifer|  and  |petroleum_reservoirs|Petroleum_Reservoir| . Fine-grained aquifers, such as sandstones, are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices, such as  |limestone|Limestone|  or other rocks fractured by  |seismic_activity|Earthquake| .     Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into  |quartzite|Quartzite|  through  |metamorphism|Metamorphism| , usually related to tectonic compression within  |orogenic_belts|Orogenic_Belts| .               Sandstones are  clastic  in origin . A Basic Sedimentary Rock Classification , L.S. Fichter, Department of Geology/Environmental Science,  |James_Madison_University|James_Madison_University|  , Harrisonburg, Virginia, October 2000,  : separates clastic, chemical & biochemical .   They are formed from  |cemented|Cementation|  grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic  |crystals|Crystal| . The cements binding these grains together are typically  |calcite|Calcite| ,  |clays|Clay| , and  |silica|Silica| .  |Grain_sizes|Particle_Size|  in sands are defined within the range of 0.0625  mm to 2  mm . Clays and sediments with smaller grain sizes not visible with the naked eye, including  |siltstones|Siltstone|  and  |shales|Shale| , are typically called  argillaceous  sediments; rocks with larger grain sizes, including  |breccias|Breccia|  and  |conglomerates|Conglomerate| , are termed rudaceous sediments.           The formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of  |sedimentation|Sedimentation| , either from water or from air . Typically, sedimentation occurs by the sand settling out from suspension; i.e., ceasing to be rolled or bounced along the bottom of a body of water or ground surface . Finally, once it has accumulated, the sand becomes sandstone when it is  |compacted|Compaction|  by the pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.     The most common cementing materials are silica and  |calcium_carbonate|Calcium_Carbonate| , which are often derived either from dissolution or from alteration of the sand after it was buried. Colors will usually be tan or yellow . A predominant additional colourant in the southwestern United States is  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide| , which imparts reddish tints ranging from pink to dark red , with additional  |manganese|Manganese|  imparting a purplish  |hue|Hue| . Red sandstones, both  |Old_Red_Sandstone|Old_Red_Sandstone|  and  |New_Red_Sandstone|New_Red_Sandstone| , are also seen in the Southwest and West of  |Britain|United_Kingdom| , as well as central  |Europe|Europe|  and  |Mongolia|Mongolia| . The regularity of the latter favours use as a source for  |masonry|Masonry| , either as a primary building material or as a facing stone, over other forms of construction.     The environment where it is deposited is crucial in determining the characteristics of the resulting sandstone, which, in finer detail, include its grain size, sorting, and composition and, in more general detail, include the rock geometry and sedimentary structures. Principal  |environments_of_deposition|Sedimentary_Depositional_Environment|  may be split between terrestrial and marine, as illustrated by the following broad groupings:   Terrestrial environments    |Rivers|River| |Alluvial_fans|Alluvial_Fan| |Glacial_outwash|Glacial_Outwash| |Lakes|Lake| |Deserts|Deserts|     Marine environments    |Deltas|River_Delta| |Beach|Beach|  and shoreface sands    |Tidal_flats|Tidal_Flat|    Offshore bars and  |sand_waves|Sand_Waves|    Storm deposits    |Turbidites|Turbidite|                  Framework grains are sand-sized  detrital fragments that make up the bulk of a sandstone.   These grains can be classified into several different categories based on their mineral composition:   Quartz framework grains are the dominant minerals in most  |clastic_sedimentary_rocks|Clastic_Sedimentary_Rock| ; this is because they have exceptional physical properties, such as hardness and chemical stability. Boggs, J.R., 2000, Principles of sedimentology and stratigraphy, 3rd ed. Toronto: Merril Publishing Company.  These physical properties allow the quartz grains to survive multiple recycling events, while also allowing the grains to display some degree of rounding. Quartz grains evolve from plutonic rock, which are felsic in origin and also from older sandstones that have been recycled.   Feldspathic framework grains are commonly the second most abundant mineral in sandstones. Feldspar can be divided into two smaller subdivisions: alkali feldspars and plagioclase feldspars. The different types of feldspar can be distinguished under a petrographic microscope. Below is a description of the different types of feldspar.     :: |Alkali_feldspar|Alkali_Feldspar|  is a group of minerals in which the chemical composition of the mineral can range from KAlSi 3 O 8 to NaAlSi 3 O 8 , this represents a complete solid solution.     :: |Plagioclase_feldspar|Plagioclase_Feldspar|  is a complex group of solid solution minerals that range in composition from NaAlSi 3 O 8 to CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 .     |muscovite|Muscovite|  and  |biotite|Biotite| 2004hence ZTR |olo|Olo| 1997 |rth_scienc|Rth_Scienc| |Lower_Carboniferous|Lower_Carboniferous| |QFL_diagrams|Qfl_Diagrams| 19931964 |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |teri|Teri| .
