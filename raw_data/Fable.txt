      Fable is a literary genre: a succinct fictional story, in  |prose|Prose|  or  |verse|Verse| , that features  |animals|Animal| ,  |legendary_creatures|Legendary_Creature| ,  |plants|Plant| , inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are  |anthropomorphized|Anthropomorphism| , and that illustrates or leads to a particular  |moral|Moral|  lesson , which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy  |maxim|Maxim|   or  |saying|Saying|  .     A fable differs from a  |parable|Parable|  in that the latter excludes animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.     Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished.

For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.     A person who writes fables is a fabulist.       The fable is one of the most enduring forms of  |folk_literature|Folklore| , spread abroad, modern researchers agree, Enzyklopädie des Märchens , see Fabel , Äsopica etc. less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.       The varying corpus denoted Aesopica or  Aesops Fables  includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the  |legend|Legend| ary  |Aesop|Aesop| , supposed to have been a slave in  |ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece|  around 550 BCE. When  |Babrius|Babrius|  set down fables from the Aesopica in verse for a  |Hellenistic|Hellenistic|  Prince Alexander, he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of myth that Aesop had introduced to the sons of the Hellenes had been an invention of Syrians from the time of  |Ninos|Ninus|   and  |Belos|Belus|  . Burkert 1992:121  |Epicharmus_of_Kos|Epicharmus_Of_Kos|  and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables. P. W. Buckham, p. 245 Many familiar fables of Aesop include  |The_Crow_and_the_Pitcher|The_Crow_And_The_Pitcher|  ,  |The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare|The_Tortoise_And_The_Hare|  and  |The_Lion_and_the_Mouse|The_Lion_And_The_Mouse|  . In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the  progymnasmata —training exercises in prose composition and public speaking—wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.        |African_oral_culture|Oral_Tradition|   has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.      |Joel_Chandler_Harris|Joel_Chandler_Harris|  wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of  |Uncle_Remus|Uncle_Remus| . His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie  Song of the South  introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.       India has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Some of the gods are forms of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in  |ancient_India|History_Of_India|  during the  |first_millennium_BCE|1St_Millennium_Bc| , often as  |stories_within|Story_Within_A_Story| |frame_stories|Frame_Story| . Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the  |Jataka_tales|Jataka_Tales| . These included  |Vishnu_Sarmas|Vishnu_Sarma|   Panchatantra , the  Hitopadesha ,  Vikram and The Vampire , and  |Syntipas|Syntipas|   Seven Wise Masters , which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the  |Old_World|Old_World| . Ben E. Perry  has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist Jataka tales and some of the fables in the Panchatantra may have been influenced by similar  |Greek|Greek_Language|  and  |Near_East|Near_East| ern ones. Ben E. Perry, Introduction , p. xix, in Babrius and Phaedrus Earlier  |Indian_epics|Indian_Epic_Poetry|  such as  |Vyasas|Krishna_Dwaipayana_Vyasa|   Mahabharata  and  |Valmikis|Valmiki|   Ramayana  also contained fables within the main story, often as  |side_stories|Side_Story|  or  |back-story|Back-Story| . The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the  One Thousand and One Nights , also known as the Arabian Nights.       Fables had a further long tradition through the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the  |French|France|  fabulist  |Jean_de_La_Fontaine|Jean_De_La_Fontaine|  saw the soul of the fable in the moral — a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising  |bourgeoisie|Bourgeoisie| , indeed the entire human scene of his time. Translations of his 12 books of fables are available online at  La Fontaines model was subsequently emulated by Englands  |John_Gay|John_Gay|  ; His two collections of 1727 and 1738 are available in one volume on Google Books at  Polands  |Ignacy_Krasicki|Ignacy_Krasicki|  ; His Bajki przypowiesci are available online at  Italys  |Lorenzo_Pignotti|Lorenzo_Pignotti|    and  |Giovanni_Gherardo_de_Rossi|Giovanni_Gherardo_De_Rossi|  ;   Serbias  |Dositej_Obradović|Dositej_Obradović|  ; Spains  |Félix_María_de_Samaniego|Félix_María_De_Samaniego|  9 books of fables are available online in Spanish at  and  |Tomás_de_Iriarte_y_Oropesa|Tomás_De_Iriarte_Y_Oropesa|  ;   Frances  |Jean-Pierre_Claris_de_Florian|Jean-Pierre_Claris_De_Florian|  ; His five books of fables are available online in French at   and Russias  |Ivan_Krylov|Ivan_Krylov|  . 5 books of fables are available online in Russian at         In modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in childrens books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature.  |Felix_Saltens|Felix_Salten|   Bambi  is a  Bildungsroman  — a story of a  |protagonists|Protagonist|  coming-of-age — cast in the form of a fable.  |James_Thurber|James_Thurber|  used the ancient fable style in his books  Fables for Our Time  and  Further Fables for Our Time  , and in his stories  |The_Princess_and_the_Tin_Box|The_Princess_And_The_Tin_Box|  in The Beast in Me and Other Animals and The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man in Lanterns and Lances .  |Władysław_Reymonts|Władysław_Reymont|  The Revolt , a  |metaphor|Metaphor|  for the  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik| |Revolution_of_1917|Russian_Revolution_Of_1917| , described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce equality.  |George_Orwells|George_Orwell|   Animal Farm  similarly satirized  |Stalinist_Communism|Stalinist_Communism|  in particular, and  |totalitarianism|Totalitarianism|  in general, in the guise of animal fable.     In the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as “western protest fables.” The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scias aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place.
