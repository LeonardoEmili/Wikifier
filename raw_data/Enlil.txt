            Enlil, later known as Elil, is an  |ancient_Mesopotamian_god|List_Of_Mesopotamian_Deities|  associated with wind, air, earth, and storms. He is first attested as the chief deity of the  |Sumerian_pantheon|Sumerian_Pantheon| , but he was later worshipped by the  |Akkadians|Akkadian_Empire| ,  |Babylonians|Babylonian_Empire| ,  |Assyrians|Assyrian_Empire| , and  |Hurrians|Hurrians| . Enlils primary center of worship was the  |Ekur|Ekur|  temple in the city of  |Nippur|Nippur| , which was believed to have been built by Enlil himself and was regarded as the mooring-rope of heaven and earth. He is also sometimes referred to in Sumerian texts as Nunamnir. According to one Sumerian hymn, Enlil himself was so holy that not even the other gods could look upon him. Enlil rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC with the rise of Nippur. His  |cult|Cult|  fell into decline after Nippur was sacked by the  |Elam|Elam| ites in 1230 BC and he was eventually supplanted as the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon by the Babylonian  |national_god|National_God| |Marduk|Marduk| . The Babylonian god  Bel  was a  |syncretic_deity|Syncretism|  of Enlil, Marduk, and the  |dying-and-rising/resurrection_deity|Dying-And-Rising_Deity| |Dumuzid|Dumuzid| .     Enlil plays a vital role in the  |Sumerian_creation_myth|Sumerian_Creation_Myth| ; he separates  |An|Anu|  from  |Ki|Ki|  , thus making the world habitable for humans. In the Sumerian  |flood_myth|Flood_Myth| , Enlil rewards  |Ziusudra|Ziusudra|  with immortality for having survived the flood and, in the Babylonian flood myth, Enlil is the cause of the flood himself, having sent the flood to exterminate the human race, who made too much noise and prevented him from sleeping. The myth of  Enlil and Ninlil  is about Enlils serial seduction of the goddess  |Ninlil|Ninlil|  in various guises, resulting in the conception of the moon-god  |Nanna|Sin|  and the  |Underworld|Ancient_Mesopotamian_Underworld|  deities  |Nergal|Nergal| ,  |Ninazu|Ninazu| , and  |Enbilulu|Enbilulu| . Enlil was regarded as the inventor of the  |mattock|Mattock|  and the patron of agriculture. Enlil also features prominently in several myths involving his son  |Ninurta|Ninurta| , including  Anzû and the Tablet of Destinies  and Lugale.       Enlils name comes from ancient Sumerian  |EN|En| , meaning lord and LÍL meaning wind . His name therefore literally translates as Lord Wind . Enlils name is not a genitive construction, indicating that Enlil was seen as the personification of the wind itself rather than merely the cause of wind.                     Enlil was the patron god of the Sumerian city-state of  |Nippur|Nippur|  and his main center of worship was the  |Ekur|Ekur|  temple located there. The name of the temple literally means Mountain House in ancient Sumerian. The Ekur was believed to have been built and established by Enlil himself. It was believed to be the mooring-rope of heaven and earth, meaning that it was seen as a channel of communication between earth and heaven . A hymn written during the reign of  |Ur-Nammu|Ur-Nammu| , the founder of the  |Third_Dynasty_of_Ur|Third_Dynasty_Of_Ur| , describes the E-kur in great detail, stating that its gates were carved with scenes of  |Imdugud|Imdugud| , a lesser deity sometimes shown as a giant bird, slaying a lion and an eagle snatching up a sinner.     The Sumerians believed that the sole purpose of humanitys existence was to serve the gods. They thought that a gods statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself. As such,  |cult_statues|Cult_Image|  were given constant care and attention and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them. People worshipped Enlil by offering food and other human necessities to him. The food, which was ritually laid out before the gods cult statue in the form of a feast, was believed to be Enlils daily meal, but, after the ritual, it would be distributed among his priests. These priests were also responsible for changing the cult statues clothing.     The Sumerians envisioned Enlil as a benevolent, fatherly deity, who watches over humanity and cares for their well-being. One Sumerian hymn describes Enlil as so glorious that even the other gods could not look upon him. The same hymn also states that, without Enlil, civilization could not exist. Enlils  |epithets|Epithet|  include titles such as the Great Mountain and King of the Foreign Lands . Enlil is also sometimes described as a raging storm , a wild bull , and a merchant . The Mesopotamians envisioned him as a creator, a father, a king, and the supreme lord of the universe. He was also known as Nunamnir  and is referred to in at least one text as the East Wind and North Wind .     Kings regarded Enlil as a model ruler and sought to emulate his example. Enlil was said to be supremely just and intolerant towards evil. Rulers from all over Sumer would travel to Enlils temple in Nippur to be legitimized. They would return Enlils favor by devoting lands and precious objects to his temple as offerings. Nippur was the only Sumerian city-state that never built a palace; this was intended to symbolize the citys importance as the center of the cult of Enlil by showing that Enlil himself was the citys king. Even during the Babylonian Period, when  |Marduk|Marduk|  had superseded Enlil as the supreme god, Babylonian kings still traveled to the holy city of Nippur to seek recognition of their right to rule.     Enlil first rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC, when the importance of the god  |An|Anu|  began to wane. During this time period, Enlil and An are frequently invoked together in inscriptions. Enlil remained the supreme god in Mesopotamia throughout the Amorite Period, with Amorite monarchs proclaiming Enlil as the source of their legitimacy. Enlils importance began to wane after the Babylonian king  |Hammurabi|Hammurabi|  conquered Sumer. The Babylonians worshipped Enlil under the name Elil  and the  |Hurrians|Hurrian_Religion|  syncretized him with their own god  |Kumarbi|Kumarbi| . In one Hurrian ritual, Enlil and Apantu are invoked as the father and mother of  |Išḫara|Ishara|  . Enlil is also invoked alongside Ninlil as a member of the  |mighty_and_firmly_established_gods|Anunnakihurrian_And_Hittite|  .     During the Kassite Period , Nippur briefly managed to regain influence in the region and Enlil rose to prominence once again. From around 1300 BC onwards, Enlil was syncretized with the Assyrian national god  |Aššur|Ashur| , who was the most important deity in the Assyrian pantheon. Then, in 1230 BC, the  |Elamites|Elamites|  attacked Nippur and the city fell into decline, taking the cult of Enlil along with it. Approximately one hundred years later, Enlils role as the head of the pantheon was given to  |Marduk|Marduk| , the  |national_god|National_God|  of the Babylonians. Enlils importance in the pantheon significantly declined and he was sometimes assimilated as merely an aspect of Marduk. Nonetheless, his temples continued functioning throughout the  |Neo-Assyrian_period|Neo-Assyrian_Empire|   and even the Babylonians saw Anu and Enlil as the ones who bestowed Marduk with his powers. During the first millennium BC, the Babylonians worshipped a deity under the title  |Bel|Bel|  , meaning lord , who was a syncretization of Enlil, Marduk, and the  |dying_god|Death_Or_Departure_Of_The_Gods| |Dumuzid|Dumuzid| . Bel held all the cultic titles of Enlil and his status in the Babylonian religion was largely the same. Eventually, Bel came to be seen as the god of order and destiny. Meanwhile, Aššur continued to be known as the Assyrian Enlil or the Enlil of the gods . After the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Enlils statues were smashed and his temples were destroyed because he had become inextricably associated with the Assyrians, who many conquered peoples hated. Enlil continued to be venerated under the name of Marduk until around 141 BC, when the cult of Marduk fell into terminal decline, and was eventually forgotten entirely.       Enlil was not represented anthropomorphically in Mesopotamian iconography. Instead, he was represented by a horned cap, which consisted of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns. Such crowns were an important symbol of divinity; gods had been shown wearing them ever since the third millennium BC. The horned cap remained consistent in form and meaning from the earliest days of Sumerian prehistory up until the time of the Persian conquest and beyond.     The Sumerians had a complex numerological system, in which certain numbers were believed to hold special ritual significance. Within this system, Enlil was associated with the number fifty, which was considered sacred to him. Enlil was part of a triad of deities, which also included An and Enki. These three deities together were the embodiment of all the  |fixed_stars|Fixed_Stars|  in the night sky. An was identified with all the stars of the  |equatorial_sky|Celestial_Equator| , Enlil with those of the  |northern_sky|Northern_Celestial_Hemisphere| , and Enki with those of the  |southern_sky|Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere| . The path of Enlils celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the  |north_celestial_pole|Celestial_Pole| , but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points. Enlil was associated with the constellation  |Boötes|Boötes| .              The main source of information about the Sumerian creation myth is the prologue to the epic poem  Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld  , which briefly describes the process of creation: originally, there was only  |Nammu|Nammu| , the primeval sea. Then, Nammu gave birth to  |An|Anu| , the sky, and  |Ki|Ki| , the earth. An and Ki mated with each other, causing Ki to give birth to Enlil. Enlil separated An from Ki and carried off the earth as his domain, while An carried off the sky.      Enlil and Ninlil   is a nearly complete 152-line Sumerian poem describing the affair between Enlil and the goddess  |Ninlil|Ninlil| . First, Ninlils mother Nunbarshegunu instructs Ninlil to go bathe in the river. Ninlil goes to the river, where Enlil seduces her and impregnates her with their son, the moon-god  |Nanna|Sin| . Because of this, Enlil is banished to  |Kur|Kur| , the Sumerian underworld. Ninlil follows Enlil to the underworld, where he impersonates the man of the gate . Ninlil demands to know where Enlil has gone, but Enlil, still impersonating the gatekeeper, refuses to answer. He then seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with  |Nergal|Nergal| , the god of death. The same scenario repeats, only this time Enlil instead impersonates the man of the river of the nether world, the man-devouring river ; once again, he seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with the god  |Ninazu|Ninazu| . Finally, Enlil impersonates the  |man_of_the_boat|Urshanabi|  ; once again, he seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with  |Enbilulu|Enbilulu| , the inspector of the canals .     The story of Enlils courtship with Ninlil is primarily a genealogical myth invented to explain the origins of the moon-god Nanna, as well as the various gods of the Underworld, but it is also, to some extent, a  |coming-of-age_story|Coming-Of-Age_Story|  describing Enlil and Ninlils emergence from adolescence into adulthood. The story also explains Ninlils role as Enlils consort; in the poem, Ninlil declares, As Enlil is your master, so am I also your mistress!  The story is also historically significant because, if the current interpretation of it is correct, it is the oldest known myth in which a god changes shape.       In the Sumerian version of the  |flood_story|Flood_Story|  , the causes of the flood are unclear because the portion of the tablet recording the beginning of the story has been destroyed. Somehow, a mortal known as  |Ziusudra|Ziusudra|  manages to survive the flood, likely through the help of the god  |Enki|Enki| . The tablet begins in the middle of the description of the flood. The flood lasts for seven days and seven nights before it subsides. Then,  |Utu|Utu| , the god of the Sun, emerges. Ziusudra opens a window in the side of the boat and falls down prostrate before the god. Next, he sacrifices an ox and a sheep in honor of Utu. At this point, the text breaks off again. When it picks back up, Enlil and An are in the midst of declaring Ziusudra immortal as an honor for having managed to survive the flood. The remaining portion of the tablet after this point is destroyed.     In the later Akkadian version of the flood story, recorded in the  Epic of Gilgamesh , Enlil actually causes the flood, seeking to annihilate every living thing on earth because the humans, who are vastly overpopulated, make too much noise and prevent him from sleeping. In this version of the story, the hero is  |Utnapishtim|Utnapishtim| , who is warned ahead of time by  |Ea|Enki| , the Babylonian equivalent of Enki, that the flood is coming. The flood lasts for seven days; when it ends,  |Ishtar|Ishtar| , who had mourned the destruction of humanity, promises Utnapishtim that Enlil will never cause a flood again. When Enlil sees that Utnapishtim and his family have survived, he is outraged, but his son  |Ninurta|Ninurta|  speaks up in favor of humanity, arguing that, instead of causing floods, Enlil should simply ensure that humans never become overpopulated by reducing their numbers using wild animals and famines. Enlil goes into the boat; Utnapishtim and his wife bow before him. Enlil, now appeased, grants Utnapishtim immortality as a reward for his loyalty to the gods.          A nearly complete 108-line poem from the  |Early_Dynastic_Period|Early_Dynastic_Period|   describes Enlils invention of the  |mattock|Mattock| , a key agricultural pick, hoe, ax, or digging tool of the Sumerians. In the poem, Enlil conjures the mattock into existence and decrees its fate. The mattock is described as gloriously beautiful; it is made of pure gold and has a head carved from  |lapis_lazuli|Lapis_Lazuli| . Enlil gives the tool over to the humans, who use it to build cities, subjugate their people, and pull up weeds. Enlil was believed to aid in the growth of plants.     The Sumerian poem  Enlil Chooses the Farmer-God   describes how Enlil, hoping to establish abundance and prosperity , creates two gods  |Emesh|Emesh|  and  |Enten|Enten| , a farmer and a shepherd respectively. The two gods argue and Emesh lays claim to Entens position. They take the dispute before Enlil, who rules in favor of Enten; the two gods rejoice and reconcile.            In the Sumerian poem Lugale , Enlil gives advice to his son, the god  |Ninurta|Ninurta| , advising him on a strategy to slay the  |demon|Utukku| |Asag|Asag| . This advice is relayed to Ninurta by way of  |Sharur|Sharur| , his enchanted talking mace, which had been sent by Ninurta to the  |realm_of_the_gods|Dilmun|  to seek counsel from Enlil directly.     In the Old, Middle, and Late Babylonian myth of Anzû and the Tablet of Destinies, the  |Anzû|Anzû| , a giant, monstrous bird, betrays Enlil and steals the  |Tablet_of_Destinies|Tablet_Of_Destinies| , a sacred clay tablet belonging to Enlil that grants him his authority, while Enlil is preparing for a bath. The rivers dry up and the gods are stripped of their powers. The gods send  |Adad|Adad| ,  |Gerra|Gerra| , and  |Shara|Shara|  to defeat the Anzû, but all of them fail. Finally, Ea proposes that the gods should send Ninurta, Enlils son. Ninurta successfully defeats the Anzû and returns the Tablet of Destinies to his father. As a reward, Ninurta is a granted a prominent seat on the council of the gods.       A badly damaged text from the  |Neo-Assyrian_Period|Neo-Assyrian_Empire|  describes Marduk leading his army of  |Anunnaki|Anunnaki|  into the sacred city of  |Nippur|Nippur|  and causing a disturbance. The disturbance causes a flood, which forces the resident gods of Nippur under the leadership of Enlil to take shelter in the Eshumesha temple to  |Ninurta|Ninurta| . Enlil is enraged at Marduks transgression and orders the gods of Eshumesha to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as prisoners. The Anunnaki are captured, but Marduk appoints his front-runner Mushteshirhablim to lead a revolt against the gods of Eshumesha and sends his messenger Neretagmil to alert  |Nabu|Nabu| , the god of literacy. When the Eshumesha gods hear Nabu speak, they come out of their temple to search for him. Marduk defeats the Eshumesha gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of war, including Enlil himself. Enlil protests that the Eshumesha gods are innocent, so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki. The text ends with a warning from Damkianna to the gods and to humanity, pleading them not to repeat the war between the Anunnaki and the gods of Eshumesha.
