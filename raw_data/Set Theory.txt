        Set theory is a branch of  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic|  that studies  |sets|Set| , which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all  |mathematical_objects|Mathematical_Object| .     The modern study of set theory was initiated by  |Georg_Cantor|Georg_Cantor|  and  |Richard_Dedekind|Richard_Dedekind|  in the 1870s. After the discovery of  |paradoxes|Paradoxes_Of_Set_Theory|  in  |naive_set_theory|Naive_Set_Theory| , such as  |Russells_paradox|Russells_Paradox| , numerous  |axiom_systems|Axiomatic_System|  were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which the  |Zermelo–Fraenkel_axioms|Zermelo–Fraenkel_Set_Theory| , with or without the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| , are the best-known.     Set theory is commonly employed as a  |foundational_system_for_mathematics|Foundations_Of_Mathematics| , particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Beyond its foundational role, set theory is a branch of  |mathematics|Mathematics|  in its own right, with an active research community. Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics, ranging from the structure of the  |real_number|Real_Number|  line to the study of the  |consistency|Consistency|  of  |large_cardinals|Large_Cardinal| .          Mathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers. Set theory, however, was founded by a single paper in 1874 by  |Georg_Cantor|Georg_Cantor| |On_a_Property_of_the_Collection_of_All_Real_Algebraic_Numbers|On_A_Property_Of_The_Collection_Of_All_Real_Algebraic_Numbers|  .       Since the 5th century BC, beginning with  |Greek|Greek_Mathematics|  mathematician  |Zeno_of_Elea|Zeno_Of_Elea|  in the West and early  |Indian_mathematicians|Indian_Mathematics|  in the East, mathematicians had struggled with the concept of  |infinity|Infinity| . Especially notable is the work of  |Bernard_Bolzano|Bernard_Bolzano|  in the first half of the 19th century.  Modern understanding of infinity began in 1870–1874 and was motivated by Cantors work in  |real_analysis|Real_Analysis| . . An 1872 meeting between Cantor and  |Richard_Dedekind|Richard_Dedekind|  influenced Cantors thinking and culminated in Cantors 1874 paper.     Cantors work initially polarized the mathematicians of his day. While  |Karl_Weierstrass|Karl_Weierstrass|  and Dedekind supported Cantor,  |Leopold_Kronecker|Leopold_Kronecker| , now seen as a founder of  |mathematical_constructivism|Mathematical_Constructivism| , did not. Cantorian set theory eventually became widespread, due to the utility of Cantorian concepts, such as  |one-to-one_correspondence|One-To-One_Correspondence|  among sets, his proof that there are more  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  than integers, and the infinity of infinities  resulting from the  |power_set|Power_Set|  operation. This utility of set theory led to the article Mengenlehre contributed in 1898 by  |Arthur_Schoenflies|Arthur_Schoenflies|  to  |Kleins_encyclopedia|Kleins_Encyclopedia| .     The next wave of excitement in set theory came around 1900, when it was discovered that some interpretations of Cantorian set theory gave rise to several contradictions, called  |antinomies|Antinomy|  or  |paradoxes|Logical_Paradox| .  |Bertrand_Russell|Bertrand_Russell|  and  |Ernst_Zermelo|Ernst_Zermelo|  independently found the simplest and best known paradox, now called  |Russells_paradox|Russells_Paradox| |cardinal_number|Cardinal_Number|  of the set of all sets? , and obtained a related paradox. Russell used his paradox as a theme in his 1903 review of continental mathematics in his  The Principles of Mathematics .     In 1906 English readers gained the book Theory of Sets of Points  by husband and wife  |William_Henry_Young|William_Henry_Young|  and  |Grace_Chisholm_Young|Grace_Chisholm_Young| , published by  |Cambridge_University_Press|Cambridge_University_Press| .     The momentum of set theory was such that debate on the paradoxes did not lead to its abandonment. The work of  |Zermelo|Zermelo|  in 1908 and the work of  |Abraham_Fraenkel|Abraham_Fraenkel|  and  |Thoralf_Skolem|Thoralf_Skolem|  in 1922 resulted in the set of axioms  |ZFC|Zfc| , which became the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory. The work of  |analysts|Real_Analysis|  such as  |Henri_Lebesgue|Henri_Lebesgue|  demonstrated the great mathematical utility of set theory, which has since become woven into the fabric of modern mathematics. Set theory is commonly used as a foundational system, although in some areas—such as algebraic geometry and algebraic topology— |category_theory|Category_Theory|  is thought to be a preferred foundation.            Set theory begins with a fundamental  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|  between an object  and a set . If  is a  member   of , the notation  is used. A set is described by listing elements separated by commas, or by a characterizing property of its elements, within braces . Since sets are objects, the membership relation can relate sets as well.     A derived binary relation between two sets is the subset relation, also called set inclusion. If all the members of set  are also members of set , then  is a  subset  of , denoted . For example,  is a subset of , and so is  but  is not. As insinuated from this definition, a set is a subset of itself. For cases where this possibility is unsuitable or would make sense to be rejected, the term  proper subset  is defined.  is called a proper subset of  if and only if  is a subset of , but  is not equal to . Also 1, 2, and 3 are members of the set  but are not subsets of it; and in turn, the subsets, such as , are not members of the set .     Just as  |arithmetic|Arithmetic|  features  |binary_operations|Binary_Operation|  on  |numbers|Number| , set theory features binary operations on sets.  The:    Union  of the sets  and , denoted , is the set of all objects that are a member of , or , or both. The union of  and  is the set .    Intersection  of the sets  and , denoted , is the set of all objects that are members of both  and . The intersection of  and  is the set .    Set difference  of  and , denoted , is the set of all members of  that are not members of . The set difference  is , while, conversely, the set difference  is . When  is a subset of , the set difference  is also called the  complement  of  in . In this case, if the choice of  is clear from the context, the notation  is sometimes used instead of , particularly if  is a  |universal_set|Universal_Set|  as in the study of  |Venn_diagrams|Venn_Diagram| .    Symmetric difference  of sets  and , denoted  or , is the set of all objects that are a member of exactly one of  and  . For instance, for the sets  and , the symmetric difference set is . It is the set difference of the union and the intersection,  or .    Cartesian product  of  and , denoted , is the set whose members are all possible  |ordered_pairs|Ordered_Pair|   where  is a member of  and  is a member of . The cartesian product of   Power set  of a set  is the set whose members are all of the possible subsets of . For example, the power set of  is .     Some basic sets of central importance are the  |empty_set|Empty_Set|  , the set of  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number| , and the set of  |real_numbers|Real_Number| .               A set is  |pure|Pure_Set|  if all of its members are sets, all members of its members are sets, and so on. For example, the set  containing only the empty set is a nonempty pure set. In modern set theory, it is common to restrict attention to the  von Neumann universe  of pure sets, and many systems of axiomatic set theory are designed to axiomatize the pure sets only. There are many technical advantages to this restriction, and little generality is lost, because essentially all mathematical concepts can be modeled by pure sets. Sets in the von Neumann universe are organized into a  |cumulative_hierarchy|Cumulative_Hierarchy| , based on how deeply their members, members of members, etc. are nested. Each set in this hierarchy is assigned  an  |ordinal_number|Ordinal_Number|    , known as its rank. The rank of a pure set X is defined to be the  |least_upper_bound|Least_Upper_Bound|  of all  |successors|Successor_Ordinal|  of ranks of members of X . For example, the empty set is assigned rank 0, while the set  containing only the empty set is assigned rank 1. For each ordinal   , the set V is defined to consist of all pure sets with rank less than   . The entire von Neumann universe is denoted   V .       Elementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using  |Venn_diagrams|Venn_Diagram| . The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are  |Russells_paradox|Russells_Paradox|  and the  |Burali-Forti_paradox|Burali-Forti_Paradox| . Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes.
