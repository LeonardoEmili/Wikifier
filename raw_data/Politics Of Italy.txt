   The politics of Italy are conducted through a  |parliamentary_republic|Parliamentary_Republic|  with a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| .  |Italy|Italy|  has been a  |democratic_republic|Democratic_Republic|  since 2 June 1946, when  |the_monarchy|Kingdom_Of_Italy|  was abolished by  |popular_referendum|1946_Italian_Institutional_Referendum|  and a  |constituent_assembly|Constituent_Assembly_Of_Italy|  was elected to draft a  |constitution|Constitution_Of_Italy| , which was promulgated on 1 January 1948.      |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the  |Council_of_Ministers|Council_Of_Ministers| , which is led by the  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Italy| , officially referred to as President of the Council .  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested primarily in the  |two_houses|Bicameralism|  of  |Parliament|Italian_Parliament|  and secondarily in the Council of Ministers, which can introduce bills and holds the majority in both houses. The  |judiciary|Judiciary_Of_Italy|  is  |independent|Judicial_Independence|  of the executive and the legislative branches. It is headed by the  |High_Council_of_the_Judiciary|High_Council_Of_The_Judiciary| , a body presided over by the  |President|President_Of_Italy| , who is the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| , though this position is separate from all branches. The current president is  |Sergio_Mattarella|Sergio_Mattarella| , and the current prime minister is  |Giuseppe_Conte|Giuseppe_Conte| .     The  |Economist_Intelligence_Unit|Economist_Intelligence_Unit|  rated Italy as a  |flawed_democracy|Democracy_Index|  in 2017.  A high degree of fragmentation and instability, leading to often short-lived  |coalition_governments|Coalition_Government| , is characteristic of Italian politics. , The Economist . ,  |Stratfor|Stratfor|  . Since the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Italy has had 61 governments. Eric J. Lyman, , The Guardian .               Article 1 of the  |Italian_Constitution|Italian_Constitution|  states: Italy is a democratic Republic, founded on labour. Sovereignty belongs to the people and is exercised by the people in the forms and within the limits of the Constitution.      By stating that Italy is a  |democratic_republic|Democratic_Republic| , the article solemnly declares the results of the  |constitutional_referendum|1946_Italian_Constitutional_Referendum|  which took place on 2 June 1946. The  |State|Italy|  is not a hereditary property of the  |ruling_monarch|King_Of_Italy| , but it is instead a  Res Publica , belonging to everyone.     The people who are called to temporarily administer the republic are not owners, but servants; and the governed are not  |subjects|Commoners| , but  |citizens|Citizenship| . And the  |sovereignty|Sovereignty| , that is the power to make choices that involve the entire community, belongs to the people, in accordance with the concept of a  |democracy|Democracy| , from the Greek demos and kratìa . However, this power is not to be exercised  |arbitrarily|Rule_Of_The_Mob| , but in the forms and within the limits established by the  |rule_of_law|Rule_Of_Law| .             As the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| , the president of the Republic represents the unity of the nation and has many of the duties previously given to the  |King_of_Italy|King_Of_Italy| . The president serves as a point of connection between the three branches as he is elected by the lawmakers, appoints the executive and is the president of the judiciary. The president is also commander-in-chief in the time of war.     The president of the Republic is elected for seven years by Parliament in joint session.            With article 48 of the  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Italythe_Parliament_.28Articles_55-82.29| , which guarantees the  |right_to_vote|Right_To_Vote| , the people exercise their power through their  |elected_representatives|Elected_Representatives|  in the  |Parliament|Italian_Parliament| . The  |Parliament|Italian_Parliament|  has a  |bicameral_system|Bicameralism| , and consists of the  |Chamber_of_deputies|Italian_Chamber_Of_Deputies|  and the  |Senate|Italian_Senate| , elected every five years.             The  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Italythe_Government_.28Articles_92-100.29|  establishes the Government of  |Italy|Italy|  as composed of the president of the council  and ministers. The  |President_of_Italy|President_Of_Italy|  appoints the prime minister and, on his proposal, the ministers that form its  |cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Italy| .            The  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Italythe_Judicial_Branch_.28Articles_101-113.29|  states that  |justice|Justice|  is administered in the name of the people and that  |judges|Judge|  are subject only to the  |law|Law| . So the  |judiciary|Judiciary|  is a branch that is completely autonomous and independent of  |all_other_branches_of_power|Separation_Of_Powers| , even though the  |Minister_of_Justice|Ministry_Of_Justice|  is responsible for the organization and functioning of those services involved with  |justice|Justice|  and has the power to originate disciplinary actions against  |judges|Judge| , which are then administered by the  |High_Council_of_the_Judiciary|High_Council_Of_The_Judiciary| , presided over by the  |President|President_Of_Italy| .     The Italian judicial system is based on  |Roman_law|Roman_Law| , the  |Napoleonic_code|Napoleonic_Code|  and later  |statutes|Statute| . It is based on a mix of the  |adversarial|Adversarial_System|  and  |inquisitorial|Inquisitorial_System| |civil_law|Civil_Law|  systems, although the  |adversarial_system|Adversarial_System|  was adopted in the Appeal Courts in 1988. Appeals are treated almost as new trials, and three degrees of trial are present. The third is a legitimating trial.      In November 2014, Italy accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| . , International Court of Justice.          All Italian citizens older than 18 can vote, but to vote for the Senate the voter must be at least 25 or older.                                  Italys dramatic self-renewal transformed the political landscape between 1992 and 1997. Scandal investigations touched thousands of politicians, administrators and businessmen; the shift from a proportional to an  |Additional_Member_System|Additional_Member_System|  also altered the political landscape. Party changes were sweeping. The Christian Democratic party dissolved; the Italian Peoples Party and the Christian Democratic Center emerged. Other major parties, such as the Socialists, saw support plummet. A new  |liberal|Liberalism|  movement,  |Forza_Italia|Forza_Italia| , gained wide support among moderate voters. The  |National_Alliance|National_Alliance|  broke from the  |Italian_Social_Movement|Italian_Social_Movement|  . A trend toward two large coalitions emerged from the April 1995 regional elections. For the 1996 national elections, the center-left parties created the  |Olive_Tree|The_Olive_Tree|  coalition while the center-right united again under the  |House_of_Freedoms|House_Of_Freedoms| . These coalitions continued into the 2001 and 2007 national elections. Geoffrey Pridham, Political Parties and Coalitional Behaviour in Italy ,          This emerging bipolarity represents a major break from the fragmented, multi-party political landscape of the postwar era, although it appears to have reached a plateau since efforts via referendums to further curtail the influence of small parties were defeated in 1999, 2000 and 2009. Günther Pallaver et al. eds. Populism, Populists, and the Crisis of Political Parties: A Comparison of Italy, Austria, and Germany 1990-2015           Five regions  have special charters granting them varying degrees of autonomy. The raisons dêtre of these charters is in most cases the presence of  |significant_linguistic_and_cultural_minorities|Languages_Of_Italyhistorical_Linguistic_Minorities| , but in the case of Sicily it was to calm down separatist movements. The other 15 regions were in practice established in 1970, even if their ideation had been a much earlier idea.                      There have been frequent government turnovers since 1945, indeed there have been 61 governments in this time. Pasta and fries .The Economist Volume 382, Number 8517 The dominance of the  |Christian_Democratic|Christian_Democracy|  party during much of the postwar period lent continuity and comparative stability to Italys political situation, mainly dominated by the attempt of keeping the  |Italian_Communist_Party|Italian_Communist_Party|  out of power in order to maintain  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  equilibrium in the region . Frederic Spotts and Theodor Wieser, eds. Italy: A Difficult Democracy: A Survey of Italian Politics .     The communists were in the government only in the national unity governments before 1948, in which their partys secretary  |Palmiro_Togliatti|Palmiro_Togliatti|  was minister of Justice. After the  |first_democratic_elections|1948_Italian_General_Election|  with  |universal_suffrage|Universal_Suffrage|  in 1948 in which the Christian Democracy and their allies won against the popular front of the Italian Communist and  |Socialists|Italian_Socialist_Party|  parties, the Communist Party never returned in the government.     Even though many repeat the cliché that Italy had over fifty governments in its first fifty years of democracy to stigmatise its alleged political instability, Italys main political problem was actually the opposite as in all the course of the so-called First Republic the government was in the hands of the Christian Democrats and their allies since it was unacceptable for a communist party to rule a Western country during the  |Cold_war|Cold_War| . The system had been nicknamed the imperfect bipolarism , referring to more proper bipolarism in other western countries where right-wing and left-wing parties alternated in government.       The main event in the First Republic in the 1960s was the inclusion of the Socialist party in the government after the reducing edge of the  |Christian_Democracy|Christian_Democracy|  had forced them to accept this alliance; attempts to incorporate the  |Italian_Social_Movement|Italian_Social_Movement|  , a right party, in the  |Tambroni|Fernando_Tambroni|  government led to  |riots|Riot|  and were short-lived.      |Aldo_Moro|Aldo_Moro| , a relatively left-leaning Christian Democrat, inspired this alliance. He would later try to include the Communist Party as well with a deal called the  |historic_compromise|Historic_Compromise|  . However, this attempt at compromise was stopped by the  |kidnap|Kidnap| ping and  |murder|Murder|  of Moro in 1978 by the  |Red_Brigades|Red_Brigades| , an extremist left-wing  |terrorist|Terrorism|  organization.     The Communist Party was at this point the largest communist party in Western Europe and remained such for the rest of its existence. Their ability to attract members was largely due to their pragmatic stance, especially their rejection of extremism and to their growing independence from  |Moscow|Moscow|  . The Italian communist party was especially strong in areas like  |Emilia-Romagna|Emilia-Romagna|  and  |Tuscany|Tuscany| , where communists had been elected to stable government positions. This practical political experience may have contributed to their taking a more pragmatic approach to politics. Joan Barth Urban,  Moscow and the Italian Communist Party: From Togliatti to Berlinguer .             On 12 December 1969, a roughly decade-long period of extremist left- and right-wing political terrorism, known as The Years of Lead , began with the  |Piazza_Fontana_bombing|Piazza_Fontana_Bombing|  in the center of  |Milan|Milan| . Neofascist  |Vincenzo_Vinciguerra|Vincenzo_Vinciguerra|  later declared the bombing to be an attempt to push the Italian state to declare a  |state_of_emergency|State_Of_Emergency|  in order to lead to a more authoritative state. A bomb left in a bank killed about twenty and was initially blamed on  |anarchist|Anarchism| |Giuseppe_Pinelli|Giuseppe_Pinelli| . This accusation was hotly contested by left-wing circles, especially the  |Maoist|Maoist|  Student Movement, which had support in those years from some students of Milans  |universities|University|  and who considered the bombing to have all the marks of a fascist operation. Their guess proved correct, but only after many years of difficult investigations. David Moss, The Politics of Left-Wing Violence in Italy, 1969-85     The  |strategy_of_tension|Strategy_Of_Tension|  attempted to blame the left for bombings carried out by right-wing terrorists. Fascist black terrorists , such as  Ordine Nuovo  and the  Avanguardia Nazionale , were in the 1980s and 1990s found to be responsible for several terrorist attacks. On the other extreme of the political spectrum, the leftist Red Brigades carried out assassinations against specific persons, but were not responsible for any blind bombings. The Red Brigades killed socialist journalist  |Walter_Tobagi|Walter_Tobagi|  and in their most famous operation kidnapped and assassinated  |Aldo_Moro|Aldo_Moro| , president of the  |Christian_Democracy|Christian_Democracy| , who was trying to involve the  |Communist_Party|Italian_Communist_Party|  in the government through the  compromesso storico  , to which the radical left as well as Washington were opposed. Robert C. Meade Jr.. Red Brigades: The Story of Italian Terrorism     The last and largest of the bombings, known as the  |Bologna_massacre|Bologna_Massacre| , destroyed the citys railway station in 1980. This was found to be a neofascist bombing, in which  |Propaganda_Due|Propaganda_Due|  was involved. On 24 October 1990, Prime Minister  |Giulio_Andreotti|Giulio_Andreotti|  revealed to the Parliament the existence of  |Gladio|Gladio| ,  |NATOs|Nato|  secret stay-behind networks which stocked weapons in order to facilitate an armed resistance in case of a communist coup. In 2000, a Parliament Commission report from the  |Olive_Tree|Olive_Tree|  coalition concluded that the strategy of tension followed by Gladio had been supported by the United States to stop the PCI and, to a certain degree, the PSI from reaching executive power in the country . Leonard Weinberg, Italian neo‐fascist terrorism: A comparative perspective. Terrorism and Political Violence 7.1 : 221-238.       With the end of the lead years, the Communist Party gradually increased their votes under the leadership of  |Enrico_Berlinguer|Enrico_Berlinguer| . The  |Italian_Socialist_Party|Italian_Socialist_Party| , led by  |Bettino_Craxi|Bettino_Craxi| , became more and more critical of the communists and of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| ; Craxi himself pushed in favor of  |Ronald_Reagans|Ronald_Reagan|  positioning of  |Pershing_II|Pershing_Ii|  missiles in Italy, a move many communists strongly disapproved of.     As the Socialist Party moved to more moderate positions, it attracted many reformists, some of whom were irritated by the failure of the communists to modernize. Increasingly, many on the left began to see the communists as old and out of fashion while Craxi and the socialists seemed to represent a new liberal socialism. The Communist Party surpassed the Christian Democrats only in the  |European_elections_of_1984|1984_European_Parliament_Election_In_Italy| , held barely two days after Berlinguers death, a passing that likely drew sympathy from many voters. The election of 1984 was to be the only time the Christian Democrats did not emerge as the largest party in a nationwide election in which they participated.     In 1987, one year after the  |Chernobyl_disaster|Chernobyl_Disaster|  following a referendum in that year, a nuclear phase-out was commenced. Italys  |four_nuclear_power_plants|List_Of_Nuclear_Reactorsitaly|  were closed down, the last in 1990. A moratorium on the construction of new plants, originally in effect from 1987 until 1993, has since been extended indefinitely.      In these years,  |corruption|Political_Corruption|  began to be more extensive, a development that would be exposed in the early 1990s and nicknamed  Tangentopoli . With the  mani pulite  investigation, starting just one year after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the whole power structure faltered and seemingly indestructible parties, such as the Christian Democrats and the Socialist Party, disbanded whereas the Communist Party changed its name to the  |Democratic_Party_of_the_Left|Democratic_Party_Of_The_Left|  and took the role of the Socialist Party as the main  |social_democratic|Social_Democracy|  party in Italy. What was to follow was then called the transition to the Second Republic.          From 1992 to 1997, Italy faced significant challenges as voters, disenchanted with past political paralysis, massive government debt, extensive corruption and organized crimes considerable influence, collectively called Tangentopoli after being uncovered by mani pulite, demanded political, economic and ethical reforms.     In the  |Italian_referendums|Referendums_In_Italy|  of 1993, voters approved substantial changes, including moving from a proportional to an  |Additional_Member_System|Additional_Member_System| , which is largely dominated by a  |majoritarian_electoral_system|First_Past_The_Post_Electoral_System|  and the abolition of some ministries, some of which have been reintroduced with only partly modified names, such as the Ministry of Agriculture reincarnated as the Ministry of Agricultural Resources.     Major political parties, beset by scandal and loss of voter confidence, underwent far-reaching changes. New political forces and new alignments of power emerged in the March 1994 national elections. This election saw a major turnover in the new parliament, with 452 out of 630 deputies and 213 out of 315 senators elected for the first time.             The 1994 elections also swept media magnate  |Silvio_Berlusconi|Silvio_Berlusconi|   into office as prime minister. However, Berlusconi was forced to step down in December 1994 when the  |Lega_Nord|Lega_Nord|  withdrew support. The Berlusconi government was succeeded by a  |technical_government|Technical_Government|  headed by Prime Minister  |Lamberto_Dini|Lamberto_Dini| , which left office in early 1996.     A series of center-left coalitions dominated Italys political landscape between 1996 and 2001. In April 1996, national elections led to the victory of a center-left coalition,  |The_Olive_Tree|The_Olive_Tree| , under the leadership of  |Romano_Prodi|Romano_Prodi| . Prodis government became the third-longest to stay in power before he narrowly lost a vote of confidence, by three votes, in October 1998.     In May 1999, the Parliament selected  |Carlo_Azeglio_Ciampi|Carlo_Azeglio_Ciampi|  as the  |President_of_the_Republic|List_Of_Presidents_Of_The_Italian_Republic| . Ciampi, a former prime minister and Minister of the Treasury and before entering the government also the governor of the  |Bank_of_Italy|Banca_Ditalia| , was elected on the first ballot by a comfortable margin over the required two-thirds of the votes.     A new government was formed by the  |Democrats_of_the_Left|Democrats_Of_The_Left|  leader and former communist  |Massimo_DAlema|Massimo_Dalema| , but in April 2000 he resigned following poor performance by his coalition in regional elections.     The succeeding center-left government, including most of the same parties, was headed by  |Giuliano_Amato|Giuliano_Amato| , a social democrat, who had previously served as prime minister in 1992–1993 and had at the time sworn never to return to active politics.     National elections held on 13 May 2001 returned Berlusconi to power at the head of the five-party center-right  |House_of_Freedoms|House_Of_Freedoms|  coalition, comprising the Prime Ministers own party,  |Forza_Italia|Forza_Italia| , the  |National_Alliance|National_Alliance| , the  |North_League|Lega_Nord| , the  |Christian_Democratic_Center|Christian_Democratic_Center|  and the  |United_Christian_Democrats|United_Christian_Democrats| .     Between 17 May 2006 and 21 February 2007, Romano Prodi served as prime minister of Italy following the narrow victory of his The Union coalition over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi in the April 2006 Italian elections. Following a government crisis, Prodi submitted his resignation on 21 February 2007. Three days later, he was asked by President  |Giorgio_Napolitano|Giorgio_Napolitano|  to stay on as prime minister and he agreed to do so. On 28 February 2007, Prodi narrowly survived a senate  |no_confidence_vote|No_Confidence_Vote| .      On 24 January 2008, the  |Prodi_II_Cabinet|Prodi_Ii_Cabinet|  went through a  |new_crisis|2008_Italian_Political_Crisis|  because  |Minister_of_Justice|Italian_Minister_Of_Justice| |Clemente_Mastella|Clemente_Mastella|  retracted his support to the Cabinet. Consequently, the Prodi Cabinet lost the  |vote_of_confidence|Vote_Of_Confidence|  and the President Giorgio Napolitano called  |a_new_general_election|2008_Italian_General_Election| .     The election set against two new parties, the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|   led by  |Walter_Veltroni|Walter_Veltroni| |The_People_of_Freedom|The_People_Of_Freedom|  led by Silvio Berlusconi. The Democratic Party was in alliance with  |Italy_of_Values|Italy_Of_Values|  while The People of Freedom forged an alliance with Lega Nord and the  |Movement_for_Autonomy|Movement_For_Autonomy| . The coalition led by Berlusconi won the election and the leader of the centre-right created the  |Berlusconi_IV_Cabinet|Berlusconi_Iv_Cabinet| .     The Monti government had the highest average age in the western world , with its youngest members being 57. The previous Italian Prime Minister  |Mario_Monti|Mario_Monti|  is 70, his predecessor Silvio Berlusconi was 75 at the time of resignation , the previous head of the government Romano Prodi was 70 when he stepped down , the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano is 88 and his predecessor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was 86. In 2013, the youngest among the candidates for prime minister  is 62, the others being 70 and 78. The current average age of Italian university professors is 63, of bank directors and CEOs 67, of members of parliament 56 and of labor union representatives 59.         The new Italian government headed by  |Enrico_Letta|Enrico_Letta|  took two months to form and made international news when Luigi Preiti shot at policemen near the building where they were swearing in the new government on Sunday 28 April 2013.     Former Prime Minister  |Matteo_Renzi|Matteo_Renzi|  became the youngest prime minister at 39 years and his government had the youngest average age in Europe.       At different times since his entering the Italian Parliament, Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centre-right, had repeatedly vowed to stop the communists , while leftist parties had insisted that they would oust Berlusconi. Thus, despite the fact that the executive branch bears responsibility toward the Parliament, the governments led by Mario Monti and by Enrico Letta were called unelected governments    because they won a vote of confidence by a Parliament coalition formed by centre-right and left-right parties that had in turn obtained parliamentary seats by taking part in the elections as competitors, rather than allies. While formally complying with law and procedures, the creation of these governments did not comply with the decision made by people through the election.     Meanwhile, in 2013, a ruling by the  |Constitutional_Court_of_Italy|Constitutional_Court_Of_Italy|  established that the Italian electoral system employed to elect the Parliament breached a number of Constitutional requirements.  Notably, the Court observed the following four facts:  1 .
