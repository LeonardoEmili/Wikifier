                    Avram Noam Chomsky is an American  |linguist|Linguist| ,  |philosopher|Philosopher| ,  |cognitive_scientist|Cognitive_Scientist| ,  |historian|Historian| ,  |social_critic|Social_Criticism| , and  |political_activist|Activism| . Sometimes called the father of modern linguistics , Chomsky is also a major figure in  |analytic_philosophy|Analytic_Philosophy|  and one of the founders of the field of  |cognitive_science|Cognitive_Science| . He holds a joint appointment as  |Institute_Professor|Institute_Professor|  Emeritus at the  |Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology|  and  |Laureate|Laureate|  Professor at the  |University_of_Arizona|University_Of_Arizona| , and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as  |linguistics|Linguistics| , war, politics, and  |mass_media|Mass_Media| . Ideologically, he aligns with  |anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-Syndicalism|  and  |libertarian_socialism|Libertarian_Socialism| .       Born to  |Jewish|Jews|  immigrants in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| , Chomsky developed an early interest in  |anarchism|Anarchism|  from alternative bookstores in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| . He studied at the  |University_of_Pennsylvania|University_Of_Pennsylvania| . During his  |postgraduate|Postgraduate|  work in the  |Harvard_Society_of_Fellows|Harvard_Society_Of_Fellows| , Chomsky developed the theory of  |transformational_grammar|Transformational_Grammar|  for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work  Syntactic Structures , which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a  |National_Science_Foundation|National_Science_Foundation|  fellow at the  |Institute_for_Advanced_Study|Institute_For_Advanced_Study| . He created or co-created the  |universal_grammar|Universal_Grammar|  theory, the  |generative_grammar|Generative_Grammar|  theory, the  |Chomsky_hierarchy|Chomsky_Hierarchy| , and the  |minimalist_program|Minimalist_Program| . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of  |behaviorism|Behaviorism| , and was particularly critical of the work of  |B._F._Skinner|B._F._Skinner| .       An outspoken  |opponent_of_U.S._involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War|Opponent_Of_U.S._Involvement_In_The_Vietnam_War| , which he saw as an act of  |American_imperialism|American_Imperialism| , in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay  |The_Responsibility_of_Intellectuals|The_Responsibility_Of_Intellectuals|  . Associated with the  |New_Left|New_Left| , he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President  |Richard_Nixons|Richard_Nixon| |Enemies_List|Nixons_Enemies_List| . While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the  |linguistics_wars|Linguistics_Wars| . In collaboration with  |Edward_S._Herman|Edward_S._Herman| , Chomsky later articulated the  |propaganda_model|Propaganda_Model|  of  |media_criticism|Media_Criticism|  in  Manufacturing Consent  and worked to expose the  |Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor|Indonesian_Occupation_Of_East_Timor| . His defense of  |freedom_of_speech|Freedom_Of_Speech| , including  |Holocaust_denial|Holocaust_Denial| , generated significant controversy in the  |Faurisson_affair|Faurisson_Affair|  of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the  |2003_invasion_of_Iraq|2003_Invasion_Of_Iraq|  and supporting the  |Occupy_movement|Occupy_Movement| . Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.       One of the most cited scholars alive, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the  |cognitive_revolution|Cognitive_Revolution|  in the  |human_sciences|Human_Sciences| , contributing to the development of a new  |cognitivistic|Cognitivism|  framework for the study of  |language|Language|  and the  |mind|Mind| . In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading  |critic|Criticism_Of_United_States_Foreign_Policy|  of  |U.S._foreign_policy|U.S._Foreign_Policy| ,  |neoliberalism|Neoliberalism|  and contemporary  |state_capitalism|State_Capitalism| , the  |Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian_Conflict| , and mainstream  |news_media|News_Media| . His ideas have proven highly influential in the  |anti-capitalist|Anti-Capitalist|  and  |anti-imperialist|Anti-Imperialist|  movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of  |anti-Americanism|Anti-Americanism| .         Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the  |East_Oak_Lane|East_Oak_Lane,_Philadelphia|  neighborhood of  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| ,  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania| . His parents,  |Zeev_William_Chomsky|Zeev_William_Chomsky|  and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants. William had fled the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in  |Baltimore|Baltimore| |sweatshops|Sweatshop|  and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university. After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the  |Congregation_Mikveh_Israel|Congregation_Mikveh_Israel|  religious school and joined the  |Gratz_College|Gratz_College|  faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all , a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son. Elsie was a teacher and activist born in  |Belarus|Belarus| . They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.     Noam was the Chomskys first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later, in 1934. The brothers were close, though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive. Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught  |Hebrew|Hebrew|  and regularly discussing the political theories of  |Zionism|Zionism| ; the family was particularly influenced by the  |Left_Zionist|Left_Zionist|  writings of  |Ahad_Haam|Ahad_Haam| . Chomsky faced  |antisemitism|Antisemitism|  as a child, particularly from Philadelphias Irish and German communities.     Chomsky attended the independent,  |Deweyite|Deweyite| |Oak_Lane_Country_Day_School|Oak_Lane_Country_Day_School|  and Philadelphias  |Central_High_School|Central_High_School| , where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies, but was troubled by the schools hierarchical and regimented teaching methods. He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College, where his father taught.     Chomsky has described his parents as normal  |Roosevelt_Democrats|Roosevelt_Democrats|  with  |center-left_politics|Center-Left_Politics| , but other relatives involved in the  |International_Ladies_Garment_Workers_Union|International_Ladies_Garment_Workers_Union|  exposed him to  |socialism|Socialism|  and  |far-left_politics|Far-Left_Politics| . He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs. Chomsky frequented left-wing and  |anarchist|Anarchist|  bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city, voraciously reading political literature. He wrote his first article at age 10 on the spread of  |fascism|Fascism|  following  |the_fall_of_Barcelona|Catalonia_Offensive|  during the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War|  and, from the age of 12 or 13, identified with anarchist politics. He later described his discovery of anarchism as a lucky accident  that made him critical of  |Stalinism|Stalinism|  and other forms of  |Marxism–Leninism|Marxism–Leninism| .            In 1945, aged 16, Chomsky began a general program of study at the  |University_of_Pennsylvania|University_Of_Pennsylvania| , where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning  |Arabic|Arabic| . Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew. Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered dropping out and moving to a  |kibbutz|Kibbutz|  in  |Mandatory_Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine| , but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist  |Zellig_Harris|Zellig_Harris| , whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject. Chomskys  |BA|Bachelor_Of_Arts|  honors thesis, Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew , applied Harriss methods to the language. Chomsky revised this thesis for his  |MA|Master_Of_Arts| , which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book. He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of  |Nelson_Goodman|Nelson_Goodman| .     From 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the  |Society_of_Fellows|Society_Of_Fellows|  at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation. Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply, Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher  |Willard_Van_Orman_Quine|Willard_Van_Orman_Quine|  was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher,  |J._L._Austin|J._L._Austin|  of the  |University_of_Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| , strongly influenced Chomsky. In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, Systems of Syntactic Analysis, which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in  The Journal of Symbolic Logic . Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the  |University_of_Chicago|University_Of_Chicago|  and  |Yale_University|Yale_University| . He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on  |transformational_grammar|Transformational_Grammar| ; he was awarded a  |Doctor_of_Philosophy|Doctor_Of_Philosophy|  degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of  The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory . Harvard professor  |George_Armitage_Miller|George_Armitage_Miller|  was impressed by Chomskys thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in  |mathematical_linguistics|Mathematical_Linguistics| . Chomskys doctorate exempted him from  |compulsory_military_service|Compulsory_Military_Service| , which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.     In 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with  |Carol_Doris_Schatz|Carol_Doris_Schatz| , whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949. After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to the  |Allston|Allston|  area of Boston and remained there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of  |Lexington|Lexington,_Massachusetts| . In 1953 the couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe, from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland into Italy, and Israel, where they lived in  |Hashomer_Hatzairs|Hashomer_Hatzair| |HaZorea|Hazorea| |kibbutz|Kibbutz| . Despite enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the countrys Jewish nationalism,  |anti-Arab_racism|Anti-Arab_Racism|  and, within the kibbutzs leftist community,  |pro-Stalinism|Pro-Stalinism| .     On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal  Fraye Arbeter Shtime  and became enamored with the ideas of  |Rudolf_Rocker|Rudolf_Rocker| , a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between  |anarchism|Anarchism|  and  |classical_liberalism|Classical_Liberalism| . Chomsky also read other political thinkers: the anarchists  |Mikhail_Bakunin|Mikhail_Bakunin|  and  |Diego_Abad_de_Santillán|Diego_Abad_De_Santillán| , democratic socialists  |George_Orwell|George_Orwell| ,  |Bertrand_Russell|Bertrand_Russell| , and  |Dwight_Macdonald|Dwight_Macdonald| , and works by Marxists  |Karl_Liebknecht|Karl_Liebknecht| ,  |Karl_Korsch|Karl_Korsch| , and  |Rosa_Luxemburg|Rosa_Luxemburg| . His readings convinced him of the desirability of an  |anarcho-syndicalist|Anarcho-Syndicalist|  society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War| , as documented in Orwells  Homage to Catalonia  . He read the leftist journal  Politics , which furthered his interest in anarchism, and the  |council_communist|Council_Communist|  periodical  Living Marxism , though he rejected the orthodoxy of its editor,  |Paul_Mattick|Paul_Mattick| . He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the  |Leninist_League_of_the_United_States|Leninist_League_Of_The_United_States| , an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their view that the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Unions  |state_capitalists|State_Capitalists|  to crush Europes  |proletariat|Proletariat| .       Chomsky befriended two linguists at the  |Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology|  ,  |Morris_Halle|Morris_Halle|  and  |Roman_Jakobson|Roman_Jakobson| , the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in 1955. At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a  |mechanical_translation|Mechanical_Translation|  project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy. He described MIT as a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.  In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of  |associate_professor|Associate_Professor| , and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University|  as a visiting professor. The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named  |Aviva|Aviva_Chomsky| . He also published his first book on linguistics,  Syntactic Structures , a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris– |Bloomfield|Leonard_Bloomfield|  trend in the field. Responses to Chomskys ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused significant upheaval in the discipline. The linguist  |John_Lyons|John_Lyons|  later asserted that Syntactic Structures revolutionized the scientific study of language . From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a  |National_Science_Foundation|National_Science_Foundation|  fellow at the  |Institute_for_Advanced_Study|Institute_For_Advanced_Study|  in  |Princeton,_New_Jersey|Princeton,_New_Jersey| .          In 1959 Chomsky published a review of  |B._F._Skinners|B._F._Skinner|  1957 book  Verbal Behavior  in the academic journal  Language , in which he argued against Skinners view of language as learned behavior. The review argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics and helped to establish Chomsky as an intellectual. With Halle, Chomsky proceeded to found MITs graduate program in linguistics. In 1961 he was awarded tenure, becoming a  |full_professor|Full_Professor|  in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics. Chomsky went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth  |International_Congress_of_Linguists|International_Congress_Of_Linguists| , held in 1962 in  |Cambridge,_Massachusetts|Cambridge,_Massachusetts| , which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics. Between 1963 and 1965 he consulted on a military-sponsored project to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control ;  |Barbara_Partee|Barbara_Partee| , a collaborator on this project and then-student of Chomsky, has said this research was justified to the military on the basis that in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.      Chomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in  Aspects of the Theory of Syntax  , Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar , and  Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought  . Along with Halle, he also edited the  Studies in Language  series of books for  |Harper_and_Row|Harper_And_Row| . As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work, Chomsky lectured at the  |University_of_California,_Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley| , in 1966. His Beckman lectures at  |Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley|  were assembled and published as  Language and Mind  in 1968. Despite his growing stature, an intellectual falling-out between Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students—including  |Paul_Postal|Paul_Postal| ,  |John_Haj_Ross|John_Haj_Ross| ,  |George_Lakoff|George_Lakoff| , and  |James_D._McCawley|James_D._Mccawley| —triggered a series of academic debates that came to be known as the  |Linguistics_Wars|Linguistics_Wars|  , although they revolved largely around philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.            Chomsky joined  |protests_against_U.S._involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War|Protests_Against_U.S._Involvement_In_The_Vietnam_War|  in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes. His 1967 critique of U.S. involvement,  |The_Responsibility_of_Intellectuals|The_Responsibility_Of_Intellectuals|  , among other contributions to  The New York Review of Books , debuted Chomsky as a public dissident. This essay and other political articles were collected and published in 1969 as part of Chomskys first political book,  American Power and the New Mandarins . He followed this with further political books, including At War with Asia , The Backroom Boys , For Reasons of State , and Peace in the Middle East? , published by  |Pantheon_Books|Pantheon_Books| . These publications led to Chomskys association with the American  |New_Left|New_Left|  movement, though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals  |Herbert_Marcuse|Herbert_Marcuse|  and  |Erich_Fromm|Erich_Fromm|  and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals. Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period.     He also became involved in left-wing activism. Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes, publicly supported students who  |refused_the_draft|Vietnam_War_Draft_Evaders| , and was arrested while participating an antiwar  |teach-in|Teach-In|  outside  |the_Pentagon|The_Pentagon| . During this time, Chomsky co-founded the antiwar collective  |RESIST|Resist|  with  |Mitchell_Goodman|Mitchell_Goodman| ,  |Denise_Levertov|Denise_Levertov| ,  |William_Sloane_Coffin|William_Sloane_Coffin| , and  |Dwight_Macdonald|Dwight_Macdonald| . Although he questioned the objectives of the  |1968_student_protests|1968_Student_Protests| , Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups and, with his colleague Louis Kampf, ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative-dominated  |political_science|Political_Science|  department. When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT, Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MITs oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense. In 1970 he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnams  |Hanoi_University_of_Science_and_Technology|Hanoi_University_Of_Science_And_Technology|  and toured war refugee camps in  |Laos|Laos| . In 1973 he helped lead a committee commemorating the 50th anniversary of the  |War_Resisters_League|War_Resisters_League| .          Because of his antiwar activism, Chomsky was arrested on multiple occasions and included on President  |Richard_Nixons_master_list_of_political_opponents|Richard_Nixons_Master_List_Of_Political_Opponents| . Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomskys imprisonment or joblessness. Chomskys scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs.     His work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he  |received_multiple_honorary_doctorates|List_Of_Honorary_Degrees_Awarded_To_Noam_Chomsky| . He delivered  |public_lectures|Public_Lectures|  at the  |University_of_Cambridge|University_Of_Cambridge| ,  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University|  , and  |Stanford_University|Stanford_University| . His appearance in a  |1971_debate|Chomsky–Foucault_Debate|  with French  |continental_philosopher|Continental_Philosopher| |Michel_Foucault|Michel_Foucault|  positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of  |analytic_philosophy|Analytic_Philosophy| . He continued to publish extensively on linguistics, producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar , an enlarged edition of  Language and Mind  , and  Reflections on Language  . In 1974 Chomsky became a  |corresponding_fellow_of_the_British_Academy|Corresponding_Fellow_Of_The_British_Academy| .             In the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomskys linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory. His political talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military. In the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with  |Edward_S._Herman|Edward_S._Herman| , who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam. Together they wrote  Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact & Propaganda , a book that criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream medias failure to cover it. Warner Modular published it in 1973, but  |its_parent_company|Warner_Communications|  disapproved of the books contents and ordered all copies destroyed.     While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from  |Michael_Alberts|Michael_Albert| |South_End_Press|South_End_Press| , an activist-oriented publishing company. In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Hermans revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume  The Political Economy of Human Rights , which compares U.S. media reactions to the  |Cambodian_genocide|Khmer_Rouge_Rule_Of_Cambodia|  and the  |Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor|Indonesian_Occupation_Of_East_Timor| . It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Chomskys response included two testimonials before the United Nations  |Special_Committee_on_Decolonization|Special_Committee_On_Decolonization| , successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in  |Lisbon|Lisbon| . The Marxist academic  |Steven_Lukes|Steven_Lukes|  publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader  |Pol_Pot|Pol_Pot| . The controversy damaged Chomskys reputation, and he maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies to defame him.     Chomsky had long publicly criticized  |Nazism|Nazism| , and  |totalitarianism|Totalitarianism|  more generally, but his commitment to  |freedom_of_speech|Freedom_Of_Speech|  led him to defend the right of French historian  |Robert_Faurisson|Robert_Faurisson|  to advocate a position widely characterized as  |Holocaust_denial|Holocaust_Denial| . Without Chomskys knowledge, his plea for Faurissons freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latters 1980 book . Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson, and Frances mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations. Critiquing Chomskys position, sociologist  |Werner_Cohn|Werner_Cohn|  later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers. The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomskys career, especially in France.            In 1985, during the  |Nicaraguan_Contra_War|Nicaraguan_Contra_War| —in which the U.S. supported the  |contra_militia|Contras|  against the  |Sandinista|Sandinista|  government—Chomsky traveled to  |Managua|Managua|  to meet with workers organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics. Many of these lectures were published in 1987 as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures. In 1983 he published  The Fateful Triangle , which argued that the U.S. had continually used the  |Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian_Conflict|  for its own ends. In 1988, Chomsky visited the  |Palestinian_territories|Palestinian_Territories|  to witness the impact of Israeli occupation.     In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published  Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media , in which they outlined their  |propaganda_model|Propaganda_Model|  for understanding mainstream media. They argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news is censored through five filters that have great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented. The book was inspired by  |Alex_Carey|Alex_Carey|  and adapted into  |a_1992_film|Manufacturing_Consent:_Noam_Chomsky_And_The_Media| . In 1989, Chomsky published Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, in which he suggests that democratic citizens, to make a worthwhile democracy, undertake intellectual self-defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them. By the 1980s, Chomskys students had become prominent linguists who, in turn, expanded and revised his linguistic theories.     In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before. Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance. The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in 1996. As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist  |John_Pilger|John_Pilger| . After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in 1999, the Australian-led  |International_Force_for_East_Timor|International_Force_For_East_Timor|  arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timors oil and gas reserves under the  |Timor_Gap_Treaty|Timor_Gap_Treaty| .            After the  |September_11_attacks|September_11_Attacks|  in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed;  |Seven_Stories_Press|Seven_Stories_Press|  collated and published these interviews that October. Chomsky argued that the ensuing  |War_on_Terror|War_On_Terror|  was not a new development but a continuation of U.S. foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era. He gave the  |D.T._Lakdawala|D.T._Lakdawala|  Memorial Lecture in  |New_Delhi|New_Delhi|  in 2001, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists. Chomskys 2003  Hegemony or Survival  articulated what he called the United States imperial  |grand_strategy|Grand_Strategy|  and critiqued the  |Iraq_War|Iraq_War|  and other aspects of the War on Terror. Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period.     Chomsky retired from MIT in 2002, but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an  |emeritus|Emeritus| . That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomskys books; Chomsky insisted on being a  |co-defendant|Co-Defendant|  and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day. During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds human rights. A supporter of the  |World_Social_Forum|World_Social_Forum| , he attended its conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.     Chomsky supported the  |Occupy_movement|Occupy_Movement| , delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence:  |Occupy|Occupy|  , a pamphlet, and Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity . He attributed Occupys growth to a perception that the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  had abandoned the interests of the white working class. In March 2014, Chomsky joined the advisory council of the  |Nuclear_Age_Peace_Foundation|Nuclear_Age_Peace_Foundation| , an organization that advocates the global  |abolition_of_nuclear_weapons|Abolition_Of_Nuclear_Weapons| , as a senior fellow. The 2016 documentary  Requiem for the American Dream  summarizes his views on capitalism and  |economic_inequality|Economic_Inequality|  through a 75-minute  |teach-in|Teach-In|  .          In 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the  |University_of_Arizona|University_Of_Arizona|  in Tucson and was later hired as a part-time professor in the linguistics department there, with his duties including teaching and public seminars. His salary is covered by philanthropic donations.     Chomsky signed the  |Declaration_on_the_Common_Language|Declaration_On_The_Common_Language|  of the  |Croats|Croats| ,  |Serbs|Serbs| ,  |Bosniaks|Bosniaks|  and  |Montenegrins|Montenegrins|  in 2018.            The basis of Chomskys linguistic theory lies in  |biolinguistics|Biolinguistics| , the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited. As such he argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences. In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the  |radical_behaviorist|Radical_Behaviorism|  psychology of  |B._F._Skinner|B._&_Nbsp;F._Skinner| , who viewed behavior as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments. Accordingly, Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species. Chomskys  |nativist|Psychological_Nativism| , internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of  |rationalism|Rationalism|  and contrasts with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of  |empiricism|Empiricism|  , which contends that all knowledge, including language, comes from external stimuli.            Since the 1960s Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain language-specific features of their  |native_languages|Native_Language| . He bases his argument on observations about human  |language_acquisition|Language_Acquisition| , noting that there is a  |poverty_of_the_stimulus|Poverty_Of_The_Stimulus|  —enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich  |linguistic_competence|Linguistic_Competence|  they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable  |syntactic_variants|Sentence|  within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce  |an_infinite_number_of_sentences|Digital_Infinity| , including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an  |innate_linguistic_capacity|Innate_Linguistic_Capacity| . Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of  |inductive_reasoning|Inductive_Reasoning| , if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the  |language_acquisition_device|Language_Acquisition_Device| , and suggested that one of linguists tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute universal grammar . Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language, the lack of universal characteristics between languages, and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages.             |Transformational-generative_grammar|Transformational-Generative_Grammar|  is a broad theory used to model, encode, and deduce a native speakers linguistic capabilities. These models, or  |formal_grammars|Formal_Grammars|  , show the abstract structures of a specific language as they may relate to structures in other languages. Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid-1950s, whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades. Transformations refers to syntactic relationships within language, e.g., being able to infer that the subject between two sentences is the same person. Chomskys theory posits that language consists of both  |deep_structures_and_surface_structures|Deep_Structures_And_Surface_Structures| |mathematical_notation|Mathematical_Notation|  to express the rules that govern the connection between meaning and sound . By this theory, linguistic principles can  |mathematically_generate|Generative_Grammar|  potential sentences structures in a language. Scholar  |Michael_Tomasello|Michael_Tomasello|  has challenged Chomskys theory as based in logic and not empiricism.          Based on this rule-based notation of grammars,  Chomsky grouped natural languages into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types, together known as the  |Chomsky_hierarchy|Chomsky_Hierarchy| . This classification was and remains foundational to  |formal_language_theory|Formal_Language_Theory| , and relevant to  |theoretical_computer_science|Theoretical_Computer_Science| , especially  |programming_language_theory|Programming_Language_Theory| ,  |compiler|Compiler|  construction, and  |automata_theory|Automata_Theory| .     Following transformational grammars heyday through the mid-1970s, a derivative  |government_and_binding_theory|Government_And_Binding_Theory|  became a dominant research framework through the early 1990s   when linguists turned to a minimalist approach to grammar. This research focused on the  |principles_and_parameters|Principles_And_Parameters|  framework, which explained childrens ability to learn any language by filling open parameters that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data. The minimalist program, initiated by Chomsky, asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly, naturally, and simply. In an attempt to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties, Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as deep structure and surface structure and instead emphasizes the plasticity of the brains neural circuits, with which come an infinite number of concepts, or  |logical_forms|Logical_Form|  . When exposed to linguistic data, a hearer-speakers brain proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way language works. Thus while much of Chomskys prior research focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms the brain uses to generate these rules and regulate speech.                 Chomsky is a prominent  |political_dissident|Political_Dissident| . His political views have changed little since his childhood, when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition. He usually identifies as an  |anarcho-syndicalist|Anarcho-Syndicalist|  or a  |libertarian_socialist|Libertarian_Socialist| . He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs: liberty, community, and freedom of association. Unlike some other socialists, such as Marxists, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science, but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.     In Chomskys view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite  |corporatocracy|Corporatocracy| , which uses corporate media, advertising, and  |think_tanks|Think_Tanks|  to promote its own  |propaganda|Propaganda| . His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure. Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by common sense , critical thinking, and understanding the roles of self-interest and self-deception, and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding. He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his  |social_privilege|Social_Privilege| , resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.     Although he has joined protest marches and organized activist groups, Chomskys primary political outlets are education and publication. He offers a wide range of political writings as well as free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness. He is a member of the  |Industrial_Workers_of_the_World|Industrial_Workers_Of_The_World|  international union.            Chomsky has been a prominent critic of  |American_imperialism|American_Imperialism| ; he believes that the basic principle of the  |foreign_policy_of_the_United_States|Foreign_Policy_Of_The_United_States|  is the establishment of open societies that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper. He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power. When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective. He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading  |Christianity|Christianity| ; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them. Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.     Chomskys political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States. He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its  |liberal_democratic|Liberal_Democracy|  electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies. He urges people to criticize their governments motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.     Chomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the  |Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian_Conflict| , arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement. Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in  |Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen|Saudi_Arabian-Led_Intervention_In_Yemen| , highlighting that Saudi Arabia has one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world .            In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of  |capitalism|Capitalism|  and the pursuit of material wealth. At the same time, he developed a disdain for  |authoritarian_socialism|Authoritarian_Socialism| , as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union. Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control . He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic, because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy. He has stated his opposition to  |ruling_elites|Ruling_Elites| , among them institutions like the  |IMF|Imf| ,  |World_Bank|World_Bank| , and  |GATT|Gatt| .     Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s,  |the_U.S._has_become_increasingly_economically_unequal|Wealth_Inequality_In_The_United_States|  as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the  |Bretton_Woods_financial_control_agreement|Bretton_Woods_Financial_Control_Agreement| . He characterizes the U.S. as a de facto  |one-party_state|One-Party_State| , viewing both the  |Republican_Party|Republican_Party|  and  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  as manifestations of a single Business Party controlled by corporate and financial interests. Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.     Noting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably. Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in womens rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the populations welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.     Chomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the  |classical_liberal|Classical_Liberal|  ideas of the  |Age_of_Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment| , arguing that his ideological position revolves around nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being . He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the  |means_of_production|Means_Of_Production|  and government by  |workers_councils|Workers_Council| , who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies. The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in  |Thomas_Jeffersons|Thomas_Jefferson|  words, a direct participator in the government of affairs.  He believes that there will be no need for  |political_parties|Political_Parties| . By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose. He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.            Chomsky has written prolifically on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aiming to raise public awareness of it. He has long endorsed a left binationalist program in Israel and Palestine, seeking to create a democratic state in the  |Levant|Levant|  that is home to both Jews and Arabs. Nevertheless, given the  |realpolitik|Realpolitik|  of the situation, he has also considered a  |two-state_solution|Two-State_Solution|  on the condition that the nation-states exist on equal terms. Chomsky was denied entry to the  |West_Bank|West_Bank|  in 2010 because of  |his_criticisms_of_Israel|Political_Positions_Of_Noam_Chomskychomsky_And_The_Middle_East| . He had been invited to deliver a lecture at  |Bir_Zeit_University|Bir_Zeit_University|  and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister  |Salam_Fayyad|Salam_Fayyad| . An  |Israeli_Foreign_Ministry|Israeli_Foreign_Ministry|  spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake.                 Chomskys political writings have largely focused on  |ideology|Ideology| ,  |social_and_political_power|Social_And_Political_Power| , the media, and state policy. One of his best-known works,  Manufacturing Consent , dissects the medias role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided free market forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union. As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests. Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass medias choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the states ideology: although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part. As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators. He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of  |Black_Panther|Black_Panther_Party| |Fred_Hampton|Fred_Hampton|  with possible  |FBI|Fbi|  involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded  |Contras|Contras| , and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict. To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.     Chomsky considers most  |conspiracy_theories|Conspiracy_Theories|  fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives. While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether  |General_Motors|General_Motors|  would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.       Chomsky has also been active in a number of  |philosophical|Philosophy|  fields, including  |philosophy_of_mind|Philosophy_Of_Mind| ,  |philosophy_of_language|Philosophy_Of_Language| , and  |philosophy_of_science|Philosophy_Of_Science| . In these fields he is credited with ushering in the  |cognitive_revolution|Cognitive_Revolution|  , a significant  |paradigm_shift|Paradigm_Shift|  that rejected  |logical_positivism|Logical_Positivism| , the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about  |language|Language|  and the  |mind|Mind| . Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century  |rationalist|Rationalism|  ideals. His position—the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought—has more in common with rationalism than behaviorism. He named one of his key works  |Cartesian_Linguistics:_A_Chapter_in_the_History_of_Rationalist_Thought|Cartesian_Linguistics|  . In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.     Chomskys famous  |1971_debate|Chomsky–Foucault_Debate|  on  |human_nature|Human_Nature|  with the French philosopher  |Michel_Foucault|Michel_Foucault|  was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical  |analytic_philosopher|Analytic_Philosopher|  against Foucault, a stalwart of the  |continental|Continental_Philosopher|  tradition. It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucaults position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity. Chomsky criticized  |postmodernism|Postmodernism|  and  |French_philosophy|French_Philosophy|  generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes. He has also debated analytic philosophers, including  |Tyler_Burge|Tyler_Burge| ,  |Donald_Davidson|Donald_Davidson| ,  |Michael_Dummett|Michael_Dummett| ,  |Saul_Kripke|Saul_Kripke| ,  |Thomas_Nagel|Thomas_Nagel| ,  |Hilary_Putnam|Hilary_Putnam| ,  |Willard_Van_Orman_Quine|Willard_Van_Orman_Quine| , and  |John_Searle|John_Searle| .     Chomskys contributions span  |intellectual|Intellectual_History|  and world history, including history of philosophy. Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.            Chomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another, calling himself scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom . An intensely private person, he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him. He also has little interest in modern art and music. McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so. Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the worlds population; nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a worker , albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill. He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to  The Boston Globe ,  The New York Times ,  The Wall Street Journal ,  Financial Times , and  The Christian Science Monitor . Chomsky is  |non-religious|Non-Religious| , but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as  |liberation_theology|Liberation_Theology| .     Chomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures corrupt , fascist , and fraudulent . His colleague  |Steven_Pinker|Steven_Pinker|  has said that he portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric , and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics. Chomsky avoids attending  |academic_conferences|Academic_Conferences| , including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences. His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that  |Walt_Rostow|Walt_Rostow| , a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened to protest publicly if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser  |John_Deutch|John_Deutch|  applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, He has more honesty and integrity than anyone Ive ever met. ... If somebodys got to be running the CIA, Im glad its him.      Chomsky was married to  |Carol|Carol_Chomsky|   from 1949 until her death in 2008. They had three children together:  |Aviva|Aviva_Chomsky|  , Diane , and Harry . In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.            Chomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure through the late 20th century, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology. In addition to being known as the most important intellectual of his time, Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a leader in the field of linguistics and a figure of enlightenment and inspiration for  |political_dissent|Political_Dissent| ers. Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being on the outer margin of acceptability . The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.       McGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the  |cognitive_revolution|Cognitive_Revolution|  in linguistics, and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal,  |natural_science|Natural_Science| , moving it away from the procedural form of  |structural_linguistics|Structural_Linguistics|  dominant during the mid-20th century. As such, some have called Chomsky the father of modern linguistics . Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become the most dynamic and influential school of thought in the field. By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy, and a  |Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead|Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead|  poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in  |cognitive_science|Cognitive_Science| . In addition, his work in  |automata_theory|Automata_Theory|  and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in  |computer_science|Computer_Science| , and he is much cited in  |computational_linguistics|Computational_Linguistics| .     Chomskys criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of  |behaviorist_psychology|Behaviorist_Psychology| ; in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science. Some arguments in  |evolutionary_psychology|Evolutionary_Psychology|  are derived from his research results;  |Nim_Chimpsky|Nim_Chimpsky| , a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in  |animal_language_acquisition|Animal_Language_Acquisition|  at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.      |ACM_Turing_Award|Acm_Turing_Award|  winner  |Donald_Knuth|Donald_Knuth|  credited Chomskys work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.  |IBM|Ibm|  computer scientist  |John_Backus|John_Backus| , another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomskys concepts to help him develop  |FORTRAN|Fortran| , the first widely used high-level  |computer_programming_language|Computer_Programming_Language| . The laureates of the 1984  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  —  |Georges_J._F._Köhler|Georges_J._F._Köhler| ,  |César_Milstein|César_Milstein| , and  |Niels_Kaj_Jerne|Niels_Kaj_Jerne|  — used Chomskys generative model to explain the human immune system, equating components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures.  Chomskys theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in  |music_theory|Music_Theory|  and  |analysis|Musical_Analysis| .     An MIT press release stated that Chomsky was cited within the  |Arts_and_Humanities_Citation_Index|Arts_And_Humanities_Citation_Index|  more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992. Chomsky was also extensively cited in the  |Social_Sciences_Citation_Index|Social_Sciences_Citation_Index|  and  |Science_Citation_Index|Science_Citation_Index|  during the same time period, with the librarian who conducted the research commenting that the statistics show that he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines ... it seems that you cant write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky.  As a result of his influence, there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan linguistics, with the disputes between the two camps often acrimonious.       Chomskys status as the most-quoted living author is credited to his political writings, which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics. Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes him as one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people ; journalist  |John_Pilger|John_Pilger|  has described him as a genuine peoples hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins—activists and movements—hes unfailingly supportive.   |Arundhati_Roy|Arundhati_Roy|  has called him one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time , and  |Edward_Said|Edward_Said|  thought him one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions .  |Fred_Halliday|Fred_Halliday|  has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a guru for the worlds anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements. The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media, also exerting a significant influence on the growth of  |alternative_media|Alternative_Media| , including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.     Sperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press. University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomskys work on their undergraduate syllabi. Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many  |social_scientists|Social_Science|  claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so. According to McGilvray, many of Chomskys critics do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomskys text .     Chomsky drew criticism for not calling the  |Srebrenica_massacre|Srebrenica_Massacre|  during the  |Bosnian_War|Bosnian_War|  a genocide , which he said would devalue the word, and in appearing to deny  |Ed_Vulliamys|Ed_Vulliamy|  reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.     Chomskys far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a  |Freedom_of_Information_Act|Freedom_Of_Information_Act|  request from the U.S. government revealed that the  |Central_Intelligence_Agency|Central_Intelligence_Agency|  monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law. He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection. German newspaper  Der Spiegel  described Chomsky as the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred , while  |conservative|American_Conservatism|  commentator  |David_Horowitz|David_Horowitz|  called him the most devious, the most dishonest and  ... the most treacherous intellect in America , whose work is infused with anti-American dementia and evidences his pathological hatred of his own country . Writing in  Commentary  magazine, the journalist  |Jonathan_Kay|Jonathan_Kay|  described Chomsky as a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says .     Chomskys criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an  |anti-Semite|Anti-Semitism| . Criticizing Chomskys defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints,  |Werner_Cohn|Werner_Cohn|  called Chomsky the most important patron of the  |neo-Nazi|Neo-Nazism|  movement. The  |Anti-Defamation_League|Anti-Defamation_League|  , which has been accused of monitoring Chomskys activities, called him a Holocaust denier, describing him as a dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims . In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by Stalinist types who oppose democracy in Israel. The lawyer  |Alan_Dershowitz|Alan_Dershowitz|  has called Chomsky a false prophet of the left ; Chomsky called Dershowitz a complete liar who is on a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation . In early 2016 President  |Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan|Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan|  of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an  |open_letter|Open_Letter|  condemning Erdoğan for his  |anti-Kurdish_repression|Kurdish–Turkish_Conflict_2015_Pkk_Rebellion|  and double standards on terrorism. Chomsky accused Erdoğan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdoğan supports  |al-Qaedas|Al-Qaeda|  Syrian affiliate, the  |al-Nusra_Front|Al-Nusra_Front| .               In 1970, the London  Times  named Chomsky one of the makers of the twentieth century . He was voted the worlds leading  |public_intellectual|Public_Intellectual|  in  |The_2005_Global_Intellectuals_Poll|The_2005_Global_Intellectuals_Poll|  jointly conducted by American magazine  Foreign Policy  and British magazine  |Prospect|Prospect| .  New Statesman  readers listed Chomsky among the worlds foremost heroes in 2006.     In the United States he is a  |Member_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences|Member_Of_The_National_Academy_Of_Sciences| , the  |American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|American_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences| , the  |Linguistic_Society_of_America|Linguistic_Society_Of_America| , the  |American_Philosophical_Association|American_Philosophical_Association| , and the  |American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science|American_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Science| . Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the  |British_Academy|British_Academy| , an honorary member of the  |British_Psychological_Society|British_Psychological_Society| , a member of the  |Deutsche_Akademie_der_Naturforscher_Leopoldina|Deutsche_Akademie_Der_Naturforscher_Leopoldina| , and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the  |Serbian_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Arts|Serbian_Academy_Of_Sciences_And_Arts| . He received a 1971  |Guggenheim_Fellowship|Guggenheim_Fellowship| , the 1984  |American_Psychological_Association_Award_for_Distinguished_Contributions_to_Psychology|American_Psychological_Association_Award_For_Distinguished_Contributions_To_Psychology| , the 1988  |Kyoto_Prize_in_Basic_Sciences|Kyoto_Prize_In_Basic_Sciences| , the 1996  |Helmholtz_Medal|Helmholtz_Medal| , the 1999  |Benjamin_Franklin_Medal_in_Computer_and_Cognitive_Science|Benjamin_Franklin_Medal| , the 2010  |Erich_Fromm_Prize|Erich_Fromm_Prize| , and the  |British_Academys|British_Academy|  2014  |Neil_and_Saras_Smith_Medal_for_Linguistics|Neil_And_Saras_Smith_Medal_For_Linguistics| .
