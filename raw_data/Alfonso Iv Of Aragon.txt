   Alfonso IV, called the Kind  was the  |King_of_Aragon|King_Of_Aragon|  and  |Count_of_Barcelona|Count_Of_Barcelona|  from 1327 to his death. His reign saw the incorporation of the  |County_of_Urgell|County_Of_Urgell| ,  |Duchy_of_Athens|Duchy_Of_Athens| , and  |Duchy_of_Neopatria|Duchy_Of_Neopatria|  into the  |Crown_of_Aragon|Crown_Of_Aragon| .       Alfonso was born in  |Naples|Naples| , the second son of  |James_II|James_Ii_Of_Aragon|  and  |Blanche_of_Anjou|Blanche_Of_Anjou| . In 1314, aged 14, he married  |Teresa_dEntença_y_Cabrera|Teresa_Dentença_Y_Cabrera| , heiress of  |Urgell|Urgell| , who was the same age as him. Teresas granduncle  |Ermengol_X_of_Urgell|Ermengol_X_Of_Urgell|  had died childless in  |La_Llitera|La_Llitera| ; before his death, he had agreed to make Alfonso his heir, on condition that Alfonso would marry Teresa, who was his nearest kin. Alfonso was at this time only the second son of the king of Aragon. He and his father readily agreed to Ermengols condition, and Alfonso married Teresa in 1314 in the Cathedral of  |Lerida|Lerida| . The teenage bridegroom is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. Alfonso and Teresa became the parents of seven children.     Alfonso became heir to the throne in December 1319 after his older brother  |James|James_Of_Aragon|  renounced his rights to become a monk. During the reign of his father, Alfonso was the procurator-general of the Crown, and in 1323–1324, he undertook the  |conquest_of_Sardinia|Aragonese_Conquest_Of_Sardinia| .     Alfonsos father and first wife Teresa died within a few days of each other in 1327. Teresa died in childbirth on 20 October 1327, and James II died on 2 November 1327, whereupon Alfonso became king. In 1329, he began a long war with the  |Republic_of_Genoa|Republic_Of_Genoa| . The city of  |Sassari|Sassari|  ahd previously surrendered to Alfonso in 1323, but rebelled three more times; its possession was contested by Genoa, which led to the protracted war.     In February 1329, Alfonso married  |Eleanor_of_Castile|Eleanor_Of_Castile|  , the sister of king  |Alfonso_XI_of_Castile|Alfonso_Xi_Of_Castile| . Eleanor had been briefly married to Alfonsos elder brother  |James_the_monk|James_Of_Aragon| . That marriage, which James had refused to consummate, had been annulled in 1319-20. Eleanor had thereafter retired to a convent and had remained unmarried. By December the same year, the couple were rejoiced to become the parents of a son, Ferdinand, who was followed five years later by another son, John.     Eleanor earnestly sought to advance the interests of her own infant sons over those of her stepson, the Infante  |Peter|Peter_Iv_Of_Aragon| , who was the heir-apparent. She convinced her husband to grant very large and significant territories to her sons. on 28 December 1329, Alfonso granted his new-born son Ferdinand the Marquisate of  |Tortosa|Tortosa|  and the cities of  |Albarracín|Albarracín| ,  |Orihuela|Orihuela| ,  |Callosa_den_Sarrià|Callosa_Den_Sarrià| ,  |Guardamar|Guardamar_De_La_Safor| ,  |Alicante|Alicante| ,  |Monforte|Monforte_Del_Cid| ,  |Elda|Elda| , La Mola,  |Novelda|Novelda|  and  |Aspe|Aspe| . Eleanors younger son John, who was born five years later, was also granted several lordships when he was only a toddler:  |Elche|Elche| ,  |Biel|Biel,_Aragon|  and Bolsa were all bestowed upon him. These territories would be controlled by Eleanor, who had also received the city of  |Huesca|Huesca|  and some other villages and castles belonging to the Aragonese crown at the time of her wedding. Nor was this all. While all of the above grants had been made from among the possessions of the Aragonese crown, the King also sought to bestow estates located within the  |Kingdom_of_Valencia|Kingdom_Of_Valencia|  upon the toddler Ferdinand, but he was prevented from doing so. When the King granted Ferdinand the cities of  |Xàtiva|Xàtiva| ,  |Alzira|Alzira,_Valencia| ,  |Sagunto|Sagunto| ,  |Morella|Morella,_Castellón| ,  |Burriana|Borriana,_Castellón|  and  |Castellón_de_la_Plana|Castellón_De_La_Plana| , all located in the  |Kingdom_of_Valencia|Kingdom_Of_Valencia| , the local subjects protested, and for this reason the King decided to revoked these patents. These grants of land diminished the territorial patrimony of the crown and mainly affected the Infante Peter, Alfonsos son by his first wife, who however was too young to make any significant protest. However, the issue agitated the court, created a climate of resentment and divided the nobility into two camps.     Alfonso died in January 1336, aged only 36. He was succeeded by  |Peter_IV|Peter_Iv_Of_Aragon| , his 16-year-old son from his first marriage.          By  |Teresa_dEntença|Teresa_Dentença| |Constance|Constance_Of_Aragon,_Queen_Of_Majorca|  , married in 1336 to  |James_III_of_Majorca|James_Iii_Of_Majorca| .  |Peter_IV|Peter_Iv_Of_Aragon|  , successor.  |James_I,_Count_of_Urgell|James_I_Of_Urgell|  , also inherited Entença and Antillon.  |Eleanor_of_Castile|Eleanor_Of_Castile| |Ferdinand|Ferdinand,_Prince_Of_Aragon|  , Marquis of Tortosa and Lord of Albarracín and Fraga; married  |Maria,_Marchioness_of_Tortosa|Maria,_Marchioness_Of_Tortosa| .   John , Lord of Elche, Biel and Bolsa, married in 1355 to  |Isabel_Núñez_de_Lara|Isabel_Núñez_De_Lara|   and was killed by order of his cousin  |Pedro_of_Castile|Pedro_Of_Castile| .
