Harry Clement Stubbs , better known by the  |pen_name|Pen_Name|  Hal Clement, was an  |American|American_People| |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  writer and a leader of the  |hard_science_fiction|Hard_Science_Fiction|  subgenre. He also painted astronomically oriented artworks under the name George Richard.     In 1998 Clement was inducted by the  |Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Hall_of_Fame|Emp_Museumscience_Fiction_Hall_Of_Fame|   and named the 17th  |SFWA_Grand_Master|Sfwa_Grand_Master|  by the  |Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Writers_of_America|Science_Fiction_And_Fantasy_Writers_Of_America|  .            Harry Clement Stubbs was born in  |Somerville,_Massachusetts|Somerville,_Massachusetts|  on May 30, 1922.     He went to  |Harvard|Harvard_University| , graduating with a B.S. in  |astronomy|Astronomy|  in 1943. While there he wrote his first published story, Proof , which appeared in the June 1942 issue of  Astounding Science Fiction , edited by  |John_W._Campbell|John_W._Campbell| ; three more appeared in later 1942 numbers. His further educational background includes an M.Ed.  and M.S. in  |chemistry|Chemistry|  .     During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  Clement was a pilot and copilot of a  |B-24_Liberator|B-24_Liberator|  and flew 35 combat missions over Europe with the 68th Bomb Squadron,  |44th_Bomb_Group|44Th_Operations_Group| , based in England with  |8th_Air_Force|Eighth_Air_Force| . After the war, he served in the  |United_States_Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force| |Reserve|Air_Force_Reserve_Command| , and retired with the rank of colonel. He taught chemistry and astronomy for many years at  |Milton_Academy|Milton_Academy|  in  |Milton,_Massachusetts|Milton,_Massachusetts| .     From 1949 to 1953, Clements first three novels were two-, three-, and four-part Astounding serials under Campbell:  Needle  ,  Iceworld  , and  Mission of Gravity  , his best-known novel, published by Doubledays Science Fiction Book Club . The latter novel features a land and sea expedition across the  |superjovian|Supergiant_Planet|  planet  |Mesklin|Mesklin|  to recover a stranded scientific probe. The natives of Mesklin are  |centipede|Centipede| -like intelligent beings about 50 centimeters long. Various episodes hinge on the fact that Mesklins fast rotational speed causes it to be considerably deformed from the spherical, with effective surface gravity that varies from approximately 3  g  n at the equator to approximately 700 g n at the poles.     Clements article Whirligig World describes his approach to writing a science fiction story:     Writing a science fiction story is fun, not work. ...the fun...lies in treating the whole thing as a game.... e rules must be quite simple. They are; for the reader of a science-fiction story, they consist of finding as many as possible of the authors statements or implications which conflict with the facts as science currently understands them. For the author, the rule is to make as few such slips as he possibly can... Certain exceptions are made but fair play demands that all such matters be mentioned as early as possible in the story...     Clement was a frequent guest at science fiction conventions, especially in the eastern United States, where he usually presented talks and slide shows about writing and astronomy.     Clement died in Massachusetts at the  |Milton_Hospital|Milton_Hospital|  on October 29, 2003 at age 81. He died in his sleep, most likely due to complications of  |diabetes|Diabetes| .         Clement has been honored several times for his cumulative contributions including 1998 Hall of Fame induction, when Clement and  |Frederik_Pohl|Frederik_Pohl|  were the fifth and sixth living persons honored, and the 1999 SFWA Grand Master Award.     For the 1945 short story  |Uncommon_Sense|Uncommon_Sense|  he received a 50-year  |Retro_Hugo_Award|Retro_Hugo_Award|  at the 1996  |World_Science_Fiction_Convention|World_Science_Fiction_Convention| . Mission of Gravity, first published as a serial during 1953, was named best foreign novel by the Spanish Science Fiction Association in 1994 and it was a finalist for a 50-year Retro Hugo Award in 2004.     The Hal Clement Award for Young Adults for Excellence in Childrens Science Fiction Literature is presented in his memory at  |Worldcon|Worldcon|  each year. . Golden Duck Awards . Archived 2008-05-25. Retrieved 2014-08-14.      |Wayne_Barlowe|Wayne_Barlowe|  illustrated two of Clements fictional species, the Abyormenites and the Mesklinites, in his  Barlowes Guide to Extraterrestrials .          Planets created by Clement typically feature unique astronomical or physical aspects. They include:     Abyormen – A planet circling a  |dwarf_star|Dwarf_Star|  , which in turn circles a  |blue_giant|Blue_Giant| . This produces a hot and a cold season, each of 65  years duration. The native intelligent life forms undergo a seasonal mass death. From Cycle of Fire.   Dhrawn – A high-gravity world settled by Mesklinites in Star Light.   Habranha - A planet that is tidally locked with its sun, such that the dark side is a mix of solid  |CO_2|Carbon_Dioxide| , solid  |methane|Methane| , and ice, and the sunlit side completely ocean, in  Fossil .   Hekla – An ice-age planet in Cold Front .   Kaihapa – An uninhabited  |ocean_planet|Ocean_Planet| , twin of Kainui, in Noise.   Kainui – An inhabited  |ocean_planet|Ocean_Planet|  in Noise.    |Mesklin|Mesklin|  — A planet with ultra-high gravity  in  Mission of Gravity . Clement later corrected his model of Mesklin and determined that the maximum surface gravity would be only 250 gravities .   Sarr – An extremely hot planet with an atmosphere of gaseous sulfur, and little liquid , in  Iceworld   |critical_point|Critical_Point| , in  Close to Critical .   Enigma 88 - A small planet near  |η_Carinae|Eta_Carinae|  in Still River. The interior of the object is honeycombed with caves, due to evaporation of accreted ice-rich planetoids. Unusually for Clement, Enigmas structure is not fully consistent with the laws of physics.            Astounding .
