Davy was taught French by a refugee priest, and in 1797 read Lavoisiers Traité élémentaire de chimie: much of his future work can be seen as reacting against Lavoisiers work and the dominance of French chemists.     As a poet, over one hundred and sixty manuscript poems were written by Davy, the majority of which are found in his personal notebooks. Most of his written poems were not published, and he chose instead to share a few of them with his friends. Eight of his known poems were published.

On the generation of oxygen gas, and the causes of the colors of organic beings. Their experimental work was poor, and the publications were harshly criticized. In after years Davy regretted he had ever published these immature hypotheses, which he subsequently designated the dreams of misemployed genius which the light of experiment and observation has never conducted to truth.     These criticisms, however, led Davy to refine and improve his experimental techniques, spending his later time at the institution increasingly in experimentation.   In 1800, Davy informed Gilbert that he had been repeating the galvanic experiments with success in the intervals of the experiments on the gases, which almost incessantly occupied him from January to April.

        ". Davy wrote to Davies Gilbert on 8 March 1801 about the offers made by Banks and Thompson, a possible move to London and the promise of funding for his work in galvanism. He also mentioned that he might not be collaborating further with Beddoes on therapeutic gases. The next day Davy left Bristol to take up his new post at the Royal Institution, it having been resolved that Humphry Davy be engaged in the service of the Royal Institution in the capacity of assistant lecturer in chemistry, director of the chemical laboratory, and assistant editor of the journals of the institution, and that he be allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished with coals and candles, and that he be paid a salary of 100l. per annum.     On 25 April 1801, Davy gave his first lecture on the relatively new subject of Galvanism. He and his friend Coleridge had had many conversations about the nature of human knowledge and progress, and Davys lectures gave his audience a vision of human civilisation brought forward by scientific discovery. It has bestowed on him powers which may almost be called creative; which have enabled him to modify and change the beings surrounding him, and by his experiments to interrogate nature with power, not simply as a scholar, passive and seeking only to understand her operations, but rather as a master, active with his own instruments. The first lecture garnered rave reviews, and by the June lecture Davy wrote to John King that his last lecture had attendance of nearly 500 people. There was Respiration, Nitrous Oxide, and unbounded Applause. Amen!   Davy revelled in his public status.     Davys lectures included spectacular and sometimes dangerous chemical demonstrations along with scientific information, and were presented with considerable showmanship by the young and handsome man.    Davy also included both poetic and religious commentary in his lectures, emphasizing that Gods design was revealed by chemical investigations. Religious commentary was in part an attempt to appeal to women in his audiences. Davy, like many of his enlightenment contemporaries, supported female education and womens involvement in scientific pursuits, even proposing that women be admitted to evening events at the Royal Society.   Davy acquired a large female following around London. In a satirical cartoon by Gillray, nearly half of the attendees pictured are female. His support of women caused Davy to be subjected to considerable gossip and innuendo, and to be criticized as unmanly.

They were aware that Davy supported some modernisation, but thought that he would not sufficiently encourage aspiring young mathematicians, astronomers and geologists, who were beginning to form specialist societies. Davy was only 41, and reformers were fearful of another long presidency.     In his early years Davy was optimistic about reconciling the reformers and the Banksians. In his first speech as president he declared, I trust that, with these new societies, we shall always preserve the most amicable relations ... I am sure there is no desire in to exert anything like patriarchal authority in relation to these institutions . Cited in David Philip Miller, Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davys presidency of the Royal Society of London , British Journal for the History of Science : 30-31.     Davy spent much time juggling the factions but, as his reputation declined in the light of failures such as his research into copper-bottomed ships, he lost popularity and authority. This was compounded by a number of political errors. In 1825 his promotion of the new Zoological Society, of which he was a founding fellow, courted the landed gentry and alienated expert zoologists. He offended the mathematicians and reformers by failing to ensure that Babbage received one of the new Royal Medals or the vacant secretaryship of the Society in 1826. In November 1826 the mathematician Edward Ryan recorded that: The Society, every member almost ... are in the greatest rage at the Presidents proceedings and nothing is now talked of but removing him.

As is shown by his verses and sometimes by his prose, his mind was highly imaginative; the poet Coleridge declared that if he had not been the first chemist, he would have been the first poet of his age , and Southey said that he had all the elements of a poet; he only wanted the art. In spite of his ungainly exterior and peculiar manner, his happy gifts of exposition and illustration won him extraordinary popularity as a lecturer, his experiments were ingenious and rapidly performed, and Coleridge went to hear him to increase his stock of metaphors. The dominating ambition of his life was to achieve fame; occasional petty jealousy did not diminish his concern for the cause of humanity , to use a phrase often employed by him in connection with his invention of the miners lamp. Careless about etiquette, his frankness sometimes exposed him to annoyances he might have avoided by the exercise of tact.      According to one of Davys biographers, ": null
