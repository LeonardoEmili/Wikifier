In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an ordered pair  is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair  is different from the ordered pair  unless a b.      Ordered pairs are also called  |2-tuples|Tuple| , or  |sequences|Sequence|  of length 2; ordered pairs of  |scalars|Scalar|  are also called 2-dimensional  |vectors|Vector| .   The entries of an ordered pair can be other ordered pairs, enabling the recursive definition of ordered  |n-tuples|N-Tuple|  . For example, the ordered triple  can be defined as , i.e., as one pair nested in another.     In the ordered pair , the object a is called the first entry, and the object b the second entry of the pair. Alternatively, the objects are called the first and second components, the first and second coordinates, or the left and right projections of the ordered pair.      |Cartesian_products|Cartesian_Product|  and  |binary_relations|Binary_Relation|   are defined in terms of ordered pairs.       Let and be ordered pairs. Then the characteristic  property of the ordered pair is:     :   a1 a2  b2.     The  |set|Set|  of all ordered pairs whose first entry is in some set A and whose second entry is in some set B is called the  |Cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|  of A and B, and written A × B. A  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|  between sets A and B is a  |subset|Subset|  of A × B.     The  notation may be used for other purposes, most notably as denoting  |open_intervals|Open_Interval|  on the  |real_number_line|Real_Number_Line| . In such situations, the context will usually make it clear which meaning is intended.   For additional clarification, the ordered pair may be denoted by the variant notation   a,b  , but this notation also has other uses.       The left and right projection of a pair p is usually denoted by  1  and  2 , or by  ℓ  and  r , respectively.   In contexts where arbitrary n-tuples are considered,  is a common notation for the i-th component of an n-tuple t.         In some introductory mathematics textbooks an informal definition of ordered pair is given, such as     For any two objects  and , the ordered pair  is a notation specifying the two objects  and , in that order.      This is usually followed by a comparison to a set of two elements; pointing out that in a set  and  must be different, but in an ordered pair they may be equal and that while the order of listing the elements of a set doesnt matter, in an ordered pair changing the order of distinct entries changes the ordered pair.     This definition is unsatisfactory because it is only descriptive and is based on an intuitive understanding of order. However, as is sometimes pointed out, no harm will come from relying on this description and almost everyone thinks of ordered pairs in this manner.      A more satisfactory approach is to observe that the characteristic property of ordered pairs given above is all that is required to understand the role of ordered pairs in mathematics. Hence the ordered pair can be taken as a  |primitive_notion|Primitive_Notion| , whose associated axiom is the characteristic property. This was the approach taken by the  |N._Bourbaki|Nicolas_Bourbaki|  group in its Theory of Sets, published in 1954. However, this approach also has its drawbacks as both the existence of ordered pairs and their characteristic property must be axiomatically assumed.     Another way to rigorously deal with ordered pairs is to define them formally in the context of set theory. This can be done in several ways and has the advantage that existence and the characteristic property can be proven from the axioms that define the set theory. One of the most cited versions of this definition is due to Kuratowski and his definition was used in the second edition of Bourbakis Theory of Sets, published in 1970. Even those mathematical textbooks that give an informal definition of ordered pairs will often mention the formal definition of Kuratowski in an exercise.         If one agrees that  |set_theory|Set_Theory|  is an appealing  |foundation_of_mathematics|Foundations_Of_Mathematics| , then all mathematical objects must be defined as  |sets|Set|  of some sort. Hence if the ordered pair is not taken as primitive, it must be defined as a set.  |Quine|Willard_Van_Orman_Quine|  has argued that the set-theoretical implementations of the concept of the ordered pair is a paradigm for the clarification of philosophical ideas .   The general notion of such definitions or implementations are discussed in Thomas Forster Reasoning about theoretical entities .   Several set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair are given below.        |Norbert_Wiener|Norbert_Wiener|  proposed the first set theoretical definition of the ordered pair in 1914: Wieners paper A Simplification of the logic of relations is reprinted, together with a valuable commentary on pages 224ff in van Heijenoort, Jean , From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1979–1931, Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA,  . van Heijenoort states the simplification this way: By giving a definition of the ordered pair of two elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes .   :   :       He observed that this definition made it possible to define the  |types|Type_Theory|  of  Principia Mathematica  as sets. Principia Mathematica had taken types, and hence  |relations|Relation|  of all arities, as  |primitive|Primitive_Notion| .     Wiener used  instead of  to make the definition compatible with  |type_theory|Type_Theory|  where all elements in a class must be of the same type . With b nested within an additional set, its type is equal to   s.       About the same time as Wiener ,  |Felix_Hausdorff|Felix_Hausdorff|  proposed his definition:   : :     where 1 and 2 are two distinct objects different from a and b. cf introduction to Wieners paper in van Heijenoort 1967:224       In 1921  |Kazimierz_Kuratowski|Kazimierz_Kuratowski|  offered the now-accepted definition cf introduction to Wieners paper in van Heijenoort 1967:224. van Heijenoort observes that the resulting set that represents the ordered pair has a type higher by 2 than the elements ; he offers references that show how, under certain circumstances, the type can be reduced to 1 or 0.    of the ordered pair p, the property x is the first coordinate of p can be formulated as:   :   Y  p:x  Y.   The property x is the second coordinate of p can be formulated as:   :     In the case that the left and right coordinates are identical, the right  |conjunct|Conjunct|  is trivially true, since Y 1 ≠ Y 2 is never the case.     This is how we can extract the first coordinate of a pair a and b.   The reverse definition is merely a trivial variant of the Kuratowski definition, and as such is of no independent interest. The definition short is so-called because it requires two rather than three pairs of  |braces|Braces| . Proving that short satisfies the characteristic property requires the  |Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel_Set_Theory| |axiom_of_regularity|Axiom_Of_Regularity| .

Moreover, if one uses  |von_Neumanns_set-theoretic_construction_of_the_natural_numbers|Von_Neumann_Ordinal| , then 2 is defined as the set , which is indistinguishable from the pair short . Yet another disadvantage of the short pair is the fact, that even if a and b are of the same type, the elements of the short pair are not.

Logic for Mathematicians. McGraw–Hill. employed a definition of the ordered pair due to  |Quine|Willard_Van_Orman_Quine|  which requires a prior definition of the  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number| . Let   be the set of natural numbers and define first   :   :     x, &           x+1, &             The function   increments its argument if it is a natural number and leaves it as is otherwise; the number 0 does not appear as functional value of   .   As x     is the set of the elements of x not in   go on with   :   :           This is the  |set_image|Image_Image_Of_A_Subset|  of a set x under   ,  |sometimes_denoted|Image_Other_Terminology|  by  x as well. Applying function   to a set x simply increments every natural number in it. In particular,   does never contain the number 0, so that for any sets x and y,   :             Further, define   :   :               By this,   does always contain the number 0.     Finally, define the ordered pair  as the disjoint union   : :               .     Extracting all the elements of the pair that do not contain 0 and undoing   yields A. Likewise, B can be recovered from the elements of the pair that do contain 0. , on: Boise State, March 29, 2009. The author uses   for   and   for   .     For example, the pair is encoded as   provided a,b,c,d,e,f    .     In type theory and in outgrowths thereof such as the axiomatic set theory NF , the Quine–Rosser pair has the same type as its projections and hence is termed a type-level ordered pair. Hence this definition has the advantage of enabling a function , defined as a set of ordered pairs, to have a type only 1 higher than the type of its arguments. This definition works only if the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is the case in NF , but not in type theory or in NFU . J. Barkley Rosser showed that the existence of such a type-level ordered pair implies the axiom of infinity .

The publisher has graciously consented to permit diffusion of this monograph via the web.       Early in the development of the set theory, before paradoxes were discovered, Cantor followed Frege by defining the ordered pair of two sets as the class of all relations that hold between these sets, assuming that the notion of relation is primitive: §144     :       This definition is inadmissible in most modern formalized set theories and is methodologically similar to defining the cardinal of a set as the class of all sets equipotent with the given set. p. 22, footnote 59       Morse–Kelley set theory makes free use of proper class es. Morse defined the ordered pair so that its projections could be proper classes as well as sets. He first defined ordered pairs whose projections are sets in Kuratowskis manner. He then redefined the pair     :       where the component Cartesian products are Kuratowski pairs of sets and where     : s           This renders possible pairs whose projections are proper classes. The Quine–Rosser definition above also admits proper class es as projections. Similarly the triple is defined as a 3-tuple as follows:     :         The use of the singleton set s which has an inserted empty set allows tuples to have the uniqueness property that if a is an n-tuple and b is an m-tuple and a b then n m. Ordered triples which are defined as ordered pairs do not have this property with respect to ordered pairs.       thu for the set product X 1 ×X 2 .   A category-theoretic product A × B in a category of sets represents the set of ordered pairs, with the first element coming from A and the second coming from B. In this context the characteristic property above is a consequence of the universal property of the product and the fact that elements of a set X can be identified with morphisms from 1 to X. While different objects may have the universal property, they are all  |naturally_isomorphic|Naturally_Isomorphic|.
