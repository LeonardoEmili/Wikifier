           Alexei Petrovich of Russia was a  |Russia|Russia| n  |Tsarevich|Tsarevich| . He was born in  |Moscow|Moscow| , the son of Tsar  |Peter_I|Peter_The_Great|  and his first wife,  |Eudoxia_Lopukhina|Eudoxia_Lopukhina| . Alexei despised his father and repeatedly thwarted Peters plans to raise him as successor to the throne. His brief defection to Austria scandalized the Russian government, leading to harsh repressions against Alexei and his associates. Alexei died after interrogation under torture, and his son  |Peter_Alexeyevich|Peter_Ii_Of_Russia|  became the new heir apparent.       The young Alexei was brought up by his mother, who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards his father, the Tsar. Alexeis relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother, as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mothers worst persecutor. From the ages of 6 to 9, Alexei was educated by his tutor Vyazemsky, but after the removal of his mother by Peter the Great to the  |Suzdal_Intercession_Convent|Suzdal_Kremlinhistory| , Alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners, who taught him history, geography, mathematics and French.       In 1703, Alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a  |bombardier|Artillery|  regiment. In 1704, he was present at the capture of  |Narva|Narva| . At this period, the preceptors of the Tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability. Alexei had strong leanings towards  |archaeology|Archaeology|  and  |ecclesiology|Ecclesiology| . However, Peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new  |Russia|Russia| , and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain Russias new wealth and power. Painful relations between father and son, quite apart from the prior personal antipathies, were therefore inevitable. It was an additional misfortune for Alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood. He was left in the hands of  |reactionary|Reactionary| |boyars|Boyars|  and priests, who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the Tsar.        In 1708 Peter sent Alexei to  |Smolensk|Smolensk|  to collect  |provender|Food|  and recruits, and after that to  |Moscow|Moscow|  to fortify it against  |Charles_XII_of_Sweden|Charles_Xii_Of_Sweden| . At the end of 1709, Alexei went to  |Dresden|Dresden|  for one year. There, he finished lessons in French, German, mathematics and fortification. After his education, Alexei married  |Princess_Charlotte_of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Charlotte_Of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel| , whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of Europe . He met with Princess Charlotte, both were pleased with each other and the marriage went forward. In theory, Alexei could have refused the marriage, and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended. Why havent you written to tell me what you thought about her? wrote Peter in a letter dated 13 August 1710.     The marriage contract was signed in September. The wedding was celebrated at  |Torgau|Torgau| , Germany, on 14 October 1711 . One of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by Alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the Orthodox faith, Charlotte herself was allowed to retain her Protestant faith, an agreement opposed by Alexeis followers.     As for the marriage itself, the first 6 months went well but quickly became a failure within the next 6 months. Alexis was drunk constantly and Alexei pronounced his bride pock-marked and too thin . He insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public.     Three weeks later, the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to  |Toruń|Toruń|  to superintend the provisioning of the Russian troops in Poland. For the next twelve months Alexei was kept constantly on the move. His wife joined him at Toruń in December, but in April 1712 a peremptory  |ukase|Ukase|  ordered him off to the army in  |Pomerania|Pomerania| , and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through  |Finland|Finland| .      He had two children with Charlotte:    |Natalia_Alexeievna_Romanova|Grand_Duchess_Natalya_Alexeyevna_Of_Russia| |Peter_Alexeyevich_Romanov|Peter_Ii_Of_Russia|      Peter Alexeyevich would succeed as the  |Emperor|Emperor| |Peter_II|Peter_Ii_Of_Russia|  in 1727. With his death in 1730, the direct male-line of the House of Romanov became extinct.     After the birth of Natalia in 1714, Alexei brought his long-time Finnish serf  |mistress|Mistress| |Afrosinia|Yefrosinya_Fedorov|  Farquhar, Michael . A Treasure of Royal Scandals, p.115. Penguin Books, New York. . to live in the palace. Some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbases disapproval of his foreign, non-Orthodox bride, more so than her appearance, that caused Alexei to spurn Charlotte. Another influence was  |Alexander_Kikin|Alexander_Kikin| , a high-placed official who had fallen out with the Tsar and had been deprived of his estates.       Immediately on his return from Finland, Alexei was dispatched by his father to  |Staraya_Russa|Staraya_Russa|  and  |Lake_Ladoga|Lake_Ladoga|  to see to the building of new ships. This was the last commission entrusted to him, since Peter had not been satisfied with his sons performance and his lack of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, Peter made one last effort to reclaim his son. On 22 October 1715 , Charlotte died, after giving birth to a son, the grand-duke Peter, the future Emperor  |Peter_II|Peter_Ii_Of_Russia| . On the day of the funeral, Peter sent Alexei a stern letter, urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state. Peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his fathers plans. Alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father, offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son Peter. Peter would agree but on the condition that Alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk.     While Alexei was pondering his options, on 26 August 1716 Peter wrote to Alexei from abroad, urging him, if he desired to remain  |tsarevich|Tsarevich| , to join him and the army without delay. Rather than face this ordeal, Alexei fled to  |Vienna|Vienna|  and placed himself under the protection of his brother-in-law, the emperor  |Charles_VI|Charles_Vi,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , who sent him for safety first to the  |Tirol|Tirol_Castle| ean fortress of Ehrenberg , and finally to the castle of  |SantElmo|Santelmo|  at  |Naples|Naples| . He was accompanied throughout his journey by Afrosinia. That the emperor sincerely sympathized with Alexei, and suspected Peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son, is plain from his confidential letter to  |George_I_of_Great_Britain|George_I_Of_Great_Britain| , whom he consulted on this delicate affair. Peter felt insulted: the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal, and he had to be recovered and brought back to Russia at all costs. This difficult task was accomplished by Count  |Peter_Tolstoi|Peter_Tolstoi| , the most subtle and unscrupulous of Peters servants.            Alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing, that if he came back he should not be punished in the least, but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry Afrosinia.     On 31 January 1718, the tsarevich reached Moscow. Peter had already determined to institute a searching inquisition in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight. On 18 February a confession was extorted from Alexei which implicated most of his friends, and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand-duke Peter Petrovich.     A brutal reign of terror ensued, in the course of which the ex-tsaritsa Eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged  |adultery|Adultery| , while all who had in any way befriended Alexei were  |impaled|Impalement|  or  |broken_on_the_wheel|Breaking_Wheel|  while having their flesh torn with red-hot pincers on their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals, and were otherwise lingeringly done to death. Alexeis servants were beheaded or had their tongues cut out.  All this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich.     In April 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from, and in regard to, Alexei. This included the words of Afrosinia, who had turned states evidence. I shall bring back the old people... Alexei is reported to have told her,   ...and choose myself new ones according to my will;   when I become sovereign I shall live in Moscow and leave Saint Petersburg simply as any other town; I wont launch any ships; I shall maintain troops only for defense, and wont make war on anyone; I shall be content with the old domains. In winter I shall live in Moscow, and in summer in  |Iaroslavl|Yaroslavl| .     Despite this and other hearsay evidence, there were no facts to go upon. The worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his fathers death. In the eyes of Peter, his son was now a self-convicted and most dangerous traitor, whose life was forfeit. But there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to Russia. The whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of  |prelates|Prelate| ,  |senators|Governing_Senate| ,  |ministers|Minister|  and other  |dignitaries|Dignitary|  on 13 June 1718 . The  |clergy|Clergy| , for their part, declared the Tsarevich Alexei,     ...had placed his Confidence in those who loved the ancient Customs, and that he had become acquainted with them by the Discourses they held, wherein they had constantly praised the ancient Manners, and spoke with Distaste of the Novelties his Father had introduced.     Declaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter, the clergy left the matter to the tsars own decision.     At noon on 24 June , the temporal dignitaries—the 126 members of both the Senate and magistrates that comprised the court—declared Alexei guilty and sentenced him to death. But the examination by torture continued, so desperate was Peter to uncover any possible collusion.     On 19 June , the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty-five strokes with the  |knout|Knout| , and then, on 24 June , he was subject to fifteen more. On 26 June , Alexei died in the  |Peter_and_Paul_fortress|Peter_And_Paul_Fortress|  in  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| .
