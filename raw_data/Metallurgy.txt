Metallurgy is a domain of  |materials_science_and_engineering|Materials_Science|  that studies the physical and chemical behavior of  |metal|Metal| lic  |elements|Chemical_Element| , their  |inter_metallic_compounds|Inter_Metallic_Alloy| , and their mixtures, which are called  |alloys|Alloy| .   Metallurgy is used to separate metals from their ore. Metallurgy is also the  |technology|Technology|  of metals: the way in which science is applied to the production of metals, and the engineering of metal components for usage in products for consumers and manufacturers. The production of metals involves the processing of  |ores|Ore|  to extract the metal they contain, and the mixture of metals, sometimes with other elements, to produce alloys. Metallurgy is distinguished from the  |craft|Craft|  of  |metalworking|Metalworking| , although metalworking relies on metallurgy, as  |medicine|Medicine|  relies on medical science, for technical advancement. The science of metallurgy is subdivided into  |chemical_metallurgy|Chemical_Metallurgy|  and  |physical_metallurgy|Physical_Metallurgy| .     Metallurgy is subdivided into  |ferrous_metallurgy|Ferrous_Metallurgy|   and  |non_ferrous_metallurgy|Non_Ferrous_Metallurgy|  .   Ferrous metallurgy involves processes and alloys based on  |iron|Iron|  while non-ferrous metallurgy involves processes and alloys based on other metals. The production of ferrous metals accounts for 95 percent of world metal production. . in The Great Soviet Encyclopedia . 1979.       Metallurgy derives from the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  , , worker in metal , from , , mine, metal + , , work .     The word was originally an  |alchemists|Alchemist|  term for the extraction of metals from minerals, the ending -urgy signifying a process, especially manufacturing: it was discussed in this sense in the 1797  Encyclopædia Britannica .  In the late 19th century it was extended to the more general scientific study of metals, alloys, and related processes.     In English, the  pronunciation is the more common one in the UK and Commonwealth. The  pronunciation is the more common one in the US, and is the first-listed variant in various American dictionaries .                 The earliest recorded metal employed by humans appears to be  |gold|Gold| , which can be found  |free|Native_Metal|  or  |native|Native_Metal|  . Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves used during the late  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  period, c. 40,000 BC.     |Silver|Silver| ,  |copper|Copper| ,  |tin|Tin|  and meteoric  |iron|Iron|  can also be found in native form, allowing a limited amount of  |metalworking|Metalworking|  in early cultures.  Egyptian weapons made from  |meteoric_iron|Meteoric_Iron|  in about 3000 BC were highly prized as daggers from heaven . W. Keller The Bible as History. p. 156.      Certain metals, notably tin,  |lead|Lead| , and at a higher temperature, copper, can be recovered from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire or blast furnace, a process known as  |smelting|Smelting| . The first evidence of this extractive metallurgy, dating from the 5th and 6th millennia  BC, . has been found at archaeological sites in  |Majdanpek|Majdanpek| ,  |Jarmovac|Jarmovac|  near  |Priboj|Priboj|  and  |Pločnik|Pločnik| , in present-day  |Serbia|Serbia| . To date, the earliest evidence of copper smelting is found at the Belovode site near Plocnik.    This site produced a copper axe from 5500 BC, belonging to the  |Vinča_culture|Vinča_Culture| .  Stonepages from news sources November 2007     The earliest use of lead is documented from the late  |neolithic|Neolithic|  settlement of  |Yarim_Tepe|Yarim_Tepe|  in Iraq,       The earliest lead finds in the ancient Near East are a 6th millennium BC bangle from Yarim Tepe in northern Iraq and a slightly later conical lead piece from Halaf period  |Arpachiyah|Arpachiyah| , near Mosul. Moorey 1994: 294 As native lead is extremely rare, such artifacts raise the possibility that lead smelting may have begun even before copper smelting. Craddock 1995: 125        Copper smelting is also documented at this site at about the same time period , although the use of lead seems to precede copper smelting. Early metallurgy is also documented at the nearby site of  |Tell_Maghzaliyah|Tell_Maghzaliyah| , which seems to be dated even earlier, and completely lacks that pottery.     The Balkans were the site of major Neolithic cultures, including  |Butmir|Butmir_Culture| ,  |Vinča|Vinča| ,  |Varna|Varna_Culture| ,  |Karanovo|Karanovo_Culture| , and  |Hamangia|Hamangia_Culture| .                   The  |Varna_Necropolis|Varna_Necropolis| ,  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| , is a burial site in the western industrial zone of  |Varna|Varna|  , internationally considered one of the key archaeological sites in world prehistory. The oldest  |gold|Gold|  treasure in the world, dating from 4,600 BC to 4,200 BC, was discovered at the site.  Gems and Gemstones: Timeless Natural Beauty of the Mineral World, By Lance Grande The gold piece dating from 4,500 BC, recently founded in  |Durankulak|Durankulak| , near  |Varna|Varna|  is another important example.       Other signs of early metals are found from the third millennium  BC in places like  |Palmela|Palmela|  ,  |Los_Millares|Los_Millares|  , and  |Stonehenge|Stonehenge|  . However, the ultimate beginnings cannot be clearly ascertained and new discoveries are both continuous and ongoing.        In the  |Near_East|Ancient_Near_East| , about 3500 BC, it was discovered that by combining copper and tin, a superior metal could be made, an  |alloy|Alloy|  called  |bronze|Bronze| . This represented a major technological shift known as the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| .     The extraction of  |iron|Iron|  from its ore into a workable metal is much more difficult than for copper or tin. The process appears to have been invented by the  |Hittites|Hittites|  in about 1200  BC, beginning the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| . The secret of extracting and working iron was a key factor in the success of the  |Philistines|Philistines| . B. W. Anderson The Living World of the Old Testament, p. 154,      Historical developments in ferrous metallurgy can be found in a wide variety of past cultures and civilizations. This includes the ancient and medieval kingdoms and empires of the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  and  |Near_East|Near_East| , ancient  |Iran|Iran| , ancient  |Egypt|Egypt| , ancient  |Nubia|Nubia| , and  |Anatolia|Anatolia|  ,  |Ancient_Nok|Nok_Culture| ,  |Carthage|Carthage| , the  |Greeks|Greeks|  and  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  of ancient  |Europe|Europe| , medieval Europe, ancient and medieval  |China|China| , ancient and medieval  |India|India| , ancient and medieval  |Japan|Japan| , amongst others. Many applications, practices, and devices associated or involved in metallurgy were established in ancient China, such as the innovation of the  |blast_furnace|Blast_Furnace| ,  |cast_iron|Cast_Iron| ,  |hydraulic|Hydraulic| -powered  |trip_hammers|Trip_Hammer| , and double acting piston  |bellows|Bellows| . R. F. Tylecote A History of Metallurgy  Robert K.G. Temple . The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention . London:  |André_Deutsch|André_Deutsch| . pp. 44–56. .     A 16th century book by  |Georg_Agricola|Georg_Agricola|  called  De re metallica  describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. Agricola has been described as the father of metallurgy .                    |Extractive_metallurgy|Extractive_Metallurgy|  is the practice of removing valuable metals from an  |ore|Ore|  and refining the extracted raw metals into a purer form. In order to convert a metal  |oxide|Oxide|  or  |sulphide|Sulfide|  to a purer metal, the ore must be  |reduced|Redox|  physically,  |chemically|Chemistry| , or  |electrolytically|Electrolyte| .     Extractive  |metallurgists|Metallurgist|  are interested in three primary streams: feed, concentrate and  |tailings|Tailings| . After mining, large pieces of the ore feed are broken through crushing and/or grinding in order to obtain particles small enough where each particle is either mostly valuable or mostly waste. Concentrating the particles of value in a form supporting separation enables the desired metal to be removed from waste products.     Mining may not be necessary, if the ore body and physical environment are conducive to  |leaching|In_Situ_Leaching| . Leaching dissolves minerals in an ore body and results in an enriched solution. The solution is collected and processed to extract valuable metals.     Ore bodies often contain more than one valuable metal. Tailings of a previous process may be used as a feed in another process to extract a secondary product from the original ore. Additionally, a concentrate may contain more than one valuable metal. That concentrate would then be processed to separate the valuable metals into individual constituents.            Common engineering  |metals|Metal|  include  |aluminium|Aluminium| ,  |chromium|Chromium| ,  |copper|Copper| ,  |iron|Iron| ,  |magnesium|Magnesium| ,  |nickel|Nickel| ,  |titanium|Titanium|  and  |zinc|Zinc| . These are most often used as alloys. Much effort has been placed on understanding the iron-carbon alloy system, which includes  |steels|Steel|  and  |cast_irons|Cast_Iron| .  |Plain_carbon_steels|Carbon_Steel|  are used in low-cost, high-strength applications where weight and  |corrosion|Corrosion|  are not a problem. Cast irons, including  |ductile_iron|Ductile_Iron| , are also part of the iron-carbon system.      |Stainless_steel|Stainless_Steel|  or  |galvanized_steel|Galvanized_Steel|  is used where resistance to corrosion is important. Aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are used for applications where strength and lightness are required.     Copper-nickel alloys  are used in highly corrosive environments and for non-magnetic applications. Nickel-based  |superalloys|Superalloy|  like  |Inconel|Inconel|  are used in high-temperature applications such as  |gas_turbines|Gas_Turbine| ,  |turbochargers|Turbocharger| ,  |pressure_vessels|Pressure_Vessel| , and  |heat_exchangers|Heat_Exchanger| . For extremely high temperatures,  |single_crystal|Single_Crystal|  alloys are used to minimize  |creep|Creep| .       In  |production_engineering|Industrial_Engineering| , metallurgy is concerned with the production of metallic components for use in consumer or  |engineering|Engineering|  products. This involves the production of alloys, the shaping, the heat treatment and the surface treatment of the product. Determining the hardness of the metal using the Rockwell, Vickers, and Brinell hardness scales is a commonly used practice that helps better understand the metals elasticity and plasticity for different applications and production processes.  The task of the metallurgist is to achieve balance between material properties such as cost,  |weight|Weight| ,  |strength|Tensile_Strength| ,  |toughness|Toughness| ,  |hardness|Hardness| ,  |corrosion|Corrosion| ,  |fatigue|Fatigue|  resistance, and performance in  |temperature|Temperature|  extremes. To achieve this goal, the operating environment must be carefully considered. In a saltwater environment, ferrous metals and some aluminium alloys corrode quickly. Metals exposed to cold or  |cryogenic|Cryogenic|  conditions may endure a ductile to brittle transition and lose their toughness, becoming more brittle and prone to cracking. Metals under continual cyclic loading can suffer from metal fatigue. Metals under constant  |stress|Stress|  at elevated temperatures can  |creep|Creep| .            Metals are shaped by processes such as:      |Casting|Casting|  – molten metal is poured into a shaped  |mold|Molding| .    |Forging|Forging|  – a red-hot  |billet|Billet|  is hammered into shape.    |Rolling|Rolling|  – a billet is passed through successively narrower rollers to create a sheet.    |Laser_cladding|Cladding|  – metallic powder is blown through a movable laser beam . The resulting melted metal reaches a substrate to form a melt pool. By moving the laser head, it is possible to stack the tracks and build up a three-dimensional piece.    |Extrusion|Extrusion|  – a hot and malleable metal is forced under pressure through a  |die|Die| , which shapes it before it cools.    |Sintering|Sintering|  – a  |powdered_metal|Powder_Metallurgy|  is heated in a non-oxidizing environment after being compressed into a die.    |Machining|Machining|  –  |lathes|Lathe| ,  |milling_machines|Milling_Machine|  and  |drills|Drill|  cut the cold metal to shape.    |Fabrication|Fabrication|  – sheets of metal are cut with  |guillotines|Guillotine|  or  |gas_cutters|Gas_Welding|  and bent and welded into structural shape.    |3D_printing|3D_Printing|  – Sintering or melting amorphous powder metal in a 3D space to make any object to shape.      |Cold_working|Cold_Working|  processes, in which the products shape is altered by rolling, fabrication or other processes while the product is cold, can increase the strength of the product by a process called  |work_hardening|Work_Hardening| . Work hardening creates  |microscopic_defects|Dislocation|  in the metal, which resist further changes of shape.     Various forms of casting exist in industry and academia. These include  |sand_casting|Sand_Casting| ,  |investment_casting|Investment_Casting|  ,  |die_casting|Die_Casting| , and continuous castings. Each of these forms has advantages for certain metals and applications considering factors like magnetism and corrosion.        Metals can be  |heat_treated|Heat_Treatment|  to alter the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness and/or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include  |annealing|Annealing| ,  |precipitation_strengthening|Precipitation_Strengthening| ,  |quenching|Quenching| , and  |tempering|Tempering| . Arthur Reardon , Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist , ASM International,  The annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged so that when the metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. Quenching is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after heating, thus freezing the steels molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder. There is a balance between hardness and toughness in any steel; the harder the steel, the less tough or impact-resistant it is, and the more impact-resistant it is, the less hard it is. Tempering relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.     Often, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what are known as thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient processing of materials. These processes are common to high-alloy special steels,  |superalloys|Superalloy|  and titanium alloys.             |Electroplating|Electroplating|  is a chemical surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a thin layer of another metal such as  |gold|Gold| ,  |silver|Silver| ,  |chromium|Chromium|  or  |zinc|Zinc|  to the surface of the product. This is done by selecting the coating material electrolyte solution which is the material that is going to coat the workpiece . There needs to be two electrodes of different materials: one the same material as the coating material and one that is receiving the coating material. Two electrodes are electrically charged and the coating material is stuck to the work piece. It is used to reduce corrosion as well as to improve the products aesthetic appearance. It is also used to make inexpensive metals look like the more expensive ones .           Shot peening is a cold working process used to finish metal parts. In the process of shot peening, small round shot is blasted against the surface of the part to be finished. This process is used to prolong the product life of the part, prevent stress corrosion failures, and also prevent fatigue. The shot leaves small dimples on the surface like a peen hammer does, which cause compression stress under the dimple. As the shot media strikes the material over and over, it forms many overlapping dimples throughout the piece being treated. The compression stress in the surface of the material strengthens the part and makes it more resistant to fatigue failure, stress failures, corrosion failure, and cracking.           Thermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings.Thermal spraying, also known as a spray welding process,  is an industrial coating process that consists of a heat source and a coating material that can be in a powder or wire form which is melted then sprayed on the surface of the material being treated at a high velocity. The spray treating process is known by many different names such as HVOF , plasma spray, flame spray, arc spray, and metalizing.             |Metallurgists|Metallurgist|  study the microscopic and macroscopic properties using  |metallography|Metallography| , a technique invented by  |Henry_Clifton_Sorby|Henry_Clifton_Sorby| . In metallography, an alloy of interest is ground flat and polished to a mirror finish. The sample can then be etched to reveal the microstructure and macrostructure of the metal. The sample is then examined in an optical or  |electron_microscope|Electron_Microscope| , and the image contrast provides details on the composition, mechanical properties, and processing history.      |Crystallography|Crystallography| , often using  |diffraction|Diffraction|  of  |x_rays|X_Ray|  or  |electron|Electron| .
