Peterhead is an important centre for the energy industry. Peterhead Port, which includes an extensive new quay with adjacent lay down area at Smith Quay, is a major support location for North Sea oil and gas exploration and production and the fast-growing global sub-sea sector. The Gas Terminal at St Fergus handles around 15% of the UKs natural gas requirements and the Peterhead power station is looking to host Britains first carbon capture and storage power generation project.   Fishing – Aberdeenshire is Scotlands foremost fishing area. In 2010, catches landed at Aberdeenshires ports accounted for over half the total fish landings of Scotland, and almost 45% in the UK. Peterhead and Fraserburgh ports, alongside Aberdeen City, provide much of the employment in these sectors.
