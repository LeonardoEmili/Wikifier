Originally titled VALISystem A, it was his first attempt to deal in fiction with his  |experiences_of_early_1974|Philip_K_Dickparanormal_Experiences_And_Mental_Health_Problems| . When his publishers at Bantam requested extensive rewrites he canned the project and reworked it into the  |VALIS_trilogy|Valis_Trilogy| . Arbor House acquired the rights to Radio Free Albemuth in 1985. They then published an edition under the current title , prepared from the corrected typescript given by Dick to his friend  |Tim_Powers|Tim_Powers| .       In this  |alternate_history|Alternate_History| , the corrupt  |United_States_president|United_States_President|  Ferris F. Fremont  becomes Chief Executive in the late 1960s following  |Lyndon_Johnsons|Lyndon_Johnson|  administration. The character is best described as an amalgam of  |Joseph_McCarthy|Joseph_Mccarthy|  and  |Richard_Nixon|Richard_Nixon| , who abrogates  |civil_liberties|Civil_Liberties|  and  |human_rights|Human_Rights|  through positing a  |conspiracy_theory|Conspiracy_Theory|  centered on a fictitious  |subversive|Subversion|  organization known as Aramchek . In addition to this, he is associated with a right-wing  |populist|Populism|  movement called Friends of the American People .     The Presidents  |paranoia|Paranoia|  and  |opportunism|Opportunism|  lead to the establishment of a real resistance movement that is organized through narrow-beam radio transmissions from a mysterious  |alien|Extraterrestrial_Life_In_Popular_Culture|  near-Earth satellite by a superintelligent, extraterrestrial, but less than omnipotent being named  |VALIS|Valis| .     Like its successor VALIS, this novel is autobiographical. Dick himself is a major character, though fictitious protagonist Nicholas Brady serves as a vehicle for Dicks alleged  |gnostic|Gnostic| |_theophany|Theophany|  on February 11, 1974. In addition, Silvia Sadassa is a character who claims that Ferris Fremont is actually a  |communist|Communist| |_covert_agent|Covert_Agent|  recruited by Sadassas mother when Fremont was still a teenager.     As with VALIS, Radio Free Albemuth deals with Dicks highly personal style of  |Christianity|Christianity|  . It further examines the moral and ethical repercussions of informing on trusted friends for the authorities. Also prominent is Dicks dislike of the  |Republican_Party|United_States_Republican_Party| , satirizing Nixons America as a  |Stalinist|Stalinist|  or  |neo_fascist|Neo_Fascist|  police state. Fremont eventually captures and imprisons Dick and Brady after the latter attempts to produce and distribute a  |record|Gramophone_Record|  that contains  |subliminal_messages|Subliminal_Message|  of revolt against the current dictatorship. Brady and Silvia are executed, and Dick narrates the concluding passage about his life in a  |concentration_camp|Concentration_Camp| , where his supposedly latest work is actually penned by a  |ghost_writer|Ghost_Writer|  and regime-approved  |hack|Hack_Writer| . Suddenly, however, he hears music blaring from a transistor radio which contains the same subliminal message. He and his friends, it turns out, were just a decoy set up by VALIS to detour the government from stopping a much more popular A-List band from releasing a similar record with a better-established recording company. As Dick realizes this and hears youngsters repeating the lyrics, he realizes that salvation may lie within the hearts and minds of the next generation.       Gerald Jonas of The New York Times thought that the novel may have been merely a first draft , but this book is not Dick at his best.      J. Michael Caparula reviewed Radio Free Albemuth in  Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer  No. 80.  Caparula commented that The final result presents a satisfying conclusion to his trilogy of Valis novels .     VALISRadio Free Albemuth as  VALIS , Dick incorporated the plotline of Radio Free Albemuth as a backdrop film  that recapitulated the central theological and existential concerns of his novel as a  |mise_en_abyme|Mise_En_Abyme|  - that is, a miniature copy of his central preoccupations at this stage of his literary career, common to both works. The word albemuth was derived by Dick from the Arabic word Al Behemoth, the whale , itself an oblique reference to  |Fomalhaut|Fomalhaut| , the star Dick at one time believed VALIS came from in real life.
