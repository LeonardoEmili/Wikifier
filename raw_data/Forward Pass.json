Nelson continues, the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. St. Louis was on Iowas thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown.

Hackett, who would become a member of the football rules committee in December 1907 American Gymnasia and Athletic Record, Volume IV, No. 5, Whole Number 41, Page 62, January 1908 and officiated games into the 1930s, Cornell Alumni News, Volume 36, No. 4, page 44, October 19, 1933 was quoted the next day in Ed Wrays  Globe-Democrat article: It was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. St. Louis style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect. Interview with Lt. Hackett, St. Louis Globe-Democrat, November 30, 1906     Hackett is the only known expert witness to the passing offenses of both Cochems 1906 squads and that of Stagg, who dismissed any special role for the St. Louis coach in the development of the pass. Hackett was an official in games involving both teams. As Wray recalled almost 40 years later: Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it. Wrays Column, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 9, 1946     Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass , Nelson writes. Iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes.   ,      During the 1906 season threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... Schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder. Considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes.     In 1907, after the first season of the forward pass, one football writer noted that, with the single exception of Cochems, football teachers were groping in the dark.      Because St. Louis was geographically isolated from both the dominant teams and the major sports media of the era, all centered in and focused on the East, Cochems groundbreaking offensive strategy was not picked up by the major teams. Pass-oriented offenses would not be adopted by the Eastern football powers until the next decade.     But that does not mean that other teams in the Midwest did not pick it up. ": null
