     Pope Gregory XV , born Alessandro Ludovisi, was head of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  and ruler of the  |Papal_States|Papal_States|  from 9 February 1621 to his death in 1623.              Alessandro Ludovisi was born in  |Bologna|Bologna|  in 1554 to Pompeo Ludovisi, the  |Count|Count|  of  |Samoggia|Samoggia|   and of Camilla Bianchini. He was one of seven children and was born as the third child.        He was educated at the  |Roman_College|Collegio_Romano|  run by the  |Society_of_Jesus|Society_Of_Jesus|  in Rome and he then went to the  |University_of_Bologna|University_Of_Bologna|  to get degrees in  |canon|Canon_Law|  and  |Roman_law|Roman_Law|  which he received on June 4, 1575. His early career was as a papal jurist in Rome, and there is no evidence that he had been  |ordained|Holy_Orders|  to the  |priesthood|Priesthood| .     He returned to Rome in 1575 and he served as the Referendary of the  |Apostolic_Signatura|Apostolic_Signatura|  from 1593 to 1596 and was appointed as the Vicegerent of Rome in 1597, a position he maintained until 1598. He also served as the Auditor of the  |Sacred_Roman_Rota|Sacred_Roman_Rota|  from 1599 to 1612.     On 12 March 1612,  |Pope_Paul_V|Pope_Paul_V|  appointed him as the  |Archbishop_of_Bologna|Archdiocese_Of_Bologna| , for which he was presumably ordained to the priesthood and then he was  |consecrated|Consecrated|  a  |bishop|Bishop|  on 1 May of that year in the church of San Andrea al Quirinale in Rome.     In August 1616, the pope sent him as  |Apostolic_Nuncio|Papal_Nuncio|  to the  |Duchy_of_Savoy|Duchy_Of_Savoy| , to mediate between  |Charles_Emmanuel_I_Duke_of_Savoy|Charles_Emmanuel_I_Duke_Of_Savoy|  and  |Philip_III_of_Spain|Philip_Iii_Of_Spain|  in their dispute concerning the  |Gonzaga|House_Of_Gonzaga| |_Marquisate_of_Montferrat|Marquisate_Of_Montferrat| .     On 19 September 1616, Pope Paul V elevated him to the rank of cardinal and appointed him as a  |Cardinal_Priest|Cardinal_Priest|  with the  |titular_church|Titular_Church|  of  |Santa_Maria_in_Traspontina|Santa_Maria_In_Traspontina| .            Ludovisi remained in his  |episcopal_see|Episcopal_See|  in Bologna until he went to Rome after the death of Pope Paul V to take part in the  |conclave|Papal_Conclave_1621|  at which he was chosen as pope and he selected the pontifical name of Gregory XV . He was crowned on 14 February 1621 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Andrea Baroni Peretti Montalto, and assumed possession of the  |Basilica_of_Saint_John_Lateran|Basilica_Of_Saint_John_Lateran|  on 14 May 1621.     At the moment of his election, chiefly through the influence of Cardinal Borghese, at his advanced age and with his weak state of health he saw at once that he would need an energetic man, in whom he could place implicit confidence, to assist him in the government of the Church. His nephew  |Ludovico_Ludovisi|Ludovico_Ludovisi| , a young man of 25 years, seemed to him to be the right person and, at the risk of being charged with nepotism, he created him cardinal on the third day of his pontificate. On the same day, his youngest brother  |Orazio|Orazio_Ludovisi|  was appointed  |Captain_General_of_the_Church|Captain_General_Of_The_Church|  at the head of the papal army.        The future revealed that Gregory XV was not disappointed in his nephew. The Catholic Encyclopedia allows that Ludovico, it is true, advanced the interests of his family in every possible way, but he also used his brilliant talents and his great influence for the welfare of the Church, and was sincerely devoted to the pope . Gregory secured for the Ludovisi two dukedoms, one for his brother Orazio, made a Nobile Romano and  |Duke|Duke|  of  |Fiano_Romano|Fiano_Romano| , 1621, and the other, the  |Duchy|Duchy|  of  |Zagarolo|Zagarolo| , purchased from the  |Colonna|Colonna|  family by his nephew  |Ludovico_Ludovisi|Ludovico_Ludovisi|  in 1622. A second nephew,  |Niccolò|Niccolò_Ludovisi| , was made reigning  |Prince_of_Piombino|Principality_Of_Piombino|  and Lord of the Isola d |Elba|Elba|  in 1634, having married the heiress, 30 March 1632.       Gregory XV interfered little in European politics, beyond assisting  |Ferdinand_II_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Ferdinand_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , and the  |Catholic_League|Catholic_League|  against the  |Protestants|Protestants| —to the tune of a million gold  |ducats|Ducat|  —as well as  |Sigismund_III_Vasa|Sigismund_Iii_Vasa| , King of the  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth| , against the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . His Declaration against Magicians and Witches  was the last papal ordinance against  |witchcraft|Witchcraft| . Former punishments were lessened, and the death penalty was limited to those who were proved to have entered into a  |compact_with_the_devil|Deal_With_The_Devil| , and to have committed homicide with his assistance .     He was a learned theologian and manifested a reforming spirit. As an example, his  |papal_bull|Papal_Bull|  of 15 November 1621,  Aeterni Patris Filius , regulated papal elections, which henceforth were to be by secret ballot; three methods of election were allowed: by scrutiny, compromise and  |quasi_inspiration|Acclamation| . On 6 January 1622, he established the  |Congregation_for_the_Propagation_of_the_Faith|Congregation_For_The_Propagation_Of_The_Faith| , the missionary arm of the  |Holy_See|Holy_See| . His pontificate was marked by the  |canonizations|Canonization|  of  |Teresa_of_Avila|Teresa_Of_Avila| ,  |Francis_Xavier|Francis_Xavier| ,  |Ignatius_Loyola|Ignatius_Loyola| ,  |Philip_Neri|Philip_Neri|  and  |Isidore_the_Farmer|Isidore_The_Farmer| . He also beatified  |Peter_of_Alcantara|Peter_Of_Alcantara| . He was influential in bringing the Bolognese artist  |Guercino|Guercino|  to Rome, a landmark in the development of the High  |Baroque|Baroque|  style. He sat for his portrait busts,  |one_of_which|Bust_Of_Pope_Gregory_Xv|  was by  |Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini|Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini|  and by  |Alessandro_Algardi|Alessandro_Algardi| , whose restrained bust in a  tondo  is in the Church of  |Santa_Maria_in_Vallicella|Santa_Maria_In_Vallicella| .          The pope created eleven cardinals in four consistories that saw him elevate his nephew Ludovico and his cousin  |Marcantonio_Gozzadini|Marcantonio_Gozzadini|  as cardinals; he also elevated the noted  |Armand_Jean_Richelieu|Cardinal_Richelieu|  as a cardinal.       On 12 March 1622, the pope canonized several saints:  |Francis_Xavier|Francis_Xavier| ,  |Ignatius_of_Loyola|Ignatius_Of_Loyola| ,  |Isidore_the_Laborer|Isidore_The_Laborer| ,  |Philip_Neri|Philip_Neri|  and  |Teresa_of_Ávila|Teresa_Of_Ávila| .     Gregory XV also beatified three individuals during his pontificate:  |Ambrose_Sansedoni_of_Siena|Ambrose_Sansedoni_Of_Siena| ,  |Albert_the_Great|Albert_The_Great| , and  |Peter_of_Alcantara|Peter_Of_Alcantara| .          Gregory XV died in the  |Quirinal_Palace|Quirinal_Palace|  on 8 July 1623 and was buried in the Church of  |SantIgnazio|Santignazio| . He was succeeded by  |Pope_Urban_VIII|Pope_Urban_Viii| . The pope had been suffering from kidney stones for some time and was bedridden from 16 June to 1 July 1623, having been suffering from  |diarrhea|Diarrhea|  and a  |stomach_disorder|Stomach_Disorder|  that caused him great discomfort. His condition worsened on 4 July, as a  |fever|Fever|  greatly weakened him, leading to the pope receiving the  |Viaticum|Viaticum|  on 5 July and the  |Extreme_Unction|Extreme_Unction|  on 6 July, before succumbing to his illness two days later.
