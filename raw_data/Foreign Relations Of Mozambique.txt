   While alliances dating back to the  |Mozambican_War_of_Independence|Mozambican_War_Of_Independence|  remain relevant,  Mozambique s foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic. The twin pillars of the policy are maintenance of good relations with its neighbors and maintenance and expansion of ties to development partners.     During the 1970s and early 1980s, Mozambiques foreign policy was inextricably linked to the struggles for majority rule in  |Rhodesia|Rhodesia|  and  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  as well as superpower competition and the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| . Mozambiques decision to enforce  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  sanctions against Rhodesia and support Rhodesian guerrillas led  |Ian_Smiths|Ian_Smith|  regime to undertake overt and covert actions to destabilize the country. Although the change of government in Zimbabwe in 1980 removed this threat, the apartheid regime in South Africa continued to finance the destabilization of Mozambique.     The 1984  |Nkomati_Accord|Nkomati_Accord| , while failing in its goal of ending South African support to  |RENAMO|Renamo| , opened initial diplomatic contacts between the Mozambican and South African governments. This process gained momentum with South Africas elimination of  |apartheid|Apartheid| , which culminated in the establishment of full diplomatic relations in October 1993. While relations with neighboring  |Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe| ,  |Malawi|Malawi| ,  |Zambia|Zambia| , and  |Tanzania|Tanzania|  show occasional strains, Mozambiques ties to these countries remain strong.      In the years immediately following its independence, Mozambique benefited from considerable assistance from some western countries, notably the  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| ns. The  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and its allies, however, became Mozambiques primary economic, military, and political supporters and its foreign policy reflected this linkage. This began to change in 1983; in 1984 Mozambique joined the  |World_Bank|World_Bank|  and  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund| . Western aid quickly replaced Soviet support, with the Scandinavians, Finland, the  |United_States|United_States| , the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , and the  |European_Union|European_Union|  becoming increasingly important sources of development assistance. Italy also maintains a profile in Mozambique as a result of its key role during the peace process. Relations with  |Portugal|Portugal| , the former colonial power, are complex and of some importance as Portuguese investors play a visible role in Mozambiques economy.     Mozambique is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and ranks among the moderate members of the African Bloc in the United Nations and other international organizations. Mozambique also belongs to the  |Organisation_of_African_Unity|Organisation_Of_African_Unity| /African Union and the  |Southern_African_Development_Community|Southern_African_Development_Community| . In 1994, the Government became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , in part to broaden its base of international support but also to please the countrys sizeable  |Muslim|Muslim|  population. Similarly, in early 1996 Mozambique joined its Anglophone neighbors in the  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| . In the same year, Mozambique became a founding member and the first President of the  |Community_of_Portuguese_Language_Countries|Community_Of_Portuguese_Language_Countries|  , and maintains close ties with other Lusophone states. The country is also a member of the  |Port_Management_Association_of_Eastern_and_Southern_Africa|Port_Management_Association_Of_Eastern_And_Southern_Africa|  .     Illicit drugs:   Southern African transit point for South Asian  |hashish|Hashish| , South Asian  |heroin|Heroin| , and South American  |cocaine|Cocaine|  probably destined for the European and South African markets; producer of  |cannabis|Cannabis|  and  |methaqualone|Methaqualone|  ; corruption and poor regulatory capability makes the banking system vulnerable to money laundering, but the lack of a well-developed financial infrastructure limits the countrys utility as a money-laundering center.
