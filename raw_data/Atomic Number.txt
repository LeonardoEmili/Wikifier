Scerri chaps. 3â€“9 By this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered, so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium .       In 1915 the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of Z, which were now recognized to be the same as the element number, was not understood. An old idea called  |Prouts_hypothesis|Prouts_Hypothesis|  had postulated that the elements were all made of residues of the lightest element hydrogen, which in the Bohr-Rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one. However, as early as 1907 Rutherford and  |Thomas_Royds|Thomas_Royds|  had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times. If Prouts hypothesis were true, something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms.     In 1917 Rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a  |nuclear_reaction|Nuclear_Reaction|  between alpha particles and nitrogen gas, . Nzhistory.net.nz . Retrieved on 2011-01-26. and believed he had proven Prouts law. He called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 . It had been immediately apparent from the work of Moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  nuclei, and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra  |protons|Protons|  presumed present in all heavy nuclei. A helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons to cancel two of the charges. At the other end of the periodic table, a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of + 79, consistent with its atomic number.     Z the proton number |James_Chadwicks|James_Chadwick| |discovery_of_the_neutron|Discovery_Of_The_Neutron|  in 1932. An atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons, and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons. After 1932, therefore, an elements atomic number Z was also realized to be identical to the  |proton_number|Proton_Number|  of its nuclei.     ZZ possibly comes from the  |German|German_Language|  word  . . frostburg.edu However, prior to 1915, the word Zahl  was used for an elements assigned number in the periodic table.       Each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom, which is Z . The  |configuration|Electron_Configuration|  of these electrons follows from the principles of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| . The number of electrons in each elements  |electron_shells|Electron_Shell| , particularly the outermost  |valence_shell|Valence_Shell| , is the primary factor in determining its  |chemical_bonding|Chemical_Bonding|  behavior. Hence, it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.       The quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers. As of 2019, all elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed. Synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions, such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created. In general, the  |half-life|Half-Life|  becomes shorter as atomic number increases, though an  |island_of_stability|Island_Of_Stability| .
