The Padres played host to the  |Atlanta_Braves|1978_Atlanta_Braves_Season|  on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth inning, Atlantas  |Jeff_Burroughs|Jeff_Burroughs|  hit a ground ball up the middle.  Smith described the play by saying, He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88|    During a roadtrip to  |Houston|Houston| , later in the season, Smith met a part-time usherette at the  |Astrodome|Reliant_Astrodome|  named Denise while making his way to the team bus outside the stadium.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |marry|Marriage| . It was also during the 1978 season that Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, but that he only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium. Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres last home game of the season.  After conferring with veteran teammate  |Gene_Tenace|Gene_Tenace| , Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be wildly popular. Smith finished the 1978 season with a .258 batting average and .970 fielding percentage, placing second in  |National_League_Rookie_of_the_Year|Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_Of_The_Year_Award|  voting to  |Bob_Horner|Bob_Horner| .

While Smith was having problems with the Padres owners, the  |St._Louis_Cardinals|St._Louis_Cardinals|  also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop,  |Garry_Templeton|Garry_Templeton| . Templetons relationship with  |Cardinal_Nation|Cardinal_Nation|  had become increasingly strained and finally came to a head during a game at  |Busch_Stadium|Busch_Memorial_Stadium|  on August 26, 1981, when he made obscene gestures at fans, and had to be physically pulled off the field by manager  |Whitey_Herzog|Whitey_Herzog| .  |ONeill_2005|Oneill05| |Herzog_and_Horrigan_1987|Her87| |Gussie_Busch|Gussie_Busch|  , Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager  |Jack_McKeon|Jack_Mckeon|  at the 1981  |baseball_winter_meetings|Winter_Meetings| .  |Herzog_and_Horrigan_1987|Her87| |Herzog_and_Horrigan_1987|Her87| |Dick_Williams|Dick_Williams|  informed Herzog that a  |no-trade_clause|No-Trade_Clause|  had been included in Smiths 1981 contract.  |Herzog_and_Pitts_1999|Her99| |San_Diego|San_Diego| , but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |Herzog_and_Horrigan_1987|Her87| |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |Steve_Mura|Steve_Mura|  to the Cardinals for a player to be named later,  |Sixto_Lezcano|Sixto_Lezcano|  and  |Garry_Templeton|Garry_Templeton| . The teams completed the trade on February 19, 1982, with the Padres sending  |Al_Olmsted|Al_Olmsted|  to the Cardinals, and St. Louis sending  |Luis_DeLeon|Luis_Deleon|  to the Padres.   |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |Smith_and_Rains_2002|Smi02| |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |1982_season|1982_St._Louis_Cardinals_Season|  got underway, Herzogs newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division.   |Leach_2008|Lea08| |Smith_and_Rains_2002|Smi02| |Nikko|Nikko_Smith| , on April 28.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |Willie_McGee|Willie_Mcgee|  during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues .  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |Cardinals|1982_St._Louis_Cardinals_Season|  faced the  |Atlanta_Braves|1982_Atlanta_Braves_Season|  in the best-of-five  |1982_National_League_Championship_Series|1982_National_League_Championship_Series|  . Smith drove in the series first run by hitting a  |sacrifice_fly|Sacrifice_Fly|  that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis three-game series sweep.      Just as Herzog had predicted when he told Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant with him on the team, Smith found himself as the teams starting shortstop in the best-of-seven  |1982_World_Series|1982_World_Series|  against the  |Milwaukee_Brewers|1982_Milwaukee_Brewers_Season| . During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field.  |Rains_2003|Rai03| |Game_7|1982_World_Seriesgame_7| , Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the teams three runs that inning.  The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.     After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals agreed on a new contract in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |All-Star_Game|1983_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game|  for the first time in 1983, and at seasons end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |disabled_list|Disabled_List|  with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88|  Smiths return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.               In 1985, Smith amassed a .276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals as a team won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth.  Facing the  |Los_Angeles_Dodgers|1985_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_Season|  in the now best-of-seven  |NLCS|1985_National_League_Championship_Series| , a split of the first four games set the stage for  |Game_5|1985_Nlcsgame_5|  at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers manager  |Tommy_Lasorda|Tommy_Lasorda|  called upon closer  |Tom_Niedenfuer|Tom_Niedenfuer|  to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his previous 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a walk-off home run, ending Game 5 in a 3–2 Cardinals victory.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |Jack_Bucks|Jack_Buck|  Go crazy folks play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.       After Smiths teammate  |Jack_Clark|Jack_Clark|  hit a late-inning home run of his own in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the  |Kansas_City_Royals|1985_Kansas_City_Royals_Season|  in the  |1985_World_Series|1985_World_Series| . Once again sportswriters were quick to draw attention to Smiths outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate.  |Schoor_1990|Sch90| |Schoor_1990|Sch90| |Game_6|1985_World_Seriesgame_6|  call by umpire  |Don_Denkinger|Don_Denkinger|  overshadowed the remainder of the Series .  |Nemec_and_Wisnia_2002|Nem02| |rotator_cuff|Rotator_Cuff|  after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres.  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88|  After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a  |pickoff|Pickoff|  throw, Smith altered his throwing motion to such a degree that the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 510 , 180-pound Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, I didnt tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didnt want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didnt get any better, but it was good enough that I didnt have to have surgery.  |Smith_and_Rains_2002|Smi02| |Rains_and_Reid_2002|Rai02| |Philadelphia_Phillies|1986_Philadelphia_Phillies_Season|  at Busch Stadium.

In addition to winning the Gold Glove Award at shortstop for the eighth consecutive time, Smith posted a career-high  |on-base_percentage|On-Base_Percentage|  of .392. Smith was also the leading vote-getter in the  |1987_All-Star_Game|1987_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game| .  |Smith_and_Rains_1988|Smi88| |San_Francisco_Giants|1987_San_Francisco_Giants_Season|  in the  |1987_National_League_Championship_Series|1987_National_League_Championship_Series| .

Following the 1987 season, Smith was awarded the largest contract in the  |National_League|National_League|  at $2,340,000.      While the team did not see the postseason for the remainder of the decade, Smith continued to rack up All-Star appearances and Gold Gloves. Combined with the attention he received from his contract, Smith continued to be a national figure. Known as a savvy dresser, he made the April 1988 cover of  GQ  magazine. Boswell, Thomas. The Wizardry of Ozzie Smith. GQ. April 1988. Smith was witness to change within the Cardinal organization when owner  |Gussie_Busch|Gussie_Busch|  died in 1989 and Herzog quit as manager during the 1990 season.   |Hummel_2007|Hum07| |Joe_Torre|Joe_Torre|  became Smiths new manager in 1990, but the team did not reach the postseason during Torres nearly five-year tenure.  |Rains_2003|Rai03| |Rains_2003|Rai03| |St._Louis|1992_St._Louis_Cardinals_Season|  had a one-game lead in the National League East division on June 1, 1992, but injuries took their toll on the team, including Smiths two-week illness in late July after contracting  |chicken_pox|Chicken_Pox|  for the first time.  As a testament to his national visibility during this time, Smith appeared in a 1992 episode of  The Simpsons  titled  |Homer_at_the_Bat|Homer_At_The_Bat|  .  Smith became a free agent for the first time in his career on November 2, 1992, only to sign a new contract with the Cardinals on December 6.      Smith won his final Gold Glove in 1992, and his 13 consecutive Gold Gloves at  |shortstop|List_Of_Nl_Gold_Glove_Winners_At_Shortstop|  in the National League has yet to be matched.  The 1993 season marked the only time between 1981 and 1996 that Smith failed to make the All-Star team, and Smith finished the 1993 season with a .288 batting average and .974 fielding percentage. He appeared in 98 games during the  |strike-shortened|1994–95_Major_League_Baseball_Strike|  1994 season, and later missed nearly three months of the 1995 season after shoulder surgery on May 31.   Smith was recognized for his community service efforts with the  |1994_Branch_Rickey_Award|Branch_Rickey_Award|  and the  |1995_Roberto_Clemente_Award|Roberto_Clemente_Award| . In February 1994, Smith took on the role of honorary chairman and official spokesman for the Missouri Governors Council on Physical Fitness and Health.

After General Manager  |Walt_Jocketty|Walt_Jocketty|  acquired shortstop  |Royce_Clayton|Royce_Clayton|  during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win.  |Rains_2009|Rai09| |platoon_situation|Platoon_System|  that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game.  |Rains_2009|Rai09| |Rains_2009|Rai09| |hamstring|Hamstring|  injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended.  |Rains_2009|Rai09| |Rains_2003|Rai03|    As Smith made his final tour of the National League, he was honored by many teams, and received a standing ovation at the  |1996_All-Star_Game|1996_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game|  in Philadelphia. Between June 19 and September 1, Smiths batting average increased from .239 to .286.

The Cardinals held a special ceremony at Busch Stadium on September 28, 1996, before a game against the  |Cincinnati_Reds|1996_Cincinnati_Reds_Season| , honoring Smith by retiring his uniform number. Noted for his ritual backflip before Opening Days, All-Star Games, and postseason games, Smith chose this occasion to perform it for one of the last times.     In the postseason, the Cardinals first faced the  |San_Diego_Padres|1996_San_Diego_Padres_Season|  in the  |1996_National_League_Division_Series|1996_National_League_Division_Series| .

Upon receiving the start in Game 5, Smith nearly duplicated his Game 1 performance with four putouts, one assist, and zero hits in four at-bats as part of another Cardinals defeat.  The Cardinals also failed to win Game 6 or Game 7 in Atlanta, ending their season.  When the Cardinals were trailing by 10 runs during Game 7 on October 17, Smith flied out to right field while pinch-hitting in the sixth inning, marking the end of his playing career.
