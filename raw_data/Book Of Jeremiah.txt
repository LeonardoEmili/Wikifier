   The Book of Jeremiah  is the second of the  |Latter_Prophets|Latter_Prophets|  in the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| , and the second of the Prophets in the Christian  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament| . The superscription at chapter  |Jeremiah_1:1–3|Jeremiah_1Superscription|  identifies the book as the words of  |Jeremiah|Jeremiah|  son of Hilkiah . Of all the prophets, Jeremiah comes through most clearly as a person, ruminating to his scribe  |Baruch|Baruch_Ben_Neriah|  about his role as a servant of God with little good news for his audience. His book is intended as a message to the Jews in exile in Babylon, explaining the disaster of exile as Gods response to Israels pagan worship: the people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children, their infidelity and rebelliousness made judgement inevitable, although restoration and a new covenant are foreshadowed. Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably to be found in the poetic sections of  |chapters_1|Jeremiah_1| |–25|Jeremiah_25| , but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by the prophets followers and later generations of Deuteronomists. It has come down in two distinct though related versions, one in Hebrew, the other known from a Greek translation. The date of the two can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the  |Masoretic|Masoretic|  shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE.       :     It is difficult to discern any structure in Jeremiah, probably because the book had such a long and complex composition history. It can be divided into roughly six sections:  |Chapters_1|Jeremiah_1| |–25|Jeremiah_25| |Chapters_26|Jeremiah_26| |–29|Jeremiah_29| |Chapters_30|Jeremiah_30| |–33|Jeremiah_33| |Chapters_34|Jeremiah_34| |–45|Jeremiah_45| |Chapters_46|Jeremiah_46| |–51|Jeremiah_51| |Chapter_52|Jeremiah_52|                The background to Jeremiah is briefly described in the superscription to the book: Jeremiah began his prophetic mission in the thirteenth year of king  |Josiah|Josiah|  and finished in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah , when Jerusalem went into exile in the sixth month. During this period, Josiah changed the Judahite religion, Babylon destroyed Assyria, Egypt briefly imposed vassal status on  |Judah|Kingdom_Of_Judah| , Babylon defeated Egypt and made Judah a  |Babylonian_vassal|Yehud|  , Judah revolted but was subjugated again by Babylon , and Judah revolted once more. This revolt was the final one: Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple and exiled its king and many of the leading citizens in 586 BC, ending Judahs existence as an independent or quasi-independent kingdom and inaugurating the  |Babylonian_exile|Babylonian_Exile| .       The book can be conveniently divided into biographical, prose and poetic strands, each of which can be summarised separately.   The biographical material is to be found in  |chapters_26|Jeremiah_26| |–29|Jeremiah_29| ,  |32|Jeremiah_32| , and  |34|Jeremiah_34| |–44|Jeremiah_44| , and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 BCE; it provides precise dates for the prophets activities beginning in 609 BCE. The non-biographical prose passages, such as the Temple sermon in  |chapter_7|Jeremiah_7|  and the covenant passage in , are scattered throughout the book; they show clear affinities with the  |Deuteronomists|Deuteronomist| , the school of writers and editors who shaped the series of history books from  |Judges|Book_Of_Judges|  to  |Kings|Books_Of_Kings| , and while it is unlikely they come directly from Jeremiah, they may well have their roots in traditions about what he said and did.   The poetic material is found largely in  |chapters_1|Jeremiah_1| |–25|Jeremiah_25|  and consists of oracles in which the prophet speaks as Gods messenger. These passages, dealing with Israels unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context, but it is widely accepted that they represent the teachings of Jeremiah and are the earliest stage of the book. Allied to them, and also probably a reflection of the authentic Jeremiah, are further poetic passages of a more personal nature, which have been called Jeremiahs confessions or spiritual diary. In these poems the prophet agonises over the apparent failure of his mission, is consumed by bitterness at those who oppose or ignore him, and accuses God of betraying him.            Jeremiah exists in two versions, a Greek translation, called the Septuagint, dating from the last few centuries before Christ and found in the earliest Christian manuscripts, and the  |Masoretic|Masoretic|  Hebrew text of traditional Jewish bibles – the Greek version is shorter than the Hebrew by about one eighth, and arranges the material differently. Equivalents of both versions were found among the  |Dead_Sea_Scrolls|Dead_Sea_Scrolls| , so that is clear that the differences mark important stages in the transmission of the text. Most scholars hold that the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint version is older than the Masoretic text, and that the Masoretic evolved either from this or from a closely related version. The Oxford Handbook of the Prophets, Oxford University Press, 2016, edited Carolyn Sharp, author Marvin A Sweeney, p. 456 The shorter version ultimately became canonical in Greek Orthodox churches, while the longer was adopted in Judaism and in Western Christian churches.       It is generally agreed that the three types of material interspersed through the book – poetic, narrative, and biographical – come from different sources or circles. Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably to be found in the poetic sections of  |chapters_1|Jeremiah_1| |–25|Jeremiah_25| , but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by followers and later generations of Deuteronomists. The date of the final versions of the book can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the  |Masoretic|Masoretic|  shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE.       The Book of Jeremiah grew over a long period of time. The Greek stage, looking forward to the fall of Babylon and aligning in places with Second  |Isaiah|Book_Of_Isaiah| , had already seen major redaction in terms of overall structure, the superscriptions , the assignment of historical settings, and arrangement of material, and may have been completed by the late Exilic period ; the initial stages of the Masoretic Hebrew version may have been written not long afterwards, although chapter  points to a setting in post-exilic times.       According to its opening verses the book records the prophetic utterances of the priest  |Jeremiah|Jeremiah|  son of Hilkiah, to whom the word of  |YHWH|Yhwh|  came in the days of king Josiah and after. Jeremiah lived during a turbulent period, the final years of the kingdom of Judah, from the death of king  |Josiah|Josiah|  and the loss of independence that followed, through the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and the exile of much its population . The book depicts a remarkably introspective prophet, impetuous and often angered by the role into which he has been thrust, alternating efforts to warn the people with pleas to God for mercy, until he is ordered to pray no more for this people. He engages in extensive  |performance_art|Performance_Art| , walking about in the streets with a yoke about his neck and engaging in other efforts to attract attention. He is taunted and retaliates, is thrown in jail as the result, and at one point is thrown into a pit to die.       The  |Deuteronomists|Deuteronomist|  were a school or movement who edited the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings into a more or less unified history of Israel during the Jewish exile in Babylon . It is argued that the Deuteronomists played an important role in the production of the book of Jeremiah; for example, there is clear Deuteronomistic language in  |chapter_25|Jeremiah_25| , in which the prophet looks back over twenty-three years of unheeded prophecy. From the Deuteronomistic perspective the prophetic role implied, more than anything else, concern with law and covenant after the manner of Moses. On this reading Jeremiah was the last of a long line of prophets sent to warn Israel of the consequences of infidelity to God; unlike the Deuteronomists, for whom the call for repentance was always central, Jeremiah seems at some point in his career to have decided that further intercession was pointless, and that Israels fate was sealed.       The books superscription claims that Jeremiah was active for forty years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah to the fall of Jerusalem in 587. It is clear from the last chapters of the book, however, that he continued to speak in Egypt after the assassination of  |Gedaliah|Gedaliah| , the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah, in 582. This suggests that the superscription is trying to make a theological point about Jeremiah by comparing him to  |Moses|Moses|  – where Moses spent forty years leading Israel from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, Jeremiahs forty years saw Israel exiled from the land and Jeremiah himself ultimately in exile in Egypt.              Much of Jeremiahs prophetic preaching is based on the theme of the covenant between God and Israel : Jeremiah insists that the covenant is conditional, and can be broken by Israels apostasy . The people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness makes judgement inevitable. Interspersed with this are references to repentance and renewal, although it is unclear whether Jeremiah thought that repentance could ward off judgement or whether it would have to follow judgement. The theme of restoration is strongest in  |chapter_31:32|Jeremiah_31Verse_32| , which looks to a future in which a  |new_covenant|New_Covenant|  made with Israel and Judah, one which will not be broken. This is the theme of the  |new_covenant|New_Covenant|  passage at  |chapter_31:31–34|Jeremiah_31The_New_Covenant| , drawing on Israels past relationship with God through the covenant at Sinai to foresee a new future in which Israel will be obedient to God.
