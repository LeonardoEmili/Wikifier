In  |number_theory|Number_Theory| , the prime number theorem  describes the  |asymptotic|Asymptotic_Analysis|  distribution of the  |prime_numbers|Prime_Number|  among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs. The theorem was proved independently by  |Jacques_Hadamard|Jacques_Hadamard|  and  |Charles_Jean_de_la_Vallée_Poussin|Charles_Jean_De_La_Vallée_Poussin|  in 1896 using ideas introduced by  |Bernhard_Riemann|Bernhard_Riemann|  .     The first such distribution found is , where  is the  |prime-counting_function|Prime-Counting_Function|  and  is the  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm|  of . This means that for large enough , the  |probability|Probability|  that a random integer not greater than  is prime is very close to . Consequently, a random integer with at most  digits  is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most  digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime , whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime . In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first  integers is roughly .                   Let  be the  |prime-counting_function|Prime-Counting_Function|  that gives the number of primes less than or equal to , for any real number  . For example,  because there are four prime numbers less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that  is a good approximation to , in the sense that the  |limit|Limit_Of_A_Function|  of the quotient of the two functions  and  as  increases without bound is 1:     :   1,     known as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. Using  |asymptotic_notation|Asymptotic_Notation|  this result can be restated as     :         This notation  does not say anything about the limit of the difference of the two functions as  increases without bound. Instead, the theorem states that  approximates  in the sense that the  |relative_error|Relative_Error|  of this approximation approaches 0 as  increases without bound.     The prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the th prime number  satisfies     : pn   n      the asymptotic notation meaning, again, that the relative error of this approximation approaches 0 as  increases without bound. For example, the th prime number is ,  and log rounds to , a relative error of about 6.4%.     The prime number theorem is also equivalent to   :           where  and  are  |the_first_and_the_second_Chebyshev_functions|Chebyshev_Function|  respectively.         Based on the tables by  |Anton_Felkel|Anton_Felkel|  and  |Jurij_Vega|Jurij_Vega| ,  |Adrien-Marie_Legendre|Adrien-Marie_Legendre|  conjectured in 1797 or 1798 that  is approximated by the function , where  and  are unspecified constants. In the second edition of his book on number theory he then made a  |more_precise_conjecture|Legendres_Constant| , with  and .  |Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|Carl_Friedrich_Gauss|  considered the same question at age 15 or 16 in the year 1792 or 1793 , according to his own recollection in 1849. C. F. Gauss. Werke, Bd 2, 1st ed, 444–447. Göttingen 1863. In 1838  |Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet|Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet|  came up with his own approximating function, the  |logarithmic_integral|Logarithmic_Integral|   . Both Legendres and Dirichlets formulas imply the same conjectured asymptotic equivalence of  and  stated above, although it turned out that Dirichlets approximation is considerably better if one considers the differences instead of quotients.     In two papers from 1848 and 1850, the Russian mathematician  |Pafnuty_Chebyshev|Pafnuty_Chebyshev|  attempted to prove the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. His work is notable for the use of the zeta function , for real values of the argument  , as in works of  |Leonhard_Euler|Leonhard_Euler| , as early as 1737. Chebyshevs papers predated Riemanns celebrated memoir of 1859, and he succeeded in proving a slightly weaker form of the asymptotic law, namely, that if the limit of  as  goes to infinity exists at all, then it is necessarily equal to one.  He was able to prove unconditionally that this ratio is bounded above and below by two explicitly given constants near 1, for all sufficiently large .  Although Chebyshevs paper did not prove the Prime Number Theorem, his estimates for  were strong enough for him to prove  |Bertrands_postulate|Bertrands_Postulate|  that there exists a prime number between  and  for any integer .     An important paper concerning the distribution of prime numbers was Riemanns 1859 memoir  |On_the_Number_of_Primes_Less_Than_a_Given_Magnitude|On_The_Number_Of_Primes_Less_Than_A_Given_Magnitude|  , the only paper he ever wrote on the subject. Riemann introduced new ideas into the subject, the chief of them being that the distribution of prime numbers is intimately connected with the zeros of the analytically extended Riemann zeta function of a complex variable. In particular, it is in this paper of Riemann that the idea to apply methods of  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis|  to the study of the real function  originates. Extending the ideas of Riemann, two proofs of the asymptotic law of the distribution of prime numbers were obtained independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée Poussin and appeared in the same year . Both proofs used methods from complex analysis, establishing as a main step of the proof that the Riemann zeta function  is non-zero for all complex values of the variable  that have the form  with  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math    .     In Pierre Dusarts thesis there are stronger versions of this type of inequality that are valid for larger . Later in 2010, Dusart proved:      :       & ,   :   .
