Conversion of units is the conversion between different  |units_of_measurement|Units_Of_Measurement|  for the same  |quantity|Quantity| , typically through multiplicative conversion factors.                  The process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose. This may be governed by regulation,  |contract|Contract| ,  |technical_specifications|Technical_Specifications|  or other published  |standards|Technical_Standard| . Engineering judgment may include such factors as:   The  |precision_and_accuracy|Precision_And_Accuracy|  of measurement and the associated  |uncertainty_of_measurement|Uncertainty_Of_Measurement| .   The statistical  |confidence_interval|Confidence_Interval|  or  |tolerance_interval|Tolerance_Interval|  of the initial measurement.   The number of  |significant_figures|Significant_Figures|  of the measurement.   The intended use of the measurement including the  |engineering_tolerances|Engineering_Tolerance| .   Historical definitions of the units and their derivatives used in old measurements; e.g.,  |international_foot|International_Foot|  vs. US  |survey_foot|Foot_Survey_Foot| .     Some conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement. This is sometimes called soft conversion. It does not involve changing the physical configuration of the item being measured.     By contrast, a hard conversion or an adaptive conversion may not be exactly equivalent. It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item.  |Nominal_values|Real_Versus_Nominal_Value|  are sometimes allowed and used.       A conversion factor is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value. The unity bracket method of unit conversion  consists of a fraction in which the denominator is equal to the numerator, but they are in different units. Because of the identity property of multiplication, the value of a quantity will not change as long as it is multiplied by one.  Also, if the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal to each other, then the fraction is equal to one. So as long as the numerator and denominator of the fraction are equivalent, they will not affect the value of the measured quantity.     The following example demonstrates how the unity bracket method  is used to convert the rate 5 kilometers per second to meters per second. The symbols km, m, and s represent kilometer, meter, and second, respectively.                       Thus, it is found that 5 kilometers per second is equal to 5000 meters per second.       There are many conversion tools. They are found in the function libraries of applications such as spreadsheets databases, in calculators, and in macro packages and plugins for many other applications such as the mathematical, scientific and technical applications.     There are many standalone applications that offer the thousands of the various units with conversions. For example, the  |free_software_movement|Free_Software_Movement|  offers a command line utility  for Linux and Windows.          This article gives lists of conversion factors for each of a number of physical quantities, which are listed in the index. For each physical quantity, a number of different units are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit. Conversions between units in the  |metric_system|Metric_System|  are defined by their  |prefixes|Si_Prefix|  and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name . Within each table, the units are listed alphabetically, and the  |SI|Si|  units are highlighted.
