                 A carbohydrate  is a  |biomolecule|Biomolecule|  consisting of  |carbon|Carbon|  ,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |oxygen|Oxygen|  atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen  |atom|Atom|  ratio of 2:1 and thus with the  |empirical_formula|Empirical_Formula|   . This formula holds true for  |monosaccharides|Monosaccharide| . Some exceptions exist; for example,  |deoxyribose|Deoxyribose| , a sugar component of  |DNA|Dna| ,  has the empirical formula C 5 H 10 O 4 .  The carbohydrates are technically  |hydrates|Hydrate|  of carbon; structurally it is more accurate to view them as  |aldoses|Aldose|  and  |ketoses|Ketose| .     The term is most common in  |biochemistry|Biochemistry| , where it is a synonym of saccharide, a group that includes  |sugars|Sugar| ,  |starch|Starch| , and  |cellulose|Cellulose| . The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides,  |disaccharides|Disaccharide| ,  |oligosaccharides|Oligosaccharide| , and  |polysaccharides|Polysaccharide| . Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest  carbohydrates, are commonly referred to as sugars.  The word saccharide comes from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  word σάκχαρον , meaning sugar .  While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix  |_ose|_Ose| , as in the monosaccharides  |fructose|Fructose|  and  |glucose|Glucose|  and the disaccharides  |sucrose|Sucrose|   and  |lactose|Lactose|  .     Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for the storage of  |energy|Energy|   and as structural components . The 5-carbon monosaccharide  |ribose|Ribose|  is an important component of  |coenzymes|Coenzyme|   and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as  |RNA|Rna| . The related  |deoxyribose|Deoxyribose|  is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important  |biomolecules|Biomolecules|  that play key roles in the  |immune_system|Immune_System| ,  |fertilization|Fertilization| , preventing  |pathogenesis|Pathogenesis| ,  |blood_clotting|Blood_Clotting| , and  |development|Developmental_Biology| .      They are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide. It is abundant in cereals , potatoes, and processed food based on cereal  |flour|Flour| , such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar , lactose , glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in  |honey|Honey| , many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey are often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.     Cellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble  |dietary_fiber|Dietary_Fiber| . Although it is not digestible, insoluble dietary fiber helps to maintain a healthy digestive system USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 14 by easing  |defecation|Defecation| . Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include  |resistant_starch|Resistant_Starch|  and  |inulin|Inulin| , which feed some bacteria in the  |microbiota|Microbiota|  of the  |large_intestine|Large_Intestine| , and are  |metabolized|Metabolism|  by these bacteria to yield  |short_chain_fatty_acids|Short_Chain_Fatty_Acids| .         In scientific literature, the term carbohydrate has many synonyms, like sugar , saccharide , ose , glucide ,  hydrate of carbon or  |polyhydroxy|Hydroxy_Group|  compounds with  |aldehyde|Aldehyde|  or  |ketone|Ketone|  . Some of these terms, specially carbohydrate and sugar , are also used with other meanings.     In  |food_science|Food_Science|  and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate  |starch|Starch|  or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar .     Often in lists of  |nutritional_information|Nutritional_Information| , such as the  |USDA_National_Nutrient_Database|Usda_National_Nutrient_Database| , the term carbohydrate is used for everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol. USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 13 This includes chemical compounds such as  |acetic|Acetic_Acid|  or  |lactic_acid|Lactic_Acid| , which are not normally considered carbohydrates. It also includes  |dietary_fiber|Dietary_Fiber|  which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute much in the way of  |food_energy|Food_Energy|  , even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as though it were a sugar.     In the strict sense,  |sugar|Sugar|  is applied for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food.       Formerly the name carbohydrate was used in  |chemistry|Chemistry|  for any compound with the formula C m n . Following this definition, some chemists considered  |formaldehyde|Formaldehyde|  to be the simplest carbohydrate,  while others claimed that title for  |glycolaldehyde|Glycolaldehyde| .  Today, the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula. For example, while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates, ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this. For example, carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as: N-acetyl , sulphate , carboxylic acid and deoxy modifications .     Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called  |monosaccharides|Monosaccharide|  with general formula n where n is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H– x – y –H, that is, an  |aldehyde|Aldehyde|  or  |ketone|Ketone|  with many  |hydroxyl|Hydroxyl|  groups added, usually one on each  |carbon|Carbon| |_atom|Atom|  that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone  |functional_group|Functional_Group| . Examples of monosaccharides are  |glucose|Glucose| ,  |fructose|Fructose| , and  |glyceraldehydes|Glyceraldehyde| . However, some biological substances commonly called monosaccharides do not conform to this formula  and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides .      The  |open_chain|Open_Chain|  form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a  |closed_ring_form|Heterocyclic_Compound|  where the  |aldehyde|Aldehyde| / |ketone|Ketone| |_carbonyl|Carbonyl|  group carbon and hydroxyl group react forming a  |hemiacetal|Hemiacetal|  with a new C–O–C bridge.     Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called  |polysaccharides|Polysaccharide|   in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example,  |deoxyribose|Deoxyribose| , a component of  |DNA|Dna| , is a modified version of  |ribose|Ribose| ;  |chitin|Chitin|  is composed of repeating units of  |N_acetyl_glucosamine|N_Acetyl_Glucosamine| , a  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| -containing form of glucose.       Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type. They may be classified according to their degree of polymerization, and may be divided initially into three principal groups, namely sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides     |ub_su|Ub_Su|  sub /sub div class thumb tleft div class thumbinner style width:187px;  div class thumbcaption  sub /sub ref  /ref /div /div /div  ref  /ref  sub /sub sup /sup  ref  /ref  ref namepigman  /ref  sub /sub sub /sub  ref  /ref  sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub   ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name pmid28836672  /ref !-- This title is used as a redirect target --  ref  /ref  ref nameNutSource  /ref ref nameNutSource /  ref nameJenkins  /ref  ref  /ref  !-- safety / AEs --  ref namemort  /ref ref namefibre  /ref  ref nameobes  /ref !-- weight -- ref nameendo  /ref  ref nameendo/  ref nameendo/  ref nametob  /ref  ref nameendo/ ref namehall  /ref  ref nameman  /ref ref nameght  /ref !-- diabetes --  ref namebrouns  /ref ref namemeng  /ref ref nameada/  ref nameups  /ref  ref nameada  /ref !-- keto --  ref namebda-2018/  ref namebda-2018  /ref  ref namebda-2018/  ref name Maughan  /ref  ref name energetics  /ref  ref name Maughan /         .
