   Mary of Bethany  is a  |biblical|Bible|  figure described in the  |Gospels|Gospels|  of  |John|Gospel_Of_John|  and  |Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke|  in the  |Christian|Christianity| |_New_Testament|New_Testament| . Together with her siblings  |Lazarus|Lazarus_Of_Bethany|  and  |Martha|Martha| , she is described by John as living in the village of  |Bethany|Bethany|  near  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| ; in Luke only the two sisters, living in an unnamed village, are mentioned. Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two sets of sisters named as Mary and Martha are the same, though this is not conclusively stated in the Gospels, and  |the_proliferation_of_New_Testament_Marys_|New_Testament_People_Named_Mary|  is notorious. See the Gospel texts, and Schiller, Gertud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I, pp. 158–59, 1971 , Lund Humphries, London,      Medieval  |Western_Christianity|Western_Christianity|  identified Mary of Bethany with  |Mary_Magdalene|Mary_Magdalene|  and with the sinful woman of . This influenced the  |Roman_Rite|Roman_Rite| |_liturgy|Liturgy|  of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a  |collect|Collect|  referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the  |1969_revision|Mysterii_Paschalis|  of that liturgy, Mary Magdalenes feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the  |memorial|Memorial|  of their sister Martha. Martyrologium Romanum , pp. 383, 398 In  |Eastern_Christianity|Eastern_Christianity|  and some  |Protestant|Protestant|  traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are considered separate people. Carol Ann Newsom, Sharon H. Ringe, Jacqueline E. Lapsley , Womens Bible Commentary, p. 532: Although Eastern Orthodox Scholars never subscribed to this conflation of Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany and the unnamed sinner, Gregory The Greats interpretation cemented Mary Magdalenes reputation as a penitent sinner for most of her interpretive history in the West  The  |Orthodox_Church|Orthodox_Church|  has its own traditions regarding Mary of Bethanys life beyond the  |gospel|Gospel|  accounts.         In the  |Gospel_of_Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke| , Jesus visits the home of two sisters named Mary and Martha, living in an unnamed village. Mary is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was cumbered about many things  while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen the better part, that of listening to the masters discourse. ,  |Eastons_Bible_Dictionary|Eastons_Bible_Dictionary| , 1897. The name of their village is not recorded.         For Mary to sit at Jesus feet, and for him to allow her to do so, was itself controversial. In doing so, as one commentator notes, Mary took the place of a disciple by sitting at the feet of the teacher. It was unusual for a woman in first-century Judaism to be accepted by a teacher as a disciple.      In the  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John| , a Mary appears in connection to two incidents: the  |raising_from_the_dead|Lazarus_Of_Bethanythe_Raising_Of_Lazarus|  of her brother Lazarus and the  |anointing_of_Jesus|Anointing_Of_Jesus| . The identification of this being the same Mary in both incidents is given explicitly by the author: Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.  The mention of her sister Martha suggests a connection with the aforementioned woman in Luke.     In the account of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha followed by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in Luke 10:38–42.  When Mary meets Jesus, she falls at his feet. In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brothers death: Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.  But where Jesus response to Martha is one of teaching, calling her to hope and faith, his response to Mary is more emotional: When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. As the 17th century Welsh commentator  |Matthew_Henry|Matthew_Henry|  notes, Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more.           A narrative in which Mary of Bethany plays a central role is the  |anointing_of_Jesus|Anointing_Of_Jesus| , an event reported in the  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John|  in which a woman pours the entire contents of an  |alabastron|Alabastron|  of very expensive  |perfume|Perfume|  over the feet of Jesus. Only in this account is the woman identified as Mary, with the earlier reference in  establishing her as the sister of Martha and Lazarus.          The womans name is not given in the Gospels of  |Matthew|Gospel_Of_Matthew|  and  |Mark|Gospel_Of_Mark| , but the event is likewise placed in Bethany, specifically at the home of one  |Simon_the_Leper|Simon_The_Leper| , a man whose significance is not explained elsewhere in the gospels.     According to the Markan account, the perfume was the purest of  |spikenard|Spikenard| . Some of the onlookers were angered because this expensive perfume could have been sold for a years wages, which Mark enumerates as 300  |denarii|Denarii| , and the money given to the poor. The Gospel of Matthew states that the disciples were indignant and Johns gospel states that it was  |Judas_Iscariot|Judas_Iscariot|  who was most offended . In the accounts, Jesus justifies Marys action by stating that they would always have the poor among them and would be able to help them whenever they desired, but that he would not always be with them and says that her anointing was done to prepare him for his burial. As one commentator notes, Mary seems to have been the only one who was sensitive to the impending death of Jesus and who was willing to give a material expression of her esteem for him. Jesus reply shows his appreciation of her act of devotion. The accounts in Matthew and Mark adds these words of Jesus, I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her .      Easton noted that it would appear from the circumstances that the family of Lazarus possessed a family vault and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to console them on the death of Lazarus, that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people. This would help explain how Mary of Bethany could afford to possess quantities of expensive perfume.     A similar anointing is described in the  |Gospel_of_Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke|  as occurring at the home of one Simon the  |Pharisee|Pharisee|  in which a woman who had been sinful all her life, and who was crying, anointed Jesus feet and, when her tears started to fall on his feet, she wiped them with her hair. Lukes account differs from that of Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events. Discussed in Van Til, Kent A.  ,  |Journal_of_Pentecostal_Theology|Journal_Of_Pentecostal_Theology| , Volume 15, Number 1, 2006, pp. 73–82. However, the author of this article does not himself hold to this view.     Jesus response to the anointing in Luke is completely different from that recorded in the other gospels to the anointing in their accounts. Rather than Jesus above-mentioned comments on the poor you will always have with you , in Luke he tells his host the  |Parable_of_the_Two_Debtors|Parable_Of_The_Two_Debtors| . As one commentator notes, Luke is the only one to record the parable of the two debtors, and he chooses to preserve it in this setting... If one considers the other gospel accounts as a variation of the same event, it is likely that the parable is not authentically set. Otherwise, the powerful message from the parable located in this setting would likely be preserved elsewhere, too. However, if one considers the story historically accurate, happening in Jesus life apart from the similar incidents recorded in the other gospels, the question of the authenticity of the parable receives a different answer... John Nolland, following Wilckens ideas, writes: There can hardly be a prior form of the episode not containing the present parable, since this would leave the Pharisees concerns of v 39 with no adequate response. Hersey, Kim.  , Wesley Center for Applied Theology, Northwest Nazarene University.       In medieval  |Western_Christian|Western_Christianity|  tradition, Mary of Bethany was identified as  |Mary_Magdalene|Mary_Magdalene|  perhaps in large part because of a  |homily|Homily|  given by  |Pope_Gregory_the_Great|Pope_Gregory_The_Great|  in which he taught about several women in the New Testament as though they were the same person. This led to a conflation of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene as well as with another woman , and the woman caught in adultery.  |Eastern_Christianity|Eastern_Christianity|  never adopted this identification. In his article in the 1910  Catholic Encyclopedia ,  |Hugh_Pope|Hugh_Pope|  stated, The Greek Fathers, as a whole, distinguish the three persons: the sinner of ; the sister of Martha and Lazarus,  and ; and Mary Magdalen. Pope, H. . , in The  |Catholic_Encyclopedia|Catholic_Encyclopedia| . New York: Robert Appleton Company.     Father Hugh Pope enumerated the accounts of each of these three persons in the Gospel of Luke and concluded that, based on these accounts, “there is no suggestion of an identification of the three persons, and if we had only Luke to guide us we should certainly have no grounds for so identifying them ” He then explains first the position, at that time general among Catholics, equating Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman of Luke by referring to , where Mary is identified as the woman who anointed Jesus, and noting that this reference is given before Johns account of the anointing in Bethany:     John, however, clearly identifies Mary of Bethany with the woman who anointed Christs feet . It is remarkable that already in , John has spoken of Mary as she that anointed the Lords feet , he aleipsasa. It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in ; but it may be questioned whether he would have used he aleipsasa if another woman, and she a sinner in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that John, just because he is writing so long after the event and at a time when Mary was dead, wishes to point out to us that she was really the same as the sinner. In the same way Luke may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of St. Matthew whose identity with Levi the publican he conceals. If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the sinner are one and the same.     Hugh Pope then explained the identification of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene by the presumption that, because of Jesus’ high praise of her deed of anointing him, it would be incredible that she should also not have been at his crucifixion and resurrection. Since Mary Magdalene is reported to have been present on those occasions, by this reasoning, she must therefore be the same person as Mary of Bethany:     An examination of Johns Gospel makes it almost impossible to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From John we learn the name of the woman who anointed Christs feet previous to the last supper. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because Matthew and Mark say two days before the Passover , while John says six days there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. John does not necessarily mean that the supper and the anointing took place six days before, but only that Christ came to Bethany six days before the Passover. At that supper, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, she hath wrought a good work upon Me...in pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done it for My burial...wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached...that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her. Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the cross, nor at the tomb of Christ? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the Evangelists, stood at the foot of the cross and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the Resurrection. And while John calls her Mary Magdalen in 19:25, 20:1, and 20:18, he calls her simply Mary in 20:11 and 20:16.     French scholar Victor Saxer dates the identification of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute, and as Mary of Bethany, to a sermon by Pope Gregory the Great on September 21, 591 A.D., where he seemed to combine the actions of three women mentioned in the New Testament and also identified an unnamed woman as Mary Magdalene. In another sermon, Gregory specifically identified Mary Magdalene as the sister of Martha mentioned in Luke 10. referenced in  But according to a view expressed more recently by theologian Jane Schaberg, Gregory only put the final touch to a legend that already existed before him.      Western Christianitys identification of Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany was reflected in the arrangement of the  |General_Roman_Calendar|General_Roman_Calendar| , until this was altered in 1969, , p. 447 reflecting the fact that by then the common interpretation in the Catholic Church was that Mary of Bethany, Mary Magdalene and the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Jesus were three distinct women. , pp. 79–81       In Orthodox Church tradition, Mary of Bethany is honored as a separate individual from Mary Magdalene. Though they are not specifically named as such in the gospels, the Orthodox Church counts Mary and Martha among the  |Myrrh_bearing_Women|Myrrh_Bearers| . These faithful followers of Jesus stood at Golgotha during the  |Crucifixion_of_Jesus|Crucifixion_Of_Jesus|  and later came to his tomb early on the morning following the  |Sabbath|Biblical_Sabbath|  with  |myrrh|Myrrh|  , according to the Jewish tradition, to anoint their Lords body.
