A National partys legislative presence must be in the Lok Sabha. A State partys legislative presence must be in the State Assembly.   A party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own members.   A party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its status.    Recognition should be given to a party only on the basis of its own performance in elections and not because it is a splinter group of some other recognized party.     Criteria National party if:      it secures at least six percent  of the valid votes polled in any four or more states, at a general election to the House of the People or, to the State Legislative Assembly; and   in addition, it wins at least four seats in the House of the People from any State or States.   ;OR   it wins at least two percent  seats in the House of the People , and these members are elected from at least three different States.     Likewise, a political party shall be entitled to be recognized as a State party, if:     it secures at least six percent  of the valid votes polled in the State at a general election, either to the House of the People or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned; and   in addition, it wins at least two seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned.   ;OR   it wins at least three percent  of the total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State, or at least three seats in the Assembly, whichever is more.       Since 1984, when a strict anti-defection law was passed, there has been a tendency amongst the Indian politicians to float their own parties rather than join a broad based party such as the Congress or the BJP. For example, between the 1984 and 1989 elections, the number of parties contesting elections increased from 33 to 113. In the decades since, this fragmentation has continued.        India has a history of party alliances and breakdown of alliances. However, there are three party alliances regularly aligning on a national level in competing for Government positions.

        ", was a member party of the UPA. The alliance has no official leading party, and smaller parties often enter and leave the alliance according to political convenience. Many of these parties ally at national level but contest against each other at state level. The inherent problem with such a third front is that they are only bound together by the fact that they are not aligned to either of the two main alliances, and not through similar ideological stances. This often means that this alliance is merely an alliance in name and does not really provide a united front which can serve as an alternative to the two historically prominent alliances. Therefore, despite the presence of this Third front, and other seeming alternatives for those seeking options outside the INC or BJP, Indian politics by and large remains a de facto two party system at the national level.       Pre-election alliances are common in India with parties deciding to share seats. This is seen mainly on a state by state basis rather than on the national level. Candidate selection starts after seat sharing has been agreed by alliance partners.     Indian political parties have low level of internal party democracy and therefore, in Indian elections, both at the state or national level, party candidates are typically selected by the party elites, more commonly called the party high command. The party elites use a number of criteria for selecting candidates. These include the ability of the candidates to finance their own election, their educational attainment, and the level of organization the candidates have in their respective constituencies.  Quite often the last criterion is associated with candidate criminality.           Panchayati Raj Institutions or Local self-government bodies play a crucial role in Indian politics, as it focuses on grassroot-level administration in India.     On 24 April 1993, the Constitutional Act, 1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This Act was extended to Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight States, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan from 24 December 1996.     The Act aims to provide 3-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having population of over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every 5 years, to provide reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women, to appoint State Finance Commission to make recommendations as regards the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute District Planning Committee to prepare draft development plan for the district.             As with any other democracy, political parties represent different sections among the Indian society and regions, and their core values play a major role in the politics of India. Both the executive branch and the legislative branch of the government are run by the representatives of the political parties who have been elected through the elections. Through the electoral process, the people of India choose which representative and which political party should run the government. Through the elections any party may gain simple majority in the lower house. Coalitions are formed by the political parties, in case no single party gains a simple majority in the lower house. Unless a party or a coalition have a majority in the lower house, a government cannot be formed by that party or the coalition.          India has a ": null
