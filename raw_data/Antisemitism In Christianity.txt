   Antisemitism in Christianity is the hostility of  |Christian_Church|Christian_Church| es, Christian groups, and by  |Christians|Christians|  in general to  |Judaism|Judaism|  and the  |Jewish_people|Jewish_People| .     Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the  |early_years_of_Christianity|Apostolic_Age|  and was reinforced by the belief that Jews had  |killed_Christ|Jewish_Deicide|  and ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the  |ensuing_centuries|Early_Christianity| . The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of  |ostracism|Ostracism| ,  |humiliation|Humiliation| ,  |violence|Violence| , and  |murder|Murder| , culminating in the  |Holocaust|Holocaust| .       Christian  |antisemitism|Antisemitism|  has been attributed to numerous factors including  |theological_differences|Split_Of_Early_Christianity_And_Judaism| , competition between  |Church|Church|  and  |Synagogue|Synagogue| , the Christian drive for converts,  misunderstanding of Jewish beliefs and practices, and a perceived Jewish hostility toward Christians. These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. May 5, 2009.  as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews.     Modern antisemitism has been described as primarily hatred against Jews as a race with its modern expression rooted in 18th-century racial theories, while  |anti-Judaism|Anti-Judaism|  is described as hostility to Jewish religion, but in  |Western_Christianity|Western_Christianity|  it effectively merged into antisemitism during the 12th century.  Scholars have debated how Christian antisemitism played a role in the  |Nazi|Nazi| |Third_Reich|Third_Reich| ,  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  and  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust| . The Holocaust has driven many within Christianity to reflect on the relationship between Christian theology, practices, and that genocide. Heschel, Susannah, , p. 20, Princeton University Press, 2008          Christianity and Judaism differed in their legal status in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| |Jewish_people|Jewish_People|  and Jewish  |proselytes|Proselyte| , was generally exempt from obligation to the  |Roman_imperial_cult|Imperial_Cult|  and since the reign of  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  enjoyed the status of a licit religion , though there were also occasional persecutions, for example in 19  |Tiberius|Tiberius|  expelled the Jews from Rome, Suetonius,  |Lives_of_the_Twelve_Caesars|Lives_Of_The_Twelve_Caesars| , Tiberius 36 as  |Claudius|Claudius|  did again in 49. Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Claudius XXV.4, referenced in  Christianity however was not restricted to one people, and as Jewish Christians were excluded from the  |synagogue|Synagogue|  , they also lost the protection of the status of Judaism, though said protection did have its limits .     From the reign of  |Nero|Nero|  onwards, who is said by  |Tacitus|Tacitus|  to have blamed the  |Great_Fire_of_Rome|Great_Fire_Of_Rome|  on Christians, Christianity was considered to be illegal and Christians were frequently subjected to  |persecution|Persecution_Of_Christianspersecution_Of_Early_Christians_In_The_Roman_Empire| , differing regionally. Comparably, Judaism suffered the setbacks of the  |Jewish-Roman_wars|Jewish–Roman_Wars| , remembered in the legacy of the  |Ten_Martyrs|Ten_Martyrs| .  |Robin_Lane_Fox|Robin_Lane_Fox|  traces the origin of much later hostility to the period of persecution, where the commonest test by the authorities of a suspected Christian was to require homage to be paid to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement as long as they paid the  |Fiscus_Judaicus|Fiscus_Judaicus| , and Christians would say they were Jewish but refused to pay the tax. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians as Jewish, often leading to their execution. In  The  |Birkat_haMinim|Birkat_Haminim|  was often brought forward as support for this charge that the Jews were responsible for the  |Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire|Persecution_Of_Christians_In_The_Roman_Empire| . In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until  |Constantines|Constantine_I|  conversion to Christianity. In 390  |Theodosius_I|Theodosius_I|  made Christianity the  |state_church_of_the_Roman_Empire|State_Church_Of_The_Roman_Empire| . While pagan cults and  |Manichaeism|Manichaeism|  were suppressed, Judaism retained its legal status as a licit religion, though anti-Jewish violence still occurred. In the 5th century, some legal measures worsened the status of the  |Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire|Jews_In_The_Roman_Empire|  .     Another point of contention for Christians concerning Judaism, which according to the modern KJV of the Protestant Bible, is attributed more to a religious bias, rather than an issue of race or being a Semite . Paul  clarifies this point in the letter to the Galatians where he makes plain his declaration ″28There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 29And if ye be Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.″ Further Paul states: ″15Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a mans covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. 16Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.″ Many misled Christians read Matthew 23, John 8:44, Revelations 2:9, 3:9, and wrongly believe the term Jew is meaning a Hebrew or Semite...it does not, but rather to the religious belief of Judaism.  A perfect real life example of this clarification is Brother Nathanael a Christian Hebrew.                   Jesus is rejected in  |Judaism|Judaism|  as a failed  |Jewish_Messiah_claimant|Jewish_Messiah_Claimants|  and a  |false_prophet|Falseprophetjudaism| .     Belief in the divinity of any human being is incompatible with  |Judaism|Judaism|   However, since the traditional Jewish belief is that the  |messiah|Jewish_Messianism|  has not yet come and the  |Messianic_Age|Messianic_Age|  is not yet present, the total  |rejection_of_Jesus|Rejection_Of_Jesus|  as either messiah or  |deity|Deity|  has never been a central issue for Judaism.     If Christianity had come from Judaism and Jesus was a Jew, how and why did the Jews reject such core elements of Christianity? The most widely held explanation, believed by most Christians for early history, was that Jews had been the chosen people but broke the covenant with God, and were condemned to spend the rest of eternity suffering on earth, a symbol of degradation and sub-humanity. According to Jews, however, it is because Jesus failed to meet various messianic prophesies. It was because of this belief that many Medieval European rulers protected the Jews, but considered them property of the king. The Butchers Tale          Many New Testament passages criticise the  |Pharisees|Pharisees|  and it has been argued that these passages have shaped the way that Christians viewed Jews. Like most Bible passages, however, they can be and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.     Mainstream  |Talmud|Talmud| ic  |Rabbinical_Judaism|Rabbinical_Judaism|  today directly descends from the Pharisees whom Jesus often criticized. Universal Jewish Encyclopedia ; Jewish Encyclopedia , Exhibit 264.  During Jesus life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the  |Sadducees|Sadducee| ,  |Zealots|Zealot| , and  |Essenes|Essene|  who mostly died out not long after the period; Jewish Encyclopedia indeed, Jewish scholars such as  |Harvey_Falk|Harvey_Falk|  and  |Hyam_Maccoby|Hyam_Maccoby|  have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against the Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time, see for example  |Hillel_and_Shammai|Hillel_And_Shammai| .            Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of Antisemitism in the New Testament  has published a detailed study of the description of Jews in the New Testament, and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom ,  |Hyam_Maccoby|Hyam_Maccoby|  , Norman A. Beck , and  |Michael_Berenbaum|Michael_Berenbaum|  . Most rabbis feel that these verses are antisemitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is  |John_Dominic_Crossans|John_Dominic_Crossan|  1995 book titled Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus.     Some biblical scholars have also been accused of holding antisemitic beliefs.  |Bruce_J._Malina|Bruce_J._Malina| , a founding member of  |The_Context_Group|The_Context_Group| , has come under criticism for going as far as to deny the Semitic ancestry of modern Israelis. He then ties this back to his work on first century cultural anthropology.                 After  |Pauls|Saint_Paul|  death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and  |Pauline_Christianity|Pauline_Christianity|  emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements. Some Christians continued to adhere to aspects of Jewish law, but they were few in number and often considered  |heretics|Christian_Heresy|  by the Church. One example is the  |Ebionites|Ebionites| , who seem to have denied the  |virgin_birth|Virgin_Birth|  of Jesus, the physical  |Resurrection_of_Jesus|Resurrection_Of_Jesus| , and most of the books that were later  |canonized|Biblical_Canon|  as the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| . For example, the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox|Ethiopian_Orthodox|  still continue  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament|  practices such as the  |Sabbath|Shabbat| . As late as the 4th century  |Church_Father|Church_Father| |John_Chrysostom|John_Chrysostom| |complained|John_Chrysostomhomilies_On_Jews_And_Judaizing_Christians|  that some Christians were still attending Jewish synagogues.     The  |Church_Fathers|Church_Fathers|  identified Jews and Judaism with  |heresy|Heresychristianity|  and declared the people of Israel to be extra Deum .  |Saint_Peter|Saint_Peter|  of Antioch referred to Christians that refused to worship  |religious_images|Iconoclast|  as having Jewish minds .  In the early second century AD, the heretic  |Marcion_of_Sinope|Marcion_Of_Sinope|   declared that the Jewish God was a different God, inferior to the Christian one,  and rejected the Jewish scriptures as the product of a lesser deity. Marcions teachings, which were extremely popular, rejected Judaism not only as an incomplete revelation, but as a false one as well, but, at the same time, allowed less blame to be placed on the Jews personally for having not recognized Jesus, since, in Marcions worldview, Jesus was not sent by the lesser Jewish God, but by the supreme Christian God, whom the Jews had no reason to recognize.     In combating Marcion, orthodox apologists conceded that Judaism was an incomplete and inferior religion to Christianity, while also defending the Jewish scriptures as canonical. The Church Father  |Tertullian|Tertullian|   had a particularly intense personal dislike towards the Jews and argued that the Gentiles had been chosen by God to replace the Jews, because they were worthier and more honorable.  |Origen_of_Alexandria|Origen|   was more knowledgeable about Judaism than any of the other Church Fathers,  having studied  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language| , met  |Rabbi_Hillel_the_Younger|Hillel,_Son_Of_Gamaliel_Iii| , consulted and debated with Jewish scholars, and been influenced by the allegorical interpretations of  |Philo_of_Alexandria|Philo| . Origen defended the canonicity of the Old Testament and defended Jews of the past as having been chosen by God for their merits. Nonetheless, he condemned contemporary Jews for not understanding their own Law, insisted that Christians were the true Israel , and blamed the Jews for the death of Christ. He did, however, maintain that Jews would eventually attain salvation in the final  apocatastasis .     Patristic bishops of the patristic era such as  |Augustine|Augustine_Of_Hippo|  argued that the Jews should be left alive and suffering as a perpetual reminder of their  |murder_of_Christ|Deicide| . Like his anti-Jewish teacher,  |Ambrose_of_Milan|Ambrose_Of_Milan| , he defined Jews as a special subset of those damned to  |hell|Hell| . As  |Witness_People|Witness_People|  , he sanctified collective punishment for the  |Jewish_deicide|Jewish_Deicide|  and enslavement of Jews to Catholics: Not by bodily death, shall the ungodly race of carnal Jews perish ... Scatter them abroad, take away their strength. And bring them down O  |Lord|God_The_Son| . Augustine claimed to love the Jews but as a means to  |convert|Proselytization_And_Counter-Proselytization_Of_Jews|  them to Christianity. Sometimes he identified all Jews with the evil Judas and developed the doctrine  that there was no salvation outside the Church .      Other Church Fathers, such as  |John_Chrysostom|John_Chrysostom| , went further in their condemnation. The Catholic editor Paul Harkins wrote that  |St._John_Chrysostoms|St._John_Chrysostom|  anti-Jewish theology is no longer tenable For these objectively unchristian acts he cannot be excused, even if he is the product of his times. John Chrysostom held, as most Church Fathers did, that the sins of all Jews were communal and endless, to him his Jewish neighbours were the collective representation of all alleged crimes of all preexisting Jews. All Church Fathers applied the passages of the New Testament concerning the alleged advocation of the crucifixion of Christ to all Jews of his day, the Jews were the ultimate evil. However, John Chrysostom went so far to say that because Jews rejected the  |Christian_God|God_In_Christianity|  in human flesh, Christ, they therefore deserved to be killed: grew fit for slaughter. In citing the New Testament, he claimed that Jesus was speaking about Jews when he said, as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.      |St._Jerome|St._Jerome|  identified Jews with  |Judas_Iscariot|Judas_Iscariot|  and the immoral use of money . Jeromes homiletical assaults, that may have served as the basis for the anti-Jewish  |Good_Friday_liturgy|Good_Friday_Prayer_For_The_Jews| , contrasts Jews with the evil, and that the ceremonies of the Jews are harmful and deadly to Christians , whoever keeps them was doomed to the  |devil|Devil| |Ephraim_the_Syrian|Ephraim_The_Syrian|  wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, including the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among them as a partner. The writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews. Ephraim feared that they were slipping back into Judaism; thus, he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize the contrast between the two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like John Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism by emphasizing what he saw as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.       However, there are also positive remarks from the Church Fathers on the issue, such as  |Eusebius_of_Caesarea|Eusebius_Of_Caesarea|  in his Ecclesiastical History, who said, The race of the Hebrews is not new, but is honoured among all men for its antiquity and is itself well known to all.              |Bernard_of_Clairvaux|Bernard_Of_Clairvaux|  , a Doctor of the Catholic Church, said For us the Jews are Scriptures living words, because they remind us of what Our Lord suffered. They are not to be persecuted, killed, or even put to flight. Catholic Book of Quotations, by Leo Knowles, Copyright 2004 by Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc. All rights reserved.     Jews were subject to a wide range of legal  |disabilities|Disabilities|  and restrictions in Medieval Europe. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. Jews association to money lending would carry on throughout history in the stereotype of Jews being greedy and perpetuating capitalism.     In the later medieval period, the number of Jews permitted to reside in certain places was limited; they were concentrated in  |ghettos|Ghetto| , and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own,   The  |Oath_More_Judaico|Oath_More_Judaico| , the form of oath required from Jewish witnesses, in some places developed bizarre or humiliating forms, e.g. in Swabian law of the 13th century, the Jew would be required to stand on the hide of a sow or a bloody lamb.     The  |Fourth_Lateran_Council|Fourth_Lateran_Council|  in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews .   On many occasions, Jews were accused of a  |blood_libel|Blood_Libel| , the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian  |Eucharist|Eucharist| .      Sicut Judaeis Sicut Judaeis  was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first  |bull|Papal_Bull|  was issued in about 1120 by  |Calixtus_II|Calixtus_Ii| , intended to protect Jews who suffered during the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade| , and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century although they were not always strictly upheld.     The bull forbade, besides other things, Christians from coercing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication.           Antisemitism in popular European Christian culture escalated beginning in the 13th century.  |Blood_libels|Blood_Libels|  and  |host_desecration|Host_Desecration|  drew popular attention and led to many cases of persecution against Jews. Many believed Jews poisoned wells to cause plagues. In the case of blood libel it was widely believed that the Jews would kill a child before Easter and needed Christian blood to bake matzo. Throughout history if a Christian child was murdered accusations of blood libel would arise no matter how small the Jewish population. The Church often added to the fire by portraying the dead child as a martyr who had been tortured and child had powers like Jesus was believed to. Sometimes the children were even made into Saints. Antisemitic imagery such as  |Judensau|Judensau|  and  |Ecclesia_et_Synagoga|Ecclesia_Et_Synagoga|  recurred in Christian art and architecture.     In Iceland, one of the hymns repeated in the days leading up to Easter includes the lines,    :The righteous Law of Moses   :The Jews here misapplied,   :Which their deceit exposes,   :Their hatred and their pride.   :The judgement is the Lords.   :When by falsification   :The foe makes accusation,   :Its His to make awards.          During the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  in  |Europe|Europe|  persecutions and formal expulsions of Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although it should be said that this was also the case for other minority communities, regardless of whether they were religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution during the  |Rhineland_massacres|Rhineland_Massacres|  of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade| , many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils. In Germany the  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence. In the  |Edict_of_Expulsion|Edict_Of_Expulsion| ,  |King_Edward_I|Edward_I_Of_England|  expelled all the Jews from England in 1290 , on the accusation of  |usury|Usury|  and undermining loyalty to the dynasty. In 1306 there was a wave of persecution in France, and there were widespread  |Black_Death_Jewish_persecutions|Black_Death_Jewish_Persecutions|  as the Jews were blamed by many Christians for the plague, or spreading it.   As late as 1519, the Imperial city of  |Regensburg|Regensburg|  took advantage of the recent death of  |Emperor_Maximilian_I|Emperor_Maximilian_I|  to expel its 500 Jews. Wood, Christopher S., Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape, p. 251, 1993, Reaktion Books, London,              The largest expulsion of Jews followed the  |Reconquista|Reconquista|  or the reunification of Spain, and it preceded the  |expulsion_of_the_Muslims|Expulsion_Of_The_Moriscos|  who would not convert, in spite of the protection of their religious rights promised by the  |Treaty_of_Granada|Treaty_Of_Granada| . On 31 March 1492  |Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon|Ferdinand_Ii_Of_Aragon|  and  |Isabella_I_of_Castile|Isabella_I_Of_Castile| , the rulers of  |Spain|Spain|  who financed  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus|  voyage to the New World just a few months later in 1492, declared that all Jews in their territories should either convert to Christianity or leave the country. While some converted, many others left for  |Portugal|Portugal| ,  |France|France| ,  |Italy|Italy|  ,  |Netherlands|Netherlands| ,  |Poland|Poland| , the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , and  |North_Africa|North_Africa| . Many of those who had fled to Portugal were later expelled by  |King_Manuel|Manuel_I_Of_Portugal|  in 1497 or left to avoid forced conversion and  |persecution|Marranos| .              On 14 July 1555,  |Pope_Paul_IV|Pope_Paul_Iv|  issued  |papal_bull|Papal_Bull| |Cum_nimis_absurdum|Cum_Nimis_Absurdum|  which revoked all the rights of the Jewish community and placed religious and economic restrictions on  |Jews|Jews|  in the  |Papal_States|Papal_States| , renewed anti-Jewish legislation and subjected Jews to various degradations and restrictions on their personal freedom.     The bull established the  |Roman_Ghetto|Roman_Ghetto|  and required Jews of Rome, which had existed as a community since before Christian times and which numbered about 2,000 at the time, to live in it. The Ghetto was a walled quarter with three gates that were locked at night. Jews were also restricted to one  |synagogue|Synagogue|  per city.     Paul IVs successor,  |Pope_Pius_IV|Pope_Pius_Iv| , enforced the creation of other ghettos in most Italian towns, and his successor,  |Pope_Pius_V|Pope_Pius_V| , recommended them to other bordering states.                |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  at first made overtures towards the Jews, believing that the evils of  |Catholicism|Catholic_Church|  had prevented their conversion to Christianity. When his call to convert to his version of Christianity was unsuccessful, he became hostile to them.       In his book  On the Jews and Their Lies , Luther excoriates them as venomous beasts, vipers, disgusting scum, canders, devils incarnate. He provided detailed recommendations for a  |pogrom|Pogrom|  against them, calling for their permanent  |oppression|Oppression|  and expulsion, writing Their private houses must be destroyed and devastated, they could be lodged in stables. Let the magistrates burn their synagogues and let whatever escapes be covered with sand and mud. Let them be forced to work, and if this avails nothing, we will be compelled to expel them like dogs in order not to expose ourselves to incurring divine wrath and eternal damnation from the Jews and their lies. At one point he wrote: ...we are at fault in not slaying them... a passage that may be termed the first work of modern antisemitism, and a giant step forward on the road to  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust| .  |Johnson,_Paul|Paul_Johnson| . A History of the Jews, HarperCollins Publishers, 1987, p.242. .  |Paul_Johnson|Paul_Johnson| .     Luthers harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian antisemitism. In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached: We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord.  |Luther,_Martin|Martin_Luther| . D. Martin Luthers Werke: kritische Gesamtausgabe, Weimar: Hermann Böhlaus Nachfolger, 1920, Vol. 51, p. 195.       In accordance with the anti-Jewish precepts of the  |Russian_Orthodox_Church|Russian_Orthodox_Church| , Steven Beller Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press 2007.     Russias discriminatory policies towards Jews intensified when the  |partition_of_Poland|Partition_Of_Poland|  in the 18th century resulted, for the first time in Russian history, in the possession of land with a large Jewish population.  This land was designated as the  |Pale_of_Settlement|Pale_Of_Settlement|  from which Jews were forbidden to migrate into the interior of Russia.  In 1772  |Catherine_II|Catherine_The_Great| , the empress of Russia, forced the Jews living in the Pale of Settlement to stay in their  shtetls  and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of Poland.              Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, the Roman Catholic Church still incorporated strong antisemitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate anti-Judaism and racial antisemitism. Brown University historian  |David_Kertzer|David_Kertzer| , working from the Vatican archive, has argued in his book  The Popes Against the Jews  that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between good antisemitism and bad antisemitism . The bad kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The good kind criticized alleged  |Jewish_conspiracies|Jewish_Conspiracy|  to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when they were accused of promoting hatred of Jews, they would remind people that they condemned the bad kind of antisemitism. Kertzers work is not without critics. Scholar of Jewish-Christian relations  |Rabbi_David_G._Dalin|Rabbi_David_G._Dalin| , for example, criticized Kertzer in the  Weekly Standard  for using evidence selectively.         The  |counter-revolutionary|Counter-Revolutionary|  Catholic royalist  |Louis_de_Bonald|Louis_De_Bonald|  stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| .   Bonalds attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced  |Napoleons|Napoléon_Bonaparte|  decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.     Bonalds article Sur les juifs was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as  |Roger_Gougenot_des_Mousseaux|Roger_Gougenot_Des_Mousseaux| ,  |Charles_Maurras|Charles_Maurras| , and  |Édouard_Drumont|Édouard_Drumont| , nationalists such as  |Maurice_Barrès|Maurice_Barrès|  and  |Paolo_Orano|Paolo_Orano| , and antisemitic socialists such as  |Alphonse_Toussenel|Alphonse_Toussenel| .   Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an alien people, a state within a state , and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.     In the 1840s, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist  |Louis_Veuillot|Louis_Veuillot|  propagated Bonalds arguments against the Jewish financial aristocracy along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a deicidal people driven by hatred to enslave Christians.   Gougenot des Mousseauxs Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens has been called a Bible of modern antisemitism and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue  |Alfred_Rosenberg|Alfred_Rosenberg| . Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming Frances ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.     In Italy the Jesuit priest  |Antonio_Brescianis|Antonio_Bresciani|  highly popular novel 1850 novel LEbreo di Verona  shaped religious anti-Semitism for decades, as did his work for  La Civiltà Cattolica , which he helped launch.        |Pope_Pius_VII|Pope_Pius_Vii|  had the walls of the Jewish  |ghetto|Ghetto|  in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were  |emancipated|Jewish_Emancipation|  by  |Napoleon|Napoleon_And_The_Jews| , and Jews were restricted to the ghetto through the end of the  |Papal_States|Papal_States|  in 1870. Official Catholic organizations, such as the  |Jesuits|Jesuits| , banned candidates who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church until 1946.       In Russia, under the Tsarist regime, antisemitism intensified in the early years of the 20th century and was given official favour when the secret police forged the notorious  Protocols of the Elders of Zion , a document purported to be a transcription of a plan by Jewish elders to achieve  |global_domination|New_World_Order| .

Steven Beller Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction |Beilis_Trial|Menahem_Mendel_Beilis|  of 1913 showed that it was possible to revive the blood libel accusation in Russia.     Catholic writers such as  |Ernest_Jouin|Ernest_Jouin| , who published the Protocols in French, seamlessly blended racial and religious anti-Semitism, as in his statement that from the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity.   |Pope_Pius_XI|Pope_Pius_Xi|  praised Jouin for combating our mortal enemy and appointed him to high papal office as a  |protonotary_apostolic|Protonotary_Apostolic| .           In 1916, in the midst of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , American Jews petitioned Pope Benedict XV on behalf of the Polish Jews.          On April 26, 1933 Hitler declared during a meeting with Roman Catholic Bishop  of Osnabrück:     “I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.”       The transcript of the discussion contains no response by Bishop Berning.  |Martin_Rhonheimer|Martin_Rhonheimer|  does not consider that unusual since in his opinion, for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was nothing particularly objectionable in this historically correct reminder .      The Nazis used Martin Luther s book,  |On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies|On_The_Jews_And_Their_Lies|  , to claim a moral righteousness for their ideology. Luther even went so far as to advocate the murder of Jews who refused to convert to Christianity by writing that we are at fault in not slaying them . Luther, Martin. On the Jews and Their Lies, cited in Robert.Michael. Luther, Luther Scholars, and the Jews, Encounter 46 No.4.343–344     Archbishop Robert Runcie has asserted that: Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitlers passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed... because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus . On Good Friday Jews, have in times past, cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking revenge for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable. Richard Harries. After the evil: Christianity and Judaism in the shadow of the Holocaust. Oxford University Press, 2003. The dissident Catholic priest Hans Küng has written that Nazi anti-Judaism was the work of godless, anti-Christian criminals. But it would not have been possible without the almost two thousand years pre-history of Christian anti-Judaism... Hans Küng. On Being a Christian. Doubleday, Garden City NY, 1976     The document Dabru Emet was issued by over 220 rabbi s and intellectual s from all branches of Judaism in 2000 as a statement about Jewish-Christian relations. This document states,   Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.   According to American historian Lucy Dawidowicz , antisemitism has a long history within Christianity. The line of antisemitic descent from Luther, the author of  |On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies|On_The_Jews_And_Their_Lies| , to Hitler is easy to draw. In her  |The_War_Against_the_Jews|The_War_Against_The_Jews| , 1933-1945, she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the demonologized universe inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luthers anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of Judenhass, which can be traced to Haman s advice to Ahasuerus . Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German nationalism and the liberal revolution of 1848, Christian antisemitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the Roman Catholic Church and upon which Luther built.

The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the encyclical  |Mit_brennender_Sorge|Mit_Brennender_Sorge|  , signed by Pope Pius XI , and Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber led the Catholic opposition, preaching against racism.     Many individual Christian clergy and laypeople of all denominations had to pay for their opposition with their life, including:   Catholic priest, Maximilian Kolbe .   Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer   the Catholic parson of Berlin Cathedral, Bernhard Lichtenberg .   the mostly Catholic members of the Munich resistance group White Rose around Hans and Sophie Scholl .     By the 1940s fewer Christians were willing to oppose Nazi policy publicly, but many secretly helped save the lives of Jews. There are many sections of Israels Holocaust Remembrance Museum, Yad Vashem , dedicated to honoring these Righteous Among the Nations .           Before becoming Pope, Cardinal Pacelli addressed the International Eucharistic Congress in Budapest on 25–30 May 1938 during which he made reference to the Jews whose lips curse and whose hearts reject him even today ; at this time antisemitic laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary.

Bokenkotter, pp. 389–392, quote And when Hitler showed increasing belligerence toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical Mit brennender Sorge was the first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism and one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican. Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil and decried its neopaganism. The Nazis retaliated by closing and sealing all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of Catholic clergy.     In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God.  Historian Guido Knopp describes these comments of Pius as being incomprehensible at a time when Jerusalem was being murdered by the million . Knopp, Guido.

Bokenkotter, Thomas . A Concise History of the Catholic Church. Doubleday. pp. 480–481, quote: A recent article by American rabbi, David G. Dalin, challenges this judgment. He calls making Pius XII a target of moral outrage a failure of historical understanding, and he thinks Jews should reject any attempt to usurp the Holocaust for the partisan purposes at work in this debate. Dalin surmises that well-known Jews such as Albert Einstein, Golda Meir, Moshe Sharett, and Rabbi Isaac Herzog would likely have been shocked at these attacks on Pope Pius. ... Dalin points out that Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Israel, sent a message in February 1944 declaring the people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness ... doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history. Dalin cites these tributes as recognition of the work of the Holy See in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews. The Israeli historian Pinchas Lapide interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000  Jews from certain death at Nazi hands . Some historians dispute this estimate. Deák, István . Essays on Hitlers Europe.

The Christian Identity movement, the Ku Klux Klan and other White supremacist groups have expressed antisemitic views. They claim that their antisemitism is based on purported Jewish control of the media, international banks, radical left-wing politics , and the Jews promotion of multiculturalism , anti-Christian groups, liberalism and perverse organizations. They rebuke charges of racism by claiming that Jews who share their ideology maintain membership in their organizations. A racial belief which is common among these groups, but not universal among them, is an alternative history doctrine, which is sometimes called British Israelism . In some of its forms, this doctrine absolutely denies the view that modern Jews have any racial connection to the Israel of the Bible . Instead, according to extreme forms of this doctrine, the true racial Israelites and the true humans are the members of the Adamic race. These groups are often rejected and not even considered Christian groups by mainstream Christian denomination s and the vast majority of Christians around the world. Michael Barkun for the Southern Poverty Law Center. Southern Poverty Law Center.       Antisemitism in Europe remains a substantial problem. Antisemitism exists to a lesser or greater degree in many other nations as well, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and the increasingly frequent tensions between some Muslim immigrants and Jews across Europe. by Daniel Ben-Simon. Haaretz. 25/03/07 The US State Department reports that antisemitism has increased dramatically in Europe and Eurasia since 2000.     While in a decline since the 1940s, there is still a measurable amount of antisemitism in the United States of America as well, although acts of violence are rare. For example, the influential evangelical preacher Billy Graham and then-president Richard Nixon were captured on tape in the early 1970s discussing matters like how to address the Jews control of the American media . BBC , March 2, 2002. This belief in Jewish conspiracies and domination of the media was similar to those of Grahams former mentors: William Bell Riley chose Graham to succeed him as the second president of Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School and evangelist Mordecai Ham led the meetings where Graham first believed in Christ. Both held strongly antisemitic views. Himes, A The Sword of the Lord: The roots of fundamentalism in an American Family The 2001 survey by the Anti-Defamation League reported 1432 acts of antisemitism in the United States that year. The figure included 877 acts of harassment, including verbal intimidation, threats and physical assaults. A minority of American churches engage in anti-Israel activism, including support for the controversial BDS movement. While not directly indicative of anti-semitism, this activism often conflates the Israeli governments treatment of Palestinians with that of Jesus, thereby promoting the anti-semitic doctrine of Jewish guilt . http://ngo-monitor.org/data/images/File/NGOMIPMNJune2014.pdf Many Christian Zionists are also accused of anti-semitism, such as John Hagee , who argued that the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves by angering God.     Relations between Jews and Christians have improved dramatically since the 20th century. According to a global 2014 poll collecting data on 102 countries on their attitudes toward Jews by the Anti-Defamation League , a Jewish group devoted to fighting antisemitism and other forms of racism, only 24% of Christians worldwide held views considered to be antisemitic in their index, compared to nearly half of Muslims at 49%.         Many Christians do not consider anti-Judaism to be antisemitism . They regard anti-Judaism as a disagreement of religiously sincere people with the tenets of Judaism, while regarding antisemitism as an emotional bias or hatred not specifically targeting the religion of Judaism. Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as antisemitism as it only rejects the religious ideas of Judaism and does not involve actual hostility to the Jewish people.     Others see anti-Judaism as the rejection of or opposition to beliefs and practices essentially because .
