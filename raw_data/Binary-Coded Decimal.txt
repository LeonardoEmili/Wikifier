        In  |computing|Computing|  and  |electronic|Electronics|  systems, binary-coded decimal  is a class of  |binary|Binary_Numeral_System|  encodings of  |decimal|Decimal|  numbers where each decimal  |digit|Numerical_Digit|  is represented by a fixed number of  |bits|Bit| , usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a  |sign|Sign|  or for other indications .     In byte-oriented systems , the term unpacked BCD usually implies a full  |byte|Byte|  for each digit , whereas packed BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see  |Excess-3|Excess-3|  for instance. The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called tetrades  with those  |dont_care|Dont_Care| -states unused named  or pseudo-decimal digit such as  |ARM|Arm_Architecture| ;  |x86|X86|  does not support  |its_BCD_instructions|Intel_Bcd_Opcode|  in  |long_mode|Long_Mode|  any more |themati|Themati|  two encodings are possible6+39bits 0 through 3bits 4 through 7but formatting routines might replace or remove leading zeroswith the leading zero |mputi|Mputi| or simply packed decimalresiding at the lowest memory address |hex|Hexadecimal|  C+Dâˆ’AEBABFFD127C127DDthe processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100   |ta_ty|Ta_Ty| 2nd+132-bitabout one-sixth of the memory used is wasted |aracter_encodi|Aracter_Encodi| an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendorspart of the 1985 COBOL standarddescended from the 1950s  |Electrodata_200_series|Burroughs_205| and otherinclusiveAs with  |twos_complement|Twos_Complement|  binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.such as  |COBOL|Cobol| ,  |PL/I|Pl/I|  and  |Ada|Ada| 1,0241,000DPDhex Fhexhex 3hexleast significantsee above such as  |COBOL|Cobol|  and  |PL/I|Pl/I| BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD |70/7072/70|70/7072/70| CMa 0 punch combined with any others12,1B,A,111,8,3B,8,2,18,2using  |two-out-of-five_code|Two-Out-Of-Five_Code|  in the digits, not BCDe.g., lowercase lettersas in EBCDIC or ASCIItwo decimal digits per  |byte|Byte| one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte |n-by|N-By| written in  |C|C| uint32t a,uint32t b   uint32t t1, t2; // unsigned 32-bit intermediate values     t1 a + 0x06666666;   t2 t1 b; // sum without carry propagation   t1 t1 + b; // provisional sum   t2 t1 t2; // all the binary carry bits   t2 ~t2 & 0x11111110; // just the BCD carry bits   t2  .
