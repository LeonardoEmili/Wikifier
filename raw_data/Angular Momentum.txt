      In  |physics|Physics| , angular momentum  is the rotational equivalent of  |linear_momentum|Linear_Momentum| . It is an important quantity in physics because it is a  |conserved_quantity|Conservation_Law| —the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.     In three  |dimensions|Dimensions| , the angular momentum for a  |point_particle|Point_Particle|  is a  |pseudovector|Pseudovector|  r × p, the  |cross_product|Cross_Product|  of the particles  |position_vector|Position_Vector|  r and its  |momentum_vector|Momentum_Vector| ; the latter is p mv in Newtonian mechanics. This definition can be applied to each point in  |continua|Continuum_Mechanics|  like solids or fluids, or  |physical_fields|Field| . Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particles position is measured from it.     Just like for  |angular_velocity|Angular_Velocity| , there are two special types of angular momentum: the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum. The spin angular momentum of an object is defined as the angular momentum about its  |centre_of_mass|Centre_Of_Mass|  coordinate. The orbital angular momentum of an object about a chosen origin is defined as the angular momentum of the centre of mass about the origin. The total angular momentum of an object is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta. The orbital angular momentum vector of a particle is always parallel and directly proportional to the orbital  |angular_velocity|Angular_Velocity|  vector ω of the particle, where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. However, the spin angular momentum of the object is proportional but not always parallel to the spin angular velocity Ω, making the constant of proportionality a second-rank  |tensor|Tensor|  rather than a scalar.     Angular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of any composite system is the  |vector_sum|Vector_Sum|  of the angular momenta of its constituent parts. For a continuous rigid body, the total angular momentum is the volume integral of angular momentum density over the entire body.     Torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to  |force|Force| . The net external torque on any system is always equal to the total torque on the system; in other words, the sum of all internal torques of any system is always 0 . Therefore, for a closed system , the total torque on the system must be 0, which means that the total angular momentum of the system is constant. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning  |figure_skater|Figure_Skater|  as the skaters arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star| , the  |Coriolis_effect|Coriolis_Effect| , and the  |precession|Precession|  of  |gyroscopes|Gyroscope| . In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.     In  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , angular momentum is expressed as an  |operator|Operator|   , and its one-dimensional projections have  |quantized_eigenvalues|Point_Spectrum| . Angular momentum is subject to the  |Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle|Heisenberg_Uncertainty_Principle| , implying that at any time, only one  |projection|Vector_Projection|  can be measured with definite precision; the other two then remain uncertain. Because of this, it turns out that the notion of a quantum particle literally spinning about an axis does not exist. Nevertheless, elementary particles still possess a spin angular momentum, but this angular momentum does not correspond to spinning motion in the ordinary sense.                         Angular momentum is a  |vector|Euclidean_Vector|  quantity  that represents the product of a bodys  |rotational_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  and  |rotational_velocity|Angular_Velocity|  about a particular axis. However, if the particles trajectory lies in a single  |plane|Plane| , it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a  |scalar|Scalar|  .  Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of  |linear_momentum|Momentum| . Thus, where  |linear_momentum|Linear_Momentum|  p is proportional to  |mass|Mass|  m and  |linear_speed|Speed|     : p mv,     angular momentum L is proportional to  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  I and  |angular_speed|Angular_Frequency|    measured in radians per second.    : L I      Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter. Unlike linear speed, which does not depend upon the choice of origin, angular velocity is always measured with respect to a fixed origin. Therefore, strictly speaking, L should be referred to as the angular momentum relative to that center.        Because I r2m for a single particle and     for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded, L r2 m     and reduced to,   : L rmv,     the product of the  |radius|Radius|  of rotation r and the  |linear_momentum|Linear_Momentum|  of the particle p mv , where v in this case is the equivalent  |linear_speed|Speedtangentialspeed|  at the radius .     This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is  |perpendicular|Perpendicular|  to the  |radius_vector|Position|  is considered. In that case,   : L rmv      where v  v  is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding, L rmv  rearranging, L r  and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,   : L r  mv,     where r  r  is the length of the  |moment_arm|Torquemoment_Arm_Formula| , a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this definition,  to which the term moment of momentum refers.        Another approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum  of the angular coordinate   expressed in the  |Lagrangian|Lagrangian_Mechanics|  of the mechanical system. Consider a mechanical system with a mass m constrained to move in a circle of radius a in the absence of any external force field. The kinetic energy of the system is   : T             And the potential energy is   : U 0.     Then the Lagrangian is   :   T - U         The generalized momentum canonically conjugate to the coordinate   is defined by   : p    ma2   I  L.            To completely define orbital angular momentum in  |three_dimensions|Three_Dimensional_Space| , it is required to know the rate at which the position vector sweeps out angle, the direction perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of angular displacement, and the  |mass|Mass|  involved, as well as how this mass is distributed in space  . By retaining this  |vector|Euclidean_Vector|  nature of angular momentum, the general nature of the equations is also retained, and can describe any sort of three-dimensional  |motion|Motion|  about the center of rotation –  |circular|Circular_Motion| ,  |linear|Linear_Motion| , or otherwise. In  |vector_notation|Vector_Notation| , the orbital angular momentum of a  |point_particle|Point_Particle|  in motion about the origin can be expressed as:     :   I      where   :: I r2m is the  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  for a  |point_mass|Point_Particle| ,   ::   is the orbital  |angular_velocity|Angular_Velocity|  in radians/sec of the particle about the origin,   ::   is the  |position_vector|Position|  of the particle relative to the origin, r  ,   ::   is the  |linear_velocity|Velocity|  of the particle relative to the origin, and   :: m is the  |mass|Mass|  of the particle.     This can be expanded, reduced, and by the rules of  |vector_algebra|Vector_Calculus| , rearranged:   :       &       & m      &   m      &           which is the  |cross_product|Cross_Product|  of the position vector   and the linear momentum   m  of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the   vector is  |perpendicular|Perpendicular|  to both   and   . It is directed perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, as indicated by the  |right_hand_rule|Right_Hand_Rule|  – so that the angular velocity is seen as  |counter_clockwise|Clockwise|  from the head of the vector. Conversely, the   vector defines the  |plane|Plane|  in which   and   lie.     By defining a  |unit_vector|Unit_Vector|    perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, a  |scalar_angular_speed|Angular_Frequency|    results, where   :     and   :     where v  is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.     The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:   :       & I    & I    &     & rmv      & r  mv          and   rmv  for circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius r .       Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of  |linear_momentum|Linear_Momentum| . Like linear momentum it involves elements of  |mass|Mass|  and  |displacement|Displacement| . Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of  |position|Position|  and  |shape|Shape| .     Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point—can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it?  |Energy|Energy| , the ability to do  |work|Work| , can be stored in matter by setting it in motion—a combination of its  |inertia|Inertia|  and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its  |mass|Mass| , and displacement by its  |velocity|Velocity| . Their product,     :       &           &     m   v & p            is the matters  |momentum|Momentum| .  Referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point directly. For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a  |lever|Lever|  of the same length as the wheels radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the moment arm. It has the effect of multiplying the momentums effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a  |moment_|Moment|  Hence, the particles momentum referred to a particular point,     :         &               &     r   m   v & L            is the angular momentum, sometimes called, as here, the moment of momentum of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation Lrmv combines a moment with a linear speed v . Linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance r and the angular speed   versus the point: vr  another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: Lrmr  Simplifying slightly, Lr2m  the quantity r2m is the particles  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia| , sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.           Because  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  is a crucial part of the spin angular momentum, the latter necessarily includes all of the complications of the former, which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the  |squares|Square|  of their  |distances|Distances|  from the center of rotation.  Therefore, the total moment of inertia, and the angular momentum, is a complex function of the configuration of the  |matter|Matter|  about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits.     For a  |rigid_body|Rigid_Body| , for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the  |rotation_axis|Rotation_Around_A_Fixed_Axis|  versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the  |center_of_mass|Center_Of_Mass| , or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.  It reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass.      For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| , the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies axes lying close to the systems axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.     In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation , the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given  |angular_velocity|Angular_Velocity| . In many cases the  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia| , and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,    : Ik2m,   :where k is the  |radius_of_gyration|Radius_Of_Gyration| , the distance from the axis at which the entire mass m may be considered as concentrated.   Similarly, for a  |point_mass|Point_Particle|  m the  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  is defined as,   : Ir2m   :where r is the  |radius|Radius|  of the point mass from the center of rotation,   and for any collection of particles mi as the sum,   :   Ii   ri2mi     Angular momentums dependence on position and shape is reflected in its  |units|Units_Of_Measurement|  versus linear momentum: kg⋅m 2 /s, N⋅m⋅s, or J⋅s for angular momentum versus  |kg⋅m_s|Si_Derived_Unit|  or  |N⋅s|Si_Derived_Unit|  for linear momentum. When calculating angular momentum as the product of the moment of inertia times the angular velocity, the angular velocity must be expressed in radians per second, where the radian assumes the dimensionless value of unity. . Angular momentums units can be interpreted as  |torque|Torque| ⋅time or as energy⋅time per angle. An object with angular momentum of  can be reduced to zero rotation by an angular  |impulse|Impulse|  of   or equivalently, by torque or work of  for one second, or energy of  for one second.      The  |plane|Plane| |_perpendicular|Perpendicular|  to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass , p. 97 is sometimes called the invariable plane, because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system, free from outside influences, are considered.  One such plane is the  |invariable_plane_of_the_Solar_System|Invariable_Plane| .           |Newtons_second_law_of_motion|Newtons_Laws_Of_Motionnewtons_Second_Law|  can be expressed mathematically,   :   m    or  |force|Force| |_mass|Mass|  ×  |acceleration|Acceleration| . The rotational equivalent for point particles may be derived as follows:   :   I    which means that the torque  is   :     + I      Because the moment of inertia is mr2 , it follows that   2mr  2rp , and   I  + 2rp  which, reduces to     :   I  + 2rp    This is the rotational analog of Newtons Second Law. Note that the torque is not necessarily proportional or parallel to the angular acceleration . The reason for this is that the moment of inertia of a particle can change with time, something that cannot occur for ordinary mass.             A rotational analog of  |Newtons_third_law_of_motion|Newtons_Laws_Of_Motionnewtons_Third_Law|  might be written, In a  |closed_system|Closed_System| , no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque. Hence, angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant .      Seen another way, a rotational analogue of  |Newtons_first_law_of_motion|Newtons_Laws_Of_Motionnewtons_First_Law|  might be written, A rigid body continues in a state of uniform rotation unless acted by an external influence.  Thus with no external influence to act upon it, the original angular momentum of the system remains constant.      The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing  |central_force_motion|Classical_Central_Force_Problem| . If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the center, then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the  |radius_vector|Position| , and none is  |perpendicular|Perpendicular|  to the radius. Mathematically, torque           because in this case   and   are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with  |gravitational_attraction|Gravity|  in the  |orbits|Orbit|  of  |planets|Planet|  and  |satellites|Satellite| , where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the  |Bohr_model|Bohr_Model|  of the  |atom|Atom| .     For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the  |Earth–Moon_system|Lunar_Theory|  results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to  |tidal_torque|Tidal_Acceleration|  the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,  +2.40 ms/century divided by 36525 days. and in gradual increase of the radius of Moons orbit, at about 3.82  centimeters per year.           The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an  |ice_skater|Ice_Skating|  as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis, she decreases her bodys moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  and  |angular_velocity|Angular_Velocity| , if the angular momentum remains constant , then the angular velocity of the skater must increase.     The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars  when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object n times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n 2 .     Conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning  |top|Top|  is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the  |nutation|Nutation|  axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its  |precession|Precession|  axis. Also, in any  |planetary_system|Planetary_System| , the planets, star, comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.      |Noethers_theorem|Noethers_Theorem|  states that every  |conservation_law|Conservation_Law|  is associated with a  |symmetry|Symmetry|  of the underlying physics. The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is  |rotational_invariance|Rotational_Invariance| . The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.           In astrodynamics and  |celestial_mechanics|Celestial_Mechanics| , a massless  angular momentum is defined    :           called  specific angular momentum . Note that   m   |Mass|Mass|  is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by  |gravity|Gravity| . The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions.       For a continuous mass distribution with  |density|Density|  function ρ, a differential  |volume_element|Volume_Element|  dV with  |position_vector|Position_Vector|  r within the mass has a mass element dm ρdV. Therefore, the  |infinitesimal|Infinitesimal|  angular momentum of this element is:     : d    dm       dV   dV           and  |integrating|Volume_Integral|  this  |differential|Differential|  over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum:     :   dV           In the derivation which follows, integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous mass.                For a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin, it is informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin. Given,   : mi is the mass of particle i ,   :   is the position vector of particle i vs the origin,   :   is the velocity of particle i vs the origin,   :   is the position vector of the center of mass vs the origin,   :   is the velocity of the center of mass vs the origin,   :   is the position vector of particle i vs the center of mass,   :   is the velocity of particle i vs the center of mass,     The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,   : M  mi.     The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,    : M  mi       By inspection,   :     +   and     +       The total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle,        Expanding   ,   :       &         &             Expanding   ,   :       &         &         &       mi  +       mi  +       mi  +       mi          It can be shown that ,        :   mi    and   mi      therefore the second and third terms vanish,   :         mi  +       mi  .     The first term can be rearranged,   :       mi        mi      M      and total angular momentum for the collection of particles is finally,         The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin. Similar to  |Single_particle|Angular_Momentumsingle_Particle| , below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass M at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to  |Fixed_center_of_mass|Angular_Momentumfixed_Center_Of_Mass| , below. The result is general—the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.     Rearranging equation  by vector identities, multiplying both terms by one , and grouping appropriately,     :       & M +         &   +     ,     & R2M   +     ,           gives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  I and  |angular_velocity|Angular_Velocity|    ,              LRV nnn32121232alignalignn + 1n + 11232ni nPArrrrrr |_r|Th| |_v_⊥|Th| |_rmv_⊥|Th| .
