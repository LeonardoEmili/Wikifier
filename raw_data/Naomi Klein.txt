Her mother,  |documentary_film-maker|Documentary_Film| |Bonnie_Sherr_Klein|Bonnie_Sherr_Klein| , is best known for her  |anti-pornography|Anti-Pornography_Movement|  film  Not a Love Story .  Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of  |Physicians_for_Social_Responsibility|Physicians_For_Social_Responsibility| . Her brother, Seth Klein, is director of the  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia| n office of the  |Canadian_Centre_for_Policy_Alternatives|Canadian_Centre_For_Policy_Alternatives| .     Before World War II, her paternal grandparents were communists, but they began to turn against the Soviet Union after the  |Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|  in 1939. In 1942, her grandfather, an animator at  |Disney|Disney| , was fired after  |the_1941_strike|Disney_Animators_Strike| ,  and had to switch to working in a shipyard instead.  By 1956 they had abandoned communism. Kleins father grew up surrounded by ideas of  |social_justice|Social_Justice|  and  |racial_equality|Racial_Equality| , but found it difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists , a so-called  |red_diaper_baby|Red_Diaper_Baby| .     Kleins husband,  |Avi_Lewis|Avi_Lewis| , was born into a well-connected political and journalistic family; he works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. The couples only child, son Toma, was born on June 13, 2012.          Klein spent much of her teenage years in  |shopping_malls|Shopping_Mall| , obsessed with  |designer_labels|Designer_Label| . As a child and teenager, she found it very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother and she rejected politics, instead embracing full-on  |consumerism|Consumerism|  .     She has attributed her change in worldview to two catalysts. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the  |University_of_Toronto|University_Of_Toronto| , her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled. Naomi, her father, and her brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so.  That year off prevented her from being such a brat .  The next year, after beginning her studies at the  |University_of_Toronto|University_Of_Toronto| , the second catalyst occurred: the 1989  |École_Polytechnique_massacre|École_Polytechnique_Massacre|  of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to  |feminism|Feminism| .      Kleins writing career began with contributions to  The Varsity , a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief. After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at  The Globe and Mail , followed by an editorship at  This Magazine . In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto with the intention of finishing her degree  but left academia for a journalism internship before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree. Q & A Interview with Brian Lamb, on CSPAN, dated November 29, 2009,          No Logo   In 1999, Klein published the book  No Logo , which for many became a  |manifesto|Manifesto|  of the  |anti-globalization|Anti-Globalization|  movement. In it, she attacks  |brand|Brand_Name| -oriented  |consumer_culture|Consumer_Culture|  and the operations of large  |corporations|Corporation| . She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the worlds poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized  |Nike|Nike,_Inc.|  so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.  No Logo became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.     Fences and Windows      Kleins  Fences and Windows  is a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the  |anti-globalization|Anti-Globalization|  movement .      The Take    The Take  , a  |documentary_film|Documentary_Film|  collaboration by Klein and Lewis, concerns factory workers in  |Argentina|Argentina|  who  |took_over_a_closed_plant|Recovered_Factory|  and resumed production, operating as a  |collective|Collective| . The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of  |Durban|Durban| , where the  |Abahlali_baseMjondolo|Abahlali_Basemjondolo|  movement began.      An article in  Z Communications  criticized The Take for its portrayal of the Argentine general and politician  |Juan_Domingo_Perón|Juan_Domingo_Perón|  arguing that he was falsely portrayed as a social democrat.      The Shock Doctrine      Kleins third book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, was published on September 4, 2007. The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate  |Milton_Friedman|Milton_Friedman|  and the  |Chicago_School_of_Economics|Chicago_School|  have risen to prominence in countries such as  |Chile,_under_Pinochet|Military_Government_Of_Chile| , Poland,  |Russia,_under_Yeltsin|Economy_Of_Russia| . The book also argues that policy initiatives  were rushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters, upheavals, or invasion. The book became an international and  |New_York_Times_bestseller|The_New_York_Times_Bestseller|  and was translated into 28 languages.      Central to the books thesis is the contention that those who wish to implement unpopular  |free_market|Free_Market|  policies now routinely do so by taking advantage of certain features of the aftermath of major disasters, be they economic, political, military or natural. The suggestion is that when a society experiences a major shock there is a widespread desire for a rapid and decisive response to correct the situation; this desire for bold and immediate action provides an opportunity for unscrupulous actors to implement policies which go far beyond a legitimate response to disaster. The book suggests that when the rush to act means the specifics of a response will go unscrutinized, that is the moment when unpopular and unrelated policies will intentionally be rushed into effect. The book appears to claim that these shocks are in some cases intentionally encouraged or even manufactured.     Klein identifies the shock doctrine , elaborating on  |Joseph_Schumpeter|Joseph_Schumpeter| , as the latest in capitalisms phases of creative destruction .      The Shock Doctrine was adapted into a  |short_film|Short_Film|  of the same name, released onto  |YouTube|Youtube| .  The original is no longer available on the site, however, a duplicate was published in 2008.  The film was directed by  |Jonás_Cuarón|Jonás_Cuarón| , produced and co-written by his father  |Alfonso_Cuarón|Alfonso_Cuarón| . The original video was viewed over one million times.      The publication of The Shock Doctrine increased Kleins prominence, with  The New Yorker  judging her the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what  |Howard_Zinn|Howard_Zinn|  and  |Noam_Chomsky|Noam_Chomsky|  were thirty years ago. On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural  |Warwick_Prize_for_Writing|Warwick_Prize_For_Writing|  from the  |University_of_Warwick|University_Of_Warwick|  in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.     This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate   Kleins fourth book,  This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate  was published in September 2014.  The book puts forth the argument that the hegemony of  |neoliberal|Neoliberal| |market_fundamentalism|Market_Fundamentalism|  is blocking any serious reforms to halt climate change and protect the environment. Rob Nixon . .  The New York Times . Retrieved December 7, 2014. Questioned about Kleins claim that capitalism and controlling climate change were incompatible, Benoit Blarel, manager of the Environment and Natural Resources global practice at the World Bank, said that the write-off of fossil fuels necessary to control climate change will have a huge impact all over and that the World Bank was starting work on this .  The book won the 2014  |Hilary_Weston_Writers_Trust_Prize_for_Nonfiction|Hilary_Weston_Writers_Trust_Prize_For_Nonfiction| , .  |CBC_Books|Cbc_Arts| , October 14, 2014. and was a shortlisted nominee for the 2015  |Shaughnessy_Cohen_Prize_for_Political_Writing|Shaughnessy_Cohen_Prize_For_Political_Writing| . .

The Battle for Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes on the Disaster CapitalistsThe Battle For Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes on the Disaster Capitalists covers what San Juan Mayor  |Carmen_Yulín_Cruz|Carmen_Yulín_Cruz|  refers to as the post-Hurricane Maria unmasked colonialism leading to inequality and creating a fierce humanitarian crisis.      On Fire: The Case for a Green New Deal On Fire: The Case for a Green New Deal and it was published on September 17, 2019.  On Fire is a collection of essays focusing on climate change and the urgent actions needed to preserve the planet. Klein relates her meeting with  |Greta_Thunberg|Greta_Thunberg|  in the opening essay in which she discusses the entrance of young people into those speaking out for climate awareness and change. She supports the  |Green_New_Deal|Green_New_Deal|  throughout the book and in the final essay she discusses the  |2020_U.S._election|2020_U.S._Election|  saying The stakes of the election are almost unbearably high. It’s why I wrote the book and decided to put it out now and why I’ll be doing whatever I can to help push people toward supporting a candidate with the most ambitious Green New Deal platform—so that they win the primaries and then the general.         Klein has written on various current issues, such as the  |Iraq_War|Iraq_War| . In a September 2004 article for  Harpers Magazine ,  she argues that, contrary to popular belief, the  |Bush_administration|George_W._Bush_Administration|  did have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq, which was to build a completely unconstrained  |free_market_economy|Free_Market_Economics| . She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq, and the methods used to achieve those goals.   The film  War, Inc.  was partially inspired by her article, Baghdad Year Zero .      Kleins August 2004 Bring Najaf to New York , published in The Nation, argued that  |Muqtada_Al_Sadrs|Muqtada_Al_Sadr| |Mahdi_Army|Mahdi_Army|  represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq.  She went on to say Yes, if elected Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a  |theocracy|Theocracy|  like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation .  |Marc_Cooper|Marc_Cooper| , a former Nation columnist, attacked the assertion that Al Sadr represented mainstream Iraqi sentiment and that American forces had brought the fight to the holy city of  |Najaf|Najaf| .  Cooper wrote that Klein should know better. All enemies of the U.S. occupation she opposes are not her friends. Or ours. Or those of the Iraqi people. I don’t think that Mullah Al Sadr, in any case, is much desirous of support issuing from secular Jewish feminist-socialists.       Klein signed a 2004 petition entitled, “We would vote for  |Hugo_Chávez|Hugo_Chávez| .”  In 2007 she described  |Venezuela|Venezuela|  under the Chávez government as a country where citizens had renewed their faith in the power of democracy to improve their lives, and described Venezuela as a place sheltered by Chávezs policies from the economic shocks produced by capitalism.  Rather, according to Klein, Chávez protected his country from financial crisis by building “a zone of relative economic calm and predictability.”  According to reviewer  |Todd_Gitlin|Todd_Gitlin| , who described the overall argument of Kleins 2007 book  The Shock Doctrine  as more right than wrong, Klein is a romantic, who expected that the Chávez government would produce a bright future in which worker-controlled co-operatives would run the economy.  The Shock Doctrine was consistent with her prior thinking about  |globalization|Globalization| , and in that book she describes Chávez policies as an example of public control of some sectors of the economy as protecting poor people from harm caused by globalization.  After the  |collapse|Crisis_In_Venezuela|  of the  |Venezuelan_economy|Economy_Of_Venezuela|  and alleged erosion of its democratic institutions under Chávez successor  |Nicolás_Maduro|Nicolás_Maduro| , Klein and other people who had supported Chávez were criticized by writers such as  |James_Kirchick|James_Kirchick|   and Mark Milke.          In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the  |Alliance_of_Concerned_Jewish_Canadians|Independent_Jewish_Voices| . In January 2009, during the  |Gaza_War|Gaza_War| , Klein supported the  |Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions|Boycott,_Divestment_And_Sanctions|  campaign against  |Israel|Israel| , arguing that the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa.      In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language|  translation of her book The Shock Doctrine, Klein visited Israel, the  |West_Bank|West_Bank| , and  |Gaza|Gaza_Strip| , combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper  Haaretz  she emphasized that it is important to her not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict.  In a speech in  |Ramallah|Ramallah|  on June 27, she apologized to the  |Palestinians|Palestinians|  for not joining the BDS campaign earlier.  Her remarks, particularly that even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free card were characterized by Noam Schimmel, an op-ed columnist in  The Jerusalem Post , as violent and unethical , and as the most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious.      Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the  |spotlight_on_Tel_Aviv|2009_Toronto_International_Film_Festivalcontroversy_Over_Tel_Aviv_Spotlight|  at the  |2009_Toronto_International_Film_Festival|2009_Toronto_International_Film_Festival| , a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.                Since 2009, Kleins attention has turned to environmentalism, with particular focus on  |climate_change|Climate_Change| , the subject of her book  This Changes Everything  . , Democracy Now!, March 9, 2011.

She has encouraged the  |Occupy_movement|Occupy_Movement|  to join forces with the environmental movement, saying the financial crisis and the climate crisis have the same root—unrestrained corporate greed.  She gave a speech at  |Occupy_Wall_Street|Occupy_Wall_Street|  where she described the world as upside down , where we act as if there is no end to what is actually finite—fossil fuels and the atmospheric space to absorb their emissions, and as if there are limits to what is actually bountiful—the financial resources to build the kind of society we need.      She has been a particularly vocal critic of the  |Athabasca_oil_sands|Athabasca_Oil_Sands|  in Alberta, describing it in a  |TED_talk|Ted_Talk|  as a form of terrestrial skinning.  On September 2, 2011, she attended the demonstration against the  |Keystone_XL|Keystone_Xl|  pipeline outside the White House and was arrested.  Klein celebrated Obamas decision to postpone a decision on the  |Keystone_pipeline|Keystone_Pipeline|  until 2013 pending an environmental review as a victory for the environmental movement.     She attended the  |Copenhagen_Climate_Summit_of_2009|2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference| . She put the blame for the failure of Copenhagen on Barack Obama,  and described her own country, Canada, as a climate criminal.  She presented the Angry Mermaid Award to  |Monsanto|Monsanto| .      Writing in the wake of  |Hurricane_Sandy|Hurricane_Sandy|  she warned that the climate crisis constitutes a massive opportunity for disaster capitalists and corporations seeking to profit from crisis. But equally, the climate crisis can be a historic moment to usher in the next great wave of progressive change, or a so-called Peoples Shock. The Nation,      On November 9, 2016, following the election of  |Donald_Trump|Donald_Trump|  as the 45th  |President_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States| , Klein called for an international campaign to impose  |economic_sanctions|Economic_Sanctions|  on the United States if his administration refuses to abide by the terms of the  |Paris_Agreement|Paris_Agreement| .
