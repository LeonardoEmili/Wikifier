   C ∗ -algebras are subjects of research in  |functional_analysis|Functional_Analysis| , a branch of  |mathematics|Mathematics| . A C-algebra is a  |Banach_algebra|Banach_Algebra|  together with an involution satisfying the properties of the  |adjoint|Hermitianadjoint| . A particular case is that of a  |complex|Complex_Number| |algebra|Algebra_Over_A_Field|  A of  |continuous_linear_operators|Continuous_Linear_Operator|  on a  |complex|Complex_Number| |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space|  with two additional properties:     A is a topologically  |closed_set|Closed_Set|  in the  |norm_topology|Norm_Topology|  of operators.   A is closed under the operation of taking  |adjoints|Adjoint_Of_An_Operator|  of operators.     Another important class of non-Hilbert C-algebra include the algebra of continuous functions C0 .     C-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  to  |model|Model|  algebras of physical  |observables|Observable| . This line of research began with  |Werner_Heisenbergs|Werner_Heisenberg| |matrix_mechanics|Matrix_Mechanics|  and in a more mathematically developed form with  |Pascual_Jordan|Pascual_Jordan|  around 1933. Subsequently,  |John_von_Neumann|John_Von_Neumann|  attempted to establish a general framework for these algebras which culminated in a series of papers on rings of operators. These papers considered a special class of C-algebras which are now known as  |von_Neumann_algebras|Von_Neumann_Algebra| .     Around 1943, the work of  |Israel_Gelfand|Israel_Gelfand|  and  |Mark_Naimark|Mark_Naimark|  yielded an abstract characterisation of C-algebras making no reference to operators on a Hilbert space.     C-algebras are now an important tool in the theory of  |unitary_representations|Unitary_Representation|  of  |locally_compact_groups|Locally_Compact_Group| , and are also used in algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics. Another active area of research is the program to obtain classification, or to determine the extent of which classification is possible, for separable simple  |nuclear_C-algebras|Nuclear_C-Algebra| .         We begin with the abstract characterization of C-algebras given in the 1943 paper by Gelfand and Naimark.     A C-algebra, A, is a  |Banach_algebra|Banach_Algebra|  over the field of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number| , together with a  |map|Map|  x   x for x  A with the following properties:     It is an  |involution|Semigroup_With_Involution| , for every x in Ax, y in AC and every x in Ax in ARemark. The first three identities say that A is a  |-algebra|-Algebra| . The last identity is called the C identity and is equivalent to:             which is sometimes called the B-identity. For history behind the names C- and B-algebras, see the  |history|Somehistory:B.2A-Algebrasandc.2A-Algebras|  section below.     The C-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the  |spectral_radius_formula|Spectral_Radius| , it implies that the C-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:     ::     x        A  |bounded_linear_map|Bounded_Linear_Map| , π : A → B, between C-algebras A and B is called a -homomorphism if     For x and y in A     ::             For x in A     ::           In the case of C-algebras, any -homomorphism π between C-algebras is  |contractive|Contraction| , i.e. bounded with norm ≤ 1. Furthermore, an injective -homomorphism between C-algebras is  |isometric|Isometry| . These are consequences of the C-identity.     A bijective -homomorphism π is called a C-isomorphism, in which case A and B are said to be isomorphic.       The term B-algebra was introduced by C. E. Rickart in 1946 to describe  |Banach_-algebras|Banach_-Algebra|  that satisfy the condition:       x x     x   2 for all x in the given B-algebra.     This condition automatically implies that the -involution is isometric, that is,   x     x   . Hence,   xx    x     x  , and therefore, a B-algebra is also a C-algebra. Conversely, the C-condition implies the B-condition. This is nontrivial, and can be proved without using the condition   x     x   . , . For these reasons, the term B-algebra is rarely used in current terminology, and has been replaced by the term C-algebra.     The term C-algebra was introduced by  |I._E._Segal|Irving_Segal|  in 1947 to describe norm-closed subalgebras of B, namely, the space of bounded operators on some Hilbert space H. C stood for closed. , .  In his paper Segal defines a C-algebra as a uniformly closed, self-adjoint algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space .          C-algebras have a large number of properties that are technically convenient. Some of these properties can be established by using the  |continuous_functional_calculus|Continuous_Functional_Calculus|  or by reduction to commutative C-algebras. In the latter case, we can use the fact that the structure of these is completely determined by the  |Gelfand_isomorphism|Gelfand_Isomorphism| .         Self-adjoint elements are those of the form xx A of the form xx forms a closed  |convex_cone|Convex_Cone| . This cone is identical to the elements of the form xx. Elements of this cone are called non-negative      The set of self-adjoint elements of a C-algebra A naturally has the structure of a  |partially_ordered|Partial_Order| |vector_space|Vector_Space| ; the ordering is usually denoted ≥. In this ordering, a self-adjoint element x of A satisfies x ≥ 0 if and only if the  |spectrum|Spectrum|  of x is non-negative, if and only if x ss for some s. Two self-adjoint elements x and y of A satisfy x ≥ y if x−y ≥ 0.     This partially ordered subspace allows the definition of a  |positive_linear_functional|Positive_Linear_Functional|  on a C-algebra, which in turn is used to define the  |states|State|  of a C-algebra, which in turn can be used to construct the  |spectrum_of_a_C-algebra|Spectrum_Of_A_C-Algebra|  using the  |GNS_construction|Gns_Construction| .         Any C-algebra A has an  |approximate_identity|Approximate_Identity| . In fact, there is a directed family  λ∈I of self-adjoint elements of A such that     :: x e    x   :: 0   e    e    1              : In case A is separable, A has a sequential approximate identity. More generally, A will have a sequential approximate identity if and only if A contains a  strictly positive element , i.e. a positive element h such that hAh is dense in A.     Using approximate identities, one can show that the algebraic  |quotient|Quotient|  of a C-algebra by a closed proper two-sided  |ideal|Ideal| , with the natural norm, is a C-algebra.     Similarly, a closed two-sided ideal of a C-algebra is itself a C-algebra.           The algebra M of n × n  |matrices|Matrix|  over C becomes a C-algebra if we consider matrices as operators on the Euclidean space, C n , and use the  |operator_norm|Operator_Norm| |conjugate_transpose|Conjugate_Transpose| . More generally, one can consider finite  |direct_sums|Direct_Sum_Of_Modules|  of matrix algebras. In fact, all C-algebras that are finite dimensional as vector spaces are of this form, up to isomorphism. The self-adjoint requirement means finite-dimensional C-algebras are  |semisimple|Semisimple_Algebra| , from which fact one can deduce the following theorem of  |Artin–Wedderburn|Artin–Wedderburn_Theorem|  type:     Theorem. A finite-dimensional C-algebra, A, is  |canonically|Canonical_Form|  isomorphic to a finite direct sum   : A   A e   where min A is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint central projections of A.     Each C-algebra, Ae, is isomorphic to the full matrix algebra M. The finite family indexed on min A given by  e is called the dimension vector of A. This vector uniquely determines the isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C-algebra. In the language of  |K-theory|Operator_K-Theory| , this vector is the  |positive_cone|Ordered_Group|  of the K 0 group of A.     A †-algebra  is the name occasionally used in  |physics|Physics|  John A. Holbrook, David W. Kribs, and Raymond Laflamme. Noiseless Subsystems and the Structure of the Commutant in Quantum Error Correction. Quantum Information Processing. Volume 2, Number 5, pp. 381  419. Oct 2003. for a finite-dimensional C-algebra. The  |dagger|Dagger| , †, is used in the name because physicists typically use the symbol to denote a  |Hermitian_adjoint|Hermitian_Adjoint| , and are often not worried about the subtleties associated with an infinite number of dimensions. †-algebras feature prominently in  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , and especially  |quantum_information_science|Quantum_Information_Science| .     An immediate generalization of finite dimensional C-algebras are the  |approximately_finite_dimensional_C-algebras|Approximately_Finite_Dimensional_C-Algebra| .       The prototypical example of a C-algebra is the algebra B of bounded  |linear_operators|Linear_Operator|  defined on a complex  |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space|  H; here x denotes the  |adjoint_operator|Adjoint_Operator|  of the operator x : H → H. In fact, every C-algebra, A, is -isomorphic to a norm-closed adjoint closed subalgebra of B for a suitable Hilbert space, H; this is the content of the  |Gelfand–Naimark_theorem|Gelfand–Naimark_Theorem| .       Let H be a  |separable|Separable_Space|  infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The algebra K of  |compact_operators|Compact_Operator_On_Hilbert_Space|  on H is a  |norm_closed|Norm_Closed|  subalgebra of B. It is also closed under involution; hence it is a C-algebra.     Concrete C-algebras of compact operators admit a characterization similar to Wedderburns theorem for finite dimensional C-algebras:     Theorem. If A is a C-subalgebra of K, then there exists Hilbert spaces  i∈I such that   : A     K,   where the direct sum consists of elements  of the Cartesian product Π K with   T i  K does not have an identity element, a sequential  |approximate_identity|Approximate_Identity|  for K can be developed. To be specific, H is isomorphic to the space of square summable sequences l 2 ; we may assume that H l 2 . For each natural number n let H n  be the subspace of sequences of l 2 which vanish for indices k ≤ n and let e n  be the orthogonal projection onto H n . The sequence  n is an approximate identity for K.     K is a two-sided closed ideal of B. For separable Hilbert spaces, it is the unique ideal. The  |quotient|Quotient|  of B by K is the  |Calkin_algebra|Calkin_Algebra| .       Let X be a  |locally_compact|Locally_Compact|  Hausdorff space. The space C0 of complex-valued continuous functions on X that vanish at infinity  form a commutative C-algebra C0 under pointwise multiplication and addition. The involution is pointwise conjugation. C0 has a multiplicative unit element if and only if X is compact. As does any C-algebra, C0 has an  |approximate_identity|Approximate_Identity| . In the case of C0 this is immediate: consider the directed set of compact subsets of X , and for each compact K let fK be a function of compact support which is identically 1 on K . Such functions exist by the  |Tietze_extension_theorem|Tietze_Extension_Theorem|  which applies to locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Any such sequence of functions   is an approximate identity.     The  |Gelfand_representation|Gelfand_Representation|  states that every commutative C-algebra is -isomorphic to the algebra C0 , where X is the space of  |characters|Character|  equipped with the  |weak_topology|Weak_Topology| . Furthermore, if C0 is  |isomorphic|Isomorphism|  to C0 as C-algebras, it follows that X and Y are  |homeomorphic|Homeomorphism| . This characterization is one of the motivations for the  |noncommutative_topology|Noncommutative_Topology|  and  |noncommutative_geometry|Noncommutative_Geometry|  programs.       Given a Banach -algebra A with an  |approximate_identity|Approximate_Identity| , there is a unique C-algebra E and -morphism π from A into E which is  |universal|Universal_Morphism| , that is, every other continuous -morphism  factors uniquely through π. The algebra E is called the C-enveloping algebra of the Banach -algebra A.     Of particular importance is the C-algebra of a  |locally_compact_group|Locally_Compact_Group|  G. This is defined as the enveloping C-algebra of the  |group_algebra|Group_Algebra|  of G. The C-algebra of G provides context for general  |harmonic_analysis|Harmonic_Analysis|  of G in the case G is non-abelian. In particular, the dual of a locally compact group is defined to be the primitive ideal space of the group C-algebra. See  |spectrum_of_a_C-algebra|Spectrum_Of_A_C-Algebra| .          |Von_Neumann_algebras|Von_Neumann_Algebra| , known as W algebras before the 1960s, are a special kind of C-algebra. They are required to be closed in the  |weak_operator_topology|Weak_Operator_Topology| , which is weaker than the norm topology.     The  |Sherman–Takeda_theorem|Sherman–Takeda_Theorem|  implies that any C-algebra has a universal enveloping W-algebra, such that any homomorphism to a W-algebra factors through it.       A C-algebra A is of type I if and only if for all non-degenerate representations π of A the von Neumann algebra π′′  is a type I von Neumann algebra. In fact it is sufficient to consider only factor representations, i.e. representations π for which π′′ is a factor.     A locally compact group is said to be of type I if and only if its  |group_C-algebra|Group_C-Algebra|  is type I.     However, if a C-algebra has non-type I representations, then by results of  |James_Glimm|James_Glimm|  it also has representations of type II and type III. Thus for C-algebras and locally compact groups, it is only meaningful to speak of type I and non type I properties.       In  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , one typically describes a physical system with a C-algebra A with unit element; the self-adjoint elements of A  are thought of as the observables, the measurable quantities, of the system. A state of the system is defined as a positive functional on A  such that φ 1. The expected value of the observable x, if the system is in state φ, is then φ.     This C-algebra approach is used in the Haag-Kastler axiomatization of  |local_quantum_field_theory|Local_Quantum_Field_Theory| , where every open set of  |Minkowski_spacetime|Minkowski_Spacetime|.
