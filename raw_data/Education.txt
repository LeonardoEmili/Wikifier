                          Education is the process of facilitating  |learning|Learning| , or the acquisition of  |knowledge|Knowledge| ,  |skills|Skill| ,  |values|Values| ,  |beliefs|Belief| , and  |habits_|Habit|  Educational methods include  |storytelling|Storytelling| ,  |discussion|Discussion| ,  |teaching|Teaching| ,  |training|Training| , and directed  |research|Research| . Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners may also  |educate_themselves|Autodidacticism| .  Education can take place in  |formal|Formality|  or  |informal|Informal_Education|  settings and any  |experience|Experience|  that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called  |pedagogy|Pedagogy| .     Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as  |preschool|Preschool|  or  |kindergarten|Kindergarten| ,  |primary_school|Primary_School| ,  |secondary_school|Secondary_School|  and then  |college|College| ,  |university|University| , or  |apprenticeship|Apprenticeship| .     A  |right_to_education|Right_To_Education|  has been recognized by some governments and the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| . Article 13 of the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  1966  |International_Covenant_on_Economic_Social_and_Cultural_Rights|International_Covenant_On_Economic_Social_And_Cultural_Rights|  recognizes a universal right to education. ICESCR, Article 13.1 In most regions, education is  |compulsory|Compulsory_Education|  up to a certain age. There is a movement for  |education_reform|Education_Reform| , and in particular for  |evidence_based_education|Evidence_Based_Education| .        |Etymologically|Etymologically| , the word education is derived from the Latin word  ēducātiō  from  ēducō  which is related to the  |homonym|Homonym|   ēdūcō  from  ē-  and  dūcō  . . Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-21.                       Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre- |literate|Literacy|  societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their  |knowledge|Knowledge|  beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the  |Middle_Kingdom|Middle_Kingdom_Of_Egypt| .        |Plato|Plato|  founded the  |Academy|Platonic_Academy|  in  |Athens|Ancient_Athens| , the first institution of higher learning in  |Europe|Europe| .  The city of  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| . There, the great  |Library_of_Alexandria|Library_Of_Alexandria|  was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476. Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004     In  |China|China| ,  |Confucius|Confucius|  , of the  |State_of_Lu|State_Of_Lu| , was the countrys most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his  |Analects|Analects|  were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.      The  |Aztecs|Aztecs|  also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in  |Nahuatl|Nahuatl|  called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means the art of raising or educating a person  or the art of strengthening or bringing up men.  This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.  There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is the act of giving wisdom to the face. These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.     After the  |Fall_of_Rome|Fall_Of_Rome| , the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.  The church established  |cathedral_schools|Cathedral_Schools|  in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into  |medieval_universities|Medieval_Universities|  and forebears of many of Europes modern universities. During the High Middle Ages,  |Chartres_Cathedral|Chartres_Cathedral|  operated the famous and influential  |Chartres_Cathedral_School|School_Of_Chartres| . The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  of the  |University_of_Naples|University_Of_Naples| ,  |Robert_Grosseteste|Robert_Grosseteste|  of the  |University_of_Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| , an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,  and Saint  |Albert_the_Great|Albertus_Magnus| , a pioneer of biological field research.  Founded in 1088, the  |University_of_Bologne|University_Of_Bologne|  is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university. Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: The heritage of European universities , 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136     Elsewhere during the Middle Ages,  |Islamic_science|Islamic_Science|  and  |mathematics|Mathematics_In_Medieval_Islam|  flourished under the Islamic  |caliphate|Caliphate|  which was established across the Middle East, extending from the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  in the west to the  |Indus|Indus|  in the east and to the  |Almoravid_Dynasty|Almoravid_Dynasty|  and  |Mali_Empire|Mali_Empire|  in the south.      |The_Renaissance|The_Renaissance|  in Europe ushered in a  |new_age_of_scientific_and_intellectual_inquiry|Scientific_Revolution|  and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450,  |Johannes_Gutenberg|Johannes_Gutenberg|  developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations  – as with the  |Jesuit_China_missions|Jesuit_China_Missions|  who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like  |Euclids_Elements|Euclids_Elements|  for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of  |Confucius|Confucius|  for European audiences.  |The_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|  saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.     In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or  |otherwise|Homeschooling| , is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth,  |UNESCO|Unesco|  has calculated that in the next 30  years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far. Robinson, K.: . TED Talks, 2006, Monterey, CA, US.       Formal education occurs in a  |structured_environment|Learning_Environment|  whose explicit purpose is teaching  |students|Student| . Usually, formal education takes place in a  |school|School|  environment with  |classrooms|Classroom|  of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most  |school_systems|Educational_Management|  are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum,  |organizational_models|School_Organizational_Models| , design of the physical  |learning_spaces|Learning_Space|  , student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.               Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter  |primary_education|Primary_Education| . These are also known as  |nursery_schools|Nursery_Schools|  and as  |kindergarten|Kindergarten| , except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.  Kindergarten provide a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim at unfolding the childs physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.              Primary education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education Under the  |Education_For_All|Education_For_All|  programs driven by  |UNESCO|Unesco| , most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and  |secondary_education|Secondary_Education|  is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate  |middle_schools|Middle_School| , with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into  |infant_schools|Infant_School|  and  |junior_school|Junior_School| .     In India, for example,  |compulsory_education|Compulsory_Educationvariation_In_Countries|  spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national  |curriculum|Curriculum|  framework designed by the  |National_Council_of_Educational_Research_and_Training|National_Council_Of_Educational_Research_And_Training| .                In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during  |adolescence|Adolescence| . It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive  |primary_education|Primary_Education|  for  |minors|Minor| , to the optional, selective  |tertiary|Tertiary_Education| , postsecondary , or  |higher|Higher_Education|  education  for  |adults|Adult| . Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or  |high_schools|High_School| ,  |gymnasiums|Gymnasium| ,  |lyceums|Lyceum| , middle schools,  |colleges|College| , or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.     Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and  |Australia|Australia| , primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as  |K_12|K–12|  education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give  |common_knowledge|Common_Knowledge| , to prepare for  |higher_education|Higher_Education| , or to train directly in a  |profession|Profession| .     Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required  |skilled_workers|Skilled_Worker| . In order to meet this new job demand,  |high_schools|High_School|  were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for  |white_collar|White_Collar_Worker|  or skilled  |blue_collar|Blue_Collar_Worker|  work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.     Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 6th century,  in the form of  |public_schools|Public_Education| ,  |fee_paying_schools|Fee_Paying_School| , or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.      |Community_colleges|Community_College|  offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.                   Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or  |secondary_school|Secondary_School| . Tertiary education is normally taken to include  |undergraduate|Undergraduate|  and  |postgraduate_education|Postgraduate_Education| , as well as  |vocational_education_and_training|Vocational_Education| . Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive  |certificates|Academic_Certificate| ,  |diplomas|Diploma| , or  |academic_degrees|Academic_Degree| .     Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or  |foundation_degree|Foundation_Degree|  qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national  |economies|Economies| , both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.     University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level  and the  |graduate|Graduate_Student|  level . Some universities are composed of several colleges.     One type of university education is a  |liberal_arts|Liberal_Arts|  education, which can be defined as a  |college|College|  or  |university|University| |_curriculum|Curriculum|  aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional,  |vocational|Vocational_Education| , or technical curriculum.  Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in  |Europe|Europe| ,  the term  |liberal_arts_college|Liberal_Arts_College|  is more commonly associated with institutions in the  |United_States|United_States|  such as  |Williams_College|Williams_College|  or  |Barnard_College|Barnard_College| .                 |Vocational_education|Vocational_Education|  is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an  |apprenticeship|Apprenticeship|  or  |internship|Internship|  as well as institutions teaching courses such as  |carpentry|Carpentry| ,  |agriculture|Agriculture| ,  |engineering|Engineering| ,  |medicine|Medicine| ,  |architecture|Architecture|  and  |the_arts|The_Arts| .             In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by  |physicians|Physicians|  or special tutors. These early physicians  set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills. In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.               While considered alternative today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system.  |Alternative_education|Alternative_Education|  developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of  |traditional_education|Traditional_Education| . A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including  |alternative_schools|Alternative_School| ,  |self_learning|Autodidacticism| ,  |homeschooling|Homeschooling| , and  |unschooling|Unschooling| . Example  |alternative_schools|Alternative_School|  include  |Montessori_schools|Montessori_Method| ,  |Waldorf_schools|Waldorf_Education|  ,  |Friends_schools|List_Of_Friends_Schools| ,  |Sands_School|Sands_School| ,  |Summerhill_School|Summerhill_School| ,  |Waldens_Path|Waldens_Path| ,  |The_Peepal_Grove_School|The_Peepal_Grove_School| ,  |Sudbury_Valley_School|Sudbury_Valley_School| ,  |Krishnamurti_schools|Jiddu_Krishnamurti| , and  |open_classroom|Open_Classroom|  schools.  |Charter_schools|Charter_School|  are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.       In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as  |Friedrich_Fröbels|Friedrich_Fröbel|  approach to  |early_childhood_education|Early_Childhood_Education|  in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary  |kindergarten|Kindergarten|  classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the  |Swiss|Switzerland| |_humanitarian|Humanitarianism| |_Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi|Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi| ; the  |American|United_States| |_transcendentalists|Transcendentalism| |_Amos_Bronson_Alcott|Amos_Bronson_Alcott| ,  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson| , and  |Henry_David_Thoreau|Henry_David_Thoreau| ; the founders of  |progressive_education|Educational_Progressivism| ,  |John_Dewey|John_Dewey|  and  |Francis_Parker|Francis_Wayland_Parker| ; and educational pioneers such as  |Maria_Montessori|Maria_Montessori|  and  |Rudolf_Steiner|Rudolf_Steiner| , and more recently  |John_Caldwell_Holt|John_Caldwell_Holt| ,  |Paul_Goodman|Paul_Goodman| ,  |Frederick_Mayer|Frederick_Mayer| ,  |George_Dennison|George_Dennison| , and  |Ivan_Illich|Ivan_Illich| .              |Indigenous_education|Indigenous_Education|  refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.           Informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the  |Organisation_for_Economic_Co_operation_and_Development|Organisation_For_Economic_Co_Operation_And_Development|  . Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at  |home|Home| ,  |work|Employment| , and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For many learners, this includes  |language_acquisition|Language_Acquisition| ,  |cultural_norms|Cultural_Norm| , and  |manners|Manners| .     In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner. If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.  For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.      While informal learning often takes place outside educational  |establishments|School|  and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.     In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.  In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.   |L_P_Jacks|L_P_Jacks| , also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.  Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of lifes activities.  The concept has been revived by the  |University_of_Western_Ontario|University_Of_Western_Ontario|  to teach  |anatomy|Anatomy|  to medical students.           |Autodidacticism|Autodidacticism|  is self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in ones life.  |Notable_autodidacts|List_Of_Autodidacts|  include  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln|  ,  |Srinivasa_Ramanujan|Srinivasa_Ramanujan|  ,  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday|  ,  |Charles_Darwin|Charles_Darwin|  ,  |Thomas_Alva_Edison|Thomas_Alva_Edison|  ,  |Tadao_Ando|Tadao_Ando|  ,  |George_Bernard_Shaw|George_Bernard_Shaw|  ,  |Frank_Zappa|Frank_Zappa|  , and  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  .          Evidence-based education is the use of well designed scientific studies to determine which education methods work best. It consists of evidence-based teaching and evidence-based learning.  |Evidence_based_learning|Evidence_Based_Learning|  methods such as  |spaced_repetition|Spaced_Repetition|  can increase rate of learning.  The evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards  |evidence_based_practices|Evidence_Based_Practice| .            Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as  |Harvard|Harvard_University| ,  |MIT|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology|  and  |Berkeley|University_Of_California_Berkeley|  teaming up to form  |edX|Edx| . Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as  |Stanford|Stanford_University| ,  |Princeton|Princeton_University| ,  |Duke|Duke_University| ,  |Johns_Hopkins|Johns_Hopkins_University| , the  |University_of_Pennylvania|University_Of_Pennsylvania| , and  |Caltech|California_Institute_Of_Technology| , as well as notable public universities including  |Tsinghua|Tsinghua_University| ,  |Peking|Peking_University| ,  |Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh| ,  |University_of_Michigan|University_Of_Michigan| , and  |University_of_Virginia|University_Of_Virginia| .     Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.  Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.      Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials. Cloete, ElsabeÂ. Electronic Education System Model. Department of Computer Science and Information Systems in South Africa, 17 Oct. 2000. Web. 3 June 2015.     The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some  |open_universities|Open_Universities|  do already offer conventional degrees such as the  |Open_University|Open_University|  in the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| . Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal  |academic_value|Academic_Capital|  to traditional degrees.      Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.      A recent meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction. U.S. Department of Education, , 2010          The education sector or education system is a group of institutions whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people . These institutions can vary according to different contexts.      Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as  |education_policies|Education_Policy|  and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical and psychological – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school. The  |Organisation_for_Economic_Co_operation_and_Development|Organisation_For_Economic_Co_Operation_And_Development|  has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.      The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with numerous stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health,  |child_protection|Child_Protection| , justice and law enforcement , media and political leadership.            Chimombo pointed out educations role as a policy instrument, capable of instilling social change and economic advancement in developing countries by giving communities the opportunity to take control of their destinies.  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17  |Sustainable_Development_Goals|Sustainable_Development_Goals|  , including SDG 4 on education.       Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.      |Universal_Primary_Education|Universal_Primary_Education|  is one of the eight international  |Millennium_Development_Goals|Millennium_Development_Goals| , towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010.  London:  |Overseas_Development_Institute|Overseas_Development_Institute| . Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the  |Overseas_Development_Institute|Overseas_Development_Institute|  have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. Additionally,  |Transparency_International|Transparency_International|  has identified  |corruption|Political_Corruption|  in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.  Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.     A study conducted by the  |UNESCO_International_Institute_for_Educational_Planning|Unesco_International_Institute_For_Educational_Planning|  indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. . Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:   national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;   strategies must be context relevant and context specific;   plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;   partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;   outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;   a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics .       Nearly every country now has  |universal_primary_education|Universal_Primary_Education| .     Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European  |Socrates_Erasmus_Programme|Erasmus_Programme|   facilitates exchanges across European universities. The  |Soros_Foundation|Soros_Foundation|   provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the  |International_Baccalaureate|International_Baccalaureate|  have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.     The  |Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment|Programme_For_International_Student_Assessment|  and the  |International_Association_for_the_Evaluation_of_Educational_Achievement|International_Association_For_The_Evaluation_Of_Educational_Achievement|  objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.     The internationalization of education is sometimes equated by critics with the westernization of education. These critics say that the internationalization of education leads to the erosion of local education systems and indigenous values and norms, which are replaced with Western systems and cultural and ideological values and orientation.                Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and  |developing_countries|Developing_Countries| . However, lack of technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing countries.  Charities like  |One_Laptop_per_Child|One_Laptop_Per_Child|  are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.     The  |OLPC_foundation|One_Laptop_Per_Child| , a group out of  |MIT_Media_Lab|Mit_Media_Lab|  and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a  |_100_laptop|_100_Laptop|  for delivering  |educational_software|Educational_Software| . The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.     In Africa, the  |New_Partnership_for_Africas_Development|New_Partnership_For_Africas_Development|  has launched an  |e_school_program|New_Partnership_For_Africas_Development_E_School_Program|  to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and  |internet_access|Internet_Access|  within 10 years.  An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,  started with the support of former American President  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton| , uses the  |Internet|Internet|  to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.      |India|India|  is developing technologies that will bypass land-based  |telephone|Telephone|  and Internet infrastructure to deliver  |distance_learning|Distance_Learning|  directly to its students. In 2004, the  |Indian_Space_Research_Organisation|Indian_Space_Research_Organisation|  launched  |EDUSAT|Gsat_3| , a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the countrys population at a greatly reduced cost.        Research into LCPS found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving  |Education_for_All|Education_For_All|  objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.  The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs. Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:   Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.        The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread. Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.                        |Educational_psychology|Educational_Psychology|  is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the  |social_psychology|Social_Psychology|  of  |schools|School|  as  |organizations|Organization| . Although the terms educational psychology and school psychology are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as  |educational_psychologists|_Category_Educational_Psychologists| , whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as  |school_psychologists|School_Psychologist| . Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as  |gifted|Gifted|  children and those with specific  |disabilities|Disabilities| .      Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by  |psychology|Psychology| , bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between  |medicine|Medicine|  and  |biology|Biology| . Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including  |instructional_design|Instructional_Design| ,  |educational_technology|Educational_Technology| , curriculum development,  |organizational_learning|Organizational_Learning| ,  |special_education|Special_Education|  and  |classroom_management|Classroom_Management| . Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to  |cognitive_science|Cognitive_Science|  and the  |learning_sciences|Learning_Sciences| . In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks .           |Intelligence|Intelligence|  is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.  This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.  Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.        There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are: Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., & Milone, M. N. . The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.    |Visual|Visual| |Auditory|Hearing| |Kinesthetic|Kinesthetic| |music|Music| al,  |interpersonal|Interpersonal| ,  |verbal|Verbal_Reasoning| ,  |logical|Logical| , and  |intrapersonal|Intrapersonal| .     Dunn and Dunn  focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as  |Joseph_Renzulli|Joseph_Renzulli|   recommended varying teaching strategies.  |Howard_Gardner|Howard_Gardner|   detailing Multiple Intelligences identified a wide range of modalities in his  |Multiple_Intelligences|Multiple_Intelligences|  theories. The  |Myers_Briggs_Type_Indicator|Myers_Briggs_Type_Indicator|  and  |Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter|Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter| , based on the works of  |Jung|Jung| ,  focus on understanding how peoples personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of  |David_Kolb|David_Kolb|  and  |Anthony_Gregorcs|Anthony_Gregorc|  Type Delineator  follows a similar but more simplified approach.     Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. Barbe, W. B., & Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. . Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.  Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that  |learning_styles|Learning_Styles|  such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.   Recent research has argued, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice.         |Educational_neuroscience|Educational_Neuroscience|  is an emerging  |scientific|Science|  field that brings together researchers in  |cognitive_neuroscience|Cognitive_Neuroscience| ,  |developmental_cognitive_neuroscience|Developmental_Cognitive_Neuroscience| ,  |educational_psychology|Educational_Psychology| ,  |educational_technology|Educational_Technology| ,  |education_theory|Education_Theory|  and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education.     Researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the  |neural|Neural|  mechanisms of  |reading|Reading| ,  |numerical_cognition|Numerical_Cognition| ,   |attention|Attention| , and their attendant difficulties including  |dyslexia|Dyslexia| ,    |dyscalculia|Dyscalculia| ,  and  |ADHD|Adhd|  as they relate to education. Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.             As an academic field, philosophy of education is the philosophical study of education and its problems   its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of  |philosophy|Philosophy|  .  The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.  As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of  |applied_philosophy|Applied_Philosophy| , drawing from fields of  |metaphysics|Metaphysics| ,  |epistemology|Epistemology| ,  |axiology|Axiology|  and the philosophical approaches  to address questions in and about  |pedagogy|Pedagogy| ,  |education_policy|Education_Policy| , and  |curriculum|Curriculum| , as well as the process of  |learning|Learning_Theory| , to name a few.  For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between  |education_theory|Education_Theory|  and practice.       There is no broad consensus as to what educations chief aim or aims are or should be. Different places, and at different times, have used educational systems for different purposes. The  |Prussian_education_system|Prussian_Education_System|  in the 19th century, for example, wanted to turn boys and girls into adults who would serve the states political goals.       Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize educations contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting societys general economic development, and preserving cultural values. Christopher Winch and John Gingell, Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts . London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.     The purpose of education in a given time and place affects who is taught, what is taught, and how the education system behaves. For example, in the 21st century, many countries treat education as a  |positional_good|Positional_Good| .  In this competitive approach, people want their own students to get a better education than other students. This approach can lead to unfair treatment of some students, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups. For example, in this system, a citys school system may draw school district boundaries so that nearly all the students in one school are from low-income families, and that nearly all the students in the neighboring schools come from more affluent families, even though concentrating low-income students in one school results in worse educational achievement for the entire school system.          In formal education, a  |curriculum|Curriculum|  is the set of courses and their content offered at a  |school|School|  or  |university|University| . As an idea, curriculum stems from the  |Latin|Latin|  word for  race course , referring to the course of  |deeds|Wikt_Deed|  and experiences through which  |child|Child| ren grow to become mature  |adults|Adult| . A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general  |syllabus|Syllabus|  which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.     An  |academic_discipline|List_Of_Academic_Disciplines|  is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the  |natural_sciences|Natural_Science| ,  |mathematics|Mathematics| ,  |computer_science|Computer_Science| ,  |social_sciences|Social_Science| ,  |humanities|Humanities|  and  |applied_sciences|Applied_Science| .        Instruction is the facilitation of anothers learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called  |teachers|Teacher| , and they direct the education of  |students|Student|  and might draw on many  |subjects|Course|  like  |reading|Reading| ,  |writing|Writing| ,  |mathematics|Mathematics| ,  |science|Science|  and  |history|History| . Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called  |teachers|Teacher| , instructors, or  |professors|Professor| , depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.   With the passing of NCLB in the United States , teachers must be highly qualified.              It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of  |economic_growth|Economic_Growth| .  Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However,  |technology_transfer|Technology_Transfer|  requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a countrys ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of  |human_capital|Human_Capital|  . Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions  and the role of cognitive skills.      At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of  |Jacob_Mincer|Jacob_Mincer| ,  on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated many studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling. David Card, Causal effect of education on earnings, in Handbook of labor economics, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card . Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999: pp. 1801–63 James J. Heckman, Lance J. Lochner, and Petra E. Todd., Earnings functions, rates of return and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond, in Handbook of the Economics of Education, Eric A. Hanushek and Finis Welch . Amsterdam: North Holland, 2006: pp. 307–458. Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high  |intelligence_quotient|Intelligence_Quotient| , may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.      Economists  |Samuel_Bowles|Samuel_Bowles|  and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the  |egalitarian|Egalitarianism|  goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.      In  |The_Case_Against_Education|The_Case_Against_Education| , Bryan Caplan argues that education is largely a waste of students time and taxpayers money. Specifically, all levels of education waste resources teaching many subjects that few students need to learn or have any real interest in. The bulk of what students learn is quickly forgotten after final examinations. University education, in particular, has become so vital to ones career only due to decades of  |credentialism_and_educational_inflation|Credentialism_And_Educational_Inflation| . It merely serves the purpose of  |signalling|Signalling|  to employers that a graduate is probably brilliant, diligent and willing to tolerate serious boredom. To remedy this situation, primary schools should teach nothing but writing and mathematics. Secondary schools should add nothing but vocational training. Public spending on university education should be drastically reduced so that  |underemployment|Underemployment| -prone degrees will become less attractive to students. The vast public funds thus saved could then be redirected to other purposes.          Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.  There are also active  |educational_interventions|Educational_Interventions_For_First_Generation_Students|  to implement programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as  |first_generation_students|First_Generation_College_Students_In_The_United_States| .     Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too.  Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.
