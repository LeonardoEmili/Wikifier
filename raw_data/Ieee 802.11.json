In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds . 802.11a also suffers from interference,  but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.            The 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11  Mbit/s, and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.     Devices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4  GHz band.

The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as reductions in manufacturing costs.

IEEE 802.11-2016 which was known as IEEE 802.11 REVmc,  is a revision based on IEEE 802.11-2012, incorporating 5 amendments . In addition, existing MAC and PHY functions have been enhanced and obsolete features were removed or marked for removal. Some clauses and annexes have been renumbered.             IEEE 802.11ah, published in 2017,  defines a WLAN system operating at sub-1  GHz license-exempt bands. Due to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating in the 2.4  GHz and 5  GHz  bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks,  extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. The protocol intends consumption to be competitive with low power ": null

IEEE 802.11aj is a rebanding of 802.11ad for use in the 45  GHz unlicensed spectrum available in some regions of the world .     Alternatively known as China Milli-Meter Wave .       IEEE 802.11aq is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that will enable pre-association discovery of services. This extends some of the mechanisms in 802.11u that enabled device discovery to further discover the services running on a device, or provided by a network.          IEEE 802.11ax  is the successor to 802.11ac, and will increase the efficiency of WLAN networks. Currently in development, this project has the goal of providing 4x the throughput of 802.11ac at the user layer,  having just 37% higher nominal data rates at the PHY layer.  In the previous amendment of 802.11 , Multi-User MIMO has been introduced, which is a spatial multiplexing technique. MU-MIMO allows the Access Point to form beams towards each Client, while transmitting information simultaneously. By doing so, the interference between Clients is reduced, and the overall throughput is increased, since multiple Clients can receive data at the same time. With 802.11ax, a similar multiplexing is introduced in the frequency domain, namely ": null

By doing so, an 80  MHz channel can be split into multiple Resource Units, so that multiple Clients receive different type of data over the same spectrum, simultaneously.

In other words, for 20, 40, 80 and 160  MHz channels, there are 64, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers in 802.11ac standard; while there are 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 subcarriers in 802.11ax standard. Since the available bandwidths have not changed and the number of subcarriers are increased with a factor of 4, the subcarrier spacing is reduced by a factor of 4 as well. This introduces 4 times longer OFDM symbols. E.g., for 802.11ac and 802.11ax, the duration of an OFDM symbol is 3.2 micro seconds and 12.8 micro seconds , respectively.

It will build upon 802.11ax, focusing on WLAN indoor and outdoor operation with stationary and pedestrian speeds in the 2.4  GHz, 5  GHz, and 6  GHz frequency bands. Being the potential successor of Wi-Fi 6, the Wi-Fi Alliance will most likely certify it as Wi-Fi 7.            Across all variations of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are given either based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer-2 data rates. However, this does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.

This occasionally leads to the belief that four non-overlapping channels exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 , which states In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25  MHz.    and section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.     This does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels. The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.            However, overlap between channels with more narrow spacing may cause unacceptable degradation of signal quality and throughput, particularly when users transmit near the boundaries of AP cells.        IEEE uses the phrase regdomain to refer to a legal regulatory region. Different countries define different levels of allowable transmitter power, time that a channel can be occupied, and different available channels.
