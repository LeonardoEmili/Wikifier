Separation of Eurostar from British domestic services through Kent meant that timetabling was no longer affected by peak-hour restrictions.          Eurostars fares were significantly higher in its early years; the cheapest fare in 1994 was £99 return.    In 2002, Eurostar was planning cheaper fares, an example of which was an offer of £50 day returns from London to Paris or Brussels.     By March 2003, the cheapest fare from the UK was £59 return, available all year around. In June 2009 it was announced that one-way single fares would be available at £31 at the cheapest. Competition between Eurostar and airline services was a large factor in ticket prices being reduced from the initial levels.     Business Premier fares also slightly undercut air fares on similar routes, targeted at regular business travellers.

On the northbound Marne la Vallée-Chessy - London train, the security check and French passport check take place at Marne la Vallée-Chessy, while the UK passport check takes place at the UK arrival stations - this is the only route where passengers are not cleared by UK border officials before crossing the channel.     On the northbound Marseille-London train, there is no facility for security or passport checks at the southern French stations, so passengers must leave the train at Lille-Europe, taking all their belongings with them, and undergo security and border checks there before rejoining the train which waits at the station for just over an hour.      On several occasions, people have illegally tried to stow away on board the train,   sometimes in large groups,  trying to enter the UK; border monitoring and security is therefore extremely tight.    Eurostar claims to have good and well-funded security measures.              Eurostars punctuality has fluctuated from year to year, but usually remains over 90%;  in the first quarter of 1999, 89% of services operated were on time, and in the second quarter it reached 92%.  Eurostars best punctuality record was 97.35%, between 16 and 22 August 2004.  In 2006, it was 92.7%,  and in 2007, 91.5% were on time. Eurostar uses the airlines definition of on-time: within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time. The measure used for long-distance services in the UK rail industry is within 10 minutes.  In the first quarter of 2009, 96% of Eurostar services were punctual, compared with rival air routes 76%.      An advantage held by Eurostar is the convenience and speed of the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing   and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market.

Speed limits in the Channel Tunnel are dictated by air-resistance, energy dissipation and the need to fit in with other, slower trains. The trains were designed with Channel Tunnel safety in mind, and consist of two independent half-sets each with its own power car. In the event of a serious fire on board while travelling through the tunnel, passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be detached and driven out of the tunnel to safety.    If the undamaged part were the rear half of the train, this would be driven by the Chef du Train, who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab while the train travels through the tunnel for this purpose.
