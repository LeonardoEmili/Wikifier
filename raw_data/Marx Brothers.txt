              The Marx Brothers were an American family comedy act that was successful in  |vaudeville|Vaudeville| , on  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre| , and in  |motion_pictures|Motion_Pictures|  from 1905 to 1949. Five of the Marx Brothers thirteen feature films were selected by the  |American_Film_Institute|American_Film_Institute|  as among the  |top_100_comedy_films|Afis_100_Years_..._100_Laughs| , with two of them,  Duck Soup  and  A Night at the Opera  , in the top fifteen. They are widely considered by critics, scholars, and fans to be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century. The brothers were included in  |AFIs_100_Years..._100_Stars|Afis_100_Years..._100_Stars|  list of the 25 greatest male stars of  |Classical_Hollywood|Classical_Hollywood|  cinema, the only performers to be inducted collectively.     The group is almost universally known today by their  |stage_names|Stage_Name| :  |Chico|Chico_Marx| ,  |Harpo|Harpo_Marx| ,  |Groucho|Groucho_Marx| ,  |Gummo|Gummo_Marx| , and  |Zeppo|Zeppo_Marx| . There was a sixth brother, the first born, named Manfred , who died aged seven months; Zeppo was given the middle name Manfred in his memory.     The core of the act was the three elder brothers: Chico, Harpo, and Groucho, each of whom developed a highly distinctive stage persona. After the group essentially disbanded in 1950, Groucho went on to begin a successful second career in  |television|Television| , while Harpo and Chico appeared less prominently. The two younger brothers, Gummo and Zeppo, never developed their stage characters to the same extent as the elder three. They each left the act to pursue business careers at which they were successful, and for a time ran a large theatrical agency through which they represented their brothers and others. Gummo was not in any of the movies; Zeppo appeared in the first five films in relatively straight roles. The early performing lives of the brothers owed much to their mother  |Minnie_Marx|Minnie_Marx|  , who acted as their manager until her death in 1929.             The Marx Brothers were born in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , the sons of  |Jewish|Jewish|  immigrants from  |Germany|Germany|  and  |France|France| . Their mother  |Miene_Minnie_Schoenberg|Minnie_Marx|  was from  |Dornum|Dornum|  in  |East_Frisia|East_Frisia| , and their father  |Samuel|Sam_Marx|  Marx was a native of  |Mertzwiller|Mertzwiller|  a small Alsacian village  |Alsace|Alsace|  and worked as a tailor.    The family lived in the poor  |Yorkville|Yorkville,_Manhattan|  section of New York Citys  |Upper_East_Side|Upper_East_Side| , centered in the Irish, German and Italian quarters. The brothers are best known by their stage names:          Another brother, Manfred , the first-born son of Sam and Minnie, was born in 1886 and died in infancy:        Family  |lore|Oral_Tradition|  told privately of the firstborn son, Manny, born in 1886 but surviving for only three months, and carried off by tuberculosis. Even some members of the Marx family wondered if he was pure myth. But Manfred can be verified. A death certificate of the Borough of Manhattan reveals that he died, aged seven months, on 17 July 1886, of  |enterocolitis|Enterocolitis| , with  |asthenia|Asthenia|  contributing, i.e., probably a victim of influenza. He is buried at New Yorks Washington Cemetery, beside his grandmother, Fanny Sophie Schönberg , who died on 10 April 1901.     The Marx Brothers also had an older sister, actually a cousin, born in January 1885 who had been adopted by Minnie and Frenchie. Her name was Pauline, or Polly . Simon Louvish.  , The New York Times. Groucho talked about her in his 1972 Carnegie Hall concert.     Minnie Marx came from a family of performers. Her mother was a  |yodeling|Yodeling|  harpist and her father a  |ventriloquist|Ventriloquism| ; both were  |funfair|Funfair|  entertainers. Around 1880, the family emigrated to  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , where Minnie married Sam in 1884. During the early 20th century, Minnie helped her younger brother Abraham Elieser Adolf Schönberg  to enter show business; he became highly successful on  |vaudeville|Vaudeville|  and  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  as half of the  |musical_comedy|Musical_Comedy| |double_act|Double_Act| |Gallagher_and_Shean|Gallagher_And_Shean| , and this gave the brothers an entree to musical comedy, vaudeville and Broadway at Minnies instigation.  Minnie also acted as the brothers manager, using the name Minnie Palmer so that agents did not realize that she was also their mother. All the brothers confirmed that Minnie Marx had been the head of the family and the driving force in getting the troupe launched, the only person who could keep them in order; she was said to be a hard bargainer with theatre management.   |Louvish,_Simon|Simon_Louvish| . Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers. Thomas Dunne Books; 1st U.S. edition . Also      Gummo and Zeppo both became successful businessmen: Gummo gained success through his agency activities and a raincoat business,  and Zeppo became a multi-millionaire through his engineering business.                 The brothers were from a family of artists, and their musical talent was encouraged from an early age. Harpo was particularly talented, learning to play an estimated six different instruments throughout his career. He became a dedicated harpist, which gave him his nickname. Marx and Barber. Chico was an excellent pianist, Groucho a guitarist and singer, and Zeppo a vocalist.     They got their start in  |vaudeville|Vaudeville| , where their uncle Albert Schönberg performed as  |Al_Shean|Al_Shean|  of  |Gallagher_and_Shean|Gallagher_And_Shean| . Grouchos debut was in 1905, mainly as a singer. By 1907, he and Gummo were singing together as The Three Nightingales with  |Mabel_ODonnell|Mabel_Odonnell| .  The next year, Harpo became the fourth Nightingale and by 1910, the group briefly expanded to include their mother Minnie and their Aunt Hannah. The troupe was renamed The Six Mascots .       One evening in 1912, a performance at the Opera House in  |Nacogdoches,_Texas|Nacogdoches,_Texas| , was interrupted by shouts from outside about a runaway mule. The audience hurried out to see what was happening. Groucho was angered by the interruption and, when the audience returned, he made snide comments at their expense, including Nacogdoches is full of roaches and the jackass is the flower of Tex-ass . Instead of becoming angry, the audience laughed. The family then realized that it had potential as a comic troupe. Kanfer, pp.  35–36.      The act slowly evolved from singing with comedy to comedy with music. The brothers sketch Fun in Hi Skule featured Groucho as a German-accented teacher presiding over a classroom that included students Harpo, Gummo, and Chico. The last version of the school act was titled Home Again and was written by their uncle  |Al_Shean|Al_Shean| . The Home Again tour reached  |Flint,_Michigan|Flint,_Michigan|  in 1915, where 14-year-old Zeppo joined his four brothers for what is believed to be the only time that all five Marx Brothers appeared together on stage.  Gummo then left to serve in  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , reasoning that anything is better than being an actor! Chandler, p. ???. Zeppo replaced him in their final vaudeville years and in the jump to  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre| , and then to  |Paramount|Paramount_Pictures|  films.          During World War I, anti-German sentiments were common, and the family tried to conceal its German origin. Mother Minnie learned that farmers were excluded from the draft rolls, so she purchased a  poultry farm near  |Countryside,_Illinois|Countryside,_Illinois|  — but the brothers soon found that chicken ranching was not in their blood.  During this time, Groucho discontinued his German stage personality.     By this time, The Four Marx Brothers had begun to incorporate their unique style of comedy into their act and to develop their characters. Both Grouchos and Harpos memoirs say that their now-famous on-stage personae were created by  |Al_Shean|Al_Shean| . Groucho began to wear his trademark  |greasepaint|Greasepaint|  mustache and to use a stooped walk. Harpo stopped speaking onstage and began to wear a red fright wig and carry a taxi-cab horn. Chico spoke with a fake Italian accent, developed off-stage to deal with neighborhood toughs, while Zeppo adopted the role of the romantic   |straight_man|Double_Act| .     The on-stage personalities of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo were said to have been based on their actual traits. Zeppo, on the other hand, was considered the funniest brother offstage, despite his straight stage roles. He was the youngest and had grown up watching his brothers, so he could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. He was so good as Captain Spaulding in  Animal Crackers  that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience, Groucho recalled.  Kanfer, pp.  139–140. In December 1917 the Marx brothers were noted in an advertisement playing in a musical comedy act Home Again .      By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers had become one of Americas favorite theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their  |improvisational_comedy|Improvisational_Comedy|  in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing  |chorus_girl|Chorus_Girl|  across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audiences delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger . When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked his watch and ad-libbed, The 9:20s right on time. You can set your watch by the  |Lehigh_Valley|Lehigh_Valley_Railroad| .     The brothers vaudeville act had made them stars on Broadway under Chicos management and with Grouchos creative direction—first with the musical revue  Ill Say She Is  and then with two musical comedies:  The Cocoanuts  and  Animal Crackers  . Playwright  |George_S._Kaufman|George_S._Kaufman|  worked on the last two and helped sharpen the brothers characterizations.     Out of their distinctive costumes, the brothers looked alike, even down to their receding hairlines. Zeppo could pass for a younger Groucho, and played the role of his son in  Horse Feathers . A scene in  Duck Soup  finds Groucho, Harpo, and Chico all appearing in the famous greasepaint eyebrows, mustache, and round glasses while wearing nightcaps. The three are indistinguishable, enabling them to carry off the mirror scene perfectly.       The stage names of the brothers were coined by  |monologist|Stand_Up_Comedy|  Art Fisher Joe Adamson. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973. during a  |poker|Poker|  game in  |Galesburg,_Illinois|Galesburg,_Illinois| , based both on the brothers personalities and  |Gus_Magers|Gus_Mager|   Sherlocko the Monk , a popular  |comic_strip|Comic_Strips|  of the day that included a supporting character named  |Groucho|Groucho_The_Monk|  . Marx, Groucho . The Groucho Phile, p. 31. As Fisher dealt each brother a card, he addressed them, for the very first time, by the names they kept for the rest of their lives.     The reasons behind Chicos and Harpos stage names are undisputed, and Gummos is fairly well established. Grouchos and Zeppos are far less clear. Arthur was named Harpo because he played the  |harp|Harp| , and Leonard became Chico because he was, in the slang of the period, a chicken chaser . Groucho Live At Carnegie Hall     In his autobiography, Harpo explained that Milton became Gummo because he crept about the theater like a gumshoe detective. Marx and Barber, p. ??. Other sources reported that Gummo was the familys hypochondriac, having been the sickliest of the brothers in childhood, and therefore wore  |rubber_overshoes|Galosh| , called gumshoes, in all kinds of weather. Still others reported that Milton was the troupes best dancer, and dance shoes tended to have rubber soles. Louvish, S. . Monkey business: The lives and legends of the Marx Brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo with added Gummo. London: Faber & Faber. Groucho stated that the source of the name was Gummo wearing galoshes. Whatever the details, the name relates to rubber-soled shoes.     The reason that Julius was named Groucho is perhaps the most disputed. There are three explanations:     Juliuss temperament: Maxine, Chicos daughter and Grouchos niece, said in the documentary The Unknown Marx Brothers that Julius was named Groucho simply because he was grouchy most or all of the time.  |Robert_B._Weide|Robert_B._Weide| , a director known for his knowledge of Marx Brothers history, said in Remarks On Marx  that, among the competing explanations, he found this one to be the most believable.  |Steve_Allen|Steve_Allen|  said in Funny People that the name made no sense; Groucho might have been impudent and impertinent, but not grouchy—at least not around Allen. However, at the very end of his life, Groucho finally admitted that Fisher had named him Groucho because he was the moody one . Marx, G. . The Groucho Phile. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, p. 30.   The grouch bag: This explanation appears in Harpos biography; it was voiced by Chico in a TV appearance included on The Unknown Marx Brothers; and it was offered by  |George_Fenneman|George_Fenneman| , Grouchos sidekick on his TV  |game_show|Game_Show|   You Bet Your Life . A grouch bag was a small drawstring bag worn around the neck in which a traveler could keep money and other valuables so that it would be very difficult for anyone to steal them. Most of Grouchos friends and associates stated that Groucho was extremely stingy, especially after losing all his money in the  |1929_stock_market_crash|Wall_Street_Crash_Of_1929| , so naming him for the grouch bag may have been a comment on this trait. Groucho insisted that this was not the case in chapter six of his first autobiography:     I kept my money in a grouch bag. This was a small  |chamois|Chamois_Leather|  bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from pinching their dough. Naturally, youre going to think thats where I got my name from. But thats not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long before there was a Groucho. Marx, Groucho and Me.     Grouchos explanation: Groucho himself insisted that he was named for a character in the comic strip  Knocko the Monk , which inspired the craze for nicknames ending in o ; in fact, there was a character in that strip named Groucho . However, he is the only Marx or Marx associate who defended this theory, and as he is not an unbiased witness, few biographers take the claim seriously.     :Groucho himself was no help on this point; he was discussing the Brothers names during his  |Carnegie_Hall|Carnegie_Hall|  concert, and he said of his own, My name, of course, I never did understand. He goes on to mention the possibility that he was named after his unemployed uncle Julius, who lived with his family. The family believed that he was a rich uncle hiding a fortune, and Groucho claimed that he may have been named after him by the family trying to get into the will. And he finally died, and he left us his will, and in that will he left three razor blades, an 8-ball, a celluloid dicky, and he owed my father $85 beside.     Herbert was not nicknamed by Art Fisher, since he did not join the act until Gummo had departed. As with Groucho, three explanations exist for Herberts name Zeppo :     Harpos explanation: Harpo said in Harpo Speaks! that the brothers had named Herbert for Mr. Zippo, a  |chimpanzee|Common_Chimpanzee|  that was part of another performers act. Herbert found the nickname very unflattering, and when it came time for him to join the act, he put his foot down and refused to be called Zippo . The brothers compromised on Zeppo .   Chicos explanation: Chico never wrote an autobiography and gave fewer interviews than his brothers, but his daughter Maxine said in The Unknown Marx Brothers that, when the brothers lived in Chicago, a popular style of humor was the Zeke and Zeb joke, which made fun of slow-witted Midwesterners in much the same way that  |Boudreaux_and_Thibodeaux|Boudreaux_And_Thibodeaux|  jokes mock  |Cajuns|Cajun|  and  |Ole_and_Lena|Ole_And_Lena|  jokes mock  |Minnesotans|Minnesotan| . One day, Chico returned home to find Herbert sitting on the fence. Herbert greeted him by saying Hi, Zeke! Chico responded with Hi, Zeb! and the name stuck. The brothers thereafter called him Zeb and, when he joined the act, they floated the idea of Zebbo , eventually preferring Zeppo .   Grouchos explanation: In a tape-recorded interview excerpted on The Unknown Marx Brothers, Groucho said that Zeppo was so named because he was born when the first  |zeppelins|Zeppelin|  started crossing the ocean. He stated this in his Carnegie Hall concert, around 1972. The first zeppelin flew in July 1900, and Herbert was  |born_seven_months_later|Zeppo_Marx|  in February 1901. However,  |the_first_transatlantic_zeppelin_flight|Zeppelinrenaissance|  was not until 1924, long after Herberts birth.     Maxine Marx reported in The Unknown Marx Brothers that the brothers listed their real names on playbills and in programs, and only used the nicknames behind the scenes, until  |Alexander_Woollcott|Alexander_Woollcott|  overheard them calling one another by the nicknames. He asked them why they used their real names publicly when they had such wonderful nicknames, and they replied, That wouldnt be dignified. Woollcott answered with a belly laugh. Woollcott did not meet the Marx Brothers until the premiere of  Ill Say She Is , which was their first Broadway show, so this would mean that they used their real names throughout their vaudeville days, and that the name Gummo never appeared in print during his time in the act. Other sources reported that the Marx Brothers went by their nicknames during their vaudeville era, but briefly listed themselves by their given names when Ill Say She Is opened because they were worried that a Broadway audience would reject a vaudeville act if they were perceived as low class. Kanfer.                The Marx Brothers stage shows became popular just as motion pictures were evolving to  |talkies|History_Of_Cinema|  . They signed a contract with  |Paramount_Pictures|Paramount_Pictures|  and embarked on their film career at Paramounts studios in  |New_York_Citys|New_York_City| |Astoria|Astoria,_Queens|  section. Their first two released films  were adaptations of the Broadway shows  The Cocoanuts  and  Animal Crackers  . Both were written by  |George_S._Kaufman|George_S._Kaufman|  and  |Morrie_Ryskind|Morrie_Ryskind| . Production then shifted to Hollywood, beginning with a  |short_film|Short_Film|  that was included in Paramounts twentieth anniversary documentary,  The House That Shadows Built  , in which they adapted a scene from Ill Say She Is. Their third feature-length film,  Monkey Business  , was their first movie not based on a stage production.       Horse Feathers  , in which the brothers satirized the American college system and  |Prohibition|Prohibition_In_The_United_States| , was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of  Time  magazine.  It included a running gag from their stage work, in which Harpo produces a ludicrous array of props from inside his coat, including a wooden mallet, a fish, a coiled rope, a tie, a poster of a woman in her underwear, a cup of hot coffee, a sword; and, just after Groucho warns him that he cant burn the candle at both ends, a candle burning at both ends.     During this period Chico and Groucho starred in a  |radio|Radio|  comedy series,  Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel . Though the series was short lived, much of the material developed for it was used in subsequent films. The shows scripts and recordings were believed lost until copies of the scripts were found in the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress|  in the 1980s. After publication in a book they were performed with Marx Brothers impersonators for  |BBC_Radio|Bbc_Radio| .      Their last Paramount film,  Duck Soup  , directed by the highly regarded  |Leo_McCarey|Leo_Mccarey| , is the highest rated of the five Marx Brothers films on the  |American_Film_Institutes|American_Film_Institute|  100 years ... 100 Movies list. It did not do as well financially as Horse Feathers, but was the sixth-highest grosser of 1933. The film sparked a dispute between the Marxes and the village of  |Fredonia,_New_York|Fredonia,_New_York| . Freedonia was the name of a fictional country in the script, and the city fathers wrote to Paramount and asked the studio to remove all references to Freedonia because it is hurting our towns image . Groucho fired back a sarcastic retort asking them to change the name of their town, because its hurting our picture.           After expiration of the Paramount contract Zeppo left the act to become an agent. He and brother Gummo went on to build one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood, helping the likes of  |Jack_Benny|Jack_Benny|  and  |Lana_Turner|Lana_Turner|  get their starts. Groucho and Chico did radio, and there was talk of returning to Broadway. At a  |bridge|Contract_Bridge|  game with Chico,  |Irving_Thalberg|Irving_Thalberg|  began discussing the possibility of the Marxes joining  |Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer| . They signed, now billed as Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Marx Bros. Harpo was a very skillful bridge player, and a consistent winner in the highest circles.     Unlike the free-for-all scripts at Paramount, Thalberg insisted on a strong story structure that made the brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic musical numbers, and targeting their mischief-making at obvious villains. Thalberg was adamant that scripts include a low point , where all seems lost for both the Marxes and the romantic leads. He instituted the innovation of testing the films script before live audiences before filming began, to perfect the comic timing, and to retain jokes that earned laughs and replace those that did not. Thalberg restored Harpos harp solos and Chicos piano solos, which had been omitted from Duck Soup.          The first Marx Brothers/Thalberg film was  A Night at the Opera  , a  |satire|Satire|  on the world of  |opera|Opera| , where the brothers help two young singers in love by throwing a production of  Il Trovatore  into chaos. The film—including its famous scene where an absurd number of people crowd into a tiny stateroom on a ship—was a great success, and was followed two years later by an even bigger hit,  A Day at the Races  , in which the brothers cause mayhem in a sanitarium and at a horse race. The film features Groucho and Chicos famous Tootsie Frootsie Ice Cream sketch. In a 1969 interview with  |Dick_Cavett|Dick_Cavett| , Groucho said that the two movies made with Thalberg were the best that they ever produced. Despite the Thalberg films success, the brothers left MGM in 1937; Thalberg had died suddenly on September 14, 1936, two weeks after filming began on A Day at the Races, leaving the Marxes without an advocate at the studio.     After a short experience at  |RKO|Rko|  , the Marx Brothers returned to MGM and made three more films:  At the Circus  ,  Go West  and  The Big Store  . Prior to the release of The Big Store the team announced they were retiring from the screen. Four years later, however, Chico persuaded his brothers to make two additional films,  A Night in Casablanca  and  Love Happy  , to alleviate his severe  |gambling|Gambling|  debts. Both pictures were released by  |United_Artists|United_Artists| .       From the 1940s onward Chico and Harpo appeared separately and together in nightclubs and casinos. Chico fronted a  |big_band|Big_Band| , the Chico Marx Orchestra . Groucho made several radio appearances during the 1940s and starred in  You Bet Your Life , which ran from 1947 to 1961 on  |NBC|Nbc|  radio and television. He authored several books, including Groucho and Me , Memoirs of a Mangy Lover and The Groucho Letters .     Groucho and Chico briefly appeared in a 1957 color short film promoting  The Saturday Evening Post  entitled Showdown at Ulcer Gulch, directed by  |animator|Animator| |Shamus_Culhane|Shamus_Culhane| , Chicos son-in-law. Groucho, Chico, and Harpo worked together in  The Story of Mankind  . In 1959, the three began production of Deputy Seraph, a TV series starring Harpo and Chico as blundering angels, and Groucho as their boss, the  |Deputy_Seraph|Deputy_Seraph| . The project was abandoned when Chico was found to be uninsurable due to severe  |arteriosclerosis|Arteriosclerosis| . On March 8 of that year, Chico and Harpo starred as bumbling thieves in  The Incredible Jewel Robbery , a half-hour pantomimed episode of the  General Electric Theater  on CBS. Groucho made a cameo appearance—uncredited, because of constraints in his NBC contract—in the last scene, and delivered the only line of dialogue .        According to a September 1947 article in  Newsweek , Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo all signed to appear as themselves in a  |biopic|Biopic|  entitled The Life and Times of the Marx Brothers. In addition to being a non-fiction biography of the Marxes, the film would have featured the brothers reenacting much of their previously unfilmed material from both their vaudeville and Broadway eras. The film, had it been made, would have been the first performance by the Brothers as a quartet since 1933.     The five brothers made only one television appearance together, in 1957, on an early incarnation of  The Tonight Show  called  Tonight! America After Dark , hosted by  |Jack_Lescoulie|Jack_Lescoulie| . Five years later after Jack Paars tenure, Groucho made a guest appearance to introduce the Tonight Shows new host,  |Johnny_Carson|Johnny_Carson| . Johnny Carson.  Retrieved 2010-08-20.     Around 1960, the acclaimed director  |Billy_Wilder|Billy_Wilder|  considered writing and directing a new Marx Brothers film. Tentatively titled A Day at the U.N., it was to be a comedy of international intrigue set around the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  building in New York. Wilder had discussions with Groucho and Gummo, but the project was put on hold because of Harpos ill-health and abandoned when Chico died in 1961. Gore, Chris . The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made, New York: St. Martins Griffin. He was 74. Three years later, on September 28, 1964, Harpo died at the age of 75 of a heart attack one day after heart surgery.     In 1966  |Filmation|Filmation|  produced a pilot for a Marx Brothers cartoon. Grouchos voice was supplied by  |Pat_Harrington_Jr.|Pat_Harrington_Jr.|  and other voices were done by  |Ted_Knight|Ted_Knight|  and  |Joe_Besser|Joe_Besser| .       In 1969, audio excerpts of dialogue from all five of the Marx Brothers Paramount films were collected and released on an  |LP|Lp_Record|  album, The Original Voice Tracks from Their Greatest Movies, by  |Decca_Records|Decca_Records| . The excerpts were interspersed with voice-over introductions by disc jockey and voice actor  |Gary_Owens|Gary_Owens| .  The album was praised by  Billboard  as a program of zany antics ; the magazine highlighted the excerpts of Groucho, who was way ahead of his time in spoofing the establishment, at his hilarious biting best with his film soundtrack one-line zingers on his love life, his son, politics, big business, society, etc.   Village Voice  critic  |Robert_Christgau|Robert_Christgau|  was less enthusiastic, however, grading the LP a C-plus and recommending it only to fanatics of the comedy group. This is the sort of record you buy out of duty and then never play, not because its a comedy record but because it isnt funny out of context , Christgau wrote, while also expressing displeasure with the interspersing of small portions of annoying music and Owenss commentary throughout.      In 1970, the four Marx Brothers had a brief reunion of sorts in the animated  |ABC|American_Broadcasting_Company|  television special  The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians , produced by  |Rankin-Bass|Rankin-Bass|  animation . The special featured animated reworkings of various famous comedians acts, including  |W._C._Fields|W._C._Fields| ,  |Jack_Benny|Jack_Benny| ,  |George_Burns|George_Burns| ,  |Henny_Youngman|Henny_Youngman| ,  |the_Smothers_Brothers|The_Smothers_Brothers| ,  |Flip_Wilson|Flip_Wilson| ,  |Phyllis_Diller|Phyllis_Diller| ,  |Jack_E._Leonard|Jack_E._Leonard| ,  |George_Jessel|George_Jessel|  and the Marx Brothers. Most of the comedians provided their own voices for their animated counterparts, except for Fields and Chico Marx , and Zeppo Marx . Voice actor  |Paul_Frees|Paul_Frees|  filled in for all three . The Marx Brothers segment was a reworking of a scene from their Broadway play  Ill Say She Is , a parody of  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  that Groucho considered among the brothers funniest routines. The sketch featured animated representations, if not the voices, of all four brothers.  |Romeo_Muller|Romeo_Muller|  is credited as having written special material for the show, but the script for the classic Napoleon Scene was probably supplied by Groucho.       On January 16, 1977, the Marx Brothers were inducted into the Motion Picture Hall of Fame. With the deaths of Gummo in April 1977, Groucho in August 1977, and Zeppo in November 1979, the brothers were gone. But their impact on the entertainment community continues well into the 21st century.
