From approximately 12,000 years  |BP|Before_Present|  onwards,  |hunter_gatherer|Hunter_Gatherer|  societies existed near present-day Bogotá , and they traded with one another and with cultures living in the  |Magdalena_River|Magdalena_River|  valley. Due to its location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human migration from  |Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica|  and the  |Caribbean|Caribbean|  to the  |Andes|Andes|  and the  |Amazon_basin|Amazon_Basin| . The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza archaeological site and El Totumo archaeological site sites in the Magdalena Valley  southwest of Bogotá.  These sites date from the  |Paleoindian|Paleoindian|  period . At Puerto Hormiga archaeological site and other sites, traces from the Archaic period in South America have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of  |El_Abra|El_Abra| ,  |Tibitó|Tibitó|  and  |Tequendama|Tequendama|  in  |Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca_Department| . The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found at San Jacinto archaeological site, dates to 5000–4000 BCE.      Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now Colombia by 10,500 BCE.

Between 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of  |Amerindians|Amerindian|  including the  |Muisca|Muisca_People| ,  |Quimbaya|Quimbaya_Civilization| ,  |Tairona|Tairona| ,  |Calima|Calima_Culture| ,  |Zenú|Zenú| ,  |Tierradentro|Tierradentro| ,  |San_Agustín|San_Agustín_Archaeological_Park| ,  |Tolima|Panche_People| , and Urabá became skilled in farming, mining, and metalcraft; and some developed the political system of  cacicazgo s with a pyramidal structure of power headed by  |caciques|Cacique| . The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the  |Departments|Departments_Of_Colombia|  of  |Boyacá|Boyacá_Department|  and  |Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca_Department|  high plateau  where they formed the  |Muisca_Confederation|Muisca_Confederation| .

The Tairona inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated  |Andes|Andes|  mountain range of  |Sierra_Nevada_de_Santa_Marta|Sierra_Nevada_De_Santa_Marta| . Broadbent, Sylvia 1965: Los Chibchas: organización socio-política. Série Latinoamericana 5. Bogotá: Facultad de Sociología, Universidad Nacional de Colombia The  |Quimbaya|Quimbaya_Civilization|  inhabited regions of the  |Cauca_River_Valley|Cauca_River|  between the  |Western|Cordillera_Occidental_Colombia|  and  |Central|Cordillera_Central_Colombia|  Ranges.    The Incas expanded their  |empire|Inca_Empire|  on the southwest part of the country.                   Colombias indigenous culture evolved from three main groups—the  |Quimbaya|Quimbaya_Culture| , who inhabited the western slopes of the  |Cordillera_Central|Cordillera_Central| ; the Chibchas; and the  |Kalina|Kalina_People|  . When the Spanish arrived in 1509, they found a flourishing and heterogeneous  |Amerindian|Amerindian|  population that numbered between 1.6 million and 7 million, belonged to several hundred tribes, and largely spoke mutually unintelligible dialects. The two most advanced cultures of Amerindian peoples at the time were the  |Muisca|Muisca_People|  and  |Taironas|Taironas| , who belonged to the Chibcha group and were skilled in farming, mining, and metalcraft. The Muisca lived mainly in the present departments of  |Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca_Department|  and  |Boyacá|Boyacá_Department| , where they had fled centuries earlier after raids by the warlike Caribs, some of whom eventually migrated to Caribbean islands near the end of the first millennium. The Taironas, who were divided into two subgroups, lived in the Caribbean lowlands and the highlands of the  |Sierra_Nevada_de_Santa_Marta|Sierra_Nevada_De_Santa_Marta| . The Muisca civilization was well organized into distinct provinces governed by communal land laws and powerful  |caciques|Caciques| , who reported to one of the two supreme leaders.     The territory that became Colombia was first visited by Europeans when the first expedition of  |Alonso_de_Ojeda|Alonso_De_Ojeda|  arrived at the  |Cabo_de_la_Vela|Cabo_De_La_Vela|  in 1499. The  |Spanish|Spain|  made several attempts to settle along the north coast of todays Colombia in the early 16th century, but their first permanent settlement, at  |Santa_Marta|Santa_Marta| , was not established until 1525.  |Cartagena|Cartagena_Colombia|  was founded on June 1, 1533, by Spanish commander Pedro de Heredia, in the former location of the indigenous Caribbean Calamarí village. Cartagena grew rapidly, fueled first by the gold in the tombs of the  |Sinú|Zenú|  Culture, and later by trade. The thirst for gold and land resulted in Spanish explorers to visit Chibchan speaking areas; resulting in the  |Spanish_conquest_of_the_Chibchan_Nations|Spanish_Conquest_Of_The_Chibchan_Nations|  refers to the  |conquest|Conquest|  by the  |Spanish_monarchy|Spanish_Monarchy|  of the  |Chibcha_language|Chibcha_Language| -speaking nations, mainly the  |Muisca|Muisca_People|  and  |Tairona|Tairona|  that inhabited present-day  |Colombia|Colombia| , beginning the  |Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas|Spanish_Colonization_Of_The_Americas| .

In August 1538, Quesáda founded Santa Fe de  |Bogotá|Bogotá|  on the site of Muisca village of Bacatá.     In 1549, the institution of the Spanish Royal  |Audiencia|Audiencia_Real|  in Bogotá gave that city the status of capital of  |New_Granada|New_Kingdom_Of_Granada| , which comprised in large part what is now the territory of Colombia. In 1717, the  |Viceroyalty_of_New_Granada|Viceroyalty_Of_New_Granada|  was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the  |Viceroyalties_of_New_Spain|New_Spain|  or  |Peru|Viceroyalty_Of_Peru|  and correspond mainly to todays  |Venezuela|Venezuela| ,  |Ecuador|Ecuador|  and  |Panama|Panama| . So,  |Bogotá|Bogotá|  became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with  |Lima|Lima_Peru|  and  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City| .                  From then on, the long independence struggle was led mainly by  |Bolívar|Simón_Bolívar|  and  |Francisco_de_Paula_Santander|Francisco_De_Paula_Santander|  in neighboring Venezuela. Bolívar returned to New Granada only in 1819 after establishing himself as leader of the pro-independence forces in the Venezuelan  llanos . From there he led an army over the Andes and captured New Granada after a quick campaign that ended at the  |Battle_of_Boyacá|Battle_Of_Boyacá| , on August 7, 1819.      That year, the  |Congress_of_Angostura|Congress_Of_Angostura|  established the Republic of Gran Colombia, which included all territories under the jurisdiction of the former Viceroyalty of New Granada. Bolívar was elected the first president of Gran Colombia  and Santander, vice president.      As the Federation of Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1830, the Department of Cundinamarca became a new country, the Republic of New Granada.                 In 1863 the name of the Republic was changed officially to  |United_States_of_Colombia|United_States_Of_Colombia|  , and in 1886 the country adopted its present name: Republic of Colombia .     Two political parties grew out of conflicts between the followers of Bolívar and Santander and their political visions—the  |Conservatives|Colombian_Conservative_Party|  and the  |Liberals|Colombian_Liberal_Party|  – and have since dominated Colombian politics. Bolívars supporters, who later formed the nucleus of the Conservative Party, sought strong centralized government, alliance with the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| , and a limited franchise. Santanders followers, forerunners of the Liberals, wanted a decentralized government, state rather than church control over education and other civil matters, and a broadened suffrage.     Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, each party held the presidency for roughly equal periods of time. Colombia maintained a tradition of civilian government and regular, free elections. The military has seized power three times in Colombias history: in 1830, after the dissolution of Great Colombia; again in 1854 ; and from 1953 to 1957 . Civilian rule was restored within one year in the first two instances.     Not withstanding the countrys commitment to democratic institutions, Colombias history has also been characterized by widespread, violent conflict. Two civil wars resulted from bitter rivalry between the Conservative and Liberal parties. The  |Thousand_Days_War|Thousand_Days_War|  cost an estimated 100,000 lives, and up to 300,000 people died during  |La_Violencia|La_Violencia|  of the late 1940s and 1950s, a bipartisan confrontation which erupted after the assassination of Liberal popular candidate  |Jorge_Eliécer_Gaitán|Jorge_Eliécer_Gaitán| .  |United_States|United_States|  activity to influence the area  led to a military uprising in the  |Isthmus_Department|Isthmus_Department|  in 1903, which resulted in the  |separation|Panama–Colombia_Separation|  and independence of  |Panama|Panama| .     A military coup in 1953 toppled the right-wing government of Conservative  |Laureano_Gómez|Laureano_Gómez|  and brought General  |Gustavo_Rojas|Gustavo_Rojas_Pinilla|  to power. Initially, Rojas enjoyed considerable popular support, due largely to his success in reducing  |La_Violencia|La_Violencia|  . When he did not restore democratic rule and occasionally engaged in open repression, however, he was overthrown by the military in 1957 with the backing of both political parties, and a provisional government was installed.          In July 1957, former Conservative President Laureano Gómez and former Liberal President  |Alberto_Lleras|Alberto_Lleras_Camargo|  issued the Declaration of Sitges, in which they proposed a National Front, whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.     The National Front ended  |La_Violencia|La_Violencia|  , and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In particular, the Liberal president  |Alberto_Lleras_Camargo|Alberto_Lleras_Camargo|  created the  |Colombian_Institute_for_Agrarian_Reform|Colombian_Institute_For_Agrarian_Reform|  , and  |Carlos_Lleras_Restrepo|Carlos_Lleras_Restrepo|  further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.     In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political injustices continued.     The National Front system itself eventually began to be seen as a form of political repression by dissidents and even many mainstream voters, and many protesters was victimized in this time. Especially, after what was apparently later confirmed as the fraudulent election of  |Conservative|Colombian_Conservative_Party|  candidate  |Misael_Pastrana|Misael_Pastrana_Borrero|  in 1970, which resulted in the defeat of the relatively populist candidate  |Gustavo_Rojas|Gustavo_Rojas_Pinilla| ,  |Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez|Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez| . The  |M_19|19Th_Of_April_Movement|  guerrilla movement, Movimiento 19 de Abril , would eventually be founded in part as a response to this particular event. The  |FARC|Farc|  was formed in 1964 by  |Manuel_Marulanda_Vélez|Manuel_Marulanda_Vélez|  and other Marxist–Leninist supporters, after a military attack on the community of  |Marquetalia|Marquetalia_Caldas| .     Although the system established by the Sitges agreement was phased out by 1974, the 1886 Colombian constitution — in effect until 1991—required that the losing political party be given adequate and equitable participation in the government which, according to many observers and later analysis, eventually resulted in some increase in corruption and legal relaxation. The current 1991 constitution does not have that requirement, but subsequent administrations have tended to include members of opposition parties.       From 1974 until 1982, different presidential administrations chose to focus on ending the persistent  |insurgencies|Insurgency|  that sought to undermine Colombias traditional political system. Both groups claimed to represent the poor and weak against the rich and powerful classes of the country, demanding the completion of true land and political reform, from an openly  |Communist|Communist|  perspective.     By 1974, another challenge to the states authority and legitimacy had come from  |19th_of_April_Movement|19Th_Of_April_Movement|  , a mostly urban guerrilla group founded in response to an alleged electoral fraud during the final National Front election of  |Misael_Pastrana|Misael_Pastrana_Borrero|  and the defeat of former dictator  |Gustavo_Rojas|Gustavo_Rojas_Pinilla| .  Initially, the M-19 attracted a degree of attention and sympathy from mainstream Colombians that the  |FARC|Farc|  and  |National_Liberation_Army_|National_Liberation_Army|  had found largely elusive earlier due to extravagant and daring operations, such as stealing a sword that had belonged to Colombias Independence hero  |Simon_Bolívar|Simon_Bolívar| . At the same time, its larger profile soon made it the focus of the states counterinsurgency efforts.     The ELN guerrilla had been seriously crippled by military operations in the region of Anorí by 1974, but it managed to reconstitute itself and escape destruction, in part due to the administration of  |Alfonso_López_Michelsen|Alfonso_López_Michelsen|  allowing it to escape encirclement, hoping to initiate a peace process with the group.     By 1982, the perceived passivity of the  |FARC|Farc| , together with the relative success of the governments efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Partys  |Julio_César_Turbay|Julio_César_Turbay_Ayala|  to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military  |human_rights_abuses|Human_Rights_Abuse|  against suspects and captured guerrillas.     Citizen exhaustion due to the conflicts newfound intensity led to the election of president  |Belisario_Betancur|Belisario_Betancur|  , a Conservative who won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC and M-19 after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. The ELN rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself through the use of extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.     As these events were developing, the growing  |illegal_drug_trade|Illegal_Drug_Trade|  and its consequences were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually, the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation of the 1981 Muerte a Secuestradores death squad . Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the  |Medellín_Cartel|Medellín_Cartel|  and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation of  |extradition|Extradition|  of Colombian nationals to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence included Justice Minister  |Rodrigo_Lara|Rodrigo_Lara_Bonilla| , whose assassination in 1984 made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.     The first negotiated cease-fire with the M-19 ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985, claiming that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, saying that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and also questioning the governments real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration, in turn, questioned the M-19s actions and its commitment to the peace process, as it continued to advance high-profile negotiations with the FARC, which led to the creation of the  |Patriotic_Union_|Patriotic_Union|  , a legal and non-clandestine political organization.     On November 6, 1985, the M-19  |stormed_the_Colombian_Palace_of_Justice|Palace_Of_Justice_Siege|  and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. In the ensuing crossfire that followed the militarys reaction, scores of people lost their lives, as did most of the guerrillas, including several high-ranking operatives. Both sides blamed each other for the outcome.     Meanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrillas chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire. Political violence against FARC and UP members  was blamed on drug lords and also on members of the security forces . Members of the government and security authorities increasingly accused the FARC of continuing to recruit guerrillas, as well as kidnapping, extorting and politically intimidating voters even as the UP was already participating in politics.     The  |Virgilio_Barco|Virgilio_Barco_Vargas|  administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of  |terrorism|Terrorism|  and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas. The UP also suffered an increasing number of losses during this term , which stemmed both from private proto- |paramilitary|Paramilitary|  organizations, increasingly powerful drug lords and a number of would-be paramilitary-sympathizers within the armed forces.       Following administrations had to contend with the guerrillas, paramilitaries, narcotics traffickers and the violence and corruption that they all perpetuated, both through force and negotiation. Narcoterrorists assassinated three presidential candidates before  |César_Gaviria|César_Gaviria_Trujillo|  was elected in 1990. Since the death of  |Medellín|Medellín|  cartel leader  |Pablo_Escobar|Pablo_Escobar|  in a police shootout during December 1993, indiscriminate acts of violence associated with that organization have abated as the cartels have broken up into multiple, smaller and often-competing trafficking organizations. Nevertheless, violence continues as these drug organizations resort to violence as part of their operations but also to protest government policies, including extradition.     The M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the 1990s began, which culminated in the elections for a  |Constituent_Assembly_of_Colombia|Constituent_Assembly_Of_Colombia|  that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991. The new Constitution, brought about a considerable number of institutional and legal reforms based on principles that the delegates considered as more modern, humanist, democratic and politically open than those in the 1886 constitution. Practical results were mixed and mingled emerged , but together with the reincorporation of some of the guerrilla groups to the legal political framework, the new Constitution inaugurated an era that was both a continuation and a gradual, but significant, departure from what had come before.        Contacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the generalized  |de_facto|De_Facto|  interruptions of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of  |César_Gaviria|César_Gaviria_Trujillo|  . The Colombian Armys assault on the FARCs Casa Verde sanctuary at  |La_Uribe|La_Uribe| ,  |Meta|Meta_Department| , followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade.     President  |Ernesto_Samper|Ernesto_Samper_Pizano|  assumed office in August 1994. However, a political crisis relating to large-scale contributions from drug traffickers to Sampers presidential campaign diverted attention from governance programs, thus slowing, and in many cases, halting progress on the nations domestic reform agenda. The military also suffered several setbacks in its fight against the guerrillas, when several of its rural bases began to be overrun and a record number of soldiers and officers were taken prisoner by the FARC .     On August 7, 1998,  |Andrés_Pastrana|Andrés_Pastrana_Arango|  was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turnout and little political unrest. The new presidents program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombias longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.     While early initiatives in the Colombian peace process gave reason for optimism, the Pastrana administration also has had to combat high unemployment and other economic problems, such as the fiscal deficit and the impact of global financial instability on Colombia. During his administration, unemployment has risen to over 20%. Additionally, the growing severity of countrywide guerrilla attacks by the FARC and ELN, and smaller movements, as well as the growth of drug production, corruption and the spread of even more violent paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia  has made it difficult to solve the countrys problems.     Although the FARC and ELN accepted participation in the peace process, they did not make explicit commitments to end the conflict. The FARC suspended talks in November 2000, to protest what it called paramilitary terrorism but returned to the negotiating table in February 2001, following 2 days of meetings between President Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda. The Colombian Government and ELN in early 2001 continued discussions aimed at opening a formal peace process.          By 2004, the security situation of Colombia had shown some measure of an improvement and the economy, while still fragile, had also shown some positive signs. On the other hand, relatively little had been accomplished in structurally solving most of the countrys other grave problems, in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the Colombian Congress , and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits.     Some critical observers consider in retrospect that Uribes policies, while admittedly reducing crime and guerrilla activity, were too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombias internal war, neglecting grave social and human rights concerns to a certain extent. They hoped that Uribes government would make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces.     Uribes supporters in turn believed that increased military action was a necessary prelude to any serious negotiation attempt with the guerrillas and that the increased security situation would help the government, in the long term, to focus more actively on reducing most wide-scale abuses and human rights violations on the part of both the armed groups and any rogue security forces that might have links to the paramilitaries. In short, these supporters maintained that the security situation needed to be stabilized in favor of the government before any other social concerns could take precedence. Uribe left the presidency in 2010.        In 2010  |Juan_Manuel_Santos|Juan_Manuel_Santos|  was elected president; he was supported by ex-president Uribe, and, in fact, he owed his election mainly through having won over former Uribe supporters. But two years after winning the presidential election, Santos began peace talks with FARC, which took place in Havana. Re-elected in 2014, Santos revived an important infrastructure program, which in fact had been planned during the Uribe administration. Focused mainly on the provision of national highways, the program was led by former vice-president Germán Vargas Lleras.     Talks between the government and the guerrillas resulted in the announcement of a peace agreement.  However, a  |referendum|Colombian_Peace_Agreement_Referendum_2016|  to ratify the deal was unsuccessful.   Afterward, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised  |peace_deal|Colombian_Peace_Process|  in November 2016,  which the  |Colombian_congress|Colombian_Congress|  approved.  In 2016, President Santos was awarded the  |Nobel_Peace_Prize|2016_Nobel_Peace_Prize| .  The Government began a process of attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict.
