      Shabbat , Shabbos , or the  Sabbath , is  |Judaisms|Judaism|  day of rest and seventh day of the  |week|Seven-Day_Week| . On this day, religious  |Jews|Jews| ,  |Samaritans|Samaritans|  and certain  |Christians|Christians|   remember the biblical  |creation_of_the_heavens_and_the_earth_in_six_days|Genesis_Creation_Narrative|  and look forward to a future  |Messianic_Age|Messianic_Age| .     Shabbat observance entails refraining from  |work_activities|Activities_Prohibited_On_Shabbat| , often with  |great_rigor|Shomer_Shabbat| , and engaging in restful activities to honor the day. Judaisms traditional position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest other origins. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the  |Abrahamic|Abrahamic_Religions|  and many other  |religions|Religions| .     According to  halakha  , Shabbat is observed from a few minutes before sunset on  |Friday|Friday|  evening until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night.  |Shulchan_Aruch|Shulchan_Aruch| ,  |Orach_Chayim|Orach_Chayim|  293:2 Shabbat is ushered in by lighting candles and reciting a blessing. Traditionally, three  |festive_meals|Seudat_Mitzvahseudat_Shabbat_And_Seudat_Yom_Tov|  are eaten: in the evening, in the early afternoon, and late in the afternoon. The evening meal and the early afternoon meal typically begin with a blessing called  kiddush  and another blessing recited over two loaves of  |challah|Challah| . Shabbat is closed the following evening with a  havdalah  blessing.     Shabbat is a festive day when Jews exercise their freedom from the regular labors of everyday life. It offers an opportunity to contemplate the spiritual aspects of life and to spend time with family.          The word Shabbat derives from the Hebrew verb shavat . Although frequently translated as rest , another accurate translation of these words is ceasing , as resting is not necessarily denoted. The related modern Hebrew word shevita , has the same implication of active rather than passive abstinence from work. The notion of active cessation from labor is also regarded as more consistent with an  |omnipotent|Omnipotent| |Gods|Names_Of_God_In_Judaism|  activity on the seventh day of  |Creation_according_to_Genesis|Genesis_Creation_Narrative| . Other significant connotations are to shevet which means sitting or staying, and to sheva meaning seven, as Shabbat is the seventh day of the week; the other days of the week do not have names but called by their  |ordinals|Ordinal_Number| .            Sabbath is given special status as a holy day at the very beginning of the  |Torah|Torah|  in . It is first commanded after  |the_Exodus|The_Exodus|  from Egypt, in   and in  , as also in  . Sabbath is commanded and commended many more times in the Torah and  |Tanakh|Tanakh| ; double the normal number of animal  |sacrifices|Korban|  are to be offered on the day. Every Persons Guide to Shabbat, by Ronald H. Isaacs, Jason Aronson, 1998, p. 6 Sabbath is also described by the prophets  |Isaiah|Isaiah| ,  |Jeremiah|Jeremiah| ,  |Ezekiel|Ezekiel| ,  |Hosea|Hosea| ,  |Amos|Amos| , and  |Nehemiah|Nehemiah| .        The longstanding traditional Jewish position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution.  The origins of Shabbat and a seven-day week are not clear to scholars; the  |Mosaic|Moses|  tradition claims an origin from the  |Biblical_creation|Creation_According_To_Genesis| .       Seventh-day Shabbat did not originate with the  |Egyptians|Ancient_Egypt| , to whom it was unknown;  and other origin theories based on the day of  |Saturn|Saturn| , or on the  |planets|Planets|  generally, have also been abandoned.      The first non-Biblical reference to Sabbath is in an  |ostracon|Ostracon|  found in excavations at  |Mesad_Hashavyahu|Mesad_Hashavyahu| , which is dated 630 BCE.        For the Babylonian concept of sapattu or sabattu, see  |here|Biblical_Sabbathetymology| .       Connection to Sabbath observance has been suggested in the designation of the seventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eight days of a lunar month in an Assyrian religious calendar as a holy day, also called ‘evil days’ . The prohibitions on these days, spaced seven days apart, include abstaining from chariot riding, and the avoidance of eating meat by the King. On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to make a wish , and at least the 28th was known as a rest-day . Histoire du peuple hébreu .  |André_Lemaire|André_Lemaire| . Presses Universitaires de France 2009 , p. 66  The  Universal Jewish Encyclopedia  advanced a theory of  |Assyriologists|Assyriologist|  like  |Friedrich_Delitzsch|Friedrich_Delitzsch|    that Shabbat originally arose from the  |lunar_cycle|Lunar_Cycle|  in the  |Babylonian_calendar|Babylonian_Calendar|    containing four weeks ending in Sabbath, plus one or two additional unreckoned days per month.  The difficulties of this theory include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week, and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as Sabbath in any language.          The Tanakh and  |siddur|Siddur|  describe Shabbat as having three purposes:   To commemorate  |Gods|Names_Of_God_In_Judaism| |creation_of_the_universe|Creation_According_To_Genesis| , on the seventh day of which God rested from his work;   To commemorate the Israelites  |redemption_from_slavery|The_Exodus|  in  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ;   As a taste of  |Olam_Haba|Olam_Haba|  .     Judaism accords Shabbat the status of a joyous holy day. In many ways, Jewish law gives Shabbat the status of being the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar: One measure is the number of people called up to Torah readings at the Shachrit/morning service. Three is the smallest number, e.g. Mondays and Thursdays. Five on the Holy days of Passover, Shavuoth, Succoth. Yom Kippur: Six. Shabbat: Seven.   It is the first holy day mentioned in the Bible, and God was the first to observe it with the cessation of  |Creation|Creation_According_To_Genesis|  .    |Jewish_liturgy|Jewish_Services|  treats Shabbat as a bride and queen ; some sources described it as a king . The Talmud describes rabbis going out to greet the Shabbat Queen, and the  |Lekhah_Dodi|Lekhah_Dodi|  poem describes Shabbat as a bride and queen . However,  |Maimonides|Maimonides|   speaks of greeting the Shabbat King , and two independent commentaries on Mishneh Torah quote the Talmud as speaking of the Shabbat King . The words King and Queen in Aramaic differ by just one letter, and it seems that these understandings result from different traditions regarding spelling the Talmudic word. See .   The  |Sefer_Torah|Sefer_Torah|  is read during the  |Torah_reading|Torah_Reading|  which is part of the Shabbat morning services, with a longer reading than during the week. The Torah is read over a yearly cycle of 54  parashioth , one for each Shabbat . On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven sections, more than on any other holy day, including  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur| . Then, the  |Haftarah|Haftarah|  reading from the Hebrew prophets is read.   A tradition states that the  |Jewish_Messiah|Jewish_Messiah|  will come if every Jew properly observes two consecutive Shabbatoth.  |Shabbat|Shabbat|  118   The punishment in ancient times for desecrating Shabbat  is the most severe punishment in Jewish law. See e.g. Numbers 15:32–36.               Honoring Shabbat  on Preparation Day includes bathing, having a haircut and cleaning and beautifying the home .   According to Jewish law, Shabbat starts a few minutes before sunset. Candles are lit at this time. It is customary in many communities to light the candles 18 minutes before sundown , and most printed Jewish calendars adhere to this custom. The Kabbalat Shabbat service is a prayer service welcoming the arrival of Shabbat. Before Friday night dinner, it is customary to sing two songs, one greeting two Shabbat angels into the house Shabbat 119b and the other praising the woman of the house for all the work she has done over the past week.  |Proverbs|Book_Of_Proverbs|  31:10–31 After blessings over the wine and challah, a festive meal is served. Singing is traditional at Sabbath meals.  In modern times, many composers have written sacred music for use during the Kabbalat Shabbat observance, including  |Robert_Strassburg|Robert_Strassburg|   and  |Samuel_Adler|Samuel_Adler| .  .     According to  |rabbinic_literature|Rabbinic_Literature| , God via the Torah commands Jews to observe and remember Shabbat, and these two actions are symbolized by the customary two  |Shabbat_candles|Shabbat_Candles| . Candles are lit usually by the woman of the house . Some families light more candles, sometimes in accordance with the number of children.  |Shulchan_Aruch|Shulchan_Aruch| ,  |Orach_Chaim|Orach_Chaim|  261.          Shabbat is a day of celebration as well as  |prayer|Jewish_Services| . It is customary to eat three festive meals: Dinner on Shabbat eve , lunch on Shabbat day , and a third meal  in the late afternoon . It is also customary to wear nice clothing on Shabbat to honor the day.     On June 13, 2014,  |Am_Yisrael_Foundation|Am_Yisrael_Foundation| ’s White City Shabbat organization set the  |Guinness_World_Record|Guinness_World_Record|  for the worlds largest Shabbat dinner. Held at Hangar 11 at  |Tel_Aviv_Port|Tel_Aviv_Port| , the event was attended by 2,226 people, including  |Alan_Dershowitz|Alan_Dershowitz| , Tel Aviv mayor  |Ron_Huldai|Ron_Huldai| , Israeli basketball star  |Tal_Brody|Tal_Brody|  and former US Ambassador  |Michael_Oren|Michael_Oren| . The event took almost a year of preparation and involved “60 days of crowd-sourced fundraising,  800 bottles of  |Israeli_wine|Israeli_Wine| , 80 bottles of vodka, 50 bottles of whiskey, 2,000  |challah|Challah|  rolls, 80 long tables, 1,800 pieces of chicken, 1,000 portions of beef and 250 vegetarian meals.” A total of 2,300 diners signed up for the dinner and another 3,000 were placed on the waiting list.      Many Jews attend synagogue services on Shabbat even if they do not do so during the week. Services are held on Shabbat eve , Shabbat morning , and late Shabbat afternoon .     With the exception of  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur| , which is referred to in the Torah as Shabbat of Shabbatoth , days of public fasting are postponed or advanced if they coincide with Shabbat. Mourners sitting  shivah  outwardly conduct themselves normally for the duration of the day and are forbidden to display public signs of mourning.     Although most Shabbat laws are restrictive, the fourth of the  |Ten_Commandments|Ten_Commandments|  in  |Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus|  is taken by the  |Talmud|Talmud|  and  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  to allude to the positive commandments of Shabbat. These include:   Honoring Shabbat  Derived from .   Recitation of  kiddush  over a cup of  |wine|Kosher_Wine|  at the beginning of Shabbat meals, or at a reception after the conclusion of morning prayers .    Eating three festive meals. Meals begin with a blessing over two loaves of bread , usually of braided  |challah|Challah| , which is symbolic of the double portion of  |manna|Manna|  that fell for the Jewish people on the day before Sabbath during their 40 years in the desert after  |the_Exodus|The_Exodus|  from  |Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| . It is customary to serve meat or fish, and sometimes both, for Shabbat evening and morning meals.  Seudah Shlishit  , generally a light meal that may be  |pareve|Pareve|  or  |dairy|Dairy| , is eaten late Shabbat afternoon.   Enjoying Shabbat  havdalah .              Havdalah  is a Jewish religious ceremony that marks the symbolic end of Shabbat, and ushers in the new week. At the conclusion of Shabbat at nightfall, after the appearance of three stars in the sky, the havdalah blessings are recited over a cup of wine, and with the use of fragrant spices and a candle, usually braided. Some communities delay havdalah later into the night in order to prolong Shabbat. There are different customs regarding how much time one should wait after the stars have surfaced until the sabbath technically ends. Some people hold by 72 minutes later and other hold longer and shorter than that.           |Jewish_law|Halakha|  prohibits doing any form of melakhah  on Shabbat, unless an urgent human or medical need is life-threatening. Though melakhah is commonly translated as work in  |English|English_Language| , a better definition is deliberate activity or skill and craftmanship . There are 39 categories of prohibited activities  listed in  |Mishnah|Mishnah| |Tractate_Shabbat|Shabbat|  7:2.     The term  shomer Shabbat  is used for a person who adheres to Shabbat laws consistently. The shomer Shabbat is an archetype mentioned in Jewish songs  and the intended audience for various treatises on Jewish law and practice for Shabbat .     There are often disagreements between Orthodox Jews and non-Orthodox Jews as to the practical observance of the Sabbath. The observance of the Sabbath is often seen as a benchmark for orthodoxy and indeed has legal bearing on the way a Jew is seen by an  |orthodox_religious_court|Beit_Din|  regarding their affiliation to Judaism. See  |Yosef_Dov_Soloveitchiks|Yosef_Dov_Soloveitchik|  Beis HaLevi commentary on  |parasha|Parasha| |Ki_Tissa|Ki_Tissa|  for further elaboration regarding the legal ramifications.
