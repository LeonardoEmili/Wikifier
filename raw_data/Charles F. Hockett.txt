   Charles Francis Hockett was an American  |linguist|Linguist|  who developed many influential ideas in American  |structuralist|Structuralismstructuralism_In_Linguistics|  linguistics. He represents the post- |Bloomfieldian|Leonard_Bloomfield|  phase of  |structuralism|Structuralism|  often referred to as distributionalism or taxonomic structuralism . His academic career spanned over half a century at Cornell and Rice universities.           At the age of 16, Hockett enrolled at  |Ohio_State_University|Ohio_State_University|  in  |Columbus,_Ohio|Columbus,_Ohio|  where he received a  |Bachelor_of_Arts|Bachelor_Of_Arts|  and  |Master_of_Arts|Master_Of_Arts|  in  |ancient_history|Ancient_History| . While enrolled at  |Ohio_State|Ohio_State_University| , Hockett became interested in the work of  |Leonard_Bloomfield|Leonard_Bloomfield| , a leading figure in the field of  |structural_linguistics|Structural_Linguistics| . Hockett continued his education at  |Yale_University|Yale_University|  where he studied  |anthropology|Anthropology|  and  |linguistics|Linguistics|  and received his  |PhD|Doctor_Of_Philosophy|  in anthropology in 1939. While studying at Yale, Hockett studied with several other influential linguists such as  |Edward_Sapir|Edward_Sapir| ,  |George_P._Murdock|George_P._Murdock| , and  |Benjamin_Whorf|Benjamin_Whorf| . Hocketts dissertation was based on his fieldwork in  |Potawatomi|Potawatomi_Language| ; his paper on Potawatomi  |syntax|Syntax|  was published in  Language  in 1939. In 1948 his  |dissertation|Dissertation|  was published as a series in the  |International_Journal_of_American_Linguistics|International_Journal_Of_American_Linguistics| . Following fieldwork in  |Kickapoo|Kickapoo_Language|  and  |Michoacán|Michoacán| ,  |Mexico|Mexico| , Hockett did two years of  |postdoctoral|Postdoctoral|  study with  |Leonard_Bloomfield|Leonard_Bloomfield|  in  |Chicago|Chicago|  and  |Michigan|Michigan| .       Hockett began his teaching career in 1946 as an assistant professor of linguistics in the Division of  |Modern_Languages|Modern_Languages|  at  |Cornell_University|Cornell_University|  where he was responsible for directing the  |Chinese_language|Chinese_Language|  program. In 1957, Hockett became a member of Cornells anthropology department and continued to teach anthropology and linguistics until he retired to  |emeritus_status|Emeritus|  in 1982. In 1986, he took up an adjunct post at  |Rice_University|Rice_University|  in  |Houston,_Texas|Houston,_Texas| , where he remained active until his death in 2000.       Charles Hockett held membership among many academic institutions such as the  |National_Academy_of_Sciences|United_States_National_Academy_Of_Sciences|  the  |American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|American_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences| , and the  |Society_of_Fellows|Society_Of_Fellows|  at  |Harvard_University|Harvard_University| . He served as president of both the  |Linguistic_Society_of_America|Linguistic_Society_Of_America|  and the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States.     In addition to making many contributions to the field of  |structural_linguistics|Structural_Linguistics| , Hockett also considered such things as  |Whorfian_Theory|Benjamin_Whorf| ,  |jokes|Jokes| , the nature of  |writing_systems|Writing_Systems| , slips of the tongue, and  |animal_communication|Animal_Communication|  and their relativeness to  |speech|Speech| .     Outside the realm of linguistics and anthropology, Hockett practiced  |musical|Musical_Theatre|  performance and  |composition|Musical_Composition| . Hockett composed a full-length  |opera|Opera|  called The Love of Doña Rosita which was based on a play by  |Federico_García_Lorca|Federico_García_Lorca|  and premiered at  |Ithaca_College|Ithaca_College|  by the  |Ithaca|Ithaca,_New_York| |Opera|Opera| .     Hockett and his wife Shirley were vital leaders in the development of the  |Cayuga|Cayuga,_New_York|  Chamber Orchestra in Ithaca, New York. In appreciation of the Hocketts hard work and dedication to the Ithaca community, Ithaca College established the Charles F. Hockett Music Scholarship, the Shirley and Chas Hockett Chamber Music Concert Series, and the Hockett Family Recital Hall.       In his Note on Structure he argues that  |linguistics|Linguistics|  can be seen as a game and as a science. A linguist as player has a freedom for experimentation on all the utterances of a language, but no criterion to compare his analysis with other linguists. Late in his career, he was known for his stinging criticism of  |Chomskyan|Noam_Chomsky|  linguistics.           After carefully examining the generative schools proposed innovations in Linguistics, Hockett decided that this approach was of little value. His book The State of the Art outlined his criticisms of the generative approach. In his paraphrase a key principle of the Chomskyan paradigm is that there are an infinite number of grammatical sentences in any particular language.   The grammar of a language is a finite system that characterizes an infinite set of sentences. More specifically, the grammar of a language is a well-defined system by definition not more powerful than a universal Turing machine . The State of the Art, p. 40     The crux of Hocketts rebuttal is that the set of grammatical sentences in a language is not infinite, but rather ill-defined. p. 52 et passim Hockett proposes that no physical system is well-defined . p. 52     Later in Where the tongue slips, there slip I he writes as follows.     It is currently fashionable to assume that, underlying the actual more or less bumbling speech behavior of any human being, there is a subtle and complicated but determinate linguistic competence : a sentence-generating device whose design can only be roughly guessed at by any techniques so far available to us. This point of view makes linguistics very hard and very erudite, so that anyone who actually does discover facts about underlying competence is entitled to considerable kudos.     Within this popular frame of reference, a theory of performance -- of the generation of speech -- must take more or less the following form. If a sentence is to be uttered aloud, or even thought silently to oneself, it must first be built by the internal competence of the speaker, the functioning of which is by definition such that the sentence will be legal in every respect. But that is not enough; the sentence as thus constructed must then be performed, either overtly so that others may hear it, or covertly so that it is perceived only by the speaker himself. It is in this second step that blunders may appear. That which is generated by the speakers internal competence is what the speaker intends to say, and is the only real concern of linguistics: blunders in actually performed speech are instructions from elsewhere. Just if there are no such intrusions is what is performed an instance of smooth speech .     I believe this view is unmitigated nonsense, unsupported by any empirical evidence of any sort. In its place, I propose the following.     All speech, smooth as well as blunderful, can be and must be accounted for essentially in terms of the three mechanisms we have listed: analogy, blending, and editing. An individuals language, at a given moment, is a set of habits--that is, of analogies, where different analogies are in conflict, one may appear as a constraint on the working of another. Speech actualizes habits--and changes the habits as it does so. Speech reflects awareness of norms; but norms are themselves entirely a matter of analogy , not some different kind of thing. The View From Language, pp. 254-255.     Despite his criticisms, Hockett always expressed gratitude to the generative school for seeing real problems in the preexisting approaches.     There are many situations in which bracketing does not serve to disambiguate. As already noted, words that belong together cannot always be spoken together, and when they are not, bracketing is difficult or impossible. In the 1950s this drove some grammarians to drink and other to transformations, but both are only anodynes, not answers Hockett, Refurbishing our Foundations. John Benjamins, 1987, p. 23       One of Hocketts most important contributions was his development of the  |design-feature|Design_Features_Of_Language|  approach to comparative linguistics. He attempted to distinguish the similarities and differences among  |animal_communication|Animal_Communication|  systems and  |human_language|Human_Language| .     Hockett initially developed seven features, which were published in the 1959 paper “Animal ‘Languages’ and Human Language.” However, after many revisions, he settled on 13 design-features in the  Scientific American  The Origin of Speech.     Hockett argued that while every communication system has some of the 13 design features, only human, spoken language has all 13 features. In turn, that differentiates human spoken language from animal communication and other human communication systems such as  |written_language|Written_Language| .           |Vocal-Auditory_Channel|Vocal-Auditory_Channel| |vocal|Vocal|  tract and  |auditory|Auditory_System|  channel. Hockett viewed this as an advantage for human  |primates|Primates|  because it allowed for the ability to participate in other activities while simultaneously communicating through spoken language.    |Broadcast_transmission_and_directional_reception|Broadcast_Transmission_And_Directional_Reception| |binaural_direction|Binaural_Direction|  finding.    |Rapid_Fading|Rapid_Fading| |signal|Signaling_Theory| . Anything that a person is able to hear can be reproduced in spoken language.    |Total_Feedback|Total_Feedback| |speech_production|Speech_Production|  and internalize what they are producing by language.   Specialization: Human language sounds are specialized for communication. When dogs pant it is to cool themselves off. When humans speak, it is to transmit information.    |Semanticity|Semanticity| |meaning|Meaning| .    |Arbitrariness|Arbitrariness| |Discreteness|Discrete_Mathematics| |Phonemes|Phonemes|  can be placed in distinct categories which differentiate them from one another, like the distinct sound of /p/ versus /b/.    |Displacement|Displacement| |Productivity|Productivity| |Traditional_Transmission|Traditional_Transmission| |innate|Innate| , and acquisition depends in part on the learning of a language.    |Duality_of_patterning|Duality_Of_Patterning|  are combined to make meaningful words, which, in turn, are combined again to make sentences.     While Hockett believed that all communication systems, animal and human alike, share many of these features, only human language contains all 13 design features. Additionally,  |traditional_transmission|Traditional_Transmission| , and  |duality_of_patterning|Duality_Of_Patterning|  are key to human language.       Hockett suggests that the importance of a vocal-auditory channel lies in the fact that the animal can communicate while also performing other tasks, such as eating, or using tools.    |Broadcast_Transmission_and_Directional_Reception|Broadcast_Transmission_And_Directional_Reception| |Rapid_Fading|Rapid_Fading|  of a signal in human communication differs from such things as animal tracks and written language because an utterance does not continue to exist after it has been broadcast. With that in mind, it is important to note that Hockett viewed spoken language as the primary concern for investigation. Written language was seen as being secondary because of its recent evolution in culture.   Interchangeability represents a humans ability to act out or reproduce any linguistic message that they are able to comprehend. That differs from many animal communication systems, particularly in regards to mating. For example, humans have the ability to say and do anything that they feel may benefit them in attracting a mate.  |Sticklebacks|Stickleback| , on the other hand, have different male and female courtship motions; a male cannot replicate a females motions and vice versa.    |Total_Feedback|Total_Feedback|  is important in differentiating a humans ability to internalize their own productions of speech and behavior. That design-feature incorporates the idea that humans have insight into their actions.   Specialization is apparent in the anatomy of human  |speech_organs|Speech_Organs|  and our ability to exhibit some control over these organs. For example, a key assumption in the evolution of language is that the descent of the  |larynx|Larynx|  has allowed humans to produce speech sounds. Additionally, in terms of control, humans are generally able to control the movements of their tongue and mouth. Dogs however, do not have control over these organs. When dogs pant they are communicating a signal, but the panting is an uncontrollable response reflex of being hot .    |Semanticity|Semanticity| |English|English_Language|  have the ability to make a connection between a specific word and what that word represents or refers to.     |Arbitrariness|Arbitrariness|  within human language suggests that there is no direct connection between the type of signal and what is being referenced. For example, an animal as large as a cow can be referred to by a very short word .    |Discreteness|Discrete_Mathematics| |waggle_dance|Waggle_Dance|  of  |honey_bees|Honey_Bee|  is continuous.    |Displacement|Displacement|  refers to the human language systems ability to communicate about things that are not present spatially, temporally, or realistically. For example, humans have the ability to communicate about unicorns and outer space.    |Productivity|Productivity| |Traditional_Transmission|Traditional_Transmission| |language|Language|  may be  |innate|Innate| , humans acquire words and their  |native_language|Native_Language|  from other speakers. That is different from many  |animal_communication|Animal_Communication|  systems because most animals are born with the  |innate|Innate| |knowledge|Knowledge| , and  |skills|Skills|  necessary for  |survival|Wiktionary:Survival| . .    |Duality_of_patterning|Duality_Of_Patterning| |phonemes|Phoneme|  to create an infinite number of words, which, in turn, can be combined to make an unlimited number of different sentences.       ;Honeybees     Foraging  |honey_bees|Honey_Bee|  communicate with other members of their hive when they have discovered a relevant source of  |pollen|Pollen| ,  |nectar|Nectar| , or water. In an effort to convey information about the location and the distance of such resources, honeybees participate in a particular figure-eight dance known as the  |waggle_dance|Waggle_Dance| .     In Hocketts The Origin of Speech , he determined that the honeybee communication system of the  |waggle_dance|Waggle_Dance|  holds the following  |design_features|Design_Features_Of_Language| |Semanticity|Semanticity| |Displacement|Displacement| |Productivity|Productivity| |Waggle_dances|Waggle_Dance|  change based on the direction, amount, and type of resource.     Gibbons are small apes in the family Hylobatidae. While they share the same  |kingdom|Kingdom| ,  |phylum|Phylum| ,  |class|Class| , and  |order|Order|  of humans and are relatively close to man, Hockett distinguishes between the gibbon communication system and human language by noting that gibbons are devoid of the last four design features.     Gibbons possess the first nine  |design_features|Design_Features_Of_Language| , but do not possess the last four .     Displacement, according to Hockett, appears to be lacking in the vocal  |signal|Signalling_Theory| ing of apes.   Productivity does not exist among gibbons because if any vocal sound is produced, it is one of a finite set of repetitive and familiar calls.   Hockett supports the idea that humans learn language extra genetically through the process of  |traditional_transmission|Traditional_Transmission| . Hockett distinguishes gibbons from humans by stating that despite any similarities in communication among a species of apes, one cannot attribute these similarities to acquisition through the teaching and learning  of signals; the only explanation must be a genetic basis.   Finally,  |duality_of_patterning|Duality_Of_Patterning|  explains a humans ability to create multiple  |meanings|Meanings|  from somewhat meaningless sounds. For example, the  |phonemess|Phonemes|  /t/, /a/, /c/ can be used to create the words cat, tack, and act. Hockett states that no other  |Hominoid|Hominoid|  communication system besides human language maintains this ability.       In a report published in 1968 with anthropologist and scientist Stuart A. Altmann, Hockett derived three more  |Design_Features|Design_Features_Of_Language| , bringing the total to 16. These are the additional three:      Prevarication Reflexiveness Learnability  |Larry_Trask|Larry_Trask|  offered an alternative term and definition for number 14,  Prevarication Stimulus Freedom, a director of the Undergraduate Studies program at the University of Maryland: College Parks Anthropology school, part of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. His “extra” Feature is:     :17. Grammaticality Grammar  Syntax  by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentners study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify “odd” statements within a given “song.” However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomskys observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns.      that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding “humans” would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us,   today.
