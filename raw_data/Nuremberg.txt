Nuremberg is the birthplace of  |Albrecht_Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer|  and  |Johann_Pachelbel|Johann_Pachelbel| .     Nuremberg was the site of major Nazi rallies, and it provided the site for the  |Nuremberg_trials|Nuremberg_Trials| , which held to account many major Nazi officials.                      The first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an  |Imperial_castle|Imperial_Castle|  between the  |East_Franks|East_Franks|  and the Bavarian  |March_of_the_Nordgau|March_Of_The_Nordgau| . Compare:   ,  Historisches Lexikon Bayerns  |King_Conrad_III|Conrad_Iii_Of_Germany|   established the  |Burgraviate_of_Nuremberg|Burgraviate_Of_Nuremberg| , with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of  |Raab|Raabs_An_Der_Thaya| . With the extinction of their male line around 1190, the last Raabs counts son-in-law,  |Frederick_I|Frederick_I,_Burgrave_Of_Nuremberg|  from the  |House_of_Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern| , inherited the burgraviate in 1192.     From the late 12th century to the  |Interregnum|Holy_Roman_Empireinterregnum|  , however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the  |Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen|  emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor  from 1173/74.  The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.        Nuremberg is often referred to as the unofficial capital of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , particularly because the  |Imperial_Diet|Imperial_Diet|   and courts met at  |Nuremberg_Castle|Nuremberg_Castle| . The  |Diets_of_Nuremberg|Diet_Of_Nuremberg|  played an important role in the administration of the empire. The increasing demands of the Imperial court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce in Nuremberg. In 1219 Emperor  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  granted the  , including  |town_rights|German_Town_Law| ,  |Imperial_immediacy|Imperial_Immediacy|  , the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy - almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves.   ,  Historisches Lexikon Bayerns  Nuremberg soon became, with  |Augsburg|Augsburg| , one of the two great trade-centers on the route from  |Italy|Italy|  to Northern Europe.     In 1298 the  |Jews|Jews_Of_Germany|  of the town were falsely accused of having  |desecrated_the_host|Host_Desecration| , and 698 of them were killed in one of the many  |Rintfleisch_massacres|Rintfleisch_Massacres| .

The largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century.  |Charles_IVs|Charles_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| |Golden_Bull_of_1356|Golden_Bull_Of_1356| , naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected  |kings_of_Germany|Kings_Of_Germany|  must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire. Charles was the patron of the  |Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche,_Nuremberg| , built between 1352 and 1362 , where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor  |Sigismund_of_Luxembourg|Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the  |advance_of_French_troops|War_Of_The_First_Coalition|  required their removal to  |Regensburg|Regensburg|  and thence to  |Vienna|Vienna| .     In 1349 the members of the  |guilds|Guild|  unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a  , supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a  |free_city|Free_Imperial_City|  . Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the  |princes_of_the_Empire|Princes_Of_The_Holy_Roman_Empire| . Frequent fights took place with the burgraves - without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between  |Frederick_IV|Frederick_I,_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|   and the duke of  |Bavaria-Ingolstadt|Bavaria-Ingolstadt| , the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle , resulting in the citys total sovereignty within its borders.     Through these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. The  |Hussite_Wars|Hussite_Wars|  , a  |recurrence_of_the_Black_Death|Black_Deathrecurrence|  in 1437, and the  |First_Margrave_War|First_Margrave_War|  led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century. Siding with  |Albert_IV|Albert_Iv,_Duke_Of_Bavaria| , Duke of  |Bavaria-Munich|Bavaria-Munich| , in the  |Landshut_War_of_Succession|Landshut_War_Of_Succession|  of 1503-1505 led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of , making it one of the largest Imperial cities.     During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.               The cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the centre of the  |German_Renaissance|German_Renaissance| . In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , and in 1532, the  |Nuremberg_Religious_Peace|Nuremberg_Religious_Peace|  was signed there, preventing war between Protestants and Catholics for 15 years. , page 351 of the 1899 Lutheran Cyclopedia During the 1552 revolution against  |Charles_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but the city was attacked without a declaration of war and was forced into a disadvantageous peace. At the  |Peace_of_Augsburg|Peace_Of_Augsburg| , the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the  |Bishop_of_Bamberg|Bishopric_Of_Bamberg|  affirmed, while the 1520s secularisation of the monasteries was also approved.        The state of affairs in the early 16th century, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade. Frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and  |League|Catholic_League|  soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population. In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of  |Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden|Gustavus_Adolphus_Of_Sweden| , was  |besieged|Siege_Of_Nuremberg|  by the army of Imperial general  |Albrecht_von_Wallenstein|Albrecht_Von_Wallenstein| . The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture – secular  |Baroque_architecture|Baroque_Architecture|  is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant citys rebuilding of  |St._Egidien_church|St._Egidien,_Nuremberg| , destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.     After the Thirty Years War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the  |War_of_the_Austrian_Succession|War_Of_The_Austrian_Succession|  and the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War|  and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures. The Bavarian elector,  |Charles_Theodore|Charles_Theodore,_Elector_Of_Bavaria| , appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the  |Landshut_War_of_Succession|Landshut_War_Of_Succession| , to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but  |Frederick_William_II|Frederick_William_Ii_Of_Prussia|  refused, fearing to offend Austria,  |Russia|Russian_Empire|  and  |France|France| . At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the  |Confederation_of_the_Rhine|Confederation_Of_The_Rhine|  on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the  |amortisation|Amortisation|  of the citys 12.5 million guilder public debt.                  After the fall of  |Napoleon|Napoleon| , the citys trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the  |Teutonic_Order|Teutonic_Order| , often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 souls.      In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of  |Rezatkreis|Rezatkreis|  , which was renamed to  |Middle_Franconia|Middle_Franconia|   on 1 January 1838. The first German railway, the  |Bavarian_Ludwigsbahn|Bavarian_Ludwigsbahn| , from Nuremberg to nearby  |Fürth|Fürth| , was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into  |Zollverein|Zollverein|  , commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity. In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the most important industrial city of Bavaria and one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other creeds.          Nuremberg held great significance during the  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  era. Because of the citys relevance to the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  and its position in the centre of Germany, the  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party|  chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions  — the  |Nuremberg_rallies|Nuremberg_Rally| . The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from 1933 through 1938. After  |Adolf_Hitlers_rise_to_power|Machtergreifung|  in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge  |Nazi_propaganda|Nazi_Propaganda|  events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by  |Leni_Riefenstahl|Leni_Riefenstahl| , and made into a propaganda film called Triumph des Willens .     At the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the  |Reichstag|Reichstag|  to convene at Nuremberg to pass the  |Nuremberg_Laws|Nuremberg_Laws|  which revoked German  |citizenship|Citizenship|  for all Jews and other non-Aryans. A number of premises were constructed solely for these assemblies, some of which were not finished. Today many examples of  |Nazi_architecture|Nazi_Architecture|  can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi  |propagandist|Propaganda| |Julius_Streicher|Julius_Streicher| , the publisher of  Der Stürmer .        During the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , Nuremberg was the headquarters of  Wehrkreis  XIII, and an important site for military production, including aircraft, submarines and tank engines. A subcamp of  |Flossenbürg_concentration_camp|Flossenbürg_Concentration_Camp|  was located here, and extensively used  |slave_labour|Slavery| .  The city was severely damaged in  |Allied_strategic_bombing|Strategic_Bombing_During_World_War_Ii|  from 1943 to 1945. On 29 March 1944, the  |RAF|Royal_Air_Force|  endured its heaviest losses in the bombing campaign of Germany. Out of more than 700 planes participating, 106 were shot down or crash-landed on the way home to their bases, and more than 700 men were missing, as many as 545 of them dead. More than 160 became prisoners of war.      On 2 January 1945, the  |medieval|Middle_Ages|  city centre was systematically bombed by the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  and the  |U.S._Army_Air_Forces|United_States_Army_Air_Forces|  and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.     Nuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in  |a_fierce_battle|Battle_Of_Nuremberg|  lasting from 17 to 21 April 1945 by the U.S.  |3rd_Infantry_Division|3Rd_Infantry_Division| ,  |42nd_Infantry_Division|42Nd_Infantry_Division|  and  |45th_Infantry_Division|45Th_Infantry_Division| , which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings. Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946, Stackpole Books , p. 90, 129, 135 Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings. Neil Gregor, Haunted City. Nuremberg and the Nazi Past However, over half of the historic look of the center, and especially the northeastern half of the old  |Imperial_Free_City|Imperial_Free_City|  was not restored.             Between 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  had wanted these trials to take place in  |Berlin|Berlin| . However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:   The city had been the location of the Nazi Partys Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.   The  |Palace_of_Justice|Palace_Of_Justice,_Nuremberg|  was spacious and largely undamaged . The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.   As a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , subsequent trials never took place.     Following the trials, in October 1946, several prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were  |executed_in_Nuremberg|Nuremberg_Executions| .     The same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the  |Nuremberg_Military_Tribunals|Subsequent_Nuremberg_Trials| , organized by the  |United_States|United_States|  as  |occupying_power|Allied-Occupied_Germany|  in the area.

The city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city.

The city contributed much to the science of  |astronomy|Astronomy| . In 1471 Johannes Mueller of  |Königsberg|Königsberg,_Bavaria|  , later called  |Regiomontanus|Regiomontanus| , built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.     In 1515,  |Albrecht_Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer| , a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by  |Johannes_Stabius|Johannes_Stabius| .
