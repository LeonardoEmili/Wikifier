            A gambeson  is a padded defensive  |jacket|Jacket| , worn as  |armor|Armor|  separately, or combined with  |mail|Mail|  or  |plate_armor|Plate_Armor| . It also doubled as a winter coat for wearers. Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called  |quilting|Quilting| . Usually constructed of  |linen|Linen|  or  |wool|Wool| , the stuffing varied, and could be for example scrap  |cloth|Cloth|  or horse hair. During the 14th century, illustrations usually show buttons or laces up the front.     An arming doublet  worn under armor, particularly  |plate_armor|Plate_Armor|  of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe, contains  |arming_points|Arming_Point|  for attaching plates. Fifteenth century examples may include  |goussets|Gousset|  sewn into the elbows and armpits to protect the wearer in locations not covered by plate.  |German|Germany| |_gothic_armor|Gothic_Plate_Armour|  arming doublets were generally shorter than  |Italian|Italy| |_white_armor|White_Armor|  doublets, which could extend to the upper thigh. In late fifteenth century Italy this also became a civilian fashion. Men who were not knights wore arming doublets, probably because the garment suggested status and  |chivalry|Chivalry| .        The term gambeson is a loan from Old French gambeson, gambaison, originally wambais, formed after the  |Middle_High_German|Middle_High_German|  term wambeis doublet , in turn from  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German|  wamba stomach .      The term aketon, originally medieval French alcottonem, might be a loan from  |Arabic|Arabic_Language|  al-qutn  |cotton|Cotton|  .     In medieval Norse, the garment was known as vápntreyja, literally weapon shirt, or panzari/panzer.  Treyja is a loan from Low German. Panzari/panzer is probably also a loan from Low German, though the word has its likely origin in Italian, and is related to Latin pantex abdomen.        Quilted leather open jackets and trousers were worn by  |Scythian|Scythian|  horsemen before the 4th century BC, as can be seen on  |Scythian_gold|Scythian_Gold|  ornaments crafted by Greek goldsmiths. The European gambeson can be traced at least to the late 10th century, but it is likely to have been in use in various forms for longer than that. In Europe, its use became widespread in the 13th century, and peaked in the 14th and 15th centuries.     The gambeson was used both as a complete armor unto itself and underneath mail and plate in order to cushion the body and prevent chafing. It was very insulatory and thus uncomfortable, but its protection was vital for the soldier.     Although they are thought to have been used in Europe much earlier, gambesons underwent a revolution from their first proven use in the late 11th and early 12th centuries as an item of armor that simply facilitated the wearing of mail to an item of independent armor popular amongst infantry. Although quilted armor survived into the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War|  in  |England|England|  as a poor mans  |cuirass|Cuirass| , and as an item to be worn beneath the few remaining suits of full plate, it was increasingly replaced by the  |buff_coat|Buff_Coat|  – a leather jacket of rough suede.     There are two distinctive designs of gambeson; those designed to be worn beneath another armor, and those designed to be worn as independent armor. The latter tend to be thicker and higher in the collar, and faced with other materials, such as leather, or heavy canvas. This variant is usually referred to as padded jack and made of several  layers of cotton, linen or wool. These jacks were known to stop even heavy arrows and their design of multiple layers bears a striking resemblance to modern day  |body_armor|Body_Armor| , which substituted at first silk, ballistic nylon and later  |Kevlar|Kevlar|  as fabric.     For common soldiers who could not afford mail or plate armor, the gambeson, combined with a helmet as the only additional protection, remained a common sight on European battlefields during the entire Middle Ages, and its decline – paralleling that of plate armor – came only with the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , as the use of firearms became more widespread, until by the 18th century it was no longer in military use.     While the use of linen has been shown in archaeological evidence, the use of cotton – and cotton-based canvas – is disputed since large amounts of cotton cloth were not widely available in northern Europe at this time. It is quite probable that Egypt still produced cotton well after the 7th and 8th centuries and knowledge of this cloth was brought to Europe by the returning Crusaders; however, the logistics and expense of equipping a town militia or army with large amounts of cotton-based garments is doubtful, when flax-based textiles were in widespread use.      |Linothorax|Linothorax|  was a type of armor similar to gambeson used by  |ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greeks| .
