      The Temple of Olympian Zeus , also known as the Olympieion or Columns of the Olympian Zeus, is a former colossal temple at the center of the  |Greek|Greece|  capital  |Athens|Athens| . It was dedicated to Olympian  |Zeus|Zeus| , a name originating from his position as head of the  |Olympian_gods|Twelve_Olympians| . Construction began in the 6th century BC during the rule of the Athenian  |tyrants|Tyrant| , who envisaged building the greatest temple in the ancient world, but it was not completed until the reign of the Roman Emperor  |Hadrian|Hadrian|  in the 2nd century AD, some 638 years after the project had begun. During the  |Roman|Roman_Empire|  period the temple -that included 104 colossal columns- was renowned as the largest temple in Greece and housed one of the largest  |cult|Cult|  statues in the ancient world.     The temples glory was short-lived, as it fell into disuse after being pillaged during a barbarian invasion in 267 AD, just about a century after its completion. It was probably never repaired and was reduced to ruins thereafter. In the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, it was extensively quarried for building materials to supply building projects elsewhere in the city. Despite this, a substantial part of the temple remains today, notably sixteen of the original gigantic columns, and it continues to be part of a very important archaeological site of Greece                       The temple is located approximately 500  m south-east of the  |Acropolis|Acropolis_Of_Athens| , and about 700  m south of the center of Athens,  |Syntagma_Square|Syntagma_Square| . Its foundations were laid on the site of an ancient outdoor sanctuary dedicated to Zeus. An earlier temple had stood there, constructed by the tyrant  |Peisistratus|Peisistratos|  around 550 BC. The building was demolished after the death of Peisistratos and the construction of a colossal new Temple of Olympian Zeus was begun around 520 BC by his sons,  |Hippias|Hippias|  and  |Hipparchos|Hipparchus| .   They sought to surpass two famous contemporary temples, the  |Heraion_of_Samos|Heraion_Of_Samos|  and the second  |Temple_of_Artemis|Temple_Of_Artemis|  at  |Ephesus|Ephesus| . Designed by the architects  |Antistates|Antistates| ,  |Callaeschrus|Callaeschrus| ,  |Antimachides|Antimachides|  and  |Pornius|Pornius| , the Temple of Olympian Zeus was intended to be built of local  |limestone|Limestone|  in the  |Doric_style|Doric_Order|  on a colossal platform measuring 41 m by 108 m . It was to be flanked by a double  |colonnade|Colonnade|  of eight columns across the front and back and twenty-one on the flanks, surrounding the  |cella|Cella| .     The work was abandoned when the tyranny was overthrown and Hippias was expelled in 510 BC. Only the platform and some elements of the columns had been completed by this point, and the temple remained in this state for 336 years. The temple was left unfinished during the years of  |Athenian_democracy|Athenian_Democracy| , apparently, because the Greeks thought it was  |hubris|Hubris|  to build on such a scale. In the treatise  Politics ,  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  cited the temple as an example of how tyrannies engaged the populace in great works for the state  and left them no time, energy or means to rebel. Aristotle, Politics, Book V, chapter 11     It was not until 174 BC that the  |Seleucid|Seleucid|  king  |Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes|Antiochus_Iv_Epiphanes| , who presented himself as the earthly embodiment of Zeus, revived the project and placed the  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|  architect  |Decimus_Cossutius|Decimus_Cossutius|  in charge. The design was changed to have three rows of eight columns across the front and back of the temple and a double row of twenty on the flanks, for a total of 104 columns. The columns would stand 17 m high and 2  m in diameter. The building material was changed to the expensive but high-quality  |Pentelic|Pentelic|  marble and the order was changed from Doric to  |Corinthian|Corinthian_Order| , marking the first time that this order had been used on the exterior of a major temple. However, the project ground to a halt again in 164 BC with the death of Antiochus. The temple was still only half-finished by this stage.     Serious damage was inflicted on the partly built temple by  |Lucius_Cornelius_Sullas|Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla|  sack of Athens in 86 BC. While looting the city, Sulla seized some of the incomplete columns and transported them back to Rome, where they were re-used in the  |Temple_of_Jupiter|Temple_Of_Jupiter|  on the  |Capitoline_Hill|Capitoline_Hill| . A half-hearted attempt was made to complete the temple during  |Augustus|Augustus|  reign as the first  |Roman_emperor|Roman_Emperor| , but it was not until the accession of Hadrian in the 2nd century AD that the project was finally completed around 638 years after it had begun.       In 124–125 AD, when the strongly  |Philhellene|Philhellene|  Hadrian visited Athens, a massive building programme was begun that included the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. A walled marble-paved precinct was constructed around the temple, making it a central focus of the ancient city. Cossutiuss design was used with few changes and the temple was formally dedicated by Hadrian in 132, who took the title of  |Panhellenios|Panhellenion|  in commemoration of the occasion. Hans Rupprecht Goette, Athens, Attica and the Megarid: An Archaeological Guide, p. 100. Routledge, 2001.  The temple and the surrounding precinct were adorned with numerous statues depicting Hadrian, the gods, and personifications of the Roman provinces. A colossal statue of Hadrian was raised behind the building by the people of Athens in honor of the emperors generosity. An equally colossal  |chryselephantine|Chryselephantine|  statue of Zeus occupied the cella of the temple. The statues form of construction was unusual, as the use of chryselephantine was by this time regarded as archaic. It has been suggested that Hadrian was deliberately imitating  |Phidias|Phidias|  famous statue of  |Athena_Parthenos|Athena_Parthenos|  in the  |Parthenon|Parthenon| , seeking to draw attention to the temple and himself by doing so. K. W. Arafat, Pausanias Greece: Ancient Artists and Roman Rulers, p. 174. Cambridge University Press, 2004.       |Pausanias|Pausanias|  describes the temple as it was in the 2nd century:   : Before the entrance to the sanctuary of Zeus Olympios -Hadrian the Roman emperor dedicated the temple and the statue, one worth seeing, which in size exceeds all other statues save the colossi at Rhodes and Rome, and is made of ivory and gold with an artistic skill which is remarkable when the size is taken into account—before the entrance, I say, stand statues of Hadrian, two of Thasian stone, two of Egyptian. Before the pillars stand bronze statues which the Athenians call ‘colonies.’ The whole circumference of the precincts is about four states, and they are full of statues; for every city has dedicated a likeness of the emperor Hadrian, and the Athenians have surpassed them in dedicating, behind the temple, the remarkable colossus. Within the precincts are antiquities: a bronze Zeus, a temple of  |Kronos|Cronus|  and  |Rhea|Rhea|  and an enclosure of  |Gaia|Gaia|  surnamed Olympias. Here the floor opens to the width of a cubit, and they say that along this bed flowed off the water after the deluge that occurred in the time of  |Deukalion|Deukalion| , and into it, they cast every year wheat meal mixed with honey. On a pillar is a statue of  |Isokrates|Isokrates|  . . . There are also statues in Phrygian marble of  |Persians|Persians|  supporting a bronze  |tripod|Sacrificialtripodancientgreece| ; both the figures and the tripod are worth seeing. The ancient sanctuary of Zeus Olympios the Athenians say was built by Deukalion, and they cite as evidence that Deukalion lived at Athens a grave which is not far from the present temple. Hadrian constructed other buildings also for the Athenians: a temple of  |Hera|Hera|  and Zeus Panellenios . Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 18. 6 – 9     The Temple of Olympian Zeus was badly damaged during the  |Heruli|Heruli|  a sack of Athens in 267. It is unlikely to have been repaired, given the extent of the damage to the rest of the city. Assuming that it was not abandoned it would certainly have been closed down in 425 by the Christian emperor  |Theodosius_II|Theodosius_Ii|  when he prohibited the worship of the old Roman and Greek gods during the  |persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire|Persecution_Of_Pagans_In_The_Late_Roman_Empire| . Material from the building was incorporated into a basilica constructed nearby during the 5th or 6th century. Athens. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Classical Art and Architecture. Ed. John B. Hattendorf. Oxford University Press, 2007.             Over the following centuries, the temple was systematically quarried to provide building materials and material for the houses and churches of medieval Athens. By the end of the  |Byzantine|Byzantine|  period, it had been almost totally destroyed; when  |Ciriaco_de_Pizzicolli|Ciriaco_De_Pizzicolli|  visited Athens in 1436 he found only 21 of the original 104 columns still standing. The fate of one of the columns is recorded by a Greek inscription on one of the surviving columns, which states that on 27 April 1759 he pulled down the column . This refers to the  |Turkish|Ottoman_Empire|  governor of Athens,  |Tzisdarakis|Tzisdarakis| , who is recorded by a chronicler as having destroyed one of Hadrians columns with gunpowder in order to re-use the marble to make plaster for the  |mosque|Mosque|  that he was building in the  |Monastiraki|Monastiraki|  district of the city. During the  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  period the temple was known to the Greeks as the Palace of Hadrian, while the Turks called it the Palace of  |Belkis|Belkis| , from a Turkish legend that the temple had been the residence of  |Solomons|Solomon|  wife. John Freely, Strolling Through Athens, pp. 209–214. Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2004.      Fifteen columns remain standing today and a sixteenth column lies on the ground where it fell during a storm in 1852. Nothing remains of the cella or the great statue that it once housed.     The temple was excavated in 1889–1896 by  |Francis_Penrose|Francis_Penrose|  of the British School in Athens , in 1922 by the German archaeologist  |Gabriel_Welter|Gabriel_Welter|  and in the 1960s by Greek archaeologists led by  |Ioannes_Travlos|Ioannes_Travlos| . The temple, along with the surrounding ruins of other ancient structures, is a historical precinct administered by Ephorate of Antiquities of the Greek Interior Ministry.     On 21 January 2007, a group of  |Greek_pagans|Hellenism|  held a ceremony honoring Zeus on the grounds of the temple. The event was organized by  |Ellinais|Ellinais|.
