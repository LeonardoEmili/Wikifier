     Prof Friedrich Wöhler   |FRS|Royal_Society_Of_London|  H |FRSE|Frse|  was a German  |chemist|Chemist| , best known for  |his_synthesis|Wöhler_Synthesis|  of  |urea|Urea| , but also the first to isolate several  |chemical_elements|Chemical_Elements| , most notably  |titanium|Titanium| .       He was born in  |Eschersheim|Eschersheim| , which then belonged to  |Hanau|Hanau| , but is now a district of  |Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt_Am_Main| . He was educated at the Frankfurt Gymnasium. His initial higher studies were at  |Marburg_University|Marburg_University|  in 1820.     In 1823 Wöhler finished his study of Medicine at  |Heidelberg_University|Heidelberg_University| , having been taught in the laboratory of  |Leopold_Gmelin|Leopold_Gmelin| , who then arranged for him to work under  |Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|  in  |Stockholm|Stockholm| ,  |Sweden|Sweden| .     From 1826 to 1831 Wohler taught chemistry at the Polytechnic School in  |Berlin|Berlin| . In 1839 he was stationed at the  |Polytechnic_School|Polytechnic_School|  at  |Kassel|Kassel| . Afterwards, he became Ordinary Professor of Chemistry in the  |University_of_Göttingen|University_Of_Göttingen| , where he remained until his death in 1882. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the  |Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences|Royal_Swedish_Academy_Of_Sciences| .       Wöhler is regarded as a pioneer in  |organic_chemistry|Organic_Chemistry|  as a result of his synthesizing  |urea|Urea|  from  |ammonium_cyanate|Ammonium_Cyanate|  in the  |Wöhler_synthesis|Wöhler_Synthesis|  in 1828. In a letter to Swedish chemist  |Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|  the same year, he wrote, In a manner of speaking, I can no longer hold my chemical water. I must tell you that I can make urea without the use of kidneys of any animal, be it man or dog. Chemie heute, Schroedel Verlag, Klasse 9/10. Chapter 3: Chemie der Kohlenwasserstoffe. Excursus pg. 64, . Translated from original: „Ich kann, so zu sagen, mein chemisches Wasser nicht halten und muss ihnen sagen, daß ich Harnstoff machen kann, ohne dazu Nieren oder überhaupt ein Thier, sey es Mensch oder Hund, nöthig zu haben.“     This discovery has become celebrated as a refutation of  |vitalism|Vitalism| , the hypothesis that living things are alive because of some special vital force . However, contemporary accounts do not support that notion. This Wöhler Myth, as historian of science Peter J. Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until one afternoon the miracle happened . Ramberg , following Rocke , pp. 239–241, traced back the origin to H. Kopp’s Geschichte der Chemie, Vol. 1 , p. 442; vol. 4 , p. 244. The myth was unmasked by McKie in 1944, followed by a series of papers quoted by Ramberg . Nevertheless, it was the beginning of the end of one popular vitalist hypothesis, that of  |Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius| , that organic compounds could be made only by living things.       Wöhler was also known for being a co-discoverer of  |beryllium|Beryllium| ,  |silicon|Silicon|  and  |silicon_nitride|Silicon_Nitride| ,  as well as the synthesis of  |calcium_carbide|Calcium_Carbide| , among others. In 1834, Wöhler and  |Justus_Liebig|Justus_Liebig|  published an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds. They proved by their experiments that a group of  |carbon|Carbon| ,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| , and  |oxygen|Oxygen| |atoms|Atom|  can behave like an element, take the place of an element, and be exchanged for elements in  |chemical_compounds|Chemical_Compound| . Thus the foundation was laid of the doctrine of  |compound_radicals|Radical_Theory| , a doctrine which had a profound influence on the development of chemistry.     Wöhler was the first to isolate the elements  |yttrium|Yttrium| ,  |beryllium|Beryllium| , and  |titanium|Titanium| , and to observe that silicium  can be obtained in crystals, and that some meteoric stones contain organic matter. He analyzed  |meteorites|Meteorite| , and for many years wrote the digest on the literature of meteorites in the  Jahresberichte über die Fortschritte der Chemie ; he possessed the best private collection of meteoric stones and irons existing. Wöhler and  |Sainte_Claire_Deville|Henri_Etienne_Sainte_Claire_Deville|  discovered the crystalline form of boron, and Wöhler and Heinrich Buff discovered  |silane|Silane|  in 1856. Wöhler also prepared urea, a constituent of urine, from ammonium cyanate in the laboratory without the help of a living cell.       Wöhlers discoveries had great influence on the theory of chemistry. The journals of every year from 1820 to 1881 contain contributions from him. In the  Scientific American  supplement for 1882, it was remarked that for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain, but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming. Had he never lived, the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now . . Fullbooks.com. Retrieved on 28 May 2014.     Wöhler had several students who became notable chemists. Among them were  |Georg_Ludwig_Carius|Georg_Ludwig_Carius| ,  |Heinrich_Limpricht|Heinrich_Limpricht| ,  |Rudolph_Fittig|Rudolph_Fittig| ,  |Adolph_Wilhelm_Hermann_Kolbe|Adolph_Wilhelm_Hermann_Kolbe| ,  |Albert_Niemann|Albert_Niemann| , and  |Vojtěch_Šafařík|Vojtěch_Šafařík| .         He was first married to his cousin Franziska Maria Wöhler in Kassel on 1 June 1830. The couple had two children, a boy  and a girl named Sophie . After the death of Franziska he married Julie Pfeiffer on 16 July 1834 in Kassel. The couple had four daughters .       Further works from Wöhler:   Lehrbuch der Chemie, Dresden, 1825, 4 vols.
