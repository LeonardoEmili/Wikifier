             Ludovico Ariosto  was an Italian poet. He is best known as the author of the  |romance|Chivalric_Romance| |_epic|Epic_Poetry|   Orlando Furioso  . The poem, a continuation of  |Matteo_Maria_Boiardos|Matteo_Maria_Boiardo|   Orlando Innamorato , describes the adventures of  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| ,  |Orlando|Roland| , and the  |Franks|Frankish_Empire|  as they battle against the  |Saracens|Saracen|  with diversions into many sideplots. Ariosto composed the poem in the  |ottava_rima|Ottava_Rima|  rhyme scheme and introduced narrative commentary throughout the work.     Ariosto also coined the term  |humanism|Humanism|   1580s, student of the classical humanities, from Middle French humaniste , formed on model of Italian umanista student of human affairs or human nature, coined by Italian poet Lodovicio Ariosto , from Latin humanus human . Philosophical sense is from 1903. for choosing to focus upon the strengths and potential of humanity, rather than only upon its role as subordinate to God. This led to  |Renaissance_humanism|Renaissance_Humanism| .          Ariosto was born in  |Reggio_nell’Emilia|Reggio_Nell’Emilia| , where his father Niccolò Ariosto was commander of the citadel. He was the oldest of 10 children and was seen as the successor to the patriarchal position of his family. From his earliest years, Ludovico was very interested in poetry, but he was obliged by his father to study law.     After five years of law, Ariosto was allowed to read  |classics|Classical_Literature|  under Gregorio da Spoleto. Ariostos studies of  |Greek|Ancient_Greek_Literature|  and  |Latin_literature|Latin_Literature|  were cut short by Spoletos move to France to tutor  |Francesco_Sforza|Francesco_I_Sforza| . Shortly after this, Ariostos father died.          After the death of his father, Ludovico Ariosto was compelled to forgo his literary occupations and take care of his family, whose affairs were in disarray. Despite his family obligations, Ariosto managed to write some comedies in prose as well as lyrical pieces. Some of these attracted the notice of Cardinal  |Ippolito_dEste|Ippolito_Deste| , who took the young poet under his patronage and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his household. Este compensated Ariosto poorly for his efforts; the only reward he gave the poet for Orlando Furioso, dedicated to him, was the question, Where did you find so many stories, Master Ludovico? Ariosto later said that the cardinal was ungrateful, that he deplored the time which he spent under his yoke, and that if he received some small pension, it was not to reward him for his poetry – which the prelate despised – but for acting as a messenger.     Ludovico Ariosto and  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  shared a patron in Cardinal  |Ippolito_dEstes|Ippolito_Deste|  older sister the Marchioness  |Isabella_d’Este|Isabella_D’Este| , the First Lady of the Renaissance. Isabella d’Este appears in Ludovicos masterpiece,  Orlando Furioso . She also appears in Leonardos, Sketch for a Portrait of Isabella d’Este, at the  |Louvre|Louvre| .      A statue no less jocund, no less bright,/   Succeeds, and on the writing is impressed;/   Lo! Hercules’ daughter, Isabella hight,/   In whom Ferrara deems city blest,/   Much more because she first shall see the light/   Within its circuit, than for all the rest/   Which kind and favouring Fortune in the flow/   Of rolling years, shall on that town bestow.    Orlando Furioso, Canto XLII.          The cardinal went to  |Hungary|Hungary|  in 1518, and wished Ariosto to accompany him. The poet excused himself, pleading ill health, his love of study, and the need to care for his elderly mother. His excuses were not well-received, and he was denied even an interview. Ariosto and dEste got into a heated argument, and Ariosto was promptly dismissed from service.                 The cardinals brother, Alfonso, duke of  |Ferrara|Ferrara| , now took Ariosto under his patronage. By then, Ariosto had already distinguished himself as a diplomat, chiefly on the occasion of two visits to Rome as ambassador to  |Pope_Julius_II|Pope_Julius_Ii| . The fatigue of one of these journeys brought on an illness from which he never recovered, and on his second mission he was nearly killed by order of the Pope, who happened at the time to be in conflict with Alfonso.     On account of the war, his salary of 84 crowns a year was suspended, and it was withdrawn altogether after the peace. Because of this, Ariosto asked the duke either to provide for him, or to allow him to seek employment elsewhere. He was appointed to the province of  |Garfagnana|Garfagnana| , then without a governor, situated on the Apennines, an appointment he held for three years. The province was distracted by factions and bandits, the governor had not the requisite means to enforce his authority and the duke did little to support his minister. Ariostos government satisfied both the sovereign and the people given over to his care, however; indeed, there is a story about a time when he was walking alone and fell into the company of a group of bandits, the chief of which, on discovering that his captive was the author of Orlando Furioso, apologized for not having immediately shown him the respect due his rank.     In 1508 Ariostos play Cassaria appeared, and the next year  I suppositi  was first acted in  |Ferrara|Ferrara|  and ten years later in the  |Vatican|Holy_See| . A prose edition was published in Rome in 1524, and the first verse edition was published at Venice in 1551. The play was translated by  |George_Gascoigne|George_Gascoigne|  and acted at  |Grays_Inn|Grays_Inn|  in London in 1566 and published in 1573, which was later used by  |Shakespeare|Shakespeare|  as a source for  The Taming of the Shrew .     In 1516, the first version of the  Orlando Furioso  in 40  |cantos|Canto| , was published at Ferrara.     The third and final version of the Orlando Furioso, in 46 cantos, appeared on 8 September 1532.            Throughout Ariostos writing are narratorial comments dubbed by Dr. Daniel Javitch as Cantus Interruptus . Javitchs term refers to Ariostos narrative technique to break off one plot line in the middle of a canto, only to pick it up again in another, often much later, canto. Javitch argues that while many critics have assumed Ariosto does this so as to build narrative tension and keep the reader turning pages, the poet in reality defuses narrative tension because so much time separates the interruption and the resumption. By the time the reader gets to the continuation of the story, he or she has often forgotten or ceased to care about the plot and is usually wrapped up in another plot. Ariosto does this, Javitch argues, to undermine mans foolish but persistent desire for continuity and completion . Ariosto uses it throughout his works. Daniel Javitch, Cantus interruptus in the Orlando Furioso, Modern language notes, 95     For example, in Canto II, stanza 30, of  Orlando Furioso , the narrator says:        Some have attributed this piece of  |metafiction|Metafiction|  as one component of the Sorriso ariostesco or Ariostos smile, the wry sense of humor that Ariosto adds to the text.     In explaining this humor, Thomas Greene, in Descent from Heaven, says:          Lodovico Ariosto is featured in the novelization of  Assassins Creed: Revelations   as an  |Assassin|Assassination| .
