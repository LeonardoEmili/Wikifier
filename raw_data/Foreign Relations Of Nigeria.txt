     Since independence, with  |Jaja_Wachuku|Jaja_Wachuku|  as the first  |Minister|Minister|  of Foreign Affairs and  |Commons|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| , later called External Affairs,  |Nigeria|Nigeria| n  |foreign_policy|Foreign_Policy|  has been characterised by a focus on Africa as a regional power and by attachment to several fundamental principles: African unity and independence; capability to exercise hegemonic influence in the region: peaceful settlemenyot of disputes;  |non_alignment|Neutrality|  and non-intentional interference in the internal affairs of other nations; and regional economic cooperation and development. In carrying out these principles, Nigeria participates in the  |African_Union|African_Union| , the  |Economic_Community_of_West_African_States|Economic_Community_Of_West_African_States|  , the  |Non_Aligned_Movement|Non_Aligned_Movement| , the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| , and the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| .              Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria quickly committed itself to improving the lives of the people of the country and harnessing the resources that remain vital to the economy of the country and her neighbours. By observing at what benefits and appropriate for the country, Nigeria became one of the founding members of the Organisation for African Unity , which later became the African Union. The Organisation for African Unity checks political stability of any African countries and encourages them to be holding regional meetings for the union. Nigeria backed the  |African_National_Congress|African_National_Congress|  by taking a committed tough line with regard to the South African government and their military actions in southern Africa. Nigeria and  |Organisation_for_African_Unity|Organisation_For_African_Unity|  , has tremendous influence in West Africa nations and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for ECOWAS and  |ECOMOG|Ecomog| , economic and military organisations, respectively.     Similarly, when civil war broke out in Angola after the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975, Nigeria mobilised its diplomatic influence in Africa in support of the  |Popular_Movement_for_the_Liberation_of_Angola|Popular_Movement_For_The_Liberation_Of_Angola|  . That support helped tip the balance in their favour, which led to OAU recognition of the MPLA over the  |National_Union_for_the_Total_Independence_of_Angola|Unita| .     Nigeria extended diplomatic support to another cause,  |Sam_Nujomas|Sam_Nujoma| |_Southwest_Africa_Peoples_Organization|Swapo|  in Namibia, to stall the apartheid South African-installed government there. In 1977, the new General Olusegun Obasanjos military regime donated $20 million to the Zimbabwean movement against the apartheid government of Rhodesia. Nigeria also sent military equipment to Mozambique to help the newly independent country suppress the South African-backed  |Mozambican_National_Resistance|Renamo|  guerrillas. Nigeria also provided some military training at the  |Kaduna|Kaduna|  first mechanised army division and other material support to  |Joshua_Nkomo|Joshua_Nkomo|  and  |Robert_Mugabes|Robert_Mugabe|  guerrilla forces during the Zimbabwe War in 1979 against the white minority rule of Prime Minister  |Ian_Douglas_Smith|Ian_Douglas_Smith| , which was backed by the apartheid -government of South Africa.     Due to mismanagement of its economy and technology, Nigeria announced that it was launching a nuclear programme of unlimited scope of its own but failed. After the Nigerian Independence in 1960, Nigeria demonstrated its seriousness in improving the economy for the people and embarked on nationalizing some multi-national companies that traded with and broke the economic/trade embargo of the apartheid South African regime, the local operations of  |Barclays_Bank|Barclays_Plc|  was  |nationalised|Nationalised|  after that bank ignored the strong protests by the Nigeria populace.     Nigeria also nationalised the British Petroleum for supplying oil to South Africa. In 1982, the Alhaji  |Shehu_Shagari|Shehu_Shagari|  government urged the visiting Pontiff  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii|  to grant audience to the leaders of Southern Africa guerrilla organisations  |Oliver_Tambo|Oliver_Tambo|  of the ANC and Sam Nujoma of SWAPO. In December 1983, the new Major General  |Muhammadu_Buhari|Muhammadu_Buhari|  regime announced that Nigeria could no longer afford an apartheid government in Africa.         In pursuing the goal of regional economic cooperation and development, Nigeria helped create ECOWAS, which seeks to harmonise trade and investment practices for its 16 West African member countries and ultimately to achieve a full customs union. Nigeria also has taken the lead in articulating the views of developing nations on the need for modification of the existing international economic order.     Nigeria has played a central role in the ECOWAS efforts to end the civil war in Liberia and contributed the bulk of the ECOWAS peacekeeping forces sent there in 1990. Nigeria also has provided the bulk of troops for  |ECOMOG|Ecomog|  forces in  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone| .     Nigeria has enjoyed generally good relations with its immediate neighbours.
