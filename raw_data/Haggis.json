Thy fowll front had, and he that Bartilmo flaid;   The gallowis gaipis eftir thy graceles gruntill,   As thow wald for ane haggeis, hungry gled.   — William Dunbar, Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy       An early printed recipe for haggis appears in 1615 in The English Huswife by Gervase Markham . It contains a section entitled Skill in Oate meale .       Food writer Alan Davidson suggests that the ancient Romans were the first known to have made products of the haggis type. Haggis was born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well . Andrew Zimmern     Clarissa Dickson Wright says that it came to Scotland in a longship i.e., from Scandinavia even before Scotland was a single nation. She cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– element of the word is derived from the Old Norse haggw or the Old Icelandic hoggva Retrieved on 29 June 2009 , Modern Scots hag, meaning to hew or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish.     In her book, The Haggis: A Little History, Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — probably in a vessel made from the animals hide — was one way to make sure these parts were not wasted.           In the absence of hard facts as to haggis origins, popular folklore has provided some notions. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers . When the men left the Highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh , the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glen s. They used the ingredients that were most readily available in their homes and conveniently packaged them in a sheeps stomach allowing for easy transportation during the journey. Other speculations have been based on Scottish slaughtering practices. When a chieftain or laird required an animal to be slaughtered for meat the workmen were allowed to keep the offal as their share.     A joke sometimes maintained is that a haggis is a small Scottish animal with longer legs on one side, so that it can run around the steep hills of the Scottish highlands without falling over. According to one poll, 33 percent of American visitors to Scotland believed haggis to be an animal. guardian.co.uk, 2003-11-27.       rig is an important part of the Burns supper   rig     Haggis is traditionally served as part of the Burns supper on or near January 25, the birthday of Scotlands national poet Robert Burns .

        ", which starts Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the puddin-race! In Burnss lifetime haggis was a common dish of the poor as it was nourishing yet very cheap, being made from leftover parts of sheep otherwise discarded.     Haggis is widely available in supermarkets in Scotland all year, with cheaper brands normally packed in artificial casings, rather than stomachs. Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven. Some commercial haggis is largely made from pig, rather than sheep, offal. Kosher haggis, not only pork-free but fully conformant to Jewish dietary laws , is produced.     Haggis is often served in Scottish fast-food establishments, in the shape of a large sausage and deep fried in batter. Together with chips, this comprises a haggis supper . A haggis burger is a patty of fried haggis served on a bun. A haggis pakora is another deep fried variant, available in some Indian restaurants in Scotland. Haggis can be used as an ingredient in other dishes, even pizza , rather than the main part of a dish. An example of the use of haggis as an ingredient     A traditional haggis recipe describes haggis as sheeps pluck , minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and traditionally encased in the animals stomach and boiled . Ingredients are sheep stomach, heart and lungs of one lamb, onions, oatmeal, salt, pepper, stock, and water, with optional ingredients dried coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It can be boiled, baked, or deep fried.       Since the 1960s various Scottish shops and manufacturers have made what they call vegetarian haggis, substituting various pulses , nuts and vegetables for the meat. There are also recipes for homemade vegetarian haggis. Oats and barley may be included as may different types of lentil s, split pea s, aduki bean s, kidney bean s, borlotti bean s, peanut s, other nuts and mushroom s, onion s, and carrot s. ": null
