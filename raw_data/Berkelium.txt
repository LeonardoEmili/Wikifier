      Berkelium is a  |transuranic|Transuranic_Element| |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   Bk and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  97. It is a member of the  |actinide|Actinide|  and  |transuranium_element|Transuranium_Element|  series. It is named after the city of  |Berkeley,_California|Berkeley,_California| , the location of the  |Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|  where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after  |neptunium|Neptunium| ,  |plutonium|Plutonium| ,  |curium|Curium|  and  |americium|Americium| .     The major  |isotope|Isotope|  of berkelium, 249 Bk, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| , mainly at the  |Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|  in  |Tennessee|Tennessee| , USA, and at the  |Research_Institute_of_Atomic_Reactors|Research_Institute_Of_Atomic_Reactors|  in  |Dimitrovgrad,_Russia|Dimitrovgrad,_Russia| . The production of the second-most important isotope 247 Bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope  |244_Cm|Curium-244|  with high-energy  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle| .     Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier  |transuranic_elements|Transuranic_Elements|  and  |transactinides|Transactinide| . A 22  milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element  |tennessine|Tennessine|  for the first time in 2009 at the  |Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research|Joint_Institute_For_Nuclear_Research| ,  |Russia|Russia| , after it was bombarded with  |calcium-48|Calcium-48|  ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.     Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white,  |radioactive|Radioactivity|  metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy  |electrons|Electron|  and thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 330  days to  |californium|Californium| -249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.                Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive  |actinide|Actinide|  metal. In the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , it is located to the right of the actinide  |curium|Curium| , to the left of the actinide  |californium|Californium|  and below the lanthanide  |terbium|Terbium|  with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78  g/cm 3 lies between those of curium and californium , as does its melting point of 986  °C, below that of curium but higher than that of californium . Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest  |bulk_moduli|Bulk_Modulus|  among the actinides, at about 20  |GPa|Pascal|  .     Berkelium ions shows two sharp  |fluorescence|Fluorescence|  peaks at 652   |nanometers|Nanometer|  and 742  nanometers due to internal transitions at the  |f-electron_shell|Electron_Configuration| . The relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.  Rita Cornelis, Joe Caruso, Helen Crews, Klaus Heumann , John Wiley and Sons, 2005,  p. 553     Between 70  K and room temperature, berkelium behaves as a  |Curie–Weiss|Curie–Weiss_Law|  paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69   |Bohr_magnetons|Bohr_Magneton|  and a  |Curie_temperature|Curie_Temperature|  of 101  K. This magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of 9.72  µ B calculated within the simple atomic  |L-S_coupling_model|Angular_Momentum_Coupling| . Upon cooling to about 34  K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an  |antiferromagnetic|Antiferromagnetism|  state.  |Enthalpy_of_dissolution|Enthalpy_Change_Of_Solution|  in  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid|  at standard conditions is −600  kJ/mol, from which the  |standard_enthalpy_change_of_formation|Standard_Enthalpy_Change_Of_Formation|   of aqueous Bk 3+ ions is obtained as −601  kJ/mol. The  |standard_potential|Standard_Potential|  Bk 3+ /Bk 0 is −2.01  V.  The  |ionization_potential|Ionization_Energy|  of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23  eV.       At ambient conditions, berkelium assumes its most stable α form which has a  |hexagonal|Hexagonal_Crystal_System|  symmetry,  |space_group|Space_Group|  P6 3 /mmc, lattice parameters of 341   |pm|Picometer|  and 1107  pm. The crystal has a double- |hexagonal_close_packing|Close-Packing_Of_Spheres|  structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is  |isotypic|Isotypic|  with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7  GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a  |face-centered_cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|   symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the  |enthalpy|Enthalpy|  increases by 3.66  kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25  GPa, berkelium transforms to an  |orthorhombic|Orthorhombic_Crystal_System|  γ-berkelium structure similar to that of α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the  |5f_electron_shell|Electron_Shell| . No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.  Young, David A. , University of California Press, 1991,  p. 228     Upon heating, α-berkelium transforms into another phase with an fcc lattice , space group Fmm and the lattice constant of 500  pm; this fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at  |room_temperature|Room_Temperature| . The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.         Like all  |actinides|Actinide| , berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and converting into the berkelium state. This  |trivalent|Trivalent| |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions,   but  |tetravalent|Tetravalent|  and possibly  |divalent|Divalent|  berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed  |lanthanum_chloride|Lanthanum_Chloride| - |strontium_chloride|Strontium_Chloride|  melts.  A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium,  |terbium|Terbium| . Aqueous solutions of Bk 3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk 4+ ions is yellow in  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid|  and orange-yellow in  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| . Berkelium does not react rapidly with  |oxygen|Oxygen|  at room temperature, possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| ,  |halogens|Halogen| ,  |chalcogens|Chalcogen|  and  |pnictogens|Pnictogen|  to form various binary compounds.          About twenty isotopes and six  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 233 to 253 .  All of them are radioactive. The longest  |half-lives|Half-Life|  are observed for 247 Bk , 248 Bk and 249 Bk ; the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft  |β-particles|Beta_Decay|  which are inconvenient for detection. Its  |alpha_radiation|Alpha_Radiation|  is rather weak—1.45% with respect to the β-radiation—but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.        All berkelium isotopes have a half-life far too short to be  |primordial|Primordial_Nuclide| . Therefore, any primordial berkelium, that is, berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.     On Earth, berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas, which were used for the atmospheric  |nuclear_weapons_tests|Nuclear_Weapons_Testing|  between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the  |Chernobyl_disaster|Chernobyl_Disaster| ,  |Three_Mile_Island_accident|Three_Mile_Island_Accident|  and  |1968_Thule_Air_Base_B-52_crash|1968_Thule_Air_Base_B-52_Crash| . Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S.  |hydrogen_bomb|Hydrogen_Bomb| ,  |Ivy_Mike|Ivy_Mike| , , revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.      Nuclear reactors produce mostly, among the berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage and before the fuel disposal, most of it  |beta_decays|Beta_Decay|  to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long when compared to the other isotopes produced in the reactor,  and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.     The  |transuranic_elements|Transuranic_Element|  from  |americium|Americium|  to  |fermium|Fermium| , including berkelium, occurred naturally in the  |natural_nuclear_fission_reactor|Natural_Nuclear_Fission_Reactor|  at  |Oklo|Oklo| , but no longer do so.                   Although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was  |first_intentionally_synthesized|Discoveries_Of_The_Chemical_Elements| , isolated and identified in December 1949 by  |Glenn_T._Seaborg|Glenn_T._Seaborg| ,  |Albert_Ghiorso|Albert_Ghiorso| ,  |Stanley_G._Thompson|Stanley_G._Thompson| , and  |Kenneth_Street,_Jr.|Kenneth_Street,_Jr.| . They used the 60-inch  |cyclotron|Cyclotron|  at the  |University_of_California,_Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley| . Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of  |americium|Americium|  and  |curium|Curium|  in 1944, the new elements berkelium and  |californium|Californium|  were both produced in 1949–1950.           The name choice for element 97 followed the previous tradition of the Californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered  |actinide|Actinide|  and the  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  element positioned above it in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| . Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue  |europium|Europium| , and curium honored scientists  |Marie|Marie_Curie|  and  |Pierre_Curie|Pierre_Curie|  as the lanthanide above it,  |gadolinium|Gadolinium| , was named after the explorer of the  |rare_earth_elements|Rare_Earth_Element| |Johan_Gadolin|Johan_Gadolin| . Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue  |terbium|Terbium|  whose name was derived from the town of  |Ytterby|Ytterby| ,  |Sweden|Sweden| , where the rare earth minerals were first found. This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide,  |californium|Californium| , was not related to its lanthanide analogue  |dysprosium|Dysprosium| , but after the discovery place.      The most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium  |nitrate|Nitrate|  solution was coated on a  |platinum|Platinum|  foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to  |americium_dioxide|Americium_Dioxide|  . This target was irradiated with 35  MeV  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the 243 Bk isotope and two free  |neutrons|Neutron| :     : Am + He - /chem  ref name E97 /  |ef_name_E97|Ef_Name_E97|  ref namec1/ ref name E97 /  ref  /ref chem  .
