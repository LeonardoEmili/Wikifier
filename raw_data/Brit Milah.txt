         The brit milah  is a Jewish religious male  |circumcision_ceremony|Religious_Male_Circumcision|  performed by a  |mohel|Mohel|  on the eighth day of the infants life. The brit milah is followed by a celebratory meal .                According to the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| |God|Names_Of_God_In_Judaism|  commanded the Biblical patriarch  |Abraham|Abraham|  to be circumcised, an act to be followed by his descendants:        Also,  provides: And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.     According to the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| , it was a reproach for an  |Israelite|Israelite|  to be uncircumcised  The term arelim is used opprobriously, denoting the  |Philistines|Philistines|  and other non-Israelites  and used in conjunction with tameh for heathen . The word arel is also employed for impermeable ; it is also applied to the first three years fruit of a tree, which is forbidden .     However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the  |Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus|  from Egypt were not circumcised.  |Joshua|Book_Of_Joshua|  5:2–9, explains, all the people that came out of  |Egypt|Ancient_Egypt|  were circumcised, but those born in the wilderness were not. Therefore, Joshua, before the celebration of the  |Passover|Passover| , had them circumcised at  |Gilgal|Gilgal|  specifically before they entered Canaan. Abraham, too, was circumcised when he moved into Canaan.     The prophetic tradition emphasizes that God expects people to be good as well as pious, and that non-Jews will be judged based on their ethical behavior, see  |Noahide_Law|Noahide_Law| . Thus, Jeremiah 9:25–26 says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.     The penalty of non-observance is  kareth  , as noted in .  |Conversion_to_Judaism|Conversion_To_Judaism|  for non-Israelites in Biblical times necessitated circumcision, otherwise one could not partake in the  |Passover|Passover|  offering . Today, as in the time of Abraham, it is required of converts in  |Orthodox|Orthodox_Judaism| ,  |Conservative|Conservative_Judaism|  and  |Reform_Judaism|Reform_Judaism| . .     As found in Genesis 17:1–14, brit milah is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on  |the_Sabbath|Shabbat| , actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise.  , accessed on 23 April 2016 The  |Talmud|Talmud| , when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot based on the  |gematria|Gematria|  for brit of 612 .     Covenants in ancient times were sometimes sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, the verb meaning to seal a covenant translates literally as to cut . It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant. Circumcision. Mark Popovsky. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion. Ed.

Due to  |Jesus|Jesus|  having  |undertaken|Circumcision_Of_Jesus|  this ceremony as a Jewish child, memory of this tradition has been preserved in traditional Christian churches according to the  |Gospel_of_Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke| .  : And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. In the northern European calculation, which abstracts from the day from which the count begins, the interval was of seven days. The  |Feast_of_the_Circumcision_of_Christ|Feast_Of_The_Circumcision_Of_Christ|  is kept as a feast eight days after  |Nativity|Nativity_Of_Jesus|  in a number of churches including the  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| ,  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| ,  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  and some  |Anglican_Communion|Anglican_Communion|  churches.  In Orthodox Christian tradition, children are officially named on the eighth day after birth with special naming prayers.       Significantly, the tradition of  |baptism|Baptism|  universally replaced circumcision among Christians as the primary  |rite_of_passage|Rite_Of_Passage|  as found in  |Pauls|Paul_The_Apostle| |Epistle_to_the_Colossians|Epistle_To_The_Colossians|  and in  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles| .                A  |mohel|Mohel|  is a Jew trained in the practice of brit milah, the covenant of circumcision. According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a grown free Jewish male expert, anyone who has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that they are Jewish. Talmud Avodah Zarah 26b; Menachot 42a; Maimonides Mishneh Torah, Milah, ii. 1;  |Shulkhan_Arukh|Shulkhan_Arukh| , Yoreh Deah, l.c. However, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow female mohels, called mohalot , without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.  Retrieved 2 February 2015          It is customary for the brit to be held in a synagogue, but it can also be held at home or any other suitable location. The brit is performed on the eighth day from the babys birth, taking into consideration that according to the Jewish calendar, the day begins at the sunset of the day before. If the baby is born on Sunday before sunset, the Brit will be held the following Sunday. However, if the baby is born on Sunday night after sunset, the Brit is on the following Monday. The brit takes place on the eighth day following birth even if that day is Shabbat or a holiday. A brit is traditionally performed in the morning, but it may be performed any time during daylight hours.           The Talmud explicitly instructs that a boy must not be circumcised if he had two brothers who died due to complications arising from their circumcisions,  and  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  says that this excluded paternal half-brothers. This may be due to a concern about  |hemophilia|Hemophilia| .     An Israeli study found a high rate of  |urinary_tract_infections|Urinary_Tract_Infection|  if the bandage is left on too long.      If the child is born  |prematurely|Premature_Baby|  or has other serious medical problems, the brit milah will be postponed until the doctors and mohel deem the child strong enough for his foreskin to be surgically removed.       In recent years, the circumcision of adult Jews who were not circumcised as infants has become more common than previously thought.  In such cases, the brit milah will be done at the earliest date that can be arranged. The actual circumcision will be private, and other elements of the ceremony may be modified to accommodate the desires of the one being circumcised.       Most prominent  acharonim  rule that the  mitzvah  of brit milah lies in the pain it causes, and anesthetic, sedation, or ointment should generally not be used. Rabbi Yaakov Montrose. Halachic World – Volume 3: Contemporary Halachic topics based on the Parshah . Lech Lecha – No Pain, No Bris? Feldham Publishers 2011, pp. 29–32 However, it is traditionally common to feed the infant a drop of wine or other sweet liquid to soothe him.        |Eliezer_Waldenberg|Eliezer_Waldenberg| ,  |Yechiel_Yaakov_Weinberg|Yechiel_Yaakov_Weinberg| ,  |Shmuel_Wosner|Shmuel_Wosner| ,  |Moshe_Feinstein|Moshe_Feinstein|  and others agree that the child should not be sedated, although pain relieving ointment may be used under certain conditions;  |Shmuel_Wosner|Shmuel_Wosner|  particularly asserts that the act ought to be painful, per  |Psalms|Psalms|  44:23.     Regarding an adult circumcision, pain is ideal, but not mandatory.     In a letter to the editor published in  The New York Times  on January 3, 1998,  |Rabbi_Moshe_David_Tendler|Moshe_David_Tendler|  disagrees with the above and writes, It is a biblical prohibition to cause anyone unnecessary pain . Rabbi Tendler recommends the use of an  |analgesic_cream|Analgesic| .   |Lidocaine|Lidocaine|  should not be used, however, because Lidocaine has been linked to several pediatric near-death episodes.             The title of  kvater  among  |Ashkenazi_Jews|Ashkenazi_Jews|  is for the person who carries the baby from the mother to the father, who in turn carries him to the  mohel . This honor is usually given to a couple without children, as a merit or  segula  that they should have children of their own. The origin of the term is  |Middle_High_German|Middle_High_German|  gevater .        After the ceremony, a  |celebratory_meal|Seudat_Mitzvah|  takes place. At the  birkat hamazon , additional introductory lines, known as Nodeh Leshimcha, are added. These lines praise God and request the permission of God, the  |Torah|Torah| ,  |Kohanim|Kohen|  and distinguished people present to proceed with the grace. When the four main blessings are concluded, special ha-Rachaman prayers are recited. They request various blessings by God that include:   the parents of the baby, to help them raise him wisely;   the  sandek  ;   the baby boy to have strength and grow up to trust in God and perceive Him  |three_times_a_year|Three_Pilgrim_Festivals| ;   the mohel for unhesitatingly performing the ritual;   to send the  |Messiah_in_Judaism|Messiah_In_Judaism|  speedily in the merit of this  mitzvah ;   to send  |Elijah|Elijah|  the prophet, known as The Righteous Kohen , so that Gods covenant can be fulfilled with the re-establishment of the throne of King  |David|David| .         priah   At the neonatal stage, the inner preputial  |epithelium|Epithelium|  is still linked with the surface of the  |glans|Glans| .        The mitzvah is executed only when this epithelium is either removed, or permanently peeled back to uncover the glans.    The  |Jerusalem_Talmud|Jerusalem_Talmud|  there adds: and is punished  |kareth|Kareth| !     On medical circumcisions performed by surgeons, the epithelium is removed along with the foreskin,   of The  |American_Academy_of_Pediatrics|American_Academy_Of_Pediatrics|  notes that there are three methods of circumcision that are commonly used in the newborn male, and that all three include bluntly freeing the inner preputial epithelium from the epithelium of the glans, to be later amputated with the foreskin. to prevent post operative penile adhesion and its complications.        However, on ritual circumcisions performed by a mohel, the epithelium is most commonly peeled off only after the foreskin has been amputated. This procedure is called priah , which means: uncovering. The main goal of priah , is to remove as much of the inner layer of the foreskin as possible and prevent the movement of the shaft skin, what creates the look and function of what is known as a low and tight circumcision.      According to Rabbinic interpretation of traditional Jewish sources,  the priah has been performed as part of the Jewish circumcision since the  |Israelites|Israelites|  first inhabited the  |Land_of_Israel|Land_Of_Israel| .  |Talmud_Bavli|Talmud_Bavli|  Tractate Yebamoth 71b: Rabbah b. Isaac stated in the name of Rab: The commandment of uncovering the corona at circumcision was not given to Abraham; for it is said, At that time the Lord said unto Joshua: Make thee knives of flint etc. But is it not possible those who were not previously circumcised; for it is written, For all the people that came out were circumcised, but all the people that were born etc.? — If so, why the expression. Again! Consequently it must apply to the uncovering of the corona.   However, the Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion, states that many Hellenistic Jews attempted to restore their foreskins, and that similar action was taken during the Hadrianic persecution, a period in which a prohibition against circumcision was issued. Thus, the writers of the dictionary hypothesize that the more severe method practiced today was probably begun in order to prevent the possibility of restoring the foreskin after circumcision, and therefore the rabbis added the requirement of cutting the foreskin in periah.

Cohen, in Why Arent Jewish Women Circumcised?: Gender and Covenant in Judaism, pg 25, the Torah only commands circumcision  David Gollaher has written that the rabbis added the procedure of priah to discourage men from trying to restore their foreskins: ‘Once established, priah was deemed essential to circumcision; if the mohel failed to cut away enough tissue, the operation was deemed insufficient to comply with Gods covenant’ and ‘Depending on the strictness of individual rabbis, boys were subjected to additional operations.’         the actual circumcision |Mishnah|Mishnah|  Shabbat 19:2Circumciseroral suction8 June 20121762–1839Heterwho was suspected of transmitting herpes via metzizah to infants1807–1879Orach Chaim 152,Yoreh Deah 244RCA3Lithuanianborn without a foreskin, 13 for a boy, 12 for a girle.g., in  |Conservative_Judaism|Conservative_Judaism| , where the mother has not converted20 BCE – CE 50Moses ben Maimon Rambam , CE 1135–1204from yesod a symbolically maleSpring, 1992 |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| naming ceremony Covenant Peace  |Hiloni]]mbrit_mil|Hiloni]]Mbrit_Mil| 199819902003March 20001974 .
