      The Declaration of Arbroath  is a declaration of  |Scottish_independence|Scottish_Independence| , made in 1320. It is in the form of a letter in  |Latin|Latin|  submitted to  |Pope_John_XXII|Pope_John_Xxii| , dated 6 April 1320, intended to confirm  |Scotlands|Scotland|  status as an  |independent_sovereign_state|Sovereign_State|  and defending Scotlands right to use military action when unjustly attacked.     Generally believed to have been written in the  |Arbroath_Abbey|Arbroath_Abbey|  by  |Bernard_of_Kilwinning|Bernard_Of_Kilwinning| , then  |Chancellor_of_Scotland|Lord_Chancellor_Of_Scotland|  and  |Abbot_of_Arbroath|Abbot_Of_Arbroath| , and sealed by fifty-one  |magnates|Magnate|  and  |nobles|Nobles| , the letter is the sole survivor of three created at the time. The others were a letter from the  |King_of_Scots|King_Of_Scots| ,  |Robert_I|Robert_I_Of_Scotland| , and a letter from four Scottish bishops which all made similar points.       The Declaration was part of a broader diplomatic campaign, which sought to assert Scotlands position as an independent kingdom, rather than its being a feudal land controlled by Englands Norman kings, as well as lift the  |excommunication|Excommunication|  of  |Robert_the_Bruce|Robert_I_Of_Scotland| . The pope had recognised  |Edward_I_of_Englands|Edward_I_Of_England|  claim to overlordship of Scotland in 1305 and Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope for murdering  |John_Comyn|John_Iii_Comyn_Lord_Of_Badenoch|  before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306.     The Declaration made a number of points: that Scotland had always been independent, indeed for longer than England; that Edward I of England had unjustly attacked Scotland and perpetrated atrocities; that Robert the Bruce had delivered the Scottish nation from this peril; and, most controversially, that the independence of Scotland was the prerogative of the Scottish people, rather than the King of Scots. In fact it stated that the nobility would choose someone else to be king if Bruce proved to be unfit in maintaining Scotlands independence.       Some have interpreted this last point as an early expression of  |popular_sovereignty|Popular_Sovereignty|    that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by God alone. Modern Scottish nationalists point to the “Declaration as evidence of the long-term persistence of the Scots as a distinct national community, giving a very early date for the emergence of  |nationalism|Nationalism| . However, the overwhelming majority of academics challenge this vision. Scholars point out that definitions change with time. The meaning ascribed to words similar to nation during the ancient and medieval periods was often quite different than it is today.      It has also been argued that the Declaration was not a statement of popular sovereignty  but a statement of royal propaganda supporting Bruces faction.   A justification had to be given for the rejection of  |King_John_Balliol|John_Of_Scotland|  in whose name  |William_Wallace|William_Wallace|  and  |Andrew_de_Moray|Andrew_De_Moray|  had rebelled in 1297. The reason given in the Declaration is that Bruce was able to defend Scotland from English aggression whereas, by implication, King John could not.       Whatever the true motive, the idea of a contract between King and people was advanced to the Pope as a justification for Bruces coronation whilst John de Balliol still lived in Papal custody.       There are 39 names—eight  |earls|Earl|  and thirty one  |barons|Baron| —at the start of the document, all of whom may have had their seals appended, probably over the space of some weeks and months, with nobles sending in their seals to be used. On the extant copy of the Declaration there are only 19 seals, and of those 19 people only 12 are named within the document. It is thought likely that at least 11 more seals than the original 39 might have been appended.  The Declaration was then taken to the  |papal_court|Papal_Court|  at  |Avignon|Avignon_Papacy|  by  |Bishop_Kininmund|Alexanderdekininmund| ,  |Sir_Adam_Gordon|Adamdegordon_Lordofgordon|  and Sir Odard de Maubuisson.        The Pope heeded the arguments contained in the Declaration, influenced by the offer of support from the Scots for his long-desired crusade if they no longer had to fear English invasion. He exhorted Edward II in a letter to make peace with the Scots, but the following year was again persuaded by the English to take their side and issued six bulls to that effect.   Not until eight years later, on 1 March 1328 the new  |English_king|English_King| ,  |Edward_III|Edward_Iii_Of_England|  signed a  |peace_treaty|Peace_Treaty|  between Scotland and  |England|Kingdom_Of_England| , the  |Treaty_of_Edinburgh_Northampton|Treaty_Of_Edinburgh_Northampton| . In this treaty, which was in effect for five years until 1333, Edward renounced all English claims to Scotland. Eight months later, in October 1328, the interdict on Scotland, and the excommunication of its king, were removed by the Pope.       The original copy of the Declaration that was sent to Avignon is lost. A copy of the Declaration survives among Scotlands state papers, measuring 540mm wide by 675mm long , it is held by the  |National_Archives_of_Scotland|National_Archives_Of_Scotland|  in  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| .  The most widely known English language translation was made by  |Sir_James_Fergusson|Sir_James_Fergusson_8Th_Baronet| , formerly  |Keeper_of_the_Records_of_Scotland|Keeper_Of_The_Records_Of_Scotland| , from text that he reconstructed using this extant copy and early copies of the original draft.      |G_W_S_Barrow|G_W_S_Barrow|  has shown that one passage in particular, often quoted from the Fergusson translation, was carefully written using different parts of  The Conspiracy of Catiline  by the Roman author,  |Sallust|Sallust|  as the direct source: G.
