Mice treated with the phage cocktail showed a 2.3-fold higher survival rate than those untreated in seven days post infection.  In 2017 a patient with a pancreas compromised by MDR A. baumannii was put on several antibiotics, despite this the patient’s health continued to deteriorate during a four-month period. Without effective antibiotics the patient was subjected to phage therapy using a phage cocktail containing nine different phages that had been demonstrated to be effective against MDR A. baumannii. Once on this therapy the patient’s downward clinical trajectory reversed, and returned to health.

Evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomes of bacterial viruses vary between different families and depend upon the type of the nucleic acid, characteristics of the virion structure, as well as the mode of the viral life cycle.        Phage often have dramatic effects on their hosts. As a consequence, the transcription pattern of the infected bacterium may change considerably. For instance, infection of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% of its hosts genes.
