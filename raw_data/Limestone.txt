               Limestone is a  |carbonate|Carbonate_Rock| |sedimentary_rock|Sedimentary_Rock|  that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as  |coral|Coral| ,  |foraminifera|Foraminifera| , and  |molluscs|Molluscs| . Its major materials are the  |minerals|Minerals| |calcite|Calcite|  and  |aragonite|Aragonite| , which are different  |crystal_forms|Polymorphism|  of  |calcium_carbonate|Calcium_Carbonate|  . A closely related rock is  |dolomite|Dolomite| , which contains a high percentage of the mineral  |dolomite|Dolomite| , CaMg 2 . In old  |USGS|Usgs|  publications, dolomite was referred to as magnesian limestone, a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones.          About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The  |solubility|Solubility|  of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to  |karst|Karst|  landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most  |cave|Cave|  systems are through limestone bedrock.     Limestone has numerous uses: as a  |building_material|Building_Material| , an essential component of  |concrete|Concrete|  , as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as  |toothpaste|Toothpaste|  or  |paints|Paint| , as a chemical  |feedstock|Feedstock|  for the production of  |lime|Lime| , as a  |soil_conditioner|Soil_Conditioner| , or as a popular decorative addition to  |rock_gardens|Rock_Gardens| .                   Like most other sedimentary rocks, most limestone is composed of grains. Most grains in limestone are skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as  |coral|Coral|  or  |foraminifera|Foraminiferal_Colouration_Index| . These organisms secrete shells made of aragonite or calcite, and leave these shells behind when they die. Other  |carbonate|Carbonate|  grains composing limestones are  |ooids|Ooids| ,  |peloids|Peloids| ,  |intraclasts|Intraclasts| , and  |extraclasts|Extraclasts| .     Limestone often contains variable amounts of  |silica|Silica|  in the form of  |chert|Chert|   or siliceous skeletal fragment , and varying amountsl  |precipitation|Precipitation|  of  |calcite|Calcite|  or  |aragonite|Aragonite| , i.e.  |travertine|Travertine| . Secondary calcite may be deposited by  |supersaturated|Supersaturation| |meteoric_waters|Meteoric_Water|  . This produces  |speleothems|Speleothem| , such as  |stalagmites|Stalagmite|  and  |stalactites|Stalactite| . Another form taken by calcite is oolitic limestone, which can be recognized by its granular appearance.     The primary source of the calcite in limestone is most commonly  |marine_organisms|Marine_Biology| . Some of these organisms can construct mounds of rock known as reefs, building upon past generations. Below about 3,000 meters, water pressure and temperature conditions cause the dissolution of calcite to increase nonlinearly, so limestone typically does not form in deeper waters . Limestones may also form in  |lacustrine|Lake|   and  |evaporite|Evaporite| |depositional_environments|Sedimentary_Depositional_Environment| .       Calcite can be  |dissolved|Solvation|  or  |precipitate|Precipitate| d by groundwater, depending on several factors, including the water temperature,  |pH|Acidity| , and dissolved  |ion|Ion|  concentrations. Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called  |retrograde_solubility|Solubilitytemperature| , in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases.     Impurities  will cause limestones to exhibit different colors, especially with  |weathered|Weathering|  surfaces.     Limestone may be crystalline,  |clastic|Clastic_Rock| , granular, or massive, depending on the method of formation. Crystals of calcite,  |quartz|Quartz| ,  |dolomite|Dolomite|  or  |barite|Barite|  may line small cavities in the rock. When conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together, or it can fill fractures.      |Travertine|Travertine|  is a banded, compact variety of limestone formed along streams, particularly where there are waterfalls and around hot or cold springs. Calcium carbonate is deposited where evaporation of the water leaves a solution supersaturated with the chemical constituents of calcite.  |Tufa|Tufa| , a porous or cellular variety of travertine, is found near waterfalls.  |Coquina|Coquina|  is a poorly consolidated limestone composed of pieces of  |coral|Coral|  or  |shells|Animal_Shell| .     During regional  |metamorphism|Metamorphism|  that occurs during the mountain building process , limestone recrystallizes into  |marble|Marble| .     Limestone is a  |parent_material|Parent_Material|  of  |Mollisol|Mollisol|  soil group.          Two major classification schemes, the Folk and the Dunham, are used for identifying the types of  |carbonate_rocks|Carbonate_Rocks|  collectively known as limestone.                  Robert L. Folk developed a classification system that places primary emphasis on the detailed composition of grains and interstitial material in  |carbonate_rocks|Carbonate_Rocks| .  Based on composition, there are three main components: allochems , matrix , and cement . The Folk system uses two-part names; the first refers to the grains and the second is the root. It is helpful to have a  |petrographic_microscope|Petrographic_Microscope|  when using the Folk scheme, because it is easier to determine the components present in each sample.           The Dunham scheme focuses on depositional textures. Each name is based upon the texture of the grains that make up the limestone. Robert J. Dunham published his system for limestone in 1962; it focuses on the depositional fabric of carbonate rocks. Dunham divides the rocks into four main groups based on relative proportions of coarser clastic particles. Dunham names are essentially for rock families. His work considers whether or not the grains were originally in mutual contact, and therefore self-supporting, or whether the rock is characterized by the presence of frame builders and algal mats. Unlike the Folk scheme, Dunham deals with the original porosity of the rock. The Dunham scheme is more useful for hand samples because it is based on texture, not the grains in the sample.      A revised classification was proposed by Wright .  It adds some diagenetic patterns and can be summarized as follows:       ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  |ef_namecassar_/re|Ef_Namecassar_/Re|  ref  /ref  ref namecassar/  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref gallery .
