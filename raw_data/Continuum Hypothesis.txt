   In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the continuum hypothesis  is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of  |infinite_sets|Infinite_Set| . It states:        The continuum hypothesis was advanced by  |Georg_Cantor|Georg_Cantor|  in 1878, and   establishing its truth or falsehood is the first of  |Hilberts_23_problems|Hilberts_Problems|  presented in 1900. Τhe answer to this problem is  |independent|Independence|  of  |ZFC_set_theory|Zfc_Set_Theory|  , so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. This independence was proved in 1963 by  |Paul_Cohen|Paul_Cohen| , complementing earlier work by  |Kurt_Gödel|Kurt_Gödel|  in 1940.     The name of the hypothesis comes from the term  the continuum  for the real numbers.       Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain . It became the first on David Hilberts  |list_of_important_open_questions|Hilberts_Problems|  that was presented at the  |International_Congress_of_Mathematicians|International_Congress_Of_Mathematicians|  in the year 1900 in Paris.  |Axiomatic_set_theory|Axiomatic_Set_Theory|  was at that point not yet formulated.    |Kurt_Gödel|Kurt_Gödel|  proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory. The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by  |Paul_Cohen|Paul_Cohen| .            Two sets are said to have the same  cardinality  or  cardinal number  if there exists a  |bijection|Bijection|  between them. Intuitively, for two sets S and T to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to pair off elements of S with elements of T in such a fashion that every element of S is paired off with exactly one element of T and vice versa. Hence, the set has the same cardinality as .     With infinite sets such as the set of  |integers|Integer|  or  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number| , the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers. However, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are  |infinite|Infinite_Set| . It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size  as the set of integers: they are both  |countable_sets|Countable_Set| .     Cantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of  |integers|Integer|  is strictly smaller than that of the set of  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  . His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.     The continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set, S, of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into S. Using the fact that the real numbers are  |equinumerous|Equinumerous|  with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set S for which   .
