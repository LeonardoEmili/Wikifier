In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the inverse limit  is a construction that allows one to glue together several related  |objects|Mathematical_Object| , the precise manner of the gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects. Inverse limits can be defined in any  |category|Category| , and they are a special case of the concept of a  |limit_in_category_theory|Limit| .             We start with the definition of an  inverse system  of  |groups|Group|  and  |homomorphisms|Group_Homomorphism| . Let  be a  |directed|Directed_Set| |poset|Poset|  . Let  i∈I be a  |family|Indexed_Family|  of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms f ij : A j → A i for all i ≤ j , called bonding maps, with the following properties:   f ii is the identity on A i ,   f ik f ij ∘ f jk for all i ≤ j ≤ k.   Then the pair  is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over I, and the morphisms f ij are called the transition morphisms of the system.     We define the inverse limit of the inverse system  as a particular  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of the  |direct_product|Direct_Product|  of the A i s:     : A         The inverse limit A comes equipped with natural projections π i : A → A i which pick out the ith component of the direct product for each i in I. The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a  |universal_property|Universal_Property|  described in the next section.     This same construction may be carried out if the A i s are  |sets|Set| , John Rhodes & Benjamin Steinberg. The q-theory of Finite Semigroups. p. 133. . semigroups, topological spaces,  |rings|Ring| ,  |modules|Module|  ,  |algebras|Algebra_Over_A_Field|  , etc., and the  |homomorphisms|Homomorphism|  are morphisms in the corresponding  |category|Category_Theory| . The inverse limit will also belong to that category.         The inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary  |category|Category|  by means of a  |universal_property|Universal_Property| . Let  be an inverse system of objects and  |morphisms|Morphism|  in a category C . The inverse limit of this system is an object X in C together with morphisms π i : X → X i  satisfying π i f ij ∘ π j for all i ≤ j. The pair  must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair   there exists a unique morphism uY → X such that the diagram      |Image:InverseLimit-01.png|Image:Inverselimit-01.Png| |commutes|Commutative_Diagram|  for all i ≤ j, for which it suffices to show that ψ i π i ∘ u for all i. The inverse limit is often denoted   : X   Xi   with the inverse system  being understood.     In some categories, the inverse limit of certain inverse systems does not exist. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any two inverse limits X and X of an inverse system, there exists a unique isomorphism X & prime; → X commuting with the projection maps.     We note that an inverse system in a category C admits an alternative description in terms of functor s. Any partially ordered set I can be considered as a small category where the morphisms consist of arrows i → j if and only if i ≤ j. An inverse system is then just a contravariant functor I → C, and the inverse limit functor     C is a covariant functor .         The ring of p-adic integers is the inverse limit of the rings Z/p n Z with the index set being the natural number s with the usual order, and the morphisms being take remainder . That is, one considers sequences of integers such that each element of the sequence projects down to the previous ones, namely, that ni  nj   p whenever i .         The  |categorical_dual|Dual|  of an inverse limit is a  |direct_limit|Direct_Limit|  . More general concepts are the  |limits_and_colimits|Limit|.
