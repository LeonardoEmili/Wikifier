        Quisling  is a term originating in  |Norway|Norway| , which is used in  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| n languages and in English for a person who collaborates with an enemy occupying force   or more generally as a synonym for  |traitor|Treason| . The word originates from the surname of the Norwegian war-time leader  |Vidkun_Quisling|Vidkun_Quisling| , who headed a domestic  |Nazi_collaborationist|Collaboration_With_The_Axis_Powers_During_World_War_Ii|  regime during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .       Use of Quislings surname as a term predates World War II. The first recorded use of the term was by  |Norwegian_Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  politician  |Oscar_Torp|Oscar_Torp|  in a 2 January 1933 newspaper interview, where he used it as a general term for followers of  |Vidkun_Quisling|Vidkun_Quisling| . Quisling was at this point in the process of establishing the  |Nasjonal_Samling|Nasjonal_Samling|  party, a fascist party modelled on the German  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party| . Further uses of the term were made by  |Aksel_Sandemose|Aksel_Sandemose| , in a newspaper article in  Dagbladet  in 1934, and by the newspaper  Vestfold Arbeiderblad , in 1936. The term with the opposite meaning, a Norwegian patriot, is  |Jøssing|Jøssingfjordhistory| .       The use of the name as a term for collaborators or traitors in general probably came about upon  |Quislings_unsuccessful_1940_coup_détat|Quisling_Regime1940Coup| , when he attempted to seize power and make Norway cease resisting the invading Germans. The term was widely introduced to an English-speaking audience by the British newspaper  The Times . It published an editorial on 19 April 1940 titled Quislings everywhere , in which it was asserted that To writers, the word Quisling is a gift from the gods. If they had been ordered to invent a new word for traitor... they could hardly have hit upon a more brilliant combination of letters. Aurally it contrives to suggest something at once slippery and tortuous. The  Daily Mail  picked up the term four days after The Times editorial was published.  The War Illustrated  discussed potential Quislings among the Dutch during the  |German_invasion_of_the_Netherlands|German_Invasion_Of_The_Netherlands| . Subsequently, the BBC brought the word into common use internationally.      |Chips_Channon|Chips_Channon|  described how during the  |Norway_Debate|Norway_Debate|  of 7–8 May 1940, he and other Conservative MPs who supported  |Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain|  called those who voted against a  |motion_of_no_confidence|Motion_Of_No_Confidence|  Quislings .  Chamberlains successor  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  used the term during an address to the Allied Delegates at  |St._Jamess_Palace|St._Jamess_Palace|  on 21 June 1941, when he said: A vile race of Quislings—to use a new word which will carry the scorn of mankind down the centuries—is hired to fawn upon the conqueror, to collaborate in his designs and to enforce his rule upon their fellow countrymen while grovelling low themselves. He used the term again in an address to both houses of  |Congress|United_States_Congress|  in the United States of America on 26 December 1941. Commenting upon the effect of a number of  |Allied|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  victories against  |Axis_forces|Axis_Forces| , and moreover the United States’ decision to enter the war, Churchill opined: Hope has returned to the hearts of scores of millions of men and women, and with that hope there burns the flame of anger against the brutal, corrupt invader. And still more fiercely burn the fires of hatred and contempt for the filthy Quislings whom he has suborned. The term subsequently entered the language and became a target for political cartoonists.     In the United States it was used often. Some examples include: In the  |Warner_Bros.|Warner_Bros.|  cartoon  Tom Turk and Daffy  , it was uttered by a Thanksgiving turkey whose presence is betrayed to  |Porky_Pig|Porky_Pig|  by  |Daffy_Duck|Daffy_Duck| . In the American film  |Edge_of_Darkness|Edge_Of_Darkness|  , about the Resistance in Norway, the heroines brother is often described as a quisling.       The  |back-formed|Back-Formation|  verb, to quisle  existed. This back-formed verb gave rise to a much less common version of the noun: quisler.     However,  |H._L._Mencken|H._L._Mencken|   even in 1944 appeared not to be aware of the existence of the verb form, and to quisle has entirely disappeared from contemporary usage.       Quisling was applied to some  |Communist|Communism|  figures who participated in the establishment of Communist regimes. As an illustration, the renegade socialist  |Zdeněk_Fierlinger|Zdeněk_Fierlinger|  of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  was frequently derided as Quislinger for his collaboration with the  |Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|Communist_Party_Of_Czechoslovakia| .      |The_Patriot_Game|The_Patriot_Game|  , one of the best known songs to emerge from the  |Irish_nationalist_struggle|Irish_Nationalism| , includes the line ...those quislings who sold out the Patriot Game in some versions .     In a June 2018 New York Times column,  |Paul_Krugman|Paul_Krugman|  called US President  |Donald_Trump|Donald_Trump|  a quisling , in reference to what Krugman described as Trumps serv the interests of foreign masters at his own country’s expense and defend Russia while attacking our closest allies . Other publications also revived the term in the  |2010s|2010S|  for use in describing President Trump and his associates and supporters.       In Max Brooks novel  World War Z , quisling is used to describe humans that have broken down psychologically and act like a zombie.     In the 2019 film  Drunk Parents , when a bumbling neighbor adds to the main characters problems, the character Frank  refers to him as a little quisling .     In Season 1, Episode 8 of the TV series  Billions .
