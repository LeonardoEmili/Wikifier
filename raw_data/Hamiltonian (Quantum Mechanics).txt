In  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , a Hamiltonian is an  |operator|Operator|  corresponding to the sum of the  |kinetic_energies|Kinetic_Energy|  plus the  |potential_energies|Potential_Energy|  for all the particles in the system . It is usually denoted by H , but also   or   to highlight its function as an operator. Its  |spectrum|Spectrum_Of_An_Operator|  is the set of possible outcomes when one measures the total energy of a system. Because of its close relation to the time-evolution of a system, it is of fundamental importance in most formulations of quantum theory.     The Hamiltonian is named after  |William_Rowan_Hamilton|William_Rowan_Hamilton| , who created a revolutionary reformulation of  |Newtonian_mechanics|Newtonian_Mechanics| , now called  |Hamiltonian_mechanics|Hamiltonian_Mechanics| , which is also important in quantum physics.              The Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic energies of all the particles, plus the potential energy of the particles associated with the system. The expression of the Hamiltonian can take different forms and simplifications taken into account the concrete characteristics of the system under analysis: single or several particles in the system; interaction between particles; kind of potential energy; time varying potential or time independent one; etc.             By analogy with  |classical_mechanics|Classical_Mechanics| , the Hamiltonian is commonly expressed as the sum of  |operators|Hermitian_Operators|  corresponding to the  |kinetic|Kinetic_Energy|  and  |potential|Potential_Energy|  energies of a system in the form     :     +       where   :   V V ,   is the  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy|  operator and   :       -    is the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  operator in which m is the  |mass|Mass|  of the particle, the dot denotes the  |dot_product|Dot_Product|  of vectors, and   :   -i  ,   is the  |momentum_operator|Momentum_Operator|  where an   is the  |del|Del| |_operator|Operator| . The  |dot_product|Dot_Product|  of   with itself is the  |Laplacian|Laplacian|    . In three dimensions using  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinates|  the Laplace operator is   :     +   +       Although this is not the technical definition of the  |Hamiltonian_in_classical_mechanics|Hamiltonian_Mechanics| , it is the form it most commonly takes. Combining these together yields the familiar form used in the  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation| |wave_function|Wave_Function|    . This is the approach commonly taken in introductory treatments of quantum mechanics, using the formalism of Schrödingers wave mechanics.     One can also make substitutions to certain variables to fit specific cases, such as some involving electromagnetic fields.         The formalism can be extended to N particles:     :       + V     where   : V V ,   is the potential energy function, now a function of the spatial configuration of the system and time and;   :     ,   is the kinetic energy operator of particle n , and   is the gradient for particle n ,   is the Laplacian for particle using the coordinates:   :     +   +       Combining these yields the Schrödinger Hamiltonian for the N -particle case:     :     &     + V     &     V     & -    + V         However, complications can arise in the  |many_body_problem|Many_Body_Problem| . Since the potential energy depends on the spatial arrangement of the particles, the kinetic energy will also depend on the spatial configuration to conserve energy. The motion due to any one particle will vary due to the motion of all the other particles in the system. For this reason cross terms for kinetic energy may appear in the Hamiltonian; a mix of the gradients for two particles:     : -      where M denotes the mass of the collection of particles resulting in this extra kinetic energy. Terms of this form are known as mass polarization terms, and appear in the Hamiltonian of many electron atoms .     For N interacting particles, i.e. particles which interact mutually and constitute a many-body situation, the potential energy function V is not simply a sum of the separate potentials . The potential energy function can only be written as above: a function of all the spatial positions of each particle.     For non-interacting particles, i.e. particles which do not interact mutually and move independently, the potential of the system is the sum of the separate potential energy for each particle, Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles , R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985,  that is     : V   V V + V +   + V     The general form of the Hamiltonian in this case is:     :     & -    +   Vi     &         &             where the sum is taken over all particles and their corresponding potentials; the result is that the Hamiltonian of the system is the sum of the separate Hamiltonians for each particle. This is an idealized situation - in practice the particles are almost always influenced by some potential, and there are many-body interactions. One illustrative example of a two-body interaction where this form would not apply is for electrostatic potentials due to charged particles, because they interact with each other by Coulomb interaction , as shown below.            The Hamiltonian generates the time evolution of quantum states. If       is the state of the system at time t , then     : H       i             This equation is the  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation| . It takes the same form as the  |Hamilton–Jacobi_equation|Hamilton–Jacobi_Equation| , which is one of the reasons H is also called the Hamiltonian. Given the state at some initial time , we can solve it to obtain the state at any subsequent time. In particular, if H is independent of time, then     :       e           The  |exponential|Matrix_Exponential|  operator on the right hand side of the Schrödinger equation is usually defined by the corresponding  |power_series|Exponential_Functionformal_Definition|  in H . One might notice that taking polynomials or power series of  |unbounded_operators|Unbounded_Operator|  that are not defined everywhere may not make mathematical sense. Rigorously, to take functions of unbounded operators, a  |functional_calculus|Functional_Calculus|  is required. In the case of the exponential function, the  |continuous|Continuous_Functional_Calculus| , or just the  |holomorphic_functional_calculus|Holomorphic_Functional_Calculus|  suffices. We note again, however, that for common calculations the physicists formulation is quite sufficient.     By the - |homomorphism|Homomorphism|  property of the functional calculus, the operator     : U e     is a  |unitary_operator|Unitary_Operator| . It is the  time evolution operator, or  propagator , of a closed quantum system. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, form a  |one_parameter_unitary_group|Stones_Theorem_On_One_Parameter_Unitary_Groups|  ; this gives rise to the physical principle of  |detailed_balance|Detailed_Balance| .         However, in the  |more_general_formalism|Bra–Ket_Notation|  of  |Dirac|Paul_Dirac| , the Hamiltonian is typically implemented as an operator on a  |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space|  in the following way:     The eigenkets  of H , denoted   a   , provide an  |orthonormal_basis|Orthonormal_Basis|  for the Hilbert space. The spectrum of allowed energy levels of the system is given by the set of eigenvalues, denoted , solving the equation:     : H   a   Ea   a       Since H is a  |Hermitian_operator|Hermitian_Operator| , the energy is always a  |real_number|Real_Number| .     From a mathematically rigorous point of view, care must be taken with the above assumptions. Operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces need not have eigenvalues . However, all routine quantum mechanical calculations can be done using the physical formulation.         Following are expressions for the Hamiltonian in a number of situations. Quanta: A handbook of concepts, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974,  Typical ways to classify the expressions are the number of particles, number of dimensions, and the nature of the potential energy function - importantly space and time dependence. Masses are denoted by m , and charges by q .             The particle is not bound by any potential energy, so the potential is zero and this Hamiltonian is the simplest. For one dimension:     :   -      and in higher dimensions:     :   -          For a particle in a region of constant potential V V0 , in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:     :   -  + V0     in three dimensions     :   -  + V0     This applies to the elementary  |particle_in_a_box|Particle_In_A_Box|  problem, and  |step_potentials|Step_Potential| .         For a  |simple_harmonic_oscillator|Simple_Harmonic_Oscillator|  in one dimension, the potential varies with position , according to:     : V         where the  |angular_frequency|Angular_Frequency|     , effective  |spring_constant|Spring_Constant|  k , and mass m of the oscillator satisfy:     :         so the Hamiltonian is:     :   -  +       For three dimensions, this becomes     :   -  +   r2     where the three-dimensional position vector   using cartesian coordinates is , its magnitude is     : r2      x2+y2+z2     Writing the Hamiltonian out in full shows it is simply the sum of the one-dimensional Hamiltonians in each direction:     :     & -  +       &   +   +               For a  |rigid_rotor|Rigid_Rotor|  – i.e. system of particles which can rotate freely about any axes, not bound in any potential , Hamiltonian is:     :   -  -  -      where I , I , and I are the  |moment_of_inertia|Moment_Of_Inertia|  components , and     ,     and     are the total  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum|  operators , about the x , y , and z axes respectively.         The  |Coulomb_potential_energy|Coulomb_Potential_Energy|  for two point charges q1 and q2 , in three dimensions, is      : Vj   qi         where   is the electrostatic potential of charge qj at   . The total potential of the system is then the sum over j :     : V         so the Hamiltonian is:     :   & -  +         &                   For an  |electric_dipole_moment|Electric_Dipole_Moment|    constituting charges of magnitude q , in a uniform,  |electrostatic_field|Electrostatic_Field|    , positioned in one place, the potential is:     : V -      the dipole moment itself is the operator     :   q      Since the particle is stationary, there is no translational kinetic energy of the dipole, so the Hamiltonian of the dipole is just the potential energy:     :   -  -q          For a magnetic dipole moment   in a uniform, magnetostatic field   , positioned in one place, the potential is:     : V -      Since the particle is stationary, there is no translational kinetic energy of the dipole, so the Hamiltonian of the dipole is just the potential energy:     :   -      For a  |Spin_½|Spin_½|  particle, the corresponding spin magnetic moment is: Physics of Atoms and Molecules, B.H. Bransden, C.J.Joachain, Longman, 1983,      :           where gs is the spin  |gyromagnetic_ratio|Gyromagnetic_Ratio|  , e is the electron charge,   is the  |spin_operator|Spin_Pauli_Matrices_And_Spin_Operators|  vector, whose components are the  |Pauli_matrices|Pauli_Matrices| , hence     :                 For a particle with mass m and charge q in an electromagnetic field, described by the  |scalar_potential|Scalar_Potential|    and  |vector_potential|Vector_Potential|    , there are two parts to the Hamiltonian to substitute for. The canonical momentum operator   , which includes a contribution from the   field and fulfils the  |canonical_commutation_relation|Canonical_Commutation_Relation| , must be quantized;     :     + q  ,     where   is the  |kinetic_momentum|Kinetic_Momentum|  operator. The quantization prescription reads     :   -i  ,     so the corresponding kinetic energy operator is     :         2     and the potential energy, which is due to the   field, is given by     :   q  .     Casting all of these into the Hamiltonian gives     :       2 + q  .         In many systems, two or more energy eigenstates have the same energy. A simple example of this is a free particle, whose energy eigenstates have wavefunctions that are propagating plane waves. The energy of each of these plane waves is inversely proportional to the square of its  |wavelength|Wavelength| . A wave propagating in the x direction is a different state from one propagating in the y direction, but if they have the same wavelength, then their energies will be the same. When this happens, the states are said to be degenerate.     It turns out that  |degeneracy|Degenerate_Energy_Levels|  occurs whenever a nontrivial  |unitary_operator|Unitary_Matrix|  U  |commutes|Commutation_Relation|  with the Hamiltonian. To see this, suppose that  a  is an energy eigenket. Then U a  is an energy eigenket with the same eigenvalue, since     : UH  a  U Ea a  Ea H   .     Since U is nontrivial, at least one pair of  a  and U a  must represent distinct states. Therefore, H has at least one pair of degenerate energy eigenkets. In the case of the free particle, the unitary operator which produces the symmetry is the  |rotation_operator|Rotation_Operator| , which rotates the wavefunctions by some angle while otherwise preserving their shape.     The existence of a symmetry operator implies the existence of a  |conserved|Conservation_Law|  observable. Let G be the Hermitian generator of U :     : U I - i   G + O       It is straightforward to show that if U commutes with H , then so does G :     : 0       Therefore,     :                 0.       In obtaining this result, we have used the Schrödinger equation, as well as its  |dual|Bra–Ket_Notation| ,     :    H - i         Thus, the  |expected_value|Expected_Value|  of the observable G is conserved for any state of the system. In the case of the free particle, the conserved quantity is the  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum| .          |Hamiltons|William_Rowan_Hamilton|  equations in classical  |Hamiltonian_mechanics|Hamiltonian_Mechanics|  have a direct analogy in quantum mechanics. Suppose we have a set of basis states   , which need not necessarily be eigenstates of the energy. For simplicity, we assume that they are discrete, and that they are orthonormal, i.e.,     :   n   n         Note that these basis states are assumed to be independent of time. We will assume that the Hamiltonian is also independent of time.     The instantaneous state of the system at time t ,       , can be expanded in terms of these basis states:     :        an  n      where     : an   n           The coefficients an are  |complex|Complex_Number|  variables. We can treat them as coordinates which specify the state of the system, like the position and momentum coordinates which specify a classical system. Like classical coordinates, they are generally not constant in time, and their time dependence gives rise to the time dependence of the system as a whole.     The expectation value of the Hamiltonian of this state, which is also the mean energy, is     :   H             a an   n H n       where the last step was obtained by expanding       in terms of the basis states.     Each an actually corresponds to two independent degrees of freedom, since the variable has a real part and an imaginary part. We now perform the following trick: instead of using the real and imaginary parts as the independent variables, we use an and its  |complex_conjugate|Complex_Conjugate|  an . With this choice of independent variables, we can calculate the  |partial_derivative|Partial_Derivative|      :       an   n H n       n H         By applying  |Schrödingers_equation|Schrödingers_Equation| .
