      The Marvel Universe is a  |fictional|Fictional|  universe where the stories in most  |American_comic_book|American_Comic_Book|  titles and other media published by  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics|  take place. Super-teams such as the  |Avengers|Avengers| , the  |X-Men|X-Men| , the  |Fantastic_Four|Fantastic_Four| , the  |Guardians_of_the_Galaxy|Guardians_Of_The_Galaxy| , the  |Defenders|Defenders| , the  |Inhumans|Inhumans| , the  |Eternals|Eternals| , and many Marvel superheroes live in this universe, including characters such as  |Spider-Man|Spider-Man| ,  |Iron_Man|Iron_Man| ,  |Captain_America|Captain_America| ,  |Thor|Thor| ,  |Wolverine|Wolverine| , the  |Hulk|Hulk| ,  |Black_Panther|Black_Panther| ,  |Doctor_Strange|Doctor_Strange| ,  |Scarlet_Witch|Scarlet_Witch| ,  |Quicksilver|Quicksilver| ,  |Captain_Marvel|Carol_Danvers| ,  |Ant-Man|Ant-Man| ,  |the_Wasp|Wasp| , the  |Punisher|Punisher| ,  |Daredevil|Daredevil| ,  |Jessica_Jones|Jessica_Jones| ,  |Luke_Cage|Luke_Cage| ,  |Iron_Fist|Iron_Fist| ,  |Deadpool|Deadpool| ,  |Blade|Blade| ,  |Ghost_Rider|Ghost_Rider| ,  |Moon_Knight|Moon_Knight| ,  |Storm|Storm| ,  |Silver_Surfer|Silver_Surfer| ,  |Adam_Warlock|Adam_Warlock| ,  |Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi| ,  |Nova|Nova| , and numerous others.     The Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a  |multiverse|Multiverse|  consisting of thousands of separate universes, all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, Marvel universes . In this context, Marvel Universe is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel  |continuity|Continuity| , which is known as  Earth-616  or currently as Earth Prime.         Though the concept of a  |shared_universe|Shared_Universe|  was not new or unique to  |comics|Comic_Book|  in 1961, writer/editor  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee| , together with several artists including  |Jack_Kirby|Jack_Kirby|  and  |Steve_Ditko|Steve_Ditko| , created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters growth and change. Headline characters in one title would make cameo or guest appearances in other books. Eventually many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the  |Avengers|Avengers| . This was not the first time that Marvels characters had interacted with one another   |Namor_the_Sub-Mariner|Namor|  and the  |Original_Human_Torch|Human_Torch|  had been rivals when Marvel was Timely comics  but it was the first time that the comic book publishers characters seemed to share a world.  |Marvel_Mystery_Comics|Marvel_Mystery_Comics| . Marvel Comics 1 The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| ; by contrast, many  |DC_heroes|Dc_Universe|  live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.     Over time, a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a  |Multiverse|Parallel_Universe|  resembling  |DCs_parallel_worlds|Dc_Multiverse| ; this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap. What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally have no effect on what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel-created universe. However, storywriters would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternative universe.     In 1982, Marvel published the mini-series  Contest of Champions , in which all of the major heroes in existence at the time were gathered together to deal with one threat. This was Marvels first miniseries. Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters; these biographies were a precursor to Marvels series of reference material,  The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe , which followed shortly on the heels of Contest of Champions.          The Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world. Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities , same historical events , and so on; however, it also contains many other fictional elements: countries such as  |Wakanda|Wakanda|  and  |Latveria|Latveria|  and organizations like the espionage agency  |S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.|  and its enemy,  |HYDRA|Hydra|  and  |A.I.M.|Advanced_Idea_Mechanics|  In 2009 Marvel officially described its worlds geography in a two-part miniseries, the Marvel Atlas. . Marvel.com News     Most importantly, the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  and  |fantasy|Fantasy|  concepts, with writers adding more continuously. Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe.  Monsters also play a more prominent role with east Asian origins of magical incantation, outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe. One such case is  |Fin_Fang_Foom|Fin_Fang_Foom|  arising from the ashes of tantric magic. Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of  |superhero|Superhero| es and  |supervillains|Supervillains| , who have gained their powers by any of these means.     Comparatively little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world, owing to the serial nature of storytelling, with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one, while a whole month has passed by in real time . Marvels major heroes were created in the 1960s, but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has most recently been identified as thirteen years. The Thing 13, July 2006; Civil War Battle Damage Report, March 2007 Consequently, the settings of some events which were contemporary when written have to be updated every few years in order to make sense in this  |floating_timeline|Floating_Timeline| . Thus, the events of previous stories are considered to have happened within a certain number of years prior to the publishing date of the current issue. For example,  |Spider-Mans|Spider-Man|  high school graduation was published in Amazing Spider-Man 28 , his college graduation in Amazing Spider-Man 185 , and his high school reunion in Marvel Knights: Spider-Man 7 . Because of the floating timeline, where stories refer to real-life historic events, these references are later ignored or rewritten to suit current sensibilities. For instance, the origin of  |Iron_Man|Iron_Man|  was changed in a 2004 storyline to refer to the  |War_on_Terror|War_On_Terror|  in  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| , Iron Man vol. 4 1 whereas the original Iron Man stories had referred to the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  in  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  similarity  |The_Punishers|The_Punisher|  backstory has also been changed as well.      |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics|  itself exists as a company within the Marvel Universe, and versions of people such as  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  and  |Jack_Kirby|Jack_Kirby|  have appeared in some of the stories, whereas characters like Steve Rogers, , have worked for Marvel. The Marvel of this reality publishes comics that adapt the actual adventures of the superheroes ; many of these are licensed with the permission of the heroes themselves, who customarily donate their share of profits to charity. Additionally, the  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics|  Universe is also said to exist in the Marvel Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said with respect to the DC Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies.     Pop culture characters such as  |Dracula|Dracula|  and  |Frankenstein|Frankensteins_Monster|  actually exist in the Marvel Universe. This is usually justified as a second hand account of events as told to credited authors  |Bram_Stoker|Bram_Stoker|  and  |Mary_Shelley|Mary_Shelley|  although the general public continues to believe them as fictional.  |Robert_E._Howards|Robert_E._Howard| |Conan_the_Barbarian|Conan| ,  |Red_Sonja|Red_Sonja| ,  |Kull_the_Conqueror|Kull| , and  |Solomon_Kane|Solomon_Kane|  also have real life existences in the Marvel Universe. The  |Hyborian_Era|Hyborian_Era|  of Conan and Kull is considered part of Earth-616 pre-recorded history. However, they rarely encounter modern Marvel superhero characters. This is most likely possible due to the uncertain legal status of Howards works prior to 2006 when they became public domain. As of 2019, Conan the Barbarian as well as Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane have been firmly integrated thanks to Marvel regaining the publishing rights to the characters. Other licensed works that have been incorporated into the Marvel Universe include  |Godzilla|Godzilla| ,  |Transformers|Transformers| ,  2001: A Space Odyssey  ,  |ROM:_Spaceknight|Rom:_Spaceknight| , the  |Micronauts|Micronauts| , and the  |Shogun_Warriors|Shogun_Warriors| . In most cases, such material is either restricted from use after the license expires or the characters redesigned or renamed to avoid infringement.       Within the fictional history of the Marvel Universe, the tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight or commit evil had long existed, but it came into prominence during the days of the American  |Wild_West|Wild_West|  with heroes such as the  |Phantom_Rider|Phantom_Rider| . During the 20th century, the tradition was reinvigorated by  |Captain_America|Captain_America|  and the  |Invaders|Invaders|  in the 1940s, who fought for the  |Allies_of_World_War_II|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii| .     Marvels most prominent heroes were created during the  |Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books|Silver_Age_Of_Comic_Books|  in the 1960s to early 1970s, including  |Spider-Man|Spider-Man| ,  |Iron_Man|Iron_Man| ,  |Thor|Thor| ,  |Hulk|Hulk| ,  |Doctor_Strange|Doctor_Strange| ,  |Daredevil|Daredevil| ,  |Ant-Man|Hank_Pym|  and the  |Wasp|Wasp|  ,  |Black_Widow|Black_Widow| ,  |Hawkeye|Hawkeye| ,  |Quicksilver|Quicksilver| ,  |Scarlet_Witch|Scarlet_Witch| , the  |Vision|Vision| ,  |Wonder_Man|Wonder_Man| ,  |Hercules|Hercules| ,  |Ka-Zar|Ka-Zar| ,  |Groot|Groot| ,  |Nick_Fury|Nick_Fury| ,  |Black_Panther|Black_Panther| ,  |Mar-Vell|Captain_Marvel|  ,  |Carol_Danvers|Carol_Danvers|  ,  |Falcon|Falcon| ,  |Black_Knight|Black_Knight| ,  |Silver_Surfer|Silver_Surfer| ,  |Jane_Foster|Jane_Foster|  ,  |Angel|Warren_Worthington_Iii| ,  |Beast|Beast| ,  |Cyclops|Cyclops| ,  |Iceman|Iceman| ,  |Jean_Grey|Jean_Grey|  ,  |Professor_X|Professor_X| ,  |Polaris|Polaris| ,  |Havok|Havok| ,  |Mister_Fantastic|Mister_Fantastic| ,  |Invisible_Woman|Invisible_Woman| , the  |Human_Torch|Human_Torch|  and the  |Thing|Thing| . Other notable heroes from the  |Bronze|Bronze_Age_Of_Comic_Books|  and  |Modern_Ages|Modern_Age_Of_Comic_Books|  from the mid 1970s to the early 1990s include  |Wolverine|Wolverine| ,  |Storm|Storm| ,  |Colossus|Colossus| ,  |Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler| ,  |Banshee|Banshee| ,  |Luke_Cage|Luke_Cage|  ,  |Iron_Fist|Iron_Fist| ,  |Misty_Knight|Misty_Knight| ,  |Colleen_Wing|Colleen_Wing| ,  |White_Tiger|White_Tiger|  ,  |Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi| ,  |Tigra|Tigra| ,  |Jessica_Drew|Spider-Woman|  ,  |Valkyrie|Valkyrie| ,  |Ghost_Rider|Ghost_Rider|  ,  |Hellstorm|Daimon_Hellstrom| ,  |Satana|Satana| ,  |Man-Thing|Man-Thing| ,  |Blade|Blade| ,  |Morbius_the_Vampire|Morbius,_The_Living_Vampire| ,  |Howard_the_Duck|Howard_The_Duck| ,  |Monica_Rambeau|Monica_Rambeau|  ,  |Moondragon|Moondragon| ,  |Drax_the_Destroyer|Drax_The_Destroyer| ,  |Star-Lord|Star-Lord| ,  |Gamora|Gamora| ,  |Rocket_Raccoon|Rocket_Raccoon| , the  |Punisher|Punisher| ,  |Moon_Knight|Moon_Knight| ,  |Mockingbird|Mockingbird| , the  |Eternals|Eternals| ,  |War_Machine|War_Machine| ,  |Nova|Nova|  ,  |Adam_Warlock|Adam_Warlock| ,  |Power_Pack|Power_Pack| ,  |Psylocke|Psylocke| ,  |Scott_Lang|Ant-Man|  ,  |Black_Cat|Black_Cat| ,  |Silver_Sable|Silver_Sable| ,  |Kitty_Pryde|Kitty_Pryde|  ,  |Emma_Frost|Emma_Frost|  ,  |She-Hulk|She-Hulk| ,  |Cloak_&_Dagger|Cloak_And_Dagger| ,  |Captain_Britain|Captain_Britain| ,  |Squirrel_Girl|Squirrel_Girl| ,  |Elektra|Elektra| , the  |New_Mutants|New_Mutants| , the  |New_Warriors|New_Warriors| ,  |Legion|Legion| ,  |Thunderbird|Thunderbird| ,  |Rogue|Rogue|  and  |Jubilee|Jubilee| . Some of Marvels more recent creations from the mid-to-late 1990s, 2000s and 2010s such as  |Deadpool|Deadpool| ,  |Gambit|Gambit| ,  |Cable|Cable| ,  |Domino|Domino| ,  |Blink|Blink| , the  |Thunderbolts|Thunderbolts| , the  |Runaways|Runaways| , the modern  |Guardians_of_the_Galaxy|Guardians_Of_The_Galaxy| , the modern  |Defenders|Defenders|  ,  |X-23|X-23|  ,  |Shuri|Shuri| , the  |Dora_Milaje|Dora_Milaje| ,  |Daisy_Johnson|Daisy_Johnson|  ,  |Phil_Coulson|Phil_Coulson| ,  |Melinda_May|Melinda_May| , the  |Winter_Soldier|Bucky_Barnes| ,  |Maria_Hill|Maria_Hill| ,  |Miles_Morales|Miles_Morales|  ,  |Hope_van_Dyne|Hope_Pym|  ,  |Cassandra_Lang|Cassandra_Lang|  , the  |Stepford_Cuckoos|Stepford_Cuckoos| ,  |Amadeus_Cho|Amadeus_Cho|  ,  |Kamala_Khan|Kamala_Khan|  ,  |Kate_Bishop|Hawkeye|  ,  |Moon_Girl|Moon_Girl| ,  |America_Chavez|Miss_America|  ,  |Robbie_Reyes|Ghost_Rider|  ,  |Ironheart|Ironheart|  and  |Spider-Gwen|Spider-Woman|   have become popular characters in their own right. Unlike the  |DC_Universe|Dc_Universe| , few of Marvels 1940s characters have risen to prominence in modern publications;  |Captain_America|Captain_America|  is one exception, and to a lesser extent, his contemporary,  |Namor_the_Sub-Mariner|Namor| , primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and to the Marvel Universe during the 1960s.     Prominent teams of superheroes include the  |Avengers|Avengers| , the  |X-Men|X-Men| , the  |Fantastic_Four|Fantastic_Four| , the  |Defenders|Defenders| , the  |Inhumans|Inhumans| ,  |S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.| , the  |Howling_Commandos|Howling_Commandos| ,  |Guardians_of_the_Galaxy|Guardians_Of_The_Galaxy| , the  |Runaways|Runaways| , the  |Midnight_Sons|Midnight_Sons|  and the  |Thunderbolts|Thunderbolts| . All these groups have varying lineups; the Avengers have included Marvels major heroes as members at one time or another. The X-Men are a team of  |mutants|Mutant|  led by  |Professor_X|Professor_X|  and include many of Marvels most popular characters, such as  |Wolverine|Wolverine|  and others. The Fantastic Four are viewed as Marvels First Family of superheroes, usually consisting of  |Mister_Fantastic|Mister_Fantastic| , the  |Invisible_Woman|Invisible_Woman| , the  |Human_Torch|Human_Torch|  and the  |Thing|Thing| , as well as siblings  |Franklin|Franklin_Richards|  and  |Valeria_Richards|Valeria_Richards| . The Defenders were an ad-hoc team usually brought together by  |Doctor_Strange|Doctor_Strange|  which has included the  |Hulk|Hulk| ,  |Namor_the_Sub-Mariner|Namor|  and the  |Silver_Surfer|Silver_Surfer| , while the most recent incarnation of the team consists of street-level New York City heroes  |Daredevil|Daredevil| ,  |Jessica_Jones|Jessica_Jones| ,  |Luke_Cage|Luke_Cage|  and  |Iron_Fist|Iron_Fist| . The Guardians of the Galaxy include Marvels cosmic characters such as  |Star-Lord|Star-Lord| ,  |Gamora|Gamora| ,  |Drax_the_Destroyer|Drax_The_Destroyer| ,  |Groot|Groot|  and  |Rocket_Raccoon|Rocket_Raccoon| , but the team has also introduced other heroes into the roster such as  |Kitty_Pryde|Kitty_Pryde| , the Silver Surfer, the Thing and  |Nova|Nova| . The Inhumans are a royal family comprising  |Black_Bolt|Black_Bolt| ,  |Medusa|Medusa| ,  |Crystal|Crystal| ,  |Gorgon|Gorgon| ,  |Triton|Triton| ,  |Lockjaw|Lockjaw|  and  |Karnak|Karnak| , who rule the city of Attilan. The Runaways are a group of teenagers and a dinosaur consisting of  |Alex_Wilder|Alex_Wilder| ,  |Nico_Minoru|Nico_Minoru| ,  |Karolina_Dean|Karolina_Dean| ,  |Chase_Stein|Chase_Stein| ,  |Molly_Hayes|Molly_Hayes| ,  |Gert_Yorkes|Gert_Yorkes|  and  |Old_Lace|Old_Lace|  who rebel against their evil parents known as  |The_Pride|The_Pride| . The Midnight Sons consist of supernatural heroes such as  |Blade|Blade| ,  |Ghost_Rider|Ghost_Rider| ,  |Elsa_Bloodstone|Elsa_Bloodstone| ,  |Hellstorm|Daimon_Hellstrom| ,  |Werewolf_by_Night|Werewolf_By_Night|  and  |Man-Thing|Man-Thing| . The Thunderbolts original incarnation were supervillains disgused as superheroes consisting of  |Citizen_V|Citizen_V|  ,  |MACH-IV|Abner_Jenkins|  ,  |Songbird|Songbird|  ,  |Moonstone|Karla_Sofen|  ,  |Techno/Ogre|Fixer_Paul_Norbert_Ebersol|  and  |Jolt|Jolt|  while the current incarnation of the team is made up of reformed supervillains working for the government:  |Deadpool|Deadpool| , the  |Punisher|Punisher| ,  |Red_Hulk|Red_Hulk| , the  |Winter_Soldier|Bucky_Barnes|  and the  |Ghost|Ghost| . Although teams of supervillains are few and far between, notable examples include the  |Masters_of_Evil|Masters_Of_Evil| , the  |Brotherhood_of_Mutants|Brotherhood_Of_Mutants| , the  |Sinister_Six|Sinister_Six| , the  |Frightful_Four|Frightful_Four| , the  |Black_Order|Black_Order| , the  |Annihilation_Wave|Annihilation_Wave| , the  |Starforce|Starforce|  and the  |Cabal|Cabal| .       Most of the superhumans in Marvels Earth owe their powers to the  |celestials|Celestial| , cosmic entities who visited Earth millions of years ago and experimented on our  |prehistoric|Prehistoric|  ancestors . This resulted in the creation of two  |hidden_races|Hidden_Races| , the godlike  |Eternals|Eternals|  and the genetically unstable  |Deviants|Deviant| , in addition to giving some humans an x-factor in their genes, which sometimes activates naturally, resulting in sometimes superpowered, sometimes disfigured individuals called  |mutants|Mutant| . Others require other factors  for their powers to come forth. Depending on the genetic profile, individuals who are exposed to different chemicals or radiation will often suffer death or injury, while in others it will cause superhuman abilities to manifest. With the exception of  |psionic|Psionic|  abilities, these powers are usually random; rarely do two people have exactly the same set of powers. It is not clear why the Celestials did this, although it is known that they continue to observe humanitys evolution. A Marvel series titled  Earth X  explored one possible reason for this: that superhumans are meant to protect a Celestial embryo that grows inside the Earth against any planetary threats and have done so for eons. An X-Men villain known as  |Vargas|Vargas|  claims to be a new direction in human evolution, as he is born with superpowers even though his genetic profile said he was an ordinary human being. The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers.     Other possible origins for superhuman powers include  |magic|Magic| ,  |genetic_manipulation|Genetic_Engineering|  and/or  |bionic|Bionics|  implants. Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand-to-hand combat training or advanced technological equipment. In the Marvel Universe, technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world; this is due to unique individuals of genius intelligence, such as Reed Richards  of the Fantastic Four. However, most of the really advanced devices  are too expensive for the common citizen, and are usually in the hands of government organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., or powerful criminal organizations like  |A.I.M|Advanced_Idea_Mechanics| . One major company producing these devices is Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark , but there are others. Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races, aliens, or  |time_travel|Time_Travel| ers like  |Kang_the_Conqueror|Kang_The_Conqueror| , who is known to have influenced the  |robotics|Robotics|  industry in the past.     In superhumans the energy required for their superpowers either comes from within using their own body as a source, or if the demand of energy exceeds what their body is capable to deliver, comes from another source. In most cases, this other source seems to be what is called the universal psionic field , which they are able to tap into. Sometimes they are connected to another source, and more rarely they are even a host for it.     Marvel tries to explain most superpowers and their sources scientifically , usually through the use of fictional science-like concepts, such as:   Energy Absorption ; the cells in the body have the same function as batteries, being charged with energy that comes from an outer source. This is most often seen in gamma exposed individuals such as the Hulk, who get their powers from this stored energy. The powers will remain as long as the energy is present, and can even be increased by filling the batteries even more. If the energy is emptied, the powers will fade away.   The  |Power_Primordial|Power_Primordial|  is a leftover force from Big Bang and is controlled by the  |Elders_of_the_Universe|Elders_Of_The_Universe| .   The  |Phoenix_Force|Phoenix_Force|  is a force of incredible power. It channels energy from life itself and has been shown to favor  |mutant|Mutant| |telepaths|Telepaths|  like  |Jean_Grey|Jean_Grey| .   Psionic energy, which is assumed to be an invisible, unknown form of energy generated by all living brains that has the ability to manipulate other forms of matter and energy.   Universal psionic field is a force present everywhere in the universe, but only those with abilities to connect to it can make use of its energy.   Enigma Force is suspected to be connected to the Microverse, and is also the source to the Uni-Power, which transforms an individual into Captain Universe.   Extradimensional space: dimensions that can be tapped in order to pull mass from them or taken away from those objects and be stored in those pocket dimensions to be retrieved later. This is how characters like the Hulk can grow and shrink with no visible absorption of mass. A type of subatomic particles called Pym Particles can be used for these effects. The change in mass can be in the form of a density change instead, allowing a character to become harder or  |incorporeal|Incorporeal| . Some characters can seem to transform themselves into unliving substances, or even pure energy, by storing their bodies in extradimensional space and replacing them with bodies made from matter or energy from that dimension, while their souls remain on Earth, controlling their new body. Travel into other dimensions can also be used as a way to  |teleport|Teleportation|  by re-entering the Earth dimension at a different point from the exiting one.   The  |Darkforce|Darkforce|  is an unknown, dark substance from another dimension  that can be summoned and manipulated in many ways: to create impenetrable darkness, to solidify it in various forms, and to absorb the life energy from living beings . The Darkforce can also be used to travel to and from its home dimension, but this is dangerous to all except those with Darkforce powers. Some believe that the Darkforce is sentient and sometimes has an evil influence on those who use it. Various heroes and villains have versions of Darkforce powers, including  |Darkstar|Darkstar| , the first  |Blackout|Blackout| , the  |Shroud|Shroud| ,  |Cloak|Cloak_And_Dagger| ,  |Doorman|Doorman|  and  |Quagmire|Quagmire|  . Cloak seems to be the prime portal to the Darkforce, however.   The  |Lightforce|Lightforce|  is the opposite of the Darkforce: a form of energy that resembles light and also comes from its own dimension, but has healing effects on living beings It is unknown if it might be sentient. Cloaks partner,  |Dagger|Cloak_And_Dagger|  seems to be the Living Lights main  |Avatar|Avatar| .   The  |Power_Cosmic|Power_Cosmic|  is a force that can alter reality, allowing the user to do whatever he or she wants , only being limited by how much cosmic energy the character can tap at a time. It seems to be part of the universe itself, and is most prominently used by  |Galactus|Galactus|  and his  |heralds|Heralds_Of_Galactus| .   Magic also appears to be like a form of energy, except that it can defy the laws of physics naturally, and usually overrules ordinary science. However, it does have rules of its own to follow, which vary with the method of invocation, usually in the form of spoken spells. It appears to be present in everything, even living beings. All humans in the Marvel Universe have the ability to use magic, but only if properly trained. Most people are unaware that magic actually works. In addition, powerful magical beings from other dimensions have created specific, extremely powerful magical spells that they allow to be used by those  |sorcerers|Magician|  who invoke their names; one example is the trinity of beings called The  |Vishanti|Vishanti| , who serve as patrons to heroic sorcerers. At any given time, there is a sorcerer on Earth whose task is to protect the universe against extra-dimensional mystical invaders; this sorcerer is known as the  |Sorcerer_Supreme|Sorcerer_Supreme| , an office left empty since the death of  |Brother_Voodoo|Brother_Voodoo| , but most recently has been reinstated to  |Doctor_Strange|Doctor_Strange| . New AvengersDoctor Strange that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans. This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem, who can be divided into three camps: those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans , those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance , and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans. The latter often use the robots known as  |Sentinels|Sentinels|  as weapons. Certain species are regarded as  |subhuman|Untermensch| , like the  |Morlocks|Morlocks|  who lurk beneath New York City and have been discriminated against by the outside world because of their mutant deformities. The Morlocks have recently joined the terrorist organization Gene Nation.     In addition to mutants, Eternals and Deviants, several other intelligent races have existed secretly on Earth. These include: The  |Inhumans|Inhumans| , another genetically unstable race that was created by a  |Kree|Kree|  experiment long ago; The  |Subterraneans|Subterranea| , a race of humanoids adapted to living below the surface, created by the Deviants ; and  |Homo_mermanus|Homo_Mermanus| , a  |humanoid|Humanoid|  race of water-breathers that lives in Earths oceans. Most of these races have advanced technology but existed hidden from humanity until recent times. More variants of humanity can be found in the  |Savage_Land|Savage_Land|  Most of the Savage Land races have their origin from a group of primitive ape men who seems to have escaped the Celestial experiments whose influence is present in all modern Homo sapiens. Other leftovers from the era where primitive humanoids walked the earth still exist, such as the altered  |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  known as  |Missing_Link|Missing_Link| , an old enemy of the Hulk.          The Marvel Universe also contains hundreds of intelligent alien races. Earth has interacted with many of them because a major  |hyperspace|Hyperspace|  warp happens to exist in the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| .     The three major space empires are:   the  |Kree|Kree| , who rule the Kree Galaxy    the  |Skrulls|Skrull| , who rule the Skrull Galaxy    the  |Shiar|Shiar| , who rule the Shiar Galaxy    The three are often in direct or indirect conflict, which occasionally involve Earth people; in particular, the Kree and Skrulls are ancient enemies, and the  |Kree-Skrull_War|Kree-Skrull_War|  has involved humans on several occasions.     The Skrulls have also been known to be in a long and consistent war against the Majesdanians, who live in a milky planet named Majesdane. Runaways |The_Pride|Pride|  had been kicked out for criminal activities; the two travelled to Earth, where Frank and Leslie stopped the war against Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls the location of Majesdane, which was hidden behind the corona of a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf| . The war had gone on for sixteen years minimum; it ended abruptly after the Skrulls shot a barrage of missiles at Majesdane, who retaliated.     Another prominent alien race is The  |Watchers|Watcher| , immortal and wise beings who watch over the Marvel Universe and have taken a sacred vow not to intervene in events, though the Watcher assigned to Earth,  |Uatu|Uatu| , has violated this oath on several occasions.     The  |Elders_of_the_Universe|Elders_Of_The_Universe|  are ancient aliens who have often had great impact on many worlds, for billions of years, acting alone or as a group. A power called Power Primordial is channeled through them.     Many other races exist, and have formed an Intergalactic Council to have their say on matters that affect them all, such as interference from Earth humans in their affairs.       Also abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as  |gods|Gods| ,  |demons|Demons|  and  |vampires|Vampire| . The gods of most  |polytheistic|Polytheistic|  pantheons are actually powerful, immortal human-like races residing in other dimensions who visited Earth in ancient times, and became the basis of many legends. However, all of these gods share a common ancestry and connection to Earth due to  |Gaea|Gaea| , the primeval  |Elder_Goddess|Elder_Gods|  that infused her life essence into all living things on Earth. Gaea is known by various names and appearances in other cultures and among the various pantheons, but shes the same being. As a result, shes a member of every polytheistic pantheon of gods worshipped by humans. Besides mythological gods, many deities made up by Marvel writers exist as well, such as the Dark Gods, enemies of the  |Asgardians|Asgard| . The Dark Gods are a race of gods that have been worshipped by  |extraterrestrial|Extraterrestrials_In_Fiction|  races. Well known alien races like the  |Shiar|Shiar|  and  |Skrulls|Skrull|  also have beings they worship as gods, though little has been revealed about them.     Many persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history; in particular, none of the ones claiming to be major figures from  |Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian|  beliefs has turned out to be the real article, although a number of angels have appeared in recent years, as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise, proving that some form of  |Heaven|Heaven|  and  |Hell|Hell|  do exist in this Universe, seemingly like those in keeping with common real world religious belief. Similarly,  |demons|Demons|  are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe. Some of the most powerful are  |Blackheart|Blackheart| ,  |Mephisto|Mephisto| ,  |Nightmare|Nightmare| ,  |Satannish|Satannish| , and  |Zom|Zom| . There are also powerful benevolent mystical entities such as The  |Vishanti|Vishanti| ; or amoral and malevolent entities who are not truly demonic in nature, such as  |Dormammu|Dormammu|  and  |The_Octessence|Demons_In_The_Marvel_Universethe_Octessence| , or ones heavily drawing upon the mythologies of  |H.P._Lovecraft|H.P._Lovecraft|  and  |Robert_E._Howard|Robert_E._Howard| . Some supernatural beings, entities and human characters created by Lovecraft & Howard, who were friends and influenced each others work, have been adapted by Marvel and include  |Abdul_Alhazred|Abdul_Alhazred| , Tarzan vol.1 15 Marvel Comics Presents vol.1 62 Marvel Comics Presents vol.1 152  |Conan_the_Barbarian|Conan_The_Barbarian|  Conan the Barbarian vol.1 1  |Nyarlathotep|Nyarlathotep|  Journey Into Mystery vol.2 4 and  |Set|Father_Set| . Marvel Feature vol.1 6 Some deities or demonic beings that are original characters of Marvel have been heavily influenced by these mythologies, such as  |Shuma-Gorath|Shuma-Gorath| . Marvel Premiere vol.1 10     Most of the current generation of gods have been revealed to be the descendants of the  |Elder_Goddess|Elder_Gods| |Gaea|Gaea| . The two most featured pantheons are the  |Asgardians|Norse_Mythology|   and the  |Olympians|Olympians|  . The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as the Council of Godheads and Council of Skyfathers. The gods were forced to stop meddling with humanity a thousand years ago by  |the_Celestials|Celestial| , and most people today believe them to be fictional. There are other pantheons that have been depicted in the Marvel Universe that are still actively worshipped in the real world including those worshipped by the  |Aboriginal|Aboriginal_Australians|  inhabitants of  |Australia|Australia| , the  |gods|Hindu_Deities|  of  |Hinduism|Hinduism| , the  |Shinto|Shinto|  gods and the gods of  |Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrianism| . These deities are rarely depicted, however. One such appearance generated a good deal of controversy as the depiction involved a fight between  |Marvels_incarnation_of_Thor|Thor|  and the Hindu god  |Shiva|Shiva| , a battle which Shiva lost. Thor vol.1 301 As Shiva is one of the principal deities of Hindu religion, his defeat offended some followers of Hinduism. This battle was  |retcon|Retcon| ned later as having been the deity  |Indra|Indra| , the Hindu god of thunder, who was posing as Shiva, that met defeat. Thor Annual 10 In order to avoid offending believers of still active religions, Marvel features such deities as characters in the background or who make very brief cameo appearances.     Marvels depiction of vampires has been heavily influenced by various interpretations of popular media, such as  |Bram_Stokers|Bram_Stoker| |Dracula|Dracula| . As with many other supernatural creatures, Marvel entwined the origin of vampires with aspects of the mythologies created by Lovecraft and Howard. They were originally created by magical rites performed by priests of Atlantis prior to the Great Cataclysm that destroyed much of the world with  |Varnae|Varnae|  becoming the first vampire. Marvel would depict vampires as frequent antagonists during the  |Hyborian_Age|Hyborian_Age|  to Howard characters such as  |Kull|Kull_Of_Atlantis|  and Conan. In recent years, Marvels depiction of vampires has altered greatly by creating various subspecies of vampires that exist in  |clans|Clan|  that greatly differ in appearance and belief. All vampires are depicted with varying degrees of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and accelerated healing. Many are capable of transforming into animals such as bats or wolves, some can transform into a mist like substance; some of the most powerful are capable of controlling the weather to a somewhat limited degree. All vampires must ingest blood in order to maintain their survival and physical vitality. So long as they do so regularly, they cease to age and are immune to diseases. They retain the well known vulnerabilities common to vampires in other media interpretations including sunlight, garlic, religious icons and weapons made of silver. Vampires can be killed by a wooden stake driven through the heart, though they return to life if the stake is removed. Vampires are highly allergic to silver and can be killed with it. While they normally heal rapidly, injuries inflicted by silver weapons heal at a much slower rate if the injuries arent fatal. Vampires can also be killed by decapitation or being set on fire, with burning them to ashes and then scattering the ashes being the most effective means of ensuring their demise.       The  |cosmic_entities|Cosmic_Entity|  are beings of unbelievably great levels of power who exist to perform duties that maintain the existence of the universe. Most do not care at all about lesser beings such as humans, and as a consequence their acts are recurrently dangerous to mortals. When dire threats threaten the universe it is not uncommon for these beings to gather together to discuss the threat, and even act.     Most conceptual entities are simply interested in furthering their own essential function, or to keep the balance with an opposing force. However, certain cosmic entities, such as  |Galactus|Galactus| ,  |In-Betweener|In-Betweener| ,  |Maelstrom|Maelstrom| , or  |The_Stranger|Stranger|  have demonstrated personality, motivations, or even ambitions beyond their functions, but often maintain the perspective that morality is entirely relative, or that destroying civilisations of lesser beings is no more evil than if these beings destroyed an anthill. Others such as  |Uatu_the_Watcher|Uatu_The_Watcher| ,  |Eon|Eon| , or the  |Celestials|Celestial| |Ashema|Ashema_The_Listener|  and  |Tiamut|Dreaming_Celestial|  are aberrations in the sense of sympathising with and occasionally coming to the defense of humanity.     The Fulcrum is a comparatively recent addition to the hierarchy, that all cosmic entities allegedly serve, of a level of raw power stated to far surpass the might of the Watchers and the Celestials. Unlike most other entities it is capable of conscience, compassion, and even a sense of humour, and has stated that it wants other cosmic beings to develop such as well. He is a possible manifestation/ |avatar|Avatar|  of  |The_One_Above_All|The_One_Above_All| .     The  |Phoenix_Force|Phoenix_Force|  first received personification in  |Jean_Grey|Jean_Grey| . The Force is composed of the psionic energy from all living beings, past, present and future, and is an embodiment of rebirth and destructive transformation through burning away what doesnt work , and helped to restart the universe before the  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang| .       The Marvel Universe is part of a  |multiverse|Multiverse| , with various universes coexisting simultaneously usually without affecting each other directly. According to Reed Richards, the ultimate fate of the Multiverse is to perish in an all-encompassing heat death. New Avengers v.3, 1       The action of most Marvel Comics titles takes place in a  |continuity|Continuity|  known as  |Earth-616|Earth-616| .

The current edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe corroborates this.   Earth-96283 - An alternate reality in which Spider-Man is the only super hero on Earth.  |Sam_Raimis|Sam_Raimi|  Spider-Man trilogy created and takes place here.      In addition, multiple continuities are visited in the comic book series  What If ,  What The--?!   and  Exiles . The concept of a continuity is not the same as dimension or universe ; for example, characters like  |Mephisto|Mephisto|  and  |Dormammu|Dormammu|  hail from alternative dimensions and  |Galactus|Galactus|  from another  |universe|Universe| , but they all nevertheless belong to the  |Earth-616|Earth-616|  continuity . A continuity should also not be confused with an  |imprint|Imprint| ; for example, while the titles of some imprints, such as  |Ultimate_Marvel|Ultimate_Marvel| , take place in a different continuity, some or all publications in other imprints, such as  |Epic_Comics|Epic_Comics| ,  |Marvel_MAX|Marvel_Max| , and  |Marvel_UK|Marvel_Uk| , take place within the  |Earth-616|Earth-616|  continuity.       Within and sometimes between continuities, there exist a variety of dimensions, sometimes called pocket dimensions which typically are not depicted as separate continuities, but rather part of one, typically Earth-616. There are a score of such dimensions, ranging from the Earthlike to the totally alien. Some are magical in nature and others are scientific; some are inhabited and others are not. These include realities like the  |Microverse|Microverse| , the  |Darkforce_Dimension|Darkforce| ,  |Limbo|Limbo| , the  |Mojoverse|Mojoverse| , and many more. The  |Astral_Plane|Astral_Plane|  is a dimensional plane which is the source of telekinesis and various other psychic powers. It is a dimension created by the Elder Goddess  |Oshtur|Oshtur|  that is sometimes referred to as the Temple of Oshtur or the Realm of the Mind . Mystic Arcana: The Marvel Tarot One Shot, Marvel Publishing, Inc. 2007.     Despite various contradictions, the term, dimension is sometimes interchangeable with universe or reality. Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions, with each dimension differing from those of other realities; for example, the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to  |Earth-616|Earth-616|  characters. Such dimensions, such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are technically not pocket dimensions as they clearly reside completely outside the boundaries of the Marvel Universe, instead of within, as the former does.          One cannot normally alter the Marvel Universes history; if a time-traveller should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past, a  |divergent_universe|Parallel_Universe|  will simply branch out from the existing timeline, and the time-traveller will still return to his or her unaltered original universe. Those realities can also spawn realities of their own. There exists hundreds, probably thousands of such realities. It is unknown why this happens, though a warp known as the Nexus of All Realities exists in a swamp in the Florida of Earth-616. For the most part this does not matter, as most beings are unaware that this occurs, or even that their universes were recently born from another. However, individuals and organizations exist that try to monitor or manipulate the various realities. These include  |Immortus|Immortus| , the  |Captain_Britain_Corps|Captain_Britain| , the  |Time_Variance_Authority|Time_Variance_Authority| , the  |Timebreakers|Timebreaker| / |Exiles|Exiles| , and  |Kang_the_Conquerors|Kang_The_Conqueror|  forces. It has been shown to be possible to travel through time without creating a new alternative universe, instead altering events in the future, but this seems to have devastating and very far-reaching repercussions, as depicted in  |Marvel_1602|Marvel_1602|  .     Also, time itself passes much differently within the confines of the Marvel Universe than it does in the real world. Despite various characters having appeared within company publications for decades, few if any have aged to any appreciable degree. For example, the patriotic hero  |Captain_America|Captain_America|  was created in 1941 but stopped appearing in titles soon after the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . The character was revived more than twenty years later, explained as having been frozen in a block of ice though believed to be dead, to lead Marvels latest team of superheroes the  |Avengers|Avengers| . This first Avengers team featured several characters that would go on to be some of the companys most famous and most popular. Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades, they have been portrayed as having aged little or none at all.     Naturally this tendency is purely due to story conveniences , and mainly that the fictional continuity has been maintained and expanded far beyond what  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  and others originally planned or hoped for. Hence, the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years, such as the graduation of  |Spider-Man|Spider-Man| ; and what started as children or teenaged characters, such as  |Kitty_Pryde|Kitty_Pryde| ,  |Franklin_Richards|Franklin_Richards| ,  |Valeria_Richards|Valeria_Richards| ,  |Power_Pack|Power_Pack| , or the  |New_Mutants|New_Mutants|  are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates , whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all. This recurrently creates inherently contradictory effects, as events are routinely described to have happened several years ago, even in cases when this would mean that some of the involved characters would have been toddlers. Different approaches also exist regarding allowing second-generation descendants of heroes or villains, fully grown over 18 years after an event , whereas other books, such as  |Young_Allies|Young_Allies_Heroic_Age|  use the inherent contradiction to debunk similar claims. If a past storyline wherein a direct depictions of a then-current president or similar is referred to in a later era, it tends to become updated accordingly, sometimes with an in-joke acknowledgement.     A more recent explanation was given by Galactus to the Ultimates, namely that some important events - for instance, the creation of the Fantastic Four or the Avengers - have a gravity all their own and warp time around them, causing the timeline to subtly change to accommodate this. Ultimates 5          While the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non-fictional universe comic book readers inhabit, for all intents and purposes the  |Local_Group|Local_Group|  is the universe; practically all action takes place in it. The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda galaxy, the Kree Empire in the Magellan clouds which are satellites of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth of course is found, while the Shi´ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies ; frequently, these three empires are quoted as the main political powers in the universe . Similarly, the Local Group seemed to be the only affected area when the  |Annihilation_Wave|Annihilation_Wave|  cut its bloody swath across the universe .       Four  |role-playing_games|Role-Playing_Game|  have been set in the Marvel Universe:      Marvel Super Heroes      Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game      Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game      Marvel Heroic Roleplaying  .
