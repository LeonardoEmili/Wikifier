An anthem is a  |musical_composition|Musical_Composition|  of  |celebration|Wikt:Celebration| , usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the  |national_anthems|National_Anthem|  of  |countries|Country| . Originally, and in  |music_theory|Music_Theory|  and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred  |choral_work|Choral_Music|   and still more particularly to a specific form of  |Anglican_church_music|Anglican_Church_Music| .            Anthem is derived from the  |Greek|Ancient_Greek_Language|    via  |Old_English|Old_English|  . Both words originally referred to  |antiphons|Antiphon| , a  |call-and-response|Call_And_Response|  style of singing. The adjectival form is anthemic .       Anthems were originally a form of  |liturgical_music|Liturgical_Music| . In the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , the  |rubric|Rubric|  appoints them to follow the third  |collect|Collect|  at morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the  |British_coronation_service|Coronation_Of_The_British_Monarch| . The words are selected from  |Holy_Scripture|Holy_Scripture|  or in some cases from the  |Liturgy|Liturgy|  and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of  |psalm|Psalm|  or  |hymn_tunes|Hymn_Tune| . Being written for a trained  |choir|Choir|  rather than the congregation, the Anglican anthem is analogous to the  |motet|Motet|  of the  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  and  |Lutheran_Church|Lutheran_Church| es but represents an essentially English  |musical_form|Musical_Form| . Anthems may be described as  |verse|Verse_Anthem|  , full , or full with verse , depending on whether they are intended for  |solo|Solo| ists, the  |full_choir|Choir| , or both. Another way of describing an anthem is that it is a piece of music written specifically to fit a certain accompanying text, and it is often difficult to make any other text fit that same melodic arrangement. It also often changes melody and/or meter, frequently multiple times within a single song, and is sung straight through from start to finish, without repeating the melody for following verses like a normal song . An example of an anthem with multiple meter shifts a, fuguing, and repeated sections is Claremont ,  or Vital Spark of Heavnly Flame . Another well known example is  |William_Billings|William_Billings|  Easter Anthem ,  also known as The Lord Is Risen Indeed! after the opening lines. This anthem is still one of the more popular songs in the Sacred harp tune book.     The anthem developed as a replacement for the  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  votive antiphon commonly sung as an appendix to the main  |office|Liturgy_Of_The_Hours|  to the  |Blessed_Virgin_Mary|Blessed_Virgin_Mary|  or  |other_saints|Saint| . During the  |Elizabethan_period|Elizabethan_Period| , notable anthems were composed by  |Thomas_Tallis|Thomas_Tallis| ,  |William_Byrd|William_Byrd| , Tye, and Farrant but they were not mentioned in the  |Book_of_Common_Prayer|Book_Of_Common_Prayer|  until 1662 when the famous  |rubric|Rubric|  In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem first appears. Early anthems tended to be simple and  |homophonic|Homophony|  in texture, so that the words could be clearly heard. During the 17th century, notable anthems were composed by  |Orlando_Gibbons|Orlando_Gibbons| ,  |Henry_Purcell|Henry_Purcell| , and  |John_Blow|John_Blow| , with the  |verse_anthem|Verse_Anthem|  becoming the dominant musical form of the  |Restoration|English_Restoration| . In the 18th century, famed anthems were composed by Croft, Boyce,  |James_Kent|James_Kent| ,  |James_Nares|James_Nares| ,  |Benjamin_Cooke|Benjamin_Cooke| , and  |Samuel_Arnold|Samuel_Arnold| . In the 19th,  |Samuel_Sebastian_Wesley|Samuel_Sebastian_Wesley|  wrote anthems influenced by contemporary  |oratorio|Oratorio|  which stretch to several  |movements|Movement|  and last twenty minutes or longer. Later in the century,  |Charles_Villiers_Stanford|Charles_Villiers_Stanford|  used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure. Many anthems have been composed since this time, generally by  |organists|Organist|  rather than professional  |composers|Composer|  and often in a conservative style. Major composers have usually composed anthems in response to commissions and for special occasions. Examples include  |Edward_Elgars|Edward_Elgar|  1912 Great is the Lord and 1914 Give unto the Lord ,  |Benjamin_Brittens|Benjamin_Britten|  1943  |Rejoice_in_the_Lamb|Rejoice_In_The_Lamb|  , and, on a much smaller scale,  |Ralph_Vaughan_Williamss|Ralph_Vaughan_Williams|  1952 O Taste and See written for the coronation of  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii| . With the relaxation of the rule, in  |England|England|  at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertoire.       The word anthem is commonly used to describe any celebratory song or composition for a distinct group, as in  |national_anthems|National_Anthem| . Many  |pop_songs|Pop_Music|  are used as  |sports_anthems|Sports_Anthem| , notably including  |Queens|Queen| |We_Are_the_Champions|We_Are_The_Champions|  and  |We_Will_Rock_You|We_Will_Rock_You|  , and some sporting events have their own anthems, most notably including  |UEFA_Champions_League|Uefa_Champions_League_Anthem| . Further, some songs are artistically styled as anthems, whether or not they are used as such, including  |Marilyn_Mansons|Marilyn_Manson| |Irresponsible_Hate_Anthem|Irresponsible_Hate_Anthem|  ,  |Silverchairs|Silverchair| |Anthem_for_the_Year_2000|Anthem_For_The_Year_2000|  , and  |Totos|Toto|  Childs Anthem .          A national anthem is generally a  |patriotic|Patriotism|  musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions, and struggles of a  |countrys|Sovereign_State|  people, recognized either by that states  |government|Government|  as the official national  |song|Song| , or by  |convention|Convention|  through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are  |marches|March|  or  |hymns|Hymn|  in style. The countries of  |Latin_America|Latin_America| ,  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , and  |Europe|Europe|  tend towards more ornate and  |opera|Opera| tic pieces, while those in the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| ,  |Oceania|Oceania| ,  |Africa|Africa| , and the  |Caribbean|Caribbean|  use a more simplistic  |fanfare|Fanfare| . Some  |countries|List_Of_Sovereign_States|  that are devolved into multiple constituent states have their own official musical compositions for them ; their constituencies songs are sometimes referred to as national anthems even though they are not  |sovereign_states|Sovereign_State| .          A  |flag_anthem|Flag_Anthem|  is generally a  |patriotic|Patriotism|  musical composition that extols and praises a flag, typically one of a country, in which case it is sometimes called a national flag anthem. It is often either sung or performed during or immediately before the raising or lowering of a flag during a ceremony. Most countries use their respective national anthems or some other patriotic song for this purpose.  However, some countries, particularly in South America, use a discrete flag anthem for such purposes. Not all countries have flag anthems. Some used them in the past but no longer do, such as Iran, China, and South Africa. Flag anthems can be officially codified in law, or unofficially recognized as such through mere custom and convention. In some countries, the flag anthem may be just another song, and in others, it may be an official symbol of the state akin to a second national anthem, such as in Taiwan.       Although anthems are used to distinguish states and territories, there are instances of shared anthems.  |Nkosi_Sikelel_iAfrika|Nkosi_Sikelel_Iafrika|  became a  |pan-African|Pan-African|  liberation anthem and was later adopted as the national anthem of five countries in  |Africa|Africa|  including  |Zambia|Zambia| ,  |Tanzania|Tanzania| ,  |Namibia|Namibia|  and  |Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe|  after independence. Zimbabwe and Namibia have since adopted new national anthems. Since 1997, the  |South_Africa|South_Africa| n national anthem has been a hybrid song combining new English lyrics with extracts of Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika and the former state anthem  |Die_Stem_van_Suid-Afrika|Die_Stem_Van_Suid-Afrika|  .      |Hymn_to_Liberty|Hymn_To_Liberty|  is the longest national anthem in the world by length of text.

Other anthems that have used the same melody include  |Heil_dir_im_Siegerkranz|Heil_Dir_Im_Siegerkranz|  ,  |Kongesangen|Kongesangen|  ,  |My_Country,_Tis_of_Thee|My_Country,_Tis_Of_Thee|  ,  |Rufst_du,_mein_Vaterland|Rufst_Du,_Mein_Vaterland|  ,  |E_Ola_Ke_Alii_Ke_Akua|E_Ola_Ke_Alii_Ke_Akua|  , and  |The_Prayer_of_Russians|The_Prayer_Of_Russians|  F.     The  |Estonia|Estonia| n anthem  |Mu_isamaa,_mu_õnn_ja_rõõm|Mu_Isamaa,_Mu_Õnn_Ja_Rõõm|  is set to a melody composed in 1848 by  |Fredrik_Pacius|Fredrik_Pacius|  which is also that of the national anthem of  |Finland|Finland| |Maamme|Maamme|  .  It is also considered to be ethnic anthem for the  |Livonian_people|Livonian_People|  with lyrics  |Min_izāmō,_min_sindimō|Min_Izāmō|  .      |Hey,_Slavs|Hey,_Slavs|  is dedicated to  |Slavic_peoples|Slavic_Peoples| . Its first lyrics were written in 1834 under the title Hey, Slovaks by  |Samuel_Tomášik|Samuel_Tomášik|  and it has since served as the ethnic anthem of the  |Pan-Slavic|Pan-Slavic|  movement, the organizational anthem of the  |Sokol|Sokol|  physical education and political movement, the national anthem of  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia|  and the transitional anthem of the State Union of  |Serbia_and_Montenegro|Serbia_And_Montenegro| . The song is also considered to be the second, unofficial anthem of the Slovaks. Its melody is based on  |Mazurek_Dąbrowskiego|Mazurek_Dabrowskiego| , which has been also the anthem of  |Poland|Poland|  since 1926, but the Yugoslav variation is much slower and more accentuated.      Between 1991 and 1994  |Deșteaptă-te,_române!|Deșteaptă-Te,_Române!|  was the national anthem of both  |Romania|Romania|  and  |Moldova|Moldova| , but in the case of the latter was replaced by the current Moldovan national anthem,  |Limba_noastră|Limba_Noastră|  .     The modern national anthem of  |Germany|Germany| ,  |Das_Lied_der_Deutschen|Deutschlandlied|  , uses the same tune as the 19th and early 20th-century  |Austro-Hungarian|Austria-Hungary|  royal anthem  |Gott_erhalte_Franz_den_Kaiser|Gott_Erhalte_Franz_Den_Kaiser|  .     The  |Hymn_of_the_Soviet_Union|National_Anthem_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  , used until its dissolution in 1991, which was given new words and  |adopted|National_Anthem_Of_Russia|  by the  |Russian_Federation|Russia|  in 2000 to replace an instrumental national anthem that had been introduced in 1990.        |Bro_Gozh_ma_Zadoù|Bro_Gozh_Ma_Zadoù|  , the regional anthem of  |Brittany|Brittany|  and,  |Bro_Goth_Agan_Tasow|Bro_Goth_Agan_Tasow|  , the  |Cornish|Cornwall|  regional anthem, are sung to the same tune as that of the Welsh regional anthem  |Hen_Wlad_Fy_Nhadau|Hen_Wlad_Fy_Nhadau|  , with similar words.                         Some countries, such as the former  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| ,  |Spain|Spain| , and the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , among others, are held to be unions of several nations by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own regional anthem and these songs may or may not be officially recognized.     In  |Austria|Austria| , the situation is similar to that in Germany. The regional anthem of  |Upper_Austria|Upper_Austria| , the Hoamatgsang , is notable in the way that it is the only German-language anthem written – and sung – entirely in dialect.     In  |Belgium|Belgium| ,  |Wallonia|Wallonia|  uses  |Le_Chant_des_Wallons|Le_Chant_Des_Wallons|  and Flanders uses  |De_Vlaamse_Leeuw|De_Vlaamse_Leeuw|  .     The Canadian province of  |Newfoundland_and_Labrador|Newfoundland_And_Labrador| , having been the independent  |Dominion_of_Newfoundland|Dominion_Of_Newfoundland|  before 1949, also has its own regional anthem from its days as a dominion and colony of the UK, the  |Ode_to_Newfoundland|Ode_To_Newfoundland|  . It was the only Canadian province with its own anthem until 2010, when  |Prince_Edward_Island|Prince_Edward_Island|  adopted the 1908 song  |The_Island_Hymn|The_Island_Hymn|  as its provincial anthem.      |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  had a national anthem composed of two parts, the  |Czech|Kde_Domov_Můj?|  regional anthem followed by one verse of the  |Slovak_one|Nad_Tatrou_Sa_Blýska| . After the  |dissolution_of_Czechoslovakia|Dissolution_Of_Czechoslovakia| , the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic|  adopted its own regional anthem as its national one, whereas  |Slovakia|Slovakia|  did so with slightly changed lyrics and an additional stanza.     In  |Germany|Germany| , many of the  |Länder|States_Of_Germany|  have their own anthems, some of which predate the  |unification_of_Germany|Unification_Of_Germany|  in 1871. A prominent example is the  |Hymn_of_Bavaria|Bayernhymne| , which also has the status of an official anthem . There are also several unofficial regional anthems, like the  |Badnerlied|Badnerlied|  or the  |Niedersachsenlied|Niedersachsenlied|  .     All the individual states of  |Malaysia|Malaysia|  have their own regional anthems.     In  |Mexico|Mexico| , after the national anthem was established in 1854, most of the states of the federation adopted their own regional anthems, which often emphasize heroes, virtues or particular landscapes. In particular, the regional anthem of  |Zacatecas|Zacatecas| , the  |Marcha_de_Zacatecas|Marcha_De_Zacatecas|  , is one of the more well-known of Mexicos various regional anthems.

The  |Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic|Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic|  used the Soviet Unions national anthem as its regional anthem until 1990. After the Soviet Union disbanded in the early 1990s, some of its former constituent states, now sovereign nations in their own right, retained the melodies of their old Soviet-era regional anthems until replacing them or, in some cases, still use them today.       In  |Spain|Spain| , the situation is similar to that in Austria and Germany. Unlike the national anthem, most of the  |anthems_of_the_autonomous_communities|Anthems_Of_The_Autonomous_Communities_Of_Spain|  have words. All are official. Three prominent examples are  |Els_Segadors|Els_Segadors|  of  |Catalonia|Catalonia| ,  |Eusko_Abendaren_Ereserkia|Eusko_Abendaren_Ereserkia|  of the  |Basque_Country|Basque_Country| , and  |Os_Pinos|Os_Pinos|  of  |Galicia|Galicia| , all written and sung in the local languages.     The United Kingdoms national anthem is God Save the Queen but  |its_constituent_countries|Countries_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and  |Crown_Dependencies|Crown_Dependencies|  also have their own regional anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition.  |England|England| ,  |Scotland|Scotland| ,  |Wales|Wales| , and  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland| , as well as  |Jersey|Jersey| ,  |Guernsey|Guernsey|  and the  |Isle_of_Man|Isle_Of_Man| , each has a number of anthems which are played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. Johnson, H. . . The song usually  |used_as_a_regional_anthem_for_England|National_Anthem_Of_England|  is God Save the Queen , though sometimes  |Jerusalem|And_Did_Those_Feet_In_Ancient_Time|  ,  |I_Vow_To_Thee,_My_Country|I_Vow_To_Thee,_My_Country|  and  |Land_of_Hope_and_Glory|Land_Of_Hope_And_Glory|  may be played instead. Scotland has adopted  |Flower_of_Scotland|Flower_Of_Scotland|  as its unofficial national anthem, while Wales has sung  |Mae_Hen_Wlad_Fy_Nhadau|Mae_Hen_Wlad_Fy_Nhadau|  since 1856 when it was written by father and son  |Evan|Evan_James|  and  |James_James|James_James| ; the translation and music were adopted by  |Brittany|Brittany|  as its regional anthem. Hen Wlad fy Nhadau was sometimes accompanied by the hymn,  |Guide_Me,_O_thou_Great_Redeemer|Cwm_Rhondda|  , especially at rugby matches. Northern Ireland has used God Save the Queen though  |Londonderry_Air|Londonderry_Air|  is also used.       Although the United States has  |The_Star-Spangled_Banner|The_Star-Spangled_Banner|  as its official national anthem, its constituent states and territories also has their own regional anthem , along with  |Washington,_DC|Washington,_D.C.| .

In  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia| , each of the countrys constituent states  had the right to have its own regional anthem, but only the  |Croatia|Socialist_Republic_Of_Croatia| n one actually did so initially, later joined by the  |Slovene|Socialist_Republic_Of_Slovenia|  one on the brink of the  |breakup_of_Yugoslavia|Breakup_Of_Yugoslavia| . Before 1989,  |Macedonia|Socialist_Republic_Of_Macedonia|  did not officially use a regional anthem, even though one was proclaimed during the  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  by  |ASNOM|Asnom| . In 2005 and 2004 respectively, the  |Serbian|Republic_Of_Serbia|  and  |Montenegrin|Republic_Of_Montenegro|  regions of  |Serbia_and_Montenegro|Serbia_And_Montenegro|  adopted their own regional anthems.
