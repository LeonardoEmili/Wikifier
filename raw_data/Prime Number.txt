              A prime number  is a  |natural_number|Natural_Number|  greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a  |composite_number|Composite_Number| . For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a  |product|Product| ,  or , involve 5 itself.   However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers  that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in  |number_theory|Number_Theory|  because of the  |fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic|Fundamental_Theorem_Of_Arithmetic| |factorized|Factorization|  as a product of primes that is unique  |up_to|Up_To|  their order.     The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number n , called  |trial_division|Trial_Division| , tests whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and   . Faster algorithms include the  |Miller–Rabin_primality_test|Miller–Rabin_Primality_Test| , which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the  |AKS_primality_test|Aks_Primality_Test| , which always produces the correct answer in  |polynomial_time|Polynomial_Time|  but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as  |Mersenne_numbers|Mersenne_Number| .  the  |largest_known_prime_number|Largest_Known_Prime_Number|  has 24,862,048  |decimal_digits|Numerical_Digit| .     There are  |infinitely_many|Infinite_Set|  primes, as  |demonstrated_by_Euclid|Euclids_Theorem|  around 300 BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result in that direction is the  |prime_number_theorem|Prime_Number_Theorem| , proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the  |probability|Probability|  of a randomly chosen number being prime is inversely  |proportional|Proportionality|  to its number of digits, that is, to its  |logarithm|Logarithm| .     Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include  |Goldbachs_conjecture|Goldbachs_Conjecture| , that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the  |twin_prime|Twin_Prime|  conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on  |analytic|Analytic_Number_Theory|  or  |algebraic|Algebraic_Number_Theory|  aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in  |information_technology|Information_Technology| , such as  |public_key_cryptography|Public_Key_Cryptography| , which relies on the difficulty of  |factoring|Integer_Factorization|  large numbers into their prime factors. In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include  |prime_elements|Prime_Element|  and  |prime_ideals|Prime_Ideal| .          A  |natural_number|Natural_Number|  is called a prime number  if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers. The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called  |composite_numbers|Composite_Number| .  In other words, n is prime if n items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item,  or if it is not possible to arrange n dots into a rectangular grid that is more than one dot wide and more than one dot high.    For example, among the numbers 1 through 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers,  as there are no other numbers that divide them evenly .   1 is not prime, as it is specifically excluded in the definition.  and  are both composite.        The  |divisors|Divisor|  of a natural number n are the natural numbers that divide n evenly.   Every natural number has both 1 and itself as a divisor. If it has any other divisor, it cannot be prime. This idea leads to a different but equivalent definition of the primes: they are the numbers with exactly two positive  |divisors|Divisor| , 1 and the number itself.    Yet another way to express the same thing is that a number n is prime if it is greater than one and if none of the numbers 2, 3,   n-1 divides n evenly.      The first 25 prime numbers are:    : |2|2| ,  |3|3| ,  |5|5| ,  |7|7| ,  |11|11| ,  |13|13| ,  |17|17| ,  |19|19| ,  |23|23| ,  |29|29| ,  |31|31| ,  |37|37| ,  |41|41| ,  |43|43| ,  |47|47| ,  |53|53| ,  |59|59| ,  |61|61| ,  |67|67| ,  |71|71| ,  |73|73| ,  |79|79| ,  |83|83| ,  |89|89| ,  |97|97|  .     No  |even_number|Even_Number|  n greater than 2 is prime because any such number can be expressed as the product 2  n/2 . Therefore, every prime number other than 2 is an  |odd_number|Odd_Number| , and is called an odd prime.  Similarly, when written in the usual  |decimal|Decimal|  system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. The numbers that end with other digits are all composite:   decimal numbers that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 are even, and decimal numbers that end in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5.      The  |set|Set|  of all primes is sometimes denoted by     or by   .             The  |Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus|Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus| , from around 1550 BC, has  |Egyptian_fraction|Egyptian_Fraction|  expansions of different forms for prime and composite numbers. Bruins, Evert Marie, review in Mathematical Reviews of  However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from  |ancient_Greek_mathematics|Greek_Mathematics| .  |Euclids|Euclid|   Elements  proves the  |infinitude_of_primes|Euclids_Theorem|  and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and shows how to construct a  |perfect_number|Perfect_Number|  from a  |Mersenne_prime|Mersenne_Prime| .  Another Greek invention, the  |Sieve|Sieve_Of_Eratosthenes|  of  |Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes| , is still used to construct lists of primes.       Around 1000 AD, the  |Islamic|Mathematics_In_Medieval_Islam|  mathematician  |Alhazen|Ibn_Al_Haytham|  found  |Wilsons_theorem|Wilsons_Theorem| , characterizing the prime numbers as the numbers n that evenly divide !+1 . Alhazen also conjectured that all even perfect numbers come from Euclids construction using Mersenne primes, but was unable to prove it.  Another Islamic mathematician,  |Ibn_al_Banna_al_Marrakushi|Ibn_Al_Banna_Al_Marrakushi| , observed that the sieve of Eratosthenes can be sped up by testing only the divisors up to the square root of the largest number to be tested.  |Fibonacci|Fibonacci|  brought the innovations from Islamic mathematics back to Europe. His book  Liber Abaci  was the first to describe  |trial_division|Trial_Division|  for testing primality, again using divisors only up to the square root.     In 1640  |Pierre_de_Fermat|Pierre_De_Fermat|  stated  |Fermats_little_theorem|Fermats_Little_Theorem|  . ,  Fermat also investigated the primality of the  |Fermat_numbers|Fermat_Number|    2+1 ,  and  |Marin_Mersenne|Marin_Mersenne|  studied the  |Mersenne_primes|Mersenne_Prime| , prime numbers of the form 2p-1 with p itself a prime.   |Christian_Goldbach|Christian_Goldbach|  formulated  |Goldbachs_conjecture|Goldbachs_Conjecture| , that every even number is the sum of two primes, in a 1742 letter to Euler.  Euler proved Alhazens conjecture  that all even perfect numbers can be constructed from Mersenne primes. He introduced methods from  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis|  to this area in his proofs of the infinitude of the primes and the  |divergence_of_the_sum_of_the_reciprocals_of_the_primes|Divergence_Of_The_Sum_Of_The_Reciprocals_Of_The_Primes|    .    At the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss conjectured that as x tends to infinity, the number of primes up to x is  |asymptotic|Asymptotic_Analysis|  to x/  x , where   x is the  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm|  of x . Ideas of  |Bernhard_Riemann|Bernhard_Riemann|  in his  |1859_paper_on_the_zeta_function|On_The_Number_Of_Primes_Less_Than_A_Given_Magnitude|  sketched an outline for proving this. Although the closely related  |Riemann_hypothesis|Riemann_Hypothesis|  remains unproven, Riemanns outline was completed in 1896 by  |Hadamard|Jacques_Hadamard|  and  |de_la_Vallée_Poussin|Charles_Jean_De_La_Vallée_Poussin| , and the result is now known as the  |prime_number_theorem|Prime_Number_Theorem| .  Another important 19th century result was  |Dirichlets_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions|Dirichlets_Theorem_On_Arithmetic_Progressions| , that certain  |arithmetic_progressions|Arithmetic_Progression|  contain infinitely many primes.      Many mathematicians have worked on  |primality_tests|Primality_Test|  for numbers larger than those where trial division is practicably applicable. Methods that are restricted to specific number forms include  |Pépins_test|Pépins_Test|  for Fermat numbers ,   |Proths_theorem|Proths_Theorem|  ,  the  |Lucas–Lehmer_primality_test|Lucas–Lehmer_Primality_Test|  , and the generalized  |Lucas_primality_test|Lucas_Primality_Test| .     Since 1951 all the  |largest_known_primes|Largest_Known_Prime|  have been found using these tests on  |computers|Computer| . The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles, through the  |Great_Internet_Mersenne_Prime_Search|Great_Internet_Mersenne_Prime_Search|  and other  |distributed_computing|Distributed_Computing|  projects. , p. 245. The idea that prime numbers had few applications outside of  |pure_mathematics|Pure_Mathematics|  was shattered in the 1970s when  |public_key_cryptography|Public_Key_Cryptography|  and the  |RSA|Rsa|  cryptosystem were invented, using prime numbers as their basis.      The increased practical importance of computerized primality testing and factorization led to the development of improved methods capable of handling large numbers of unrestricted form.   The mathematical theory of prime numbers also moved forward with the  |Green–Tao_theorem|Green–Tao_Theorem|  that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers, and  |Yitang_Zhangs|Yitang_Zhang|  2013 proof that there exist infinitely many  |prime_gaps|Prime_Gap|  of bounded size. , pp. 18, 47.       Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number,  For a selection of quotes from and about the ancient Greek positions on this issue, see in particular pp. 3–4. For the Islamic mathematicians, see p. 6.  so they could not consider its primality. A few mathematicians from this time also considered the prime numbers to be a subdivision of the odd numbers, so they also did not consider 2 to be prime. However, Euclid and a majority of the other Greek mathematicians considered 2 as prime. The  |medieval_Islamic_mathematicians|Mathematics_In_Medieval_Islam|  largely followed the Greeks in viewing 1 as not being a number.   By the Middle Ages and Renaissance mathematicians began treating 1 as a number, and some of them included it as the first prime number. , pp. 7–13. See in particular the entries for Stevin, Brancker, Wallis, and Prestet. In the mid-18th century  |Christian_Goldbach|Christian_Goldbach|  listed 1 as prime in his correspondence with  |Leonhard_Euler|Leonhard_Euler| ; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be prime. , p. 15. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered 1 to be prime, and lists of primes that included 1 continued to be published as recently as 1956.       If the definition of a prime number were changed to call 1 a prime, many statements involving prime numbers would need to be reworded in a more awkward way. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic would need to be rephrased in terms of factorizations into primes greater than 1, because every number would have multiple factorizations with different numbers of copies of 1.  Similarly, the  |sieve_of_Eratosthenes|Sieve_Of_Eratosthenes|  would not work correctly if it handled 1 as a prime, because it would eliminate all multiples of 1 and output only the single number 1. Some other more technical properties of prime numbers also do not hold for the number 1: for instance, the formulas for  |Eulers_totient_function|Eulers_Totient_Function|  or for the  |sum_of_divisors_function|Sum_Of_Divisors_Function|  are different for prime numbers than they are for 1. For the totient, see , . For the sum of divisors, see  By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to agree that 1 should not be listed as prime, but rather in its own special category as a  |unit|Unit|  .            Writing a number as a product of prime numbers is called a prime factorization of the number. For example:   :     34866 & 2  3  3  13   149    & 2  32  13   149       The terms in the product are called prime factors. The same prime factor may occur more than once; this example has two copies of the prime factor 3 .   When a prime occurs multiple times,  |exponentiation|Exponentiation|  can be used to group together multiple copies of the same prime number: for example, in the second way of writing the product above, 32 denotes the  |square|Square|  or second power of 3 .     The central importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.  This theorem states that every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes. More strongly,   this product is unique in the sense that any two prime factorizations of the same number will have the same numbers of copies of the same primes,   although their ordering may differ. , ;  So, although there are many different ways of finding a factorization using an  |integer_factorization|Integer_Factorization|  algorithm, they all must produce the same result. Primes can thus be considered the basic building blocks of the natural numbers.      Some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations are based on  |Euclids_lemma|Euclids_Lemma| , ;  Conversely, if a number p has the property that when it divides a product it always divides at least one factor of the product, then p must be prime.           There are  |infinitely|Infinitely|  many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence   :2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...   of prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as Euclids theorem in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician  |Euclid|Euclid| , since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an  |analytical|Mathematical_Analysis|  proof by  |Euler|Euler| ,  |Goldbachs|Christian_Goldbach| |_proof|Fermat_Numberbasic_Properties|  based on  |Fermat_numbers|Fermat_Number| ,  in  |Latin|Latin|  from Goldbach to Euler, July 1730.  |Furstenbergs|Hillel_Furstenberg| |_proof_using_general_topology|Furstenbergs_Proof_Of_The_Infinitude_Of_Primes| ,    and  |Kummers|Ernst_Kummer|  elegant proof.       |Euclids_proof|Euclids_Theorem| |_Euclids_Elements|Euclids_Elements| , Book IX, Proposition 20. See  or  shows that every  |finite_list|Finite_Set|  of primes is incomplete. The key idea is to multiply together the primes in any given list and add 1 . If the list consists of the primes   p1,p2,  pn , this gives the number   : N 1 + p1  p2  pn.   By the fundamental theorem, N has a prime factorization   : N p1  p2  pm   with one or more prime factors. N is evenly divisible by each of these factors, but N has a remainder of one when divided by any of the prime numbers in the given list, so none of the prime factors of N can be in the given list. Because there is no finite list of all the primes, there must be infinitely many primes.     The numbers formed by adding one to the products of the smallest primes are called  |Euclid_numbers|Euclid_Number| .  The first five of them are prime, but the sixth,   : 1+  30031 59  509,   is a composite number.          There is no known efficient formula for primes. For example, there is no non-constant  |polynomial|Polynomial| , even in several variables, that takes only prime values. However, there are numerous expressions that do encode all primes, or only primes. One possible formula is based on  |Wilsons_theorem|Wilsons_Theorem|  and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.  There is also a set of  |Diophantine_equations|Diophantine_Equations|  in nine variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its positive values are prime.      Other examples of prime-generating formulas come from  |Mills_theorem|Mills_Theorem|  and a theorem of  |Wright|E_M_Wright| .
