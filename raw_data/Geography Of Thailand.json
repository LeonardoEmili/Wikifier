The exception is the southern parts of Thailand where it receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November.  Summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–February until mid–May and is characterized by warmer weather.

Most borders were stabilized and demarcated in the late-19th and early-20th centuries in accordance with treaties forced on Thailand and its neighbors by Britain and France. In some areas, however, exact boundaries, especially along Thailands eastern borders with Laos and Cambodia, are still disputed.     Adding to general border tensions were the activities of communist-led insurgents, whose operations were of paramount concern to the Thai government and its security forces for several decades. The problem of communist insurgency was compounded by the activity of what the Thai government labelled antistate elements . Often the real source of border problems was ordinary criminals or local merchants involved in illegal mining, logging, smuggling, and narcotics production and trade.          Cambodias disputes with Thailand after 1951 arose in part from ill-defined boundaries and changes in Frances colonial fortunes. Recently, the most notable case has been a dispute over ": null
