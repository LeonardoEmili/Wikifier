                The Red Sea  is a  |seawater|Seawater| |inlet|Inlet|  of the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| , lying between  |Africa|Africa|  and  |Asia|Asia| . The connection to the ocean is in the south through the  |Bab_el_Mandeb|Bab_El_Mandeb|  strait and the  |Gulf_of_Aden|Gulf_Of_Aden| . To the north lie the  |Sinai_Peninsula|Sinai_Peninsula| , the  |Gulf_of_Aqaba|Gulf_Of_Aqaba| , and the  |Gulf_of_Suez|Gulf_Of_Suez|  . The Red Sea is a  |Global_200|Global_200| |ecoregion|Ecoregion| . The sea is underlain by the  |Red_Sea_Rift|Red_Sea_Rift|  which is part of the  |Great_Rift_Valley|Great_Rift_Valley| .     The Red Sea has a surface area of roughly 438,000  km 2 ,   is about 2250  km long and, at its widest point, 355  km wide. It has a maximum depth of  in the central Suakin Trough, Robert Dinwiddie: Ocean The Worlds Last Wilderness Revealed. Dorling Kindersley, London 2008, p. 452 and an average depth of 490  m . However, there are also extensive shallow shelves, noted for their marine life and  |corals|Coral| . The sea is the habitat of over 1,000  |invertebrate|Invertebrate|  species, and 200 soft and hard corals. It is the worlds northernmost  |tropical|Tropics|  sea.       The  |International_Hydrographic_Organization|International_Hydrographic_Organization|  defines the limits of the Red Sea as follows:      ::On the North. The Southern limits of the  |Gulfs_of_Suez|Gulf_Of_Suez|  A line running from  |Ràs_Muhammed|Ras_Muhammad_National_Park|  to the South point of  |Shadwan|Shadwan|  Island and thence Westward on a parallel to the coast of  |Africa|Africa|  and  |Aqaba|Gulf_Of_Aqaba|  A line running from Ràs al Fasma Southwesterly to Requin Island  through  |Tiran_Island|Tiran_Island|  to the Southwest point thereof and thence Westward on a parallel to the coast of the  |Sinai_Peninsula|Sinai_Peninsula|  .   ::On the South. A line joining  |Husn_Murad|Hisn_Murad|   and  |Ras_Siyyan|Ras_Siyyan|  .          Red Sea is a direct translation of the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  Erythra Thalassa ,  |Latin|Latin|  Mare Rubrum ,  ,  |Somali|Somali_Language|  Badda Cas and  |Tigrinya|Tigrinya_Language|  Qeyyiḥ bāḥrī . The name of the sea may signify the seasonal blooms of the red-coloured  Trichodesmium erythraeum  near the waters surface.   A theory favoured by some modern scholars is that the name red is referring to the direction south, just as the  |Black_Seas|Black_Sea|  name may refer to north. The basis of this theory is that some Asiatic languages used colour words to refer to the  |cardinal_directions|5_Cardinal_Point| .   |Herodotus|Herodotus|  on one occasion uses Red Sea and Southern Sea interchangeably. Schmitt 1996     The name in Hebrew  Yam Suph   is of biblical origin.   The name in  Phiom Enhah is connected to  |Ancient_Egyptian|Egyptian_Language|  root ḥḥ which refers to water and sea  - Pa-yem Aa en Mu-Ked, the ancient Egyptian name of the Red Sea.      Historically, it was also known to western geographers as Mare Mecca , and Sinus Arabicus .  Some ancient geographers called the Red Sea the Arabian Gulf  or Gulf of Arabia.  Andrew E. Hill, John H. Walton , A survey of the Old Testament, p.32      The association of the Red Sea with the  |biblical|Bible|  account of the Israelites  |crossing_the_Red_Sea|Crossing_The_Red_Sea|  is ancient, and was made explicit in the  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  translation of the  |Book_of_Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus|  from  |Hebrew|Hebrew|  to  |Koine_Greek|Koine|  in approximately the third century B.C. In that version, the  Yam Suph   is translated as Erythra Thalassa . Although reeds do not grow in the Red Sea today , Professor  |Colin_Humphreys|Colin_Humphreys|  explains the discrepancy on the basis that a freshwater marsh of reeds could have existed around  |Aqaba|Aqaba| .      The Red Sea is one of four seas named in English after common  |color_terms|Color_Term|  – the others being the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea| , the  |White_Sea|White_Sea|  and the  |Yellow_Sea|Yellow_Sea| . The direct rendition of the Greek Erythra thalassa in Latin as  |Mare_Erythraeum|Mare_Erythraeum|  refers to the north-western part of the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| , and also to a region on  |Mars|Mars| .              The earliest known exploration of the Red Sea was conducted by  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ians, as they attempted to establish commercial routes to  |Punt|Land_Of_Punt| . One such expedition took place around 2500 BCE, and another around 1500 BCE . Both involved long voyages down the Red Sea.  The biblical  |Book_of_Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus|  tells the account of the  |Israelites|Israelites| |crossing_of_a_body_of_water|Crossing_The_Red_Sea| , which the Hebrew text calls  Yam Suph  . Yam Suph was traditionally identified as the Red Sea. Rabbi  |Saadia_Gaon|Saadia_Gaon|  , in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, identifies the crossing place of the Red Sea as Baḥar al-Qulzum, meaning the  |Gulf_of_Suez|Gulf_Of_Suez| . Tafsir, Saadia Gaon, s.v. Exodus 15:22, et al.      In the 6th century BCE,  |Darius_the_Great_of_Persia|Darius_The_Great_Of_Persia|  sent reconnaissance missions to the Red Sea, improving and extending navigation by locating many hazardous rocks and currents. A canal was built between the  |Nile|Nile|  and the northern end of the Red Sea at  |Suez|Suez| . In the late 4th century BCE,  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  sent Greek naval expeditions down the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. Greek navigators continued to explore and compile data on the Red Sea.  |Agatharchides|Agatharchides|  collected information about the sea in the 2nd century BCE. The  Periplus of the Erythraean Sea  , a  |Greek|Greek_Language| |periplus|Periplus|  written by an unknown author around the 1st century , contains a detailed description of the Red Seas ports and sea routes.  The Periplus also describes how  |Hippalus|Hippalus|  first discovered the direct route from the Red Sea to India.     The Red Sea was favored for  |Roman_trade_with_India|Roman_Trade_With_India|  starting with the reign of  |Augustus|Augustus| , when the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  gained control over the Mediterranean,  |Egypt|Egypt| , and the northern Red Sea. The route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic under the Romans. From Indian ports goods from  |China|China|  were introduced to the Roman world. Contact between Rome and China depended on the Red Sea, but the route was broken by the  |Aksumite_Empire|Aksumite_Empire|  around the 3rd century AD.        During the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , the Red Sea was an important part of the  |spice_trade|Spice_Trade|  route. In 1183,  |Raynald_of_Châtillon|Raynald_Of_Châtillon|  launched a raid down the Red Sea to attack the Muslim pilgrim convoys to Mecca. Mallett, Alex A Trip down the Red Sea with Reynald of Châtillon pages 141-153 from Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 18, Issue 2, April 2008 pages 143-144. The possibility that Raynalds fleet might sack the holy cities of Mecca and Medina caused fury throughout the Muslim world. Mallett, Alex A Trip down the Red Sea with Reynald of Châtillon pages 141-153 from Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 18, Issue 2, April 2008 pages 146-147. However, it appears that Reynalds target were the lightly armed Muslim pilgrim convoys rather the well guarded cities of Mecca and Medina, and the belief in the Muslim world that Reynald was seeking to sack the holy cities was due to the proximity of those cities to the areas that Raynald raided. Mallett, Alex A Trip down the Red Sea with Reynald of Châtillon pages 141-153 from Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 18, Issue 2, April 2008 pages 152-153. In 1513, trying to secure that channel to Portugal,  |Afonso_de_Albuquerque|Afonso_De_Albuquerque|  laid  |siege_to_Aden|Siege_Of_Aden|  By M. D. D. Newitt, , p.87, Routledge, 2005,  but was forced to retreat. They cruised the Red Sea inside the  |Bab_al-Mandab|Bab_Al-Mandab| , as the first fleet from Europe in modern times to have sailed these waters.     In 1798,  |France|France|  ordered General  |Napoleon|Napoleon_I|  to invade  |Egypt|Egypt|  and take control of the Red Sea. Although he failed in his mission, the engineer  |Jean-Baptiste_Lepère|Jean-Baptiste_Lepère| , who took part in it, revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the  |Pharaohs|Pharaoh| . Several canals were built in ancient times from the Nile to the Red Sea along or near the line of the present  |Sweet_Water_Canal|Sweet_Water_Canal| , but none lasted for long. The  |Suez_Canal|Suez_Canal|  was opened in November 1869. After the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified. However, the  |Six-Day_War|Six-Day_War|  culminated in the closure of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Today, in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less vulnerable to piracy.          The Red Sea is between arid land,  |desert|Desert|  and  |semi-desert|Semi-Desert| . Reef systems are better developed along the Red Sea mainly because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern. The Red Sea water mass-exchanges its water with the  |Arabian_Sea|Arabian_Sea| ,  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean|  via the  |Gulf_of_Aden|Gulf_Of_Aden| . These physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation in the north and relatively hot water in the south.     The  |climate|Climate|  of the Red Sea is the result of two monsoon seasons; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds occur because of differential heating between the land and the sea. Very high surface temperatures and high salinities make this one of the warmest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about  in the north and  in the south, with only about 2  °C variation during the winter months. The overall average water temperature is . Temperature and visibility remain good to around 200  m . The sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents.     The  |rainfall|Rainfall|  over the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging  per year. The rain is mostly short showers, often with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust  |storms|Storm| . The scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in excess evaporation as high as  per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from  |Sudan|Sudan|  and  |Eritrea|Eritrea| |BBC_2|Bbc_2|  television program Oceans 3/8 The Red Sea , 8 pm - 9 pm Wednesday 26 November 2008 found surface water temperatures  in winter and up to  in the summer, but despite that extreme heat, the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of  |coral_bleaching|Coral_Bleaching| , with only 9% infected by  Thalassomonas loyana , the white plague agent.  |Favia_favus|Favia|  coral there harbours a virus, BA3, which kills T. loyana.  at  |New_Scientist|New_Scientist| , 7 July 2012.p.17.   Plans are afoot to use samples of these corals apparently heat-adapted  |commensal|Commensal| |algae|Algae|  to salvage bleached coral elsewhere.       The Red Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, owing to high evaporation and low precipitation; no significant rivers or streams drain into the sea, and its southern connection to the  |Gulf_of_Aden|Gulf_Of_Aden| , an arm of the Indian Ocean, is narrow.  Its  |salinity|Salinity|  ranges from between ~36   |‰|Per_Mil|  in the southern part and 41  ‰ in the northern part around the  |Gulf_of_Suez|Gulf_Of_Suez| , with an average of 40  ‰.         In general, tide ranges between  in the north, near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and  in the south near the Gulf of Aden, but it fluctuates between  and  away from the nodal point. The central Red Sea is therefore almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal  |sabkhas|Sabkha|  as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred metres rather than flooding the  |sabkhas|Sabkha|  through a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the  |Shoiaba|Shoiaba|  area, the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as , whereas north of Jeddah in the  |Al-Kharrar|Al-Kharrar|  area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as . The prevailing north and northeast winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during storms. Winter mean sea level is  higher than in summer. Tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands commonly exceed 1–2  m/s . Coral reefs in the Red Sea are near Egypt, Eritrea, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.       Detailed information regarding current data is lacking, partially because the currents are weak and both spatially and temporally variable. The variation of temporal and spatial currents is as low as  and are governed all by wind. During the summer, NW winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of 15–20  cm/s , whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to the north end of the Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of the tidal current is between 50–60  cm/s with a maximum of  at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8–29  cm/s .       The north part of the Red Sea is dominated by persistent north-west  |winds|Winds| , with speeds ranging between  and . The rest of the Red Sea and the  |Gulf_of_Aden|Gulf_Of_Aden|  are subjected to regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind  |regime|Regime|  is characterized by seasonal and regional variations in  |speed|Speed|  and  |direction|Direction|  with average speed generally increasing northward. Patzer, W. C. , Wind-induced reversal in the Red Sea circulation, Deep Sea Research, 21, 109-121.     Wind is the driving force in the Red Sea to transport material as suspension or as bedload. Wind-induced currents play an important role in the Red Sea in resuspending bottom sediments and transferring materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind-generated current  |measurement|Measurement|  is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds. Morcos, S. A. , Physical and chemical oceanography of the Red Sea,Oceanography and Marine Biology Annual Review, 8, 73-202.          The Red Sea was formed by the  |Arabian_peninsula|Arabian_Peninsula|  being split from the  |Horn_of_Africa|Horn_Of_Africa|  by movement of the  |Red_Sea_Rift|Red_Sea_Rift| . This split started in the  |Eocene|Eocene|  and accelerated during the  |Oligocene|Oligocene| . The sea is still widening ,  and it is considered that it will become an ocean in time . In 1949, a deep water survey reported anomalously hot brines in the central portion of the Red Sea. Later work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot, 60  °C , saline brines and associated metalliferous muds. The hot solutions were emanating from an active subseafloor  |rift|Rift| . Lake Asal in Djibouti is eligible as an experimental site to study the evolution of the deep hot brines of the Red Sea.  Indeed, by observing the strontium isotope composition of the Red Sea brines, it is easy to deduce how these salt waters found at the bottom of the Red Sea could have evolved in a similar way to Lake Asal, which ideally represents their compositional extreme. The high salinity of the waters was not hospitable to living organisms. Degens, Egon T. , 1969, Hot Brines and Recent Heavy Metal Deposits in the Red Sea, 600 pp, Springer-Verlag     Sometime during the  |Tertiary|Tertiary|  period, the  |Bab_el_Mandeb|Bab_El_Mandeb|  closed and the Red Sea evaporated to an empty hot dry salt-floored sink. Effects causing this would have been:   A race between the Red Sea widening and  |Perim_Island|Perim_Island| |erupting|Volcano|  filling the Bab el Mandeb with  |lava|Lava| .   The lowering of world  |sea_level|Sea_Level|  during the  |Ice_Ages|Ice_Age|  because of much water being locked up in the  |ice_caps|Ice_Cap| .     A number of volcanic islands rise from the center of the sea. Most are dormant. However, in 2007,  |Jabal_al-Tair_island|Jabal_Al-Tair_Island|  in the Bab el Mandeb strait erupted violently. Two new islands were formed in 2011 and 2013 in the  |Zubair_Archipelago|Zubair_Group| , a small chain of islands owned by Yemen. The first island, Sholan Island, emerged in an eruption in December 2011, the second island, Jadid, emerged in September 2013.          The Durwara 2 Field was discovered in 1963, while the Suakin 1 Field and the Bashayer 1A Field were discovered in 1976, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. The Barqan Field was discovered in 1969, and the Midyan Field in 1992, both within the Midyan Basin on the Saudi Arabian side of the Red Sea. The 20-m thick  |Middle_Miocene|Middle_Miocene|  Maqna  |Formation|Formation|  is an oil source rock in the basin.  |Oil_seeps|Oil_Seep|  occur near the  |Farasan_Islands|Farasan_Islands| , the  |Dahlak_Archipelago|Dahlak_Archipelago| , along the coast of Eritrea, and in the southeastern Red Sea along the coasts of Saudi Arabia and Yemen.           In terms of mineral resources the major constituents of the Red Sea sediments are as follows:   Biogenic constituents:   :Nanofossils,  |foraminifera|Foraminifera| ,  |pteropods|Pteropod| , siliceous fossils   Volcanogenic constituents:   : |Tuff|Tuff| ites,  |volcanic_ash|Volcanic_Ash| ,  |montmorillonite|Montmorillonite| ,  |cristobalite|Cristobalite| ,  |zeolites|Zeolite|    Terrigenous constituents:   : |Quartz|Quartz| ,  |feldspars|Feldspar| , rock fragments,  |mica|Mica| , heavy minerals,  |clay_minerals|Clay_Minerals| |Sulfide_minerals|Sulfide_Mineral| ,  |aragonite|Aragonite| , Mg- |calcite|Calcite| , protodolomite,  |dolomite|Dolomite| , quartz,  |chalcedony|Chalcedony| .

The Red Sea is a rich and diverse  |ecosystem|Ecosystem| . More than  |1200_species_of_fish|Fish_Of_The_Red_Sea|   have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10% of these are found nowhere else.  This also includes 42 species of  |deepwater_fish|List_Of_Deep_Water_Fish_Of_The_Red_Sea| .      The rich diversity is in part due to the  of  |coral_reef|Coral_Reef|  extending along its  |coastline|Coastline| ; these  |fringing_reefs|Fringing_Reef|  are 5000–7000 years old and are largely formed of stony  |acropora|Acropora|  and  |porites|Porites|  corals. The reefs form platforms and sometimes  |lagoons|Lagoon|  along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders . These coastal reefs are also visited by  |pelagic|Pelagic|  species of Red Sea fish, including some of the  |44_species_of_shark|List_Of_Sharks_In_The_Red_Sea| .     It contains 175 species of  |nudibranch|Nudibranch| , many of which are only found in the Red Sea.      The Red Sea also contains many offshore reefs including several true atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic coral reef classification schemes, and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.     The special  |biodiversity|Biodiversity|  of the area is recognized by the  |Egypt|Egypt| ian government, who set up the  |Ras_Mohammed_National_Park|Ras_Mohammed|  in 1983. The rules and regulations governing this area protect local marine life, which has become a major draw for  |diving|Scuba_Diving|  enthusiasts.      |Divers|Scuba_Diving|  and  |snorkellers|Snorkeller|  should be aware that although most Red Sea species are innocuous, a few are hazardous to humans: see  |Red_Sea_species_hazardous_to_humans|Red_Sea_Species_Hazardous_To_Humans| . Lieske, E. and Myers, R.F.

There is extensive demand for  |desalinated|Desalination|  water to meet the needs of the population and the industries along the Red Sea.     There are at least 18 desalination plants along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia which discharge warm  |brine|Brine|  and treatment chemicals  that  |bleach|Bleach|  and kill  |corals|Coral|  and cause diseases in the fish. This is only localized, but it may intensify with time and profoundly impact the fishing industry. Mabrook, B. Environmental Impact of Waste Brine Disposal of Desalination Plants, Red Sea, Egypt , Desalination, 1994, Vol.97, pp.453-465.     The water from the Red Sea is also used by  |oil_refineries|Oil_Refineries|  and  |cement|Cement|  factories for cooling.       The Red Sea is part of the  |sea_roads|Sea_Road|  between  |Europe|Europe| , the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf|  and  |East_Asia|East_Asia| , and as such has heavy  |shipping_traffic|Shipping| . Government-related bodies with responsibility to police the Red Sea area include the  |Port_Said_Port_Authority|Port_Said_Port_Authority| ,  |Suez_Canal_Authority|Suez_Canal_Authority|  and  |Red_Sea_Ports_Authority|Red_Sea_Ports_Authority|  of  |Egypt|Egypt| ,  |Jordan_Maritime_Authority|Jordan_Maritime_Authority| ,  |Israel_Port_Authority|Israel_Port_Authority| ,  |Saudi_Ports_Authority|Saudi_Ports_Authority|  and  |Sea_Ports_Corporation|Sea_Ports_Corporation,_Sudan|  of  |Sudan|Sudan| .          : Length: ~ - 79% of the eastern Red Sea with numerous coastal inlets   : Maximum Width: ~ 306–355 km – Massawa   : Minimum Width: ~ 26–29 km -  |Bab_el_Mandeb|Bab_El_Mandeb|  Strait   : Average Width: ~    : Average Depth: ~    : Maximum Depth: ~    : Surface Area: 438-450 x 10 2 km 2   : Volume: 215–251 x 10 3 km 3     : Approximately 40% of the Red Sea is quite shallow , and about 25% is under  deep.   : About 15% of the Red Sea is over  depth that forms the deep axial trough.   : Shelf breaks are marked by coral reefs   : Continental slope has an irregular profile    : Centre of Red Sea has a narrow trough            The sea is known for its  |recreational_diving|Recreational_Diving|  sites, such as  |Ras_Mohammed|Ras_Mohammed| ,  |SS_Thistlegorm|Ss_Thistlegorm|  ,  |Elphinstone_Reef|Elphinstone_Reef| ,  |The_Brothers|The_Brothers,_Egypt| ,  |Daedalus_Reef|Daedalus_Reef| ,  |St.Johns_Reef|St.Johns_Reef| ,  |Rocky_Island|Rocky_Island|  in  |Egypt|Egypt|   and less known sites in  |Sudan|Sudan|  such as  |Sanganeb|Sanganeb| ,  |Abington|Abington,_Sudan| ,  |Angarosh|Angarosh|  and  |Shaab_Rumi|Shaab_Rumi| .     The Red Sea became a popular destination for diving after the expeditions of  |Hans_Hass|Hans_Hass|  in the 1950s, and later by  |Jacques-Yves_Cousteau|Jacques-Yves_Cousteau| .  Popular tourist resorts include  |El_Gouna|El_Gouna| ,  |Hurghada|Hurghada| ,  |Safaga|Safaga| ,  |Marsa_Alam|Marsa_Alam| , on the west shore of the Red Sea, and  |Sharm-el-Sheikh|Sharm-El-Sheikh| ,  |Dahab|Dahab| , and  |Taba|Taba,_Egypt|  on the  |Egypt|Egypt| ian side of  |Sinaï|Sinaï| , as well as  |Aqaba|Aqaba|  in  |Jordan|Jordan|  and  |Eilat|Eilat|  in  |Israel|Israel|  in an area known as the  |Red_Sea_Riviera|Red_Sea_Riviera| .     The popular tourist beach of Sharm el-Sheikh was closed to all swimming in December 2010 due to several serious  |shark_attacks|2010_Sharm_El_Sheikh_Shark_Attacks| , including a fatality. As of December 2010, scientists are investigating the attacks and have identified, but not verified, several possible causes including over-fishing which causes large sharks to hunt closer to shore, tourist boat operators who chum offshore for shark-photo opportunities, and reports of ships throwing dead livestock overboard. The seas narrowness, significant depth, and sharp drop-offs, all combine to form a geography where large deep-water sharks can roam in hundreds of meters of water, yet be within a hundred meters of swimming areas.        Tourism to the region has been threatened by occasional terrorist attacks, and by incidents related to food safety standards.         The Red Sea may be geographically divided into three sections: the Red Sea proper, and in the north, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez. The six countries bordering the Red Sea proper are:     Eastern shore:             The Gulf of Suez is entirely bordered by Egypt. The Gulf of Aqaba borders Egypt,  |Israel|Israel| ,  |Jordan|Jordan|  and Saudi Arabia.     In addition to the standard geographical definition of the six countries bordering the Red Sea cited above, areas such as  |Somalia|Somalia|  are sometimes also described as Red Sea territories. This is primarily due to their proximity to and geological similarities with the nations facing the Red Sea and/or political ties with said areas.
