     HAL 9000 is a fictional  |artificial_intelligence|Artificial_Intelligence|  character and the main  |antagonist|Antagonist|  in  |Arthur_C._Clarkes|Arthur_C._Clarke|   Space Odyssey  series. First appearing in the 1968 film  2001: A Space Odyssey , HAL  is a  |sentient|Sentience| |computer|Computer|   that controls the systems of the  Discovery  One  spacecraft and interacts with the ships  |astronaut|Astronaut|  crew. Part of HALs hardware is shown toward the end of the film, but he is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red or yellow dot, instances of which are located throughout the ship. HAL 9000 is voiced by  |Douglas_Rain|Douglas_Rain|  in the two feature film adaptations of the Space Odyssey series. HAL speaks in a soft, calm voice and a conversational manner, in contrast to the crewmen,  |David_Bowman|David_Bowman|  and Frank Poole.     In the film, HAL became operational on 12 January 1992 at the HAL Laboratories in  |Urbana,_Illinois|Urbana,_Illinois|  as production number 3. The activation year was 1991 in earlier screenplays and changed to 1997 in Clarkes  |novel|2001:_A_Space_Odyssey|  written and released in conjunction with the movie.  In addition to maintaining the Discovery One spacecraft systems during the interplanetary mission to  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  , HAL is capable of  |speech|Speech_Synthesis| ,  |speech_recognition|Speech_Recognition| ,  |facial_recognition|Facial_Recognition_System| ,  |natural_language_processing|Natural_Language_Processing| ,  |lip_reading|Lip_Reading| ,  |art_appreciation|Art_Criticism| ,  |interpreting_emotional_behaviours|Affective_Computing| ,  |automated_reasoning|Automated_Reasoning| ,  |spacecraft_piloting|Robotic_Spacecraft|  and  |playing_chess|Computer_Chess| .         2001: A Space Odyssey  |Urbana,_Illinois|Urbana,_Illinois| , at the HAL Plant . The film says this occurred in 1992, while the book gives 1997 as HALs birth year.      In  2001: A Space Odyssey  , HAL is initially considered a dependable member of the crew, maintaining ship functions and engaging genially with its human crew-mates on an equal footing. As a recreational activity,  |Frank_Poole|Frank_Poole|  plays chess  |against_HAL|Poole_Versus_Hal_9000| . In the film, the artificial intelligence is shown to triumph easily. However, as time progresses, HAL begins to malfunction in subtle ways and, as a result, the decision is made to shut down HAL in order to prevent more serious malfunctions. The sequence of events and manner in which HAL is shut down differs between the novel and film versions of the story. In the aforementioned game of chess HAL makes minor and undetected mistakes in his analysis, a possible foreshadowing to HALs malfunctioning.     In the film, astronauts  |David_Bowman|David_Bowman|  and Frank Poole consider disconnecting HALs  |cognitive|Cognition|  circuits when he appears to be mistaken in reporting the presence of a fault in the spacecrafts communications antenna. They attempt to conceal what they are saying, but are unaware that HAL can  |read_their_lips|Lip_Reading| . Faced with the prospect of disconnection, HAL decides to kill the astronauts in order to protect and continue its programmed directives. HAL uses one of the Discoverys EVA pods to kill Poole while he is repairing the ship. When Bowman, without space helmet, uses another pod to attempt to rescue Poole, HAL locks him out of the ship, then disconnects the life support systems of the other hibernating crew members. Bowman circumvents HALs control, entering the ship by manually opening an emergency airlock with his service pods clamps, detaching the pod door via its explosive bolts. Bowman jumps across empty space, reenters Discovery, and quickly re-pressurizes the airlock.     While HALs motivations are ambiguous in the film, the novel explains that the computer is unable to resolve a conflict between his general mission to relay information accurately, and orders specific to the mission requiring that he withhold from Bowman and Poole the true purpose of the mission.  With the crew dead, HAL reasons, he would not need to lie to them.     In the novel, the orders to disconnect HAL come from Dave and Franks superiors on Earth. After Frank is killed while attempting to repair the communications antenna he is pulled away into deep space using the safety tether which is still attached to both the pod and Frank Pooles spacesuit. Dave begins to revive his hibernating crew mates, but is foiled when HAL vents the ships atmosphere into the vacuum of space, killing the awakening crew members and almost killing Bowman, who is only narrowly saved when he finds his way to an emergency chamber which has its own oxygen supply and a spare space suit inside.     In both versions, Bowman then proceeds to shut down the machine. In the film, HALs central core is depicted as a crawlspace full of brightly lit computer modules mounted in arrays from which they can be inserted or removed. Bowman shuts down HAL by removing modules from service one by one; as he does so, HALs consciousness degrades. HAL finally reverts to material that was programmed into him early in his memory, including announcing the date he became operational as 12 January 1992 . When HALs logic is completely gone, he begins singing the song  |Daisy_Bell|Daisy_Bell|  and starts slowing down and changing pitch similar to an old electronic game running low on batteries. .   HALs final act of any significance is to prematurely play a prerecorded message from Mission Control which reveals the true reasons for the mission to Jupiter.     2010: Odyssey Two and 2010: The Year We Make Contact  2010: Odyssey Two , HAL is restarted by his creator, Dr. Chandra, who arrives on the Soviet spaceship  Leonov .     Prior to leaving Earth, Dr. Chandra has also had a discussion with HALs twin, the SAL 9000. Like HAL, SAL was created by Dr. Chandra. Whereas HAL was characterized as being male , SAL is characterized as being female  and is represented by a blue camera eye instead of a red one.     Dr. Chandra discovers that HALs crisis was caused by a programming contradiction: he was constructed for the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment , yet his orders, directly from Dr. Heywood Floyd at the National Council on Astronautics, required him to keep the discovery of the  |Monolith|Monolith|  TMA-1 a secret for reasons of  |national_security|National_Security| . This contradiction created a Hofstadter-Moebius loop , reducing HAL to  |paranoia|Paranoia| . Therefore, HAL made the decision to kill the crew, thereby allowing him to obey both his hardwired instructions to report data truthfully and in full, and his orders to keep the monolith a secret. In essence: if the crew were dead, he would no longer have to keep the information secret.     The alien intelligence initiates a terraforming scheme, placing the Leonov, and everybody in it, in danger. Its human crew devises an escape plan which unfortunately requires leaving the Discovery and HAL behind to be destroyed. Dr. Chandra explains the danger, and HAL willingly sacrifices himself so that the astronauts may escape safely. In the moment of his destruction the monolith-makers transform HAL into a  |non-corporeal|Incorporeality|  being so that David Bowmans avatar may have a companion.     The details in the novel and the 1984 film  2010: The Year We Make Contact  are nominally the same, with a few exceptions. First, in contradiction to the book , Heywood Floyd is absolved of responsibility for HALs condition; it is asserted that the decision to program HAL with information concerning TMA-1 came directly from the White House. In the film, HAL functions normally after being reactivated, while in the book it is revealed that his mind was damaged during the shutdown, forcing him to begin communication through screen text. Also, in the film the Leonov crew initially lies to HAL about the dangers that he faced , whereas in the novel he is told at the outset. However, in both cases the suspense comes from the question of what HAL will do when he knows that he may be destroyed by his actions.     In the novel, the basic reboot sequence initiated by Dr. Chandra is quite long, while the movie uses a shorter sequence voiced from HAL as: HELLODOCTORNAMECONTINUEYESTERDAYTOMORROW .     While Curnow tells Floyd that Dr. Chandra has begun designing the HAL 10000, the 10000 has not been mentioned in subsequent novels.     2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: The Final Odyssey 2061: Odyssey Three ,  |Heywood_Floyd|Heywood_R._Floyd|  is surprised to encounter HAL, now stored alongside Dave Bowman in the Europa monolith.     In Clarkes 1997 novel  3001: The Final Odyssey , Frank Poole is introduced to the merged form of Dave Bowman and HAL, the two merging into one entity called Halman after Bowman rescued HAL from the dying  Discovery One  spaceship toward the end of  2010: Odyssey Two .       Clarke noted that the first film was criticized for not having any characters except for HAL, and that a great deal of the establishing story on Earth was cut from the film .   Clarke stated that he had considered Autonomous Mobile Explorer  5 as a name for the computer, then decided on  |Socrates|Socrates|  when writing early drafts, switching in later drafts to  |Athena|Athena| , a computer with a female personality, before settling on HAL 9000.  The Socrates name was later used in Clarke and  |Stephen_Baxters|Stephen_Baxter|   A Time Odyssey  novel series.     The earliest draft depicted Socrates as a roughly humanoid robot, and is introduced as overseeing Project  |Morpheus|Morpheus| , which studied prolonged hibernation in preparation for long term space flight. As a demonstration to Senator Floyd, Socrates designer, Dr. Bruno Forster, asks Socrates to turn off the oxygen to hibernating subjects Kaminski and Whitehead, which Socrates refuses, citing  |Asimovs|Isaac_Asimov| |First_Law_of_Robotics|Laws_Of_Robotics| .      In a later version, in which Bowman and Whitehead are the non-hibernating crew of Discovery, Whitehead dies outside the spacecraft after his pod collides with the main antenna, tearing it free. This triggers the need for Bowman to revive Poole, but the revival does not go according to plan, and after briefly awakening, Poole dies. The computer, named  |Athena|Athena|  in this draft, announces All systems of Poole now No–Go. It will be necessary to replace him with a spare unit.  After this, Bowman decides to go out in a pod and retrieve the antenna, which is moving away from the ship. Athena refuses to allow him to leave the ship, citing Directive 15 which prevents it from being left unattended, forcing him to make program modifications during which time the antenna drifts further.      During rehearsals Kubrick asked  |Stefanie_Powers|Stefanie_Powers|  to supply the voice of HAL 9000 while searching for a suitably androgynous voice so the actors had something to react to. On the set, British actor  |Nigel_Davenport|Nigel_Davenport|  played HAL.   When it came to dubbing HAL in post-production, Kubrick had originally cast  |Martin_Balsam|Martin_Balsam| , but as he felt Balsam just sounded a little bit too colloquially American , he was replaced with  |Douglas_Rain|Douglas_Rain| , who had the kind of bland  |mid-Atlantic_accent|Mid-Atlantic_Accent|  we felt was right for the part .  Rain was only handed HALs lines instead of the full script, and recorded them across a day and a half.      HALs  |point_of_view_shots|Point_Of_View_Shot|  were created with a  |Cinerama|Cinerama|  Fairchild-Curtis  |wide-angle_lens|Wide-Angle_Lens|  with a 160°  |angle_of_view|Angle_Of_View| . This lens is about  in diameter, while HALs on set  |prop|Theatrical_Property|  eye lens is about  in diameter.  |Stanley_Kubrick|Stanley_Kubrick|  chose to use the large Fairchild-Curtis lens to shoot the HAL 9000 POV shots because he needed a wide-angle  |fisheye_lens|Fisheye_Lens|  that would fit onto his shooting camera, and this was the only lens at the time that would work. The Fairchild-Curtis lens has a focal length of  with a maximum aperture of 2.0 and a weight of approximately ; it was originally designed by Felix Bednarz  with a maximum aperture of 2.2 for the first Cinerama 360 film, Journey to the Stars, shown at the  |1962_Seattle_Worlds_Fair|1962_Seattle_Worlds_Fair| .  Bednarz adapted the lens design from an earlier lens he had designed for military training to simulate human peripheral vision coverage.  The lens was later recomputed for the second Cinerama 360 film  To the Moon and Beyond , which had a slightly different film format. To the Moon and Beyond was produced by Graphic Films and shown at the  |1964/1965_New_York_Worlds_Fair|1964/1965_New_York_Worlds_Fair| ,  where Kubrick watched it; afterwards, he was so impressed that he hired the same creative team from Graphic Films  to work on 2001.       A HAL 9000 face plate, without lens , was discovered in a junk shop in Paddington, London, in the early 1970s by Chris Randall.  This was found along with the key to HALs Brain Room. Both items were purchased for ten shillings .   Research revealed that the original lens was a Fish-eye-Nikkor 8  mm 8.  The collection was sold at a  |Christies|Christies|  auction in 2010 for £17,500  to film director  |Peter_Jackson|Peter_Jackson| .        HALs name, according to writer Arthur C. Clarke, is derived from Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer.  After the film was released, fans noticed HAL was a one-letter shift from the name  |IBM|Ibm|  and there has been much speculation since then that this was a dig at the large computer company, Ted Friedman, Electric Dreams: Computers in American Culture, NYU Press - 2005, page 101 something that has been denied by both Clarke and 2001 director  |Stanley_Kubrick|Stanley_Kubrick| . Clarke addressed the issue in his book The Lost Worlds of 2001   IBM was consulted during the making of the film and their logo can be seen on props in the film including the  |Pan_Am_Clippers|Orion_Iii_Spaceplaneorion_Iii_Spaceplane|  cockpit instrument panel and on the lower arm keypad on Pooles space suit. During production it was brought to IBMs attention that the films plot included a homicidal computer but they approved association with the film if it was clear any equipment failure was not related to their products.       HAL Communications Corporation is a real corporation, with facilities located in  |Urbana,_Illinois|Urbana,_Illinois| ,  which is where HAL in the movie identifies himself as being activated: I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H-A-L plant in Urbana Illinois on the 12th of January 1992.      The former president of HAL Communications, Bill Henry, has stated that this is a coincidence: There was not and never has been any connection to Hal, Arthur Clarkes intelligent computer in the screen play 2001 — later published as a book. We were very surprised when the movie hit the Coed Theatre on campus and discovered that the movies computer had our name. We never had any problems with that similarity - Hal for the movie and HAL for our small company. But, from time-to-time, we did have issues with others trying to use HAL. That resulted in us paying lawyers. The offenders folded or eventually went out of business.        The scene in which HALs consciousness degrades was inspired by Clarkes memory of a  |speech_synthesis|Speech_Synthesis|  demonstration by physicist  |John_Larry_Kelly,_Jr.|John_Larry_Kelly,_Jr.| , who used an  |IBM_704|Ibm_704|  computer to synthesize speech. Kellys voice recorder synthesizer  vocoder  recreated the song  |Daisy_Bell|Daisy_Bell|  , with musical accompaniment from  |Max_Mathews|Max_Mathews| .      HALs capabilities, like all the technology in 2001, were based on the speculation of respected scientists.  |Marvin_Minsky|Marvin_Minsky| , director of the  |MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory|Mit_Computer_Science_And_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory|  and one of the most influential researchers in the field, was an adviser on the film set.  In the mid-1960s, many  |computer_scientists|Computer_Scientist|  in the field of artificial intelligence were optimistic that machines with HALs capabilities would exist within a few decades. For example, AI pioneer  |Herbert_A._Simon|Herbert_A._Simon|  at  |Carnegie_Mellon_University|Carnegie_Mellon_University| , had predicted in 1965 that  |machines_will_be_capable,_within_twenty_years,_of_doing_any_work_a_man_can_do|Technological_Singularity|  , Quoted in , p. 109 the overarching premise being that the issue was  |one_of_computational_speed|Moores_Law|  rather than principle.       HAL is listed as the 13th-greatest film villain in the  |AFIs_100_Years...100_Heroes_&_Villains|Afis_100_Years...100_Heroes_&_Villains| .      The 9000th of the  |asteroids|Asteroid|  in the  |asteroid_belt|Asteroid_Belt| ,  |9000_Hal|List_Of_Minor_Planets:_8001–9000| , discovered on May 3, 1981 by E. Bowell at  |Anderson_Mesa_Station|Anderson_Mesa_Station| , is named after HAL 9000.       Nintendo collaborator and development studio HAL Laboratory, developer of the Kirby video game series and previous Super Smash Bros video game titles, presumably adopted its name as a reference to HAL 9000; however, according to Satoru Iwata in 2012, the name was chosen because each letter precedes the letters of IBM in the alphabet.
