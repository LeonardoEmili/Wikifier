Likewise, the  allomorph does not appear after stem-final  because the earlier clause for the  allomorph takes priority; the  allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phoneme because the preceding clause for the  takes priority.     Irregular past tense forms, such as broke or was/ were, can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items, such as the verb break, which take priority over the general cases listed above.
