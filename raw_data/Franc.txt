The countries that use francs include  |Switzerland|Switzerland| ,  |Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein| , and most of  |Francophone_Africa|Francophone_Africa| .

The French franc symbol was F or Fr.; the symbol  |₣|₣|  was suggested in France by Prime Minister  |Édouard_Balladur|Édouard_Balladur| , but it was never used.

In the Luxembourgish language, the word for franc is Frang, plural form Frangen.          The franc was originally a French  |gold|Gold|  coin of 3.87  g minted in 1360 on the occasion of the release of King  |John_II|John_Ii_Of_France| , held by the English since his capture at the  |Battle_of_Poitiers|Battle_Of_Poitiers|  four years earlier.

In the 1870s the gold value was made the fixed standard, a situation which was to continue until 1914.     In 1926  |Belgium|Belgium|  as well as France experienced depreciation and an abrupt collapse of confidence, leading to the introduction of a new gold currency for international transactions, the belga of 5 francs, and the countrys withdrawal from the monetary union, which ceased to exist at the end of the year. The 1921 monetary union of Belgium and Luxembourg survived, however, forming the basis for full economic union in 1932.
