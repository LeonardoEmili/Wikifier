Transport in Kyrgyzstan  is severely constrained by the countrys alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of  altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mud slides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions. Additional problems are because many roads and railway lines built during the  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. The  |horse|Horse|  is still a much used transport option, especially in rural and inaccessible areas, as it does not depend on imported  |fuel|Fuel| . For transport in the Soviet Union, see  |Transport_in_the_Soviet_Union|Transport_In_The_Soviet_Union| .             The  |Kyrgyz_Railway|Kyrgyz_Railway|  is currently responsible for railway development and maintenance in the country. The  |Chuy_Valley|Chuy_Valley|  in the north and the  |Fergana_Valley|Fergana_Valley|  in the south were endpoints of the  |Soviet_Unions|Soviet_Union|  rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about 370  km of   |broad_gauge|Russian_Gauge|  in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centers as  |Tashkent|Tashkent| ,  |Almaty|Almaty|  and the cities of Russia.     There are vague plans about extending rail lines from  |Balykchy|Balykchy|  in the north and/or from  |Osh|Osh|  in the south into the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| , but the cost of construction would be enormous.          |Kazakhstan|Transport_In_Kazakhstan|  - yes -  |Bishkek|Bishkek|  branch - same gauge    |Uzbekistan|Transport_In_Uzbekistan|  - yes -  |Osh|Osh|  branch - same gauge    |Tajikistan|Transport_In_Tajikistan|  - no - same gauge    |China|Transport_In_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  - no -  |Break_of_gauge|Break_Of_Gauge|  /           With support from the  |Asian_Development_Bank|Asian_Development_Bank| , a major road linking the north and southwest from  |Bishkek|Bishkek|  to  |Osh|Osh|  has recently been completed. This considerably eases communication between the two major population centers of the countryâ€”the  |Chuy_Valley|Chuy_Valley|  in the north and the  |Fergana_Valley|Fergana_Valley|  in the South. An offshoot of this road branches off across a 3,500 meter  |pass|Mountain_Pass|  into the  |Talas_Valley|Talas_Valley|  in the northwest. Plans are now being formulated to build a major road from Osh into the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| .     The total length of the road network in  |Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan|  is approximately 34,000  km. Of them, 18,810  km are public roads directly subordinated to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and 15,190  km - other roads . By their status the roads of the Ministry of Transport and Communications are classified as:   international roads: 4,163  km   state roads: 5,678  km   local roads: 8,969  km     By nature of surface there can be distinguished:   hard-surfaced roads: 7,228  km   gravel roads: 9,961  km   earth roads: 1,621  km       Frequent bus and, more commonly, minibus, service connects countrys major cities.  |Minibuses|Marshrutka|  provide public transit in cities and between cities to neighboring villages.       The limitations of Kyrgyzstans pipeline system are a major impediment to fuel distribution. In 2006 the country had 367 kilometers of natural gas pipeline and 16 kilometers of oil pipeline, after adding 167 kilometers of natural gas pipeline in 2003.         Water transport exists only on  |Issyk_Kul_Lake|Issyk_Kul_Lake| , and has drastically shrunk since the end of the Soviet Union.         Kyrgyzstans only port is  |Balykchy|Balykchy| , a fishing town on  |Issyk_Kul_Lake|Issyk_Kul_Lake| . None of Kyrgyzstans rivers is navigable, and the country has no canals. .  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress| |Federal_Research_Division|Federal_Research_Division|  .

At the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today.     There are four airports with international flights, namely in Bishkek , Osh , Tamchy and Karakol .     Manas International Airport near Bishkek is the main international terminal, with flights to Moscow , Tashkent , Dushanbe , Istanbul , Baku and London .   Osh Airport is the main air terminal in the south, with daily connections to Bishkek and beyond.

Issyk-Kul International Airport is linked to Almaty in summers by flights operated by SCAT on Yakovlev YAK-42 Bishkek, Jalal-Abad and Osh.   Karakol International Airport is linked to Almaty in winters by flights operated by SCAT on Antonov AN-24 .   Kazarman Airport is linked to Jalal-Abad, Osh and Bishkek by flights operated by Sky Bishkek on Saab-340 .   Kerben Airport is linked to Jalal-Abad and Bishkek by flights operated by Sky Bishkek on Saab-340 .   Other airports, aerodromes and landing strips are located in Toktogul , Kanysh-Kiya , Ala-Buka , Sakaldy in Nooken District , Batken , Isfana , Kyzyl-Kiya , Naryn , Talas , Pokrovka , Cholpon-Ata , Tamga , Tokmok , Aravan and many other places.
