Papua New Guinea is largely  |mountainous|Mountainous| , and much of it is covered with tropical  |rainforest|Rainforest| . The  |New_Guinea_Highlands|New_Guinea_Highlands|  runs the length of New Guinea, and the highest areas receive snowfall—a rarity in the tropics. Within Papua New Guinea  |Mount_Wilhelm|Mount_Wilhelm|  is the highest peak, at . There are several major rivers, notably the  |Sepik_River|Sepik_River| , which is  long, which winds through lowland  |swamp|Swamp|  plains to the north coast, and the  |Fly_River|Fly_River|  at  in length, which flows through one of the largest  |swamplands|Swampland|  in the world to the south coast. The Highlands consist of a number of smaller ranges running west to east, such as the  |Finisterre_Range|Finisterre_Range|  which dominates the  |Huon_Peninsula|Huon_Peninsula|  to north of the city of  |Lae|Lae| . At  it is the worlds 3rd largest  |island_country|List_Of_Island_Countries| .     Papua New Guinea has one land border—that which divides the island of New Guinea. Across the 820  km border, the western half of New Guinea is officially known as  |Papua_province|Papua| , governed by  |Indonesia|Indonesia| . Papua New Guineas border with Indonesia is not straight; the border loops slightly to the west in the south-central part of New Guinea. Papua New Guineas  |Western_Province|Western_Province|  contains that loop. There are maritime borders with  |Australia|Australia|  to the south and  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands|  to the southeast.            Papua New Guinea has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water. This makes it the 3rd largest  |island_country|List_Of_Island_Countries|  in the world.  Its coastline is 5  152  km long.     The northernmost point is  |Mussau_Island|Mussau_Island|  , southernmost point is  |Hemenahei_Island|Hemenahei_Island|  , easternmost point is Olava,  |Bougainville|Bougainville_Island|  and the westernmost point is either  |Bovakaka|Bovakaka|  along the  |Fly_River|Fly_River|  border with Indonesia or  |Mabudawan|Mabudawan|  .     Papua New Guinea has  |several_volcanoes|List_Of_Volcanoes_In_Papua_New_Guinea| , as it is situated along the  |Pacific_Ring_of_Fire|Pacific_Ring_Of_Fire| . Volcanic eruptions are not rare, and the area is prone to  |earthquakes|Earthquakes|  and  |tsunamis|Tsunamis|  because of this. The volcanic disturbance can often cause severe earthquakes, which in turn can also cause tsunamis. Papua New Guinea is also prone to  |landslides|Landslides| , often caused by deforestation in major forests. The mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea are the areas most susceptible to landslides causing damage.     Offshore islands include the small, forested  |Admiralty_Islands|Admiralty_Islands| , the largest of which is  |Manus|Manus_Island| , to the north of the main island of New Guinea. These have a distinct plant and animal life from the main island but the natural forest has been cleared in places for logging and agriculture.         |Tropical|Tropical| ; northwest  |monsoon|Monsoon|  , southeast monsoon ; slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80  °F year round. But the higher altitudes are a constant 70  °F .          Maritime claims:   These are measured from claimed archipelagic baselines.

If the trend continues, more than half the forest that existed when Papua New Guinea became independent from Australia in 1975 will be gone by 2021.
