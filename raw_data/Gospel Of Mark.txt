        The Gospel According to Mark  is one of the four  |canonical_gospels|Canonical_Gospels|  and one of the three  |synoptic_gospels|Synoptic_Gospels| . It tells of the  |ministry_of_Jesus|Ministry_Of_Jesus|  from his  |baptism|Baptism_Of_Jesus|  by  |John_the_Baptist|John_The_Baptist|  to his death and burial and the discovery of the  |empty_tomb|Empty_Tomb|   – there is no  |genealogy_of_Jesus|Genealogy_Of_Jesus|  or birth narrative, nor, in the original ending at  |chapter_16|Mark_16| , any  |post_resurrection_appearances_of_Jesus|Post_Resurrection_Appearances_Of_Jesus| . It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action, an  |exorcist|Exorcism| , a healer, and a miracle worker. Jesus is also the  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God| , but he keeps his identity secret , concealing it in  |parables|Parables|  so that even most of the  |disciples|Disciple|  fail to understand. All this is in keeping with prophecy, which foretold the fate of the  |messiah|Messiah|  as  |suffering_servant|Suffering_Servant| . The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the  |resurrection|Resurrection_Of_Christ| .     Mark probably dates from AD 66–70. Most scholars reject the  |tradition|Tradition|  which ascribes it to  |John_Mark|John_Mark| , the companion of the apostle  |Peter|Apostle_Peter| , and regard it as anonymous, the work of an unknown author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.     Mark was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel,  |Matthew|Gospel_Of_Matthew| . The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from  |John|Gospel_Of_John| , and only distantly from Mark. It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and  |Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke| . The hypothesis of  |Marcan_priority|Marcan_Priority|  continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God| .                 The Gospel of Mark is anonymous. It was written in Greek for a gentile audience, probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch , and southern Syria have also been suggested. Early Christian tradition attributes it to the John Mark mentioned in Acts, but scholars generally reject this as an attempt to link the gospel to an authoritative figure. It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during  |Neros|Nero|  persecution of the Christians in Rome or the  |Jewish_revolt|First_Jewish–Roman_War| , as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution. The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories ,  |apocalyptic|Apocalyptic_Literature|  discourse , and collections of sayings .          The gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke bear a striking resemblance to each other, so much so that their contents can easily be set  |side_by_side_in_parallel_columns|Gospel_Harmonya_Parallel_Harmony_Presentation| . The fact that they share so much material verbatim and yet also exhibit important differences has led to a number of hypotheses explaining their interdependence, a phenomenon termed the  |Synoptic_Problem|Synoptic_Problem| . It is widely accepted that this was  |the_first_gospel|Marcan_Priority|  and was used as a source by both Matthew and Luke, who agree with each other in their sequence of stories and events only when they also agree with Mark.     In the 19th century the acceptance of Marks status as the earliest gospel led to the belief that it must therefore be the most reliable. This conclusion was shaken by two works published in the early decades of the 20th century: in 1901  |William_Wrede|William_Wrede|  argued strongly that the  |Messianic_secret|Messianic_Secret|  motif in Mark was a creation of the early church rather than a reflection of the historical Jesus; and in 1919 Karl Ludwig Schmidt showed how the links between the episodes are the invention of the writer, thus undermining the claim that the gospel is a reliable guide to the chronology of Jesus mission. The gospel is nevertheless still seen as the most reliable of the four in terms of its overall description of Jesuss life and ministry.       Christianity began within  |Judaism|Judaism| , with a Christian church  that arose shortly after his death, when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead. From the outset, Christians depended heavily on  |Jewish_literature|Jewish_Literature| , supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures. Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the  |son_of_God|Son_Of_God|  and the  |son_of_man|Son_Of_Man| , the  |suffering_servant|Suffering_Servant| , the  |Day_of_the_Lord|Day_Of_The_Lord| , and the  |kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| . Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ. The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.     The gospels were written for an audience already Christian  – their purpose was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, not to convert unbelievers. Christian churches were small communities of believers, often based on households , and the evangelists often wrote on two levels, one the historical presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the authors own day. Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew and those of the early church . More fundamentally, some scholars believe Marks reason for writing was to counter believers who saw Jesus in a Greek way, as wonder-worker ; Mark saw the suffering of the messiah as essential, so that the Son of God title had to be corrected and amplified with the Son of Man title, which conveyed  |Christs_suffering|Passion_Of_Jesus| . Some scholars think Mark might have been writing as a Galilean Christian against those Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who saw the Jewish revolt against Rome as the beginning of the  |end_times|End_Time|  : for Mark, the Second Coming would be in Galilee, not Jerusalem, and not until the generation following the revolt.               There is no agreement on the structure of Mark. There is, however, a widely recognised break at  Peters confession at Mark 8:27–30 that Jesus is the messiah thus forms the watershed to the whole gospel. A further generally recognised turning point comes at the end of chapter 10, when Jesus and his followers arrive in Jerusalem and the foreseen confrontation with the Temple authorities begins, leading  |R_T_France|R_T_France|  to characterise Mark as a three-act drama. James Edwards in his 2002 commentary points out that the gospel can be seen as a series of questions asking first who Jesus is , then what form his mission takes , while another scholar, C. Myers, has made what Edwards calls a compelling case for recognising the incidents of Jesus baptism,  |transfiguration|Transfiguration_Of_Christ|  and crucifixion, at the beginning, middle and end of the gospel, as three key moments, each with common elements, and each portrayed in an apocalyptic light. Stephen H. Smith has made the point that the structure of Mark is similar to the structure of a  |Greek_tragedy|Greek_Tragedy| .  |Satan|Satan| ; John is arrested, and Jesus begins to preach the good news of the  |kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| .   Jesus gathers his disciples; he begins teaching, driving out demons, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, raising the dead, feeding the hungry, and giving sight to the blind; he delivers a long discourse in  |parables|Parable|  to the crowd, intended for the disciples, but they fail to understand; he performs mighty works, calming the storm and walking on water, but while God and demons recognise him, neither the crowds nor the disciples grasp his identity. He also has several run-ins with Jewish law keepers especially in chapters 2-3.   Jesus asks the disciples who people say he is, and then, but you, who do you say I am? Peter answers that he is the Christ, and Jesus commands him to silence; Jesus explains that the Son of Man must go to Jerusalem and be killed, but will rise again;  |Moses|Moses|  and  |Elijah|Elijah|  appear with Jesus and God tells the disciples, This is my son, but they remain uncomprehending.   Jesus goes to Jerusalem, where he is hailed as one who comes in the name of the Lord and will inaugurate the kingdom of David ; he drives those who buy and sell animals from the Temple and debates with the Jewish authorities; on the Mount of Olives he announces the coming destruction of the Temple, the persecution of his followers, and the coming of the  |Son_of_Man|Son_Of_Man|  in power and glory.   A woman perfumes Jesus head with oil, and Jesus explains that this is a sign of his coming death; Jesus celebrates  |Passover|Passover|  with the disciples, declares the bread and wine to be his body and blood, and goes with them to  |Gethsemane|Gethsemane|  to pray; there  |Judas|Judas_Iscariot|  betrays him to the Jews; interrogated by the high priest, he says that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and will return as Son of Man at Gods right hand; the Jewish leaders turn him over to  |Pilate|Pilate| , who has him crucified as one who claims to be king of the Jews ; Jesus, abandoned by the disciples, is buried in a rock tomb by a friendly member of the Jewish council.   The women who have followed Jesus come to the tomb on Sunday morning; they find it empty, and are told by a young man in a white robe to go and tell the others that Jesus has risen and has gone before them to Galilee; but they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid  ....         The earliest and most reliable manuscripts of Mark end at , with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb: the majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending, and this is supported by statements from the early Church Fathers Eusebius and Jerome. Two attempts were made to provide a more satisfactory conclusion. A minority of later manuscripts have what is called the shorter ending , an addition to  telling how the women told those around Peter all that the angel had commanded and how the message of eternal life was then sent out by Jesus himself. This addition differs from the rest of Mark both in style and in its understanding of Jesus. The overwhelming majority of manuscripts have the longer ending , , with accounts of the resurrected Jesus, the commissioning of the disciples to proclaim the gospel, and Christs ascension. This ending was possibly written in the early 2nd century and added later in the same century.     Modern scholars have proposed many explanations for the abrupt original ending, though none with universal acceptance. It could indicate a connection to the theme of the  |Messianic_Secret|Messianic_Secret|  . Whatever the case, it is clear that Marks Jesus looks forward to a post-death meeting in Galilee, and it is likely that at that meeting, like the final meeting in Galilee that Matthew depicts, Marks Jesus would command the disciples to take his message to the nations.                 The author introduces his work as gospel , meaning good news , a literal translation of the Greek evangelion   – he uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament besides Paul. Paul uses it to mean the good news of Christ ; Mark extends it to the career of Christ as well as his death and resurrection. Like the other gospels, Mark was written to confirm the identity of Jesus as  |eschatological_deliverer|Eschatology|   – the purpose of terms such as  |messiah|Messiah|  and  |son_of_God|Son_Of_God|  . As in all the gospels, the messianic identity of Jesus is supported by a number of themes, including: the depiction of his disciples as obtuse, fearful and uncomprehending; the refutation of the charge made by Jesus enemies that he was a magician; secrecy surrounding his true identity .       In Mark, the disciples, and especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the way of suffering to flight and denial  – even the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct erroneous views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the converts usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the suffering just one portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the  |Suffering_Servant|Suffering_Servant|  passages in  |Isaiah|Book_Of_Isaiah| . It also reflects the Jewish scripture theme of Gods love being met by infidelity and failure, only to be renewed by God. And in the real-world context in which the gospel was written, the persecutions of the Christians of Rome under Nero , the failure of the disciples and Jesus denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation.       Mark contains twenty accounts of miracles and healings, accounting for almost a third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel. In the gospels as a whole, Jesus miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of Gods rule, but Marks descriptions of Jesus healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness and magic formulae , were those of a magician. This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist . There was  ... no period in the history of the empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society, subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen. All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him. The point of the  |Beelzebub|Beelzebub|  incident in Mark is to set forth Jesus claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.          In 1901,  |William_Wrede|William_Wrede|  identified the Messianic secret  – Jesus secrecy about his identity as the messiah  – as one of Marks central themes. Wrede argued that the elements of the secret  – Jesus silencing of the demons, the obtuseness of the disciples regarding his identity, and the concealment of the truth inside parables  – were fictions and arose from the tension between the Churchs post-resurrection messianic belief and the historical reality of Jesus. There remains continuing debate over how far the secret originated with Mark and how far he got it from tradition, and how far, if at all, it represents the self-understanding and practices of the historical Jesus.           |Christology|Christology|  means a doctrine or understanding concerning the person or nature of Christ. In the New Testament writings it is frequently conveyed through the titles applied to Jesus. Most scholars agree that Son of God is the most important of these titles in Mark. It appears on the lips of God himself at the  |baptism|Baptism_Of_Jesus|  and the  |transfiguration|Transfiguration_Of_Jesus| , and is Jesus own self-designation . These and other instances provide reliable evidence of how the evangelist perceived Jesus, but it is not clear just what the title meant to Mark and his 1st century audience. Where it appears in the Hebrew scriptures it meant Israel as Gods people, or the king at his coronation, or angels, as well as the suffering righteous man. In Hellenistic culture the same phrase meant a divine man , a supernatural being. There is little evidence that son of God was a title for the messiah in 1st century Judaism, and the attributes which Mark describes in Jesus are much more those of the Hellenistic miracle-working divine man than of the Jewish Davidic messiah.     Mark does not explicitly state what he means by Son of God , nor when the sonship was conferred. The New Testament as a whole presents four different understandings:   Jesus became Gods son at his resurrection, God begetting Jesus to a new life by raising him from the dead  – this was the earliest understanding, preserved in Pauls  |Epistle_to_the_Romans|Epistle_To_The_Romans| , 1:3–4, and in  |Acts|Acts_Of_The_Apostles|  13:33;   Jesus became Gods son at his  |baptism|Baptism_Of_Jesus| , the coming of the  |Holy_Spirit|Holy_Spirit|  marking him as messiah, while Son of God refers to the relationship then established for him by God  – this is the understanding implied in ;   Matthew and Luke present Jesus as Son of God from the moment of conception and birth, with God taking the place of a human father;   John, the last of the gospels, presents the idea that the Christ was pre-existent and became flesh as Jesus  – an idea also found in Paul.     Mark also calls Jesus christos , translating the Hebrew messiah, . In the Old Testament the term messiah described prophets, priests and kings; by the time of Jesus, with the kingdom long vanished, it had come to mean an  |eschatological_king|Eschatology|  , one who would be entirely human though far greater than all Gods previous messengers to Israel, endowed with miraculous powers, free from sin, ruling in justice and glory . The most important occurrences are in the context of Jesus death and suffering, suggesting that, for Mark, Jesus can only be fully understood in that context.     A third important title,  |Son_of_Man|Son_Of_Man|  , has its roots in  |Ezekiel|Book_Of_Ezekiel| , the  |Book_of_Enoch|Book_Of_Enoch| , , and especially in  |Daniel_7|Daniel_7|  Mark 14:62 combines more scriptural allusions: before he comes on clouds the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God , pointing to the equivalence of the three titles, Christ, Son of God, Son of Man, the common element being the reference to kingly power.        |Eschatology|Eschatology|  means the study of the end-times, and the Jews expected the  |messiah|Messiah|  to be an  |eschatological|Eschatology|  figure, a deliverer who would appear at the end of the age to usher in an earthly kingdom. The earliest Jewish Christian community saw Jesus as a  |messiah|Messiah|  in this Jewish sense, a human figure appointed by God as his earthly regent; but they also believed in Jesus resurrection and exultation to heaven, and for this reason they also viewed him as Gods agent who would return in glory ushering in the  |Kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| .     The term  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God|  likewise had a specific Jewish meaning, or range of meanings, one of the most significant being the earthly king adopted by God as his son at his enthronement, legitimising his rule over Israel. In Hellenistic culture, in contrast, the phrase meant a divine man , covering legendary heroes like  |Hercules|Hercules| , god-kings like the Egyptian  |pharaohs|Pharaoh| , or famous philosophers like  |Plato|Plato| . When the gospels call Jesus Son of God the intention is to place him in the class of Hellenistic and Greek divine men, the sons of God who were endowed with supernatural power to perform healings, exorcisms and other wonderful deeds. Marks Son of David is Hellenistic, his Jesus predicting that his mission involves suffering, death and resurrection, and, by implication, not military glory and conquest. This reflects a move away from the Jewish-Christian apocalyptic tradition and towards the Hellenistic message preached by Paul, for whom Christs death and resurrection, rather than the establishment of the apocalyptic Jewish kingdom, is the meaning of salvation, the gospel .              All four gospels tell a story in which Jesus death and resurrection are the crucial redemptive events. There are, however, important differences between the four: Unlike  |John|Gospel_Of_John| , Mark never calls Jesus God , or claims that Jesus existed prior to his earthly life; unlike  |Matthew|Gospel_Of_Matthew|  and  |Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke| , the author does not mention a virgin birth, and apparently believes that Jesus had a normal human parentage and birth; unlike Matthew and Luke, he makes no attempt to trace Jesus ancestry back to  |King_David|King_David|  or  |Adam|Adam|  with a genealogy.     Christians of Marks time expected Jesus to return as Messiah in their own lifetime  – Mark, like the other gospels, attributes the promise to Jesus himself , and it is reflected in the letters of  |Paul|Apostle_Paul| , in the  |epistle_of_James|Epistle_Of_James| , in  |Hebrews|Epistle_To_The_Hebrews| , and in  |Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| . When return failed, the early Christians revised their understanding. Some acknowledged that the  |Second_Coming|Second_Coming|  had been delayed, but still expected it; others redefined the focus of the promise, the  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John| , for example, speaking of eternal life as something available in the present; while still others concluded that Jesus would not return at all .     Marks despairing death of Jesus was changed to a more victorious one in subsequent gospels. Marks Christ dies with the cry,  |My_God_my_God_why_have_you_forsaken_me?|My_God_My_God_Why_Have_You_Forsaken_Me?|  ; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesuss death is the beginning of the resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Marks cry of despair with one of submission to Gods will ; while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan.  |Sabbath|Biblical_Sabbath|  was made for man, not man for the Sabbath . Similar to a rabbinical saying from the 2nd century BC, The Sabbath is given over to you and not you to the Sabbath.  Not present in either  or . This is also a so-called Western non-interpolation .
