Mountains cover much of northern Thailand and extend along the Myanmar border down through the  |Kra_Isthmus|Kra_Isthmus|  and the  |Malay_Peninsula|Malay_Peninsula| . The central plain is a lowland area drained by the  |Chao_Phraya_River|Chao_Phraya_River|  and its  |tributaries|Tributaries_Of_The_Chao_Phraya_River| , the countrys principal river system, which feeds into the delta at the head of the  |Bay_of_Bangkok|Bay_Of_Bangkok| . The Chao Phraya system drains about one-third of the nations territory. In the northeastern part of the country the  |Khorat_Plateau|Khorat_Plateau| , a region of gently rolling low hills and shallow lakes, drains into the Mekong through the  |Mun_River|Mun_River| . The Mekong system empties into the  |South_China_Sea|South_China_Sea|  and includes a series of canals and dams.     Together, the Chao Phraya and Mekong systems sustain  |Thailands_agricultural_economy|Agriculture_In_Thailand|  by supporting wet-rice cultivation and providing waterways for the transport of goods and people. In contrast, the distinguishing natural features of peninsular Thailand are long coastlines, offshore islands, and diminishing mangrove swamps.

They are, namely: the North Region, the Northeast Region, the Central Region, the East Region, the West Region and the South Region of Thailand. Although Bangkok geographically is part of the central plain, as the capital and largest city this metropolitan area may be considered in other respects a separate region. Each of the six geographical regions differs from the others in population, basic resources, natural features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the regions is in fact the most pronounced attribute of Thailands physical setting.        |Northern_Thailand|Northern_Thailand|  is a  |mountainous|Mountainous|  area. Parallel mountain ranges extend from the  |Daen_Lao_Range|Daen_Lao_Range|  , in the southern region of the  |Shan_Hills|Shan_Hills| , in a north/south direction, the  |Dawna_Range|Dawna_Range|  forming the western border of Thailand between  |Mae_Hong_Son|Mae_Hong_Son|  and the  |Salween_River|Salween_River| ,   the  |Thanon_Thong_Chai_Range|Thanon_Thong_Chai_Range|  , the  |Khun_Tan_Range|Khun_Tan_Range|  , the  |Phi_Pan_Nam_Range|Phi_Pan_Nam_Range|  , as well as the western part of the  |Luang_Prabang_Range|Luang_Prabang_Range|  . ดร.กระมล ทองธรรมชาติ และคณะ, สังคมศึกษา ศาสนาและวัฒนธรรม ม.1, สำนักพิมพ์ อักษรเจริญทัศน์ อจท. จำกัด, 2548, หน้า 24-25     These high mountains are incised by steep river valleys and upland areas that border the central plain. Most rivers, including the  |Nan|Nan_River| ,  |Ping|Ping_River| ,  |Wang|Wang_River| , and  |Yom|Yom_River| , unite in the lowlands of the lower-north region and the upper-central region. The Ping River and the Nan River unite to form the  |Chao_Phraya_River|Chao_Phraya_River| . The northeastern part is drained by rivers flowing into the  |Mekong|Mekong|  basin, like the  |Kok|Kok_River|  and  |Ing|Ing_River| .     Traditionally, these natural features made possible several different types of agriculture, including wet-rice farming in the valleys and shifting cultivation in the uplands. The forested mountains also promoted a spirit of regional independence. Forests, including stands of teak and other economically useful hardwoods that once dominated the north and parts of the northeast, had diminished by the 1980s to 130,000  km². In 1961 they covered 56 percent of the country, but by the mid-1980s forestland had been reduced to less than 30 percent of Thailands total area.     During the winter months in mountainous northern Thailand, the temperature is cool enough for the cultivation of fruits such as  |lychees|Lychee|  and  |strawberries|Strawberry| .          The northeast, with its poor soils, is not favoured agriculturally. However, sticky rice, the staple food of the region, which requires flooded, poorly drained paddy fields, thrives and where fields can be flooded from nearby streams, rivers and ponds, often two harvests are possible each year. Cash crops such as sugar cane and  |manioc|Manioc|  are cultivated on a vast scale, and to a lesser extent, rubber.  |Silk|Silk|  production is an important cottage industry and contributes significantly to the economy.     The region consists mainly of the dry  |Khorat_Plateau|Khorat_Plateau|  which in some parts is extremely flat, and a few low but rugged and rocky hills, the  |Phu_Phan_Mountains|Phu_Phan_Mountains| . The short monsoon season brings heavy flooding in the river valleys. Unlike the more fertile areas of Thailand, the northeast has a long dry season, and much of the land is covered by sparse grasses. Mountains ring the plateau on the west and the south, and the Mekong delineates much of the northern and eastern rim. Some varieties of traditional medicinal herbs, particularly of the Genus  |Curcuma|Curcuma| , family  |Zingiberaceae|Zingiberaceae| , are indigenous to the region.       The heartland ,  |central_Thailand|Central_Thailand| , is a natural self-contained basin often termed the rice bowl of Asia. The complex irrigation system developed for wet-rice agriculture in this region provided the necessary economic support to sustain the development of the Thai state from the 13th century  |Sukhothai_Kingdom|Sukhothai_Kingdom|  to contemporary Bangkok. Here the rather flat unchanging landscape facilitated inland water and road transport. The fertile area was able to sustain a dense population, 422 people per square kilometer in 1987, compared with an average of 98 for the country as a whole. The terrain of the region is dominated by the Chao Phraya and its tributaries and by the cultivated paddy fields. Metropolitan Bangkok, the focal point of trade, transport, and industrial activity, is on the southern edge of the region at the head of the Gulf of Thailand and includes part of the Chao Phraya delta.        |Eastern_Thailand|Eastern_Thailand|  lies between the  |Sankamphaeng_Range|Sankamphaeng_Range| , which forms the border of the northeastern plateau to the north, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south. The western end of the  |Cardamom_Mountains|Cardamom_Mountains| , known in Thailand as Thio Khao Banthat, extends into eastern Thailand. The geography of the region is characterised by short mountain ranges alternating with small basins of short rivers which drain into the Gulf of Thailand.     Fruit is a major component of agriculture in the area, and tourism plays a strong part in the economy. The regions  |coastal_location|Eastern_Seaboard_Of_Thailand|  has helped promote industrial development, a major factor in the economy of the region.       Thailands long mountainous border with Myanmar continues south from the north into  |western_Thailand|Western_Thailand|  with the  |Tenasserim_Hills|Tenasserim_Hills| , known in Thailand as Thio Khao Tanaosi . The geography of the western region of Thailand, like the north, is characterised by high mountains and steep river valleys.     Western Thailand hosts much of Thailands less-disturbed forest areas. Water and minerals are also important natural resources. The region is home to many of the countrys major dams, and mining is an important industry in the area.        |Southern_Thailand|Southern_Thailand| , part of a narrow peninsula, is distinctive in climate, terrain, and resources. Its economy is based on tourism, and palm oil and rubber plantations. In Krabi Province, for example, palm plantations occupy 980,000  |rai|Rai|  , or 52 percent of the provinces farmland.  Other sources of income include coconut plantations, tin mining. Rolling and mountainous terrain and the absence of large rivers are conspicuous features of the south. North-south mountain barriers and impenetrable tropical forest caused the early isolation and separate political development of this region. International access through the  |Andaman_Sea|Andaman_Sea|  and the Gulf of Thailand made the south a crossroads for both  |Theravada_Buddhism|Theravada_Buddhism| , centered at  |Nakhon_Si_Thammarat|Nakhon_Si_Thammarat| , and  |Islam|Islam| , especially in the former  |Pattani_Kingdom|Pattani_Kingdom|  on the border with Malaysia.          Thailands regions are divided politically into a total of  |76_provinces|Provinces_Of_Thailand|  plus Bangkok, which is a special administrative area.                  Thailands climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character .   The southwest monsoon, which starts from May until October is characterized by movement of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean to Thailand, causing abundant rain over most of the country.  The northeast monsoon, starting from October until February brings cold and dry air from China over most of Thailand.  In southern Thailand, the northeast monsoon brings mild weather and abundant rainfall on the eastern coast of that region.  Most of Thailand has a tropical wet and dry or savanna climate type .  The majority of the south as well as the eastern tip of the east have a  |tropical_monsoon_climate|Tropical_Monsoon_Climate| . Parts of the south also have a  |tropical_rainforest_climate|Tropical_Rainforest_Climate| .     Thailand has three seasons.  The first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season which prevails over most of the country.  This season is characterized by abundant rain with August and September being the wettest period of the year.  This can occasionally lead to floods.  In addition to rainfall caused by the southwest monsoon, the  |Intertropical_Convergence_Zone|Intertropical_Convergence_Zone|  and tropical  |cyclones|Cyclones|  also contribute to producing heavy rainfall during the rainy season.  Nonetheless, dry spells commonly occur for 1 to 2 weeks from June to early July.  This is due to the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone to southern China.  Winter or the northeast monsoon starts from mid–October until mid–February.  Most of Thailand experiences dry weather during this season with mild temperatures.  The exception is the southern parts of Thailand where it receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November.  Summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–February until mid–May and is characterized by warmer weather.      Due to its inland nature and latitude, the north, northeast, central, and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather.  During the hottest time of the year , temperatures usually reach up to  or more with the exception of coastal areas where sea breezes moderate afternoon temperatures.  In contrast, outbreaks of cold air from China can bring colder temperatures; in some cases close to or below .  Southern Thailand is characterized by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences.      Most of the country receives a mean annual rainfall of .  However, certain areas on the windward sides of mountains such as Ranong province in the west coast of southern Thailand and eastern parts of Trat Province receive more than  of rainfall per year.  The driest areas are on the leeward side in the central valleys and northernmost portion of south Thailand where mean annual rainfall is less than .  Most of Thailand is characterized by dry weather during the northeast monsoon and abundant rainfall during the southwest monsoon.  In the southern parts of Thailand, abundant rainfall occurs in both the northeast and southwest monsoon seasons with a peak in September for the western coast and a peak in November–January on the eastern coast.      Thailand is good 2007-2008 season lasted only from late-November through to mid-March. Its red, laterite, dense clayey soils retain water well, which limits their agricultural potential for many crops, but is ideal for keeping water in paddy fields and local village reservoirs. The well-drained, loose sandy alluvium of the Mekong flood plain is very fertile, the main crops being tomatoes, tobacco, and pineapples, grown on an industrial-scale.       |Tin|Tin| ,  |rubber|Rubber| ,  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas| ,  |tungsten|Tungsten| ,  |tantalum|Tantalum| ,  |timber|Timber| ,  |lead|Lead| ,  |fish|Fish| ,  |gypsum|Gypsum| ,  |lignite|Lignite| ,  |fluorite|Fluorite| , arable land.         |Thammasat_University|Thammasat_University| , estimates that about 59 percent of all arable land in Thailand belongs to the state.  the  |Treasury_Department|Ministry_Of_Finance|  owned 176,467 plots of land, consisting of about 9.9 million rai .

Although neither  |China|China|  nor  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  border Thailand, their territories lie within 100  km of Thai territory.     Many parts of Thailands boundaries follow natural features, such as the Mekong. Most borders were stabilized and demarcated in the late-19th and early-20th centuries in accordance with treaties forced on Thailand and its neighbors by Britain and France. In some areas, however, exact boundaries, especially along Thailands eastern borders with Laos and Cambodia, are still disputed.     Adding to general border tensions were the activities of communist-led insurgents, whose operations were of paramount concern to the Thai government and its security forces for several decades. The problem of communist insurgency was compounded by the activity of what the Thai government labelled antistate elements . Often the real source of border problems was ordinary criminals or local merchants involved in illegal mining, logging, smuggling, and narcotics production and trade.          Cambodias disputes with Thailand after 1951 arose in part from ill-defined boundaries and changes in Frances colonial fortunes. Recently, the most notable case has been a dispute over  |Prasat_Preah_Vihear|Prasat_Preah_Vihear|  submitted to the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| , which ruled in favor of Cambodia in 1962. During the years that the Cambodian capital,  |Phnom_Penh|Phnom_Penh| , was controlled by the  |Khmer_Rouge|Khmer_Rouge|  regime of  |Pol_Pot|Pol_Pot|  , the border disputes continued.          Demarcation is complete except for certain Mekong islets. The border is marked by the Mekong: at high water during the rainy season, the centre line of the current is the border, while during low water periods, all islands, mudbanks, sandbanks, and rocks that are revealed belong to Laos.          In contrast to dealings with Cambodia, which attracted international attention, boundary disputes with Malaysia are usually handled more cooperatively. Continuing mineral exploration and fishing, however, are sources of potential conflict. A one kilometre segment at the mouth of the  |Kolok_River|Kolok_River|  remained in dispute with Malaysia as of 2004.          Significant differences remain with Myanmar over boundary alignment and the handling of ethnic rebels, refugees, and the drug trade, in addition to mineral exploration and fishing rights. Groups in both countries have expressed concern over the  |Peoples_Republic_of_Chinas|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  construction of 13 hydroelectric dams on the  |Salween_River|Salween_River|  in  |Yunnan|Yunnan| .
