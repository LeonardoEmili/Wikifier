The modern state of  |Guinea|Guinea|  did not come into existence until 1958, but the history of the area stretches back well before  |European_colonization|Scramble_For_Africa| . Its current boundaries were determined during the colonial period by the  |Berlin_Conference|Berlin_Conference|  and the French, who ruled Guinea until 1958.       What is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major  |West_Africa|West_Africa| n empires. The  |Ghana_Empire|Ghana_Empire|  is believed to be the earliest of these which grew on trade but contracted and ultimately fell due to the hostile influence of the  |Almoravids|Almoravids| . It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region.     The  |Sosso|Sosso|  kingdom briefly flourished in the void but the Islamic  |Mandinka|Mandinka_People| |Mali_Empire|Mali_Empire|  came to prominence when  |Soundiata_Kéïta|Sundiata_Keita|  defeated the Sosso ruler,  |Sumanguru_Kanté|Soumaoro_Kanté|  at the semi-historical  |Battle_of_Kirina|Battle_Of_Kirina|  in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by  |Mansa|Mansa|  , the most famous being  |Kankou_Moussa|Musa_I_Of_Mali| , who made a famous  |hajj|Hajj|  to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its  |vassal|Vassal|  states in the 15th century.     The most successful of these was the  |Songhai_Empire|Songhai_Empire| , expanding its power from about 1460, and eventually surpassing the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of  |Askia_Daoud|Askia_Daoud|  in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from  |Morocco|Morocco|  at the  |Battle_of_Tondibi|Battle_Of_Tondibi|  just 3 years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.       After the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea.           |Fulani|Fulani|  Muslims migrated to  |Futa_Jallon|Futa_Jallon|  in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers.          The Wassoulou empire was a short-lived empire, led by  |Samory_Touré|Samory_Touré|  in the predominantly  |Malinké|Mandinka_People|  area of what is now upper  |Guinea|Guinea|  and southwestern  |Mali|Mali|  . It moved to  |Ivory_Coast|Ivory_Coast|  before being conquered by the French.          The  |slave_trade|Slave_Trade|  came to the coastal region of Guinea with European adventurers in the 16th century. Slavery had always been part of everyday life but the scale increased as slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the  |triangular_trade|Triangular_Trade| .     Guineas colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of  |Samori_Touré|Samori_Touré| , Mansa of the  |Ouassoulou|Ouassoulou|  state and leader of Malinké descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.     France negotiated Guineas present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone| , the Portuguese for their Guinea colony , and  |Liberia|Liberia| . Under the French, the country formed the  |Territory_of_Guinea|French_Guinea|  within  |French_West_Africa|French_West_Africa| , administered by a governor general resident in  |Dakar|Dakar| . Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.       In 1958 the  |French_Fourth_Republic|French_Fourth_Republic|  collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially  |Indochina|Indochina|  and  |Algeria|Algeria| . The founding of a  |Fifth_Republic|French_Fifth_Republic|  was supported by the French people, while French President  |Charles_de_Gaulle|Charles_De_Gaulle|  made it clear on 8 August 1958 that Frances colonies were to be given a stark choice between more  |autonomy|Autonomous_Entity|  in a new  |French_Community|French_Community|  and immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958.     The other French colonies chose the former but Guinea — under the leadership of  |Ahmed_Sékou_Touré|Ahmed_Sékou_Touré|  whose  |Democratic_Party_of_Guinea|Democratic_Party_Of_Guinea|  had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections — voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on October 2, 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with Sékou Touré as president.            U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was hostile to Touré, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlins first success story in Africa. Following Frances withdrawal, Guinea quickly aligned itself with the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and adopted socialist policies. This alliance was short lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism. Nevertheless, President John F. Kennedy and his Peace Corps director  |Sargent_Shriver|Sargent_Shriver|  tried even harder than the Kremlins  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev| . By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington. Philip E. Muehlenbeck, Kennedy and Toure: A success in personal diplomacy. Diplomacy and Statecraft 19.1 : 69-95.  Guinea relied more and more on aid and investment from the U.S. Even the relationship with France improved, after the election of  |Valéry_Giscard_dEstaing|Valéry_Giscard_Destaing|  as president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.     By 1960, Touré had declared the PDG the only legal party. For the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one. Touré was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly. Advocating a hybrid  |African_Socialism|African_Socialism|  domestically and  |Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanism|  abroad, Touré quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning hundreds, and stifling free press.     At the same time, the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and broke ties with French government and companies. Vacillating between support for the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and the United States, Guineas economic situation became as unpredictable as its diplomatic line. Alleging plots and conspiracies against him at home and abroad, Touré’s regime targeted real and imagined opponents, driving thousands of political opponents into exile.     In 1970, Portuguese forces, from neighboring  |Portuguese_Guinea|Portuguese_Guinea| , staged  |Operation_Green_Sea|Operation_Green_Sea| , a raid into Guinea with the support of exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among other goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the  |PAIGC|Paigc| , a guerilla movement operating inside Portuguese Guinea.   Mr Sekou Touré, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...  ,  |The_Economist|The_Economist|    After several days of fierce fighting, the Portuguese forces retreated without achieving most of their goals. The regime of Sékou Touré increased the number of internal arrests and executions.     The  |Guinean_Market_Womens_Revolt|Guinean_Market_Womens_Revolt|  in 1977 resulted in the regimes softening of economic restrictions and began a turn away from the radical socialism previously practiced by the government.     Sékou Touré died on March 26, 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by  |Prime_Minister|Heads_Of_Government_Of_Guinea| |Louis_Lansana_Beavogui|Louis_Lansana_Beavogui| , who was to serve as interim president pending new elections.       The PDG was due to elect a new leader on April 3, 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. However, hours before that meeting, Colonels  |Lansana_Conté|Lansana_Conté|  and  |Diarra_Traoré|Diarra_Traoré|  seized power in a bloodless  |coup|Coup| . Conté assumed the role of president, with Traoré serving as prime minister until December.     Conté immediately denounced the previous regime’s record on  |human_rights|Human_Rights| , released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards  |democracy|Democracy| .     In 1992, Conté announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995  Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Contés grip on power remained tight. In September 2001 the opposition leader  |Alpha_Condé|Alpha_Condé|  was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.     In 2001 Conté organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Conté survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital  |Conakry|Conakry| . His opponents claimed that he was a tired dictator      whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents. Guinea still faces very real problems and according to  |Foreign_Policy|Foreign_Policy|  is in danger of becoming a  |failed_state|Failed_State| .          In 2000 Guinea became embroiled in the instability which had long blighted the rest of  |West_Africa|West_Africa|  as rebels crossed the borders with  |Liberia|Liberia|  and  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone|  and it seemed for a time that the country was headed for  |civil_war|Civil_War| .      Conté blamed neighbouring leaders for coveting Guineas natural resources, though these claims were strenuously denied.  In 2003 Guinea agreed plans with her neighbours to tackle the insurgents. In 2007 there were  |big_protests|2007_Guinean_General_Strike|  against the government, resulting in the appointment of a new prime minister.            In a  |coup_détat|Lansana_Conté1984_Guinean_Coup|  several hours following  |Tourés|Ahmed_Sékou_Touré|  death,  |Lansana_Conté|Lansana_Conté|  became the President. The constitution and parliament were suspended and a committee for national recovery was established. Conté remained in power until his death on 22 December 2008.
