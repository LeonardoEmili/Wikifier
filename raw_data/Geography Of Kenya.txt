The  |Anza_trough|Anza_Trough|  is a NW–SE trending Jurassic rift extending from the Indian Ocean coast to the Sudan northwest of Lake Turkana. The Anza Rift resulted from the break–up of  |Gondwana|Gondwana| .           The climate of Kenya varies by location, from mostly cool every day, to always warm/hot. The climate along the coast is tropical. This means rainfall and temperatures are higher throughout the year. At the coastal cities, Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi, the air changes from cool to hot, almost every day. .     The further inside Kenya, the more arid the climate becomes. An arid climate is nearly devoid of rainfall, and temperature swings widely according to the general time of the day/night. For many areas of Kenya, the daytime temperature rises about 12  °C , almost every day.     Elevation is the major factor in temperature levels, with the higher areas, on average, as 11  °C cooler, day or night.

Nairobi, at , ranges from , and  |Kitale|Kitale| , at , ranges from . At night, heavy clothes or blankets are needed, in the highlands, when the temperature drops to about  every night.     At lower altitudes, the increased temperature is like day and night, literally: like starting the morning at the highland daytime high, and then adding the heat of the day, again. Hence, the overnight low temperatures near sea level are nearly the same as the high temperatures of the elevated Kenyan highlands. However, locations along the Indian Ocean have more moderate temperatures, as a few degrees cooler in the daytime, such as at  |Mombasa|Mombasa|  .
