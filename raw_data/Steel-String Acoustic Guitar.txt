                      The steel-string acoustic guitar is a modern form of  |guitar|Guitar|  that descends from the nylon-strung  |classical_guitar|Classical_Guitar| , but is strung with  |steel|Steel| |_strings|String|  for a brighter, louder sound. Like the classical guitar, it is often referred to simply as an  acoustic guitar .     The most common type is often called a  |flat_top_guitar|Flat_Top_Guitar| , to distinguish it from the more specialized  |archtop_guitar|Archtop_Guitar|  and other variations.     The  |standard_tuning|Standard_Tuningplucked_Strings|  for an acoustic guitar is E-A-D-G-B-E , although many players, particularly  |fingerpickers|Fingerpicking| , use alternate tunings , such as  |open_G|Open_G_Tuning|  ,  |open_D|Open_D_Tuning|  , or  |drop_D|Drop_D_Tuning|  .       Steel-string guitars vary in construction and materials. Different woods and approach to bracing affect the instruments  |timbre|Timbre|  or tone. While there is little scientific evidence, many players and  |luthiers|Luthier|  believe a well-made guitars tone improves over time. They theorize that a decrease in the content of hemicellulose, crystallization of cellulose, and changes to lignin over time all result in its wood gaining better resonating properties.        Steel-string acoustic guitars are commonly constructed in several body types, varying in size, depth, and proportion. In general, the guitars soundbox can be thought of as composed of two mating chambers: the upper bouts  on the neck end of the body, and lower bouts . These meet at the waist, or the narrowest part of the body face near the soundhole. The proportion and overall size of these two parts helps determine the overall tonal balance and native sound of a particular body style – the larger the body, the louder the volume.     The 00, double-O or grand concert body type is the major body style most directly derived from the classical guitar. It has the thinnest soundbox and the smallest overall size, making it very comfortable to play but lacking in projection -volume - relative to the larger types. Its smaller size makes it suitable for younger or smaller-framed players. It is commonly called a parlor steel , as it is well-suited to smaller rooms.  |Martins|C_F_Martin_Company|  00-xxx series and  |Taylors|Taylor_Guitars|  x12 series are common examples.   The grand auditorium guitar, sometimes called the 000 or the triple-O is very similar in design to the grand concert, but slightly wider and deeper. Many 000-style guitars also have a convex back to increase the physical volume of the soundbox without making it deeper at the edges, which would affect comfort and playability. The result is a very balanced tone, comparable to the 00 but with greater volume and dynamic range and slightly more low-end response, making this Classically shaped body style very popular.  |Eric_Claptons|Eric_Clapton|  signature Martin, for example, is of this style. Martins 000-xxx series and Taylors x14 series are well-known examples of the grand auditorium style.   The  dreadnought  is a large-bodied guitar which incorporates a deeper soundbox, but a smaller and less-pronounced upper bout than most styles. Its size and power gave rise to its name, from the most formidable class of warship at the time of its creation in the early 20th century. The style was designed by  |Martin_Guitars|Martin_Guitars|   to produce a deeper sound than classic -style guitars, with very resonant bass. Its bodys combination of compact profile with a deep sound has since been copied by virtually every major steel-string luthier, making it the most popular body type.  |Martins|Martin_Guitars|  D series guitars, such as the highly prized  |D_28|Martin_D_28| , are classic examples of the dreadnought.   The jumbo body type is bigger again than a grand auditorium but similarly proportioned, and is generally designed to provide a deep tone similar to a dreadnoughts. It was designed by  |Gibson|Gibson|  to compete with the dreadnought, guitar |s|S| |n|N| |sic_technolo|Sic_Technolo| most notably blues and bluegrasssuch as flame and quilt patternsAnother simpler system, called ladder bracing, where the braces are all placed across the width of the instrument, is used on all types of flat-top guitars on the back.as opposed to laminated or  |plywood|Plywood| in the range of US$300–$1000 |sic_technolo|Sic_Technolo| |_sic_technolo|Sic_Technolo| |d|D| |sici|Sici| strumming |thi|Thi| .
