        Liliales  is an  |order|Order|  of  |monocotyledon|Monocotyledon| ous  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plant|  in the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  and  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Web|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Web| |system|List_Of_Systems_Of_Plant_Classification| , within the  |lilioid_monocots|Lilioid_Monocots| . This order of necessity includes the  |family|Family| |Liliaceae|Liliaceae| . The  |APG_III_system|Apg_Iii_System|  places this order in the  |monocot|Monocot| |clade|Clade| . In APG III, the family  |Luzuriagaceae|Luzuriagaceae|  is combined with the family  |Alstroemeriaceae|Alstroemeriaceae|  and the family  |Petermannia|Petermannia| ceae is recognized. Both the order Lililiales and the family Liliaceae have had a widely disputed history, with the  |circumscription|Circumscription|  varying greatly from one taxonomist to another. Previous members of this order, which at one stage included most monocots with conspicuous  |tepals|Tepals|  and lacking  |starch|Starch|  in the  |endosperm|Endosperm|  are now distributed over three orders, Liliales,  |Dioscoreales|Dioscoreales|  and  |Asparagales|Asparagales| , using predominantly  |molecular_phylogenetics|Molecular_Phylogenetics| . The newly delimited Liliales is  |monophyletic|Monophyletic| , with ten families. Well known plants from the order include  Lilium  ,  |tulip|Tulip| , the North American wildflower  Trillium , and  |greenbrier|Smilax| .     Thus circumscribed, this order consists mostly of  |herbaceous|Herbaceous|  plants, but  |lianas|Lianas|  and  |shrubs|Shrubs|  also occur. They are mostly  |perennial_plants|Perennial_Plant| , with food  |storage_organs|Storage_Organs|  such as  |corms|Corm|  or  |rhizomes|Rhizome| . The family  |Corsiaceae|Corsiaceae|  is notable for being  |heterotrophic|Heterotrophic| .     The order has worldwide distribution. The larger families are roughly confined to the  |Northern_Hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| , or are distributed worldwide, centering on the north. On the other hand, the smaller families are confined to the  |Southern_Hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere| , or sometimes just to  |Australia|Australia|  or  |South_America|South_America| . The total number of species in the order is now about 1768.     As with any  |herb|Herb| aceous group, the  |fossil|Fossil|  record of the Liliales is rather scarce. There are several species from the  |Eocene|Eocene| , such as Petermanniopsis anglesaensis or Smilax, but their identification is not definite. Another known fossil is Ripogonum scandens from the  |Miocene|Miocene| . Due to the scarcity of data, it seems impossible to determine precisely the age and the initial distribution of the order. It is assumed that the Liliales originate from the Lower  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous| , over 100 million years ago. Fossil aquatic plants from the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  of northeastern Brazil and a new terrestrial species placed in the new genus  Cratosmilax  suggest that the first species have appeared around 120 million years ago when the continents formed Pangea, before dispersing as Asia, Africa and America. The initial diversification to the current families took place between 82 and 48 million years ago. The order consists of 10 families, 67 genera and about 1,768 species.         The Liliales are characterised by  the presence of  |nectaries|Nectaries|  at the base of the  |tepals|Tepals|  or  |stamen|Stamen|  filaments, together with  |extrorse|Extrorse|  anthers. This distinguishes them from the septal nectaries and introrse anthers that are the features of most other monocots. They are mainly  |geophytes|Geophytes|  with elliptical  |leaves|Leaves|  showing fine  |reticulate_venation|Reticulate_Venation| . The tepals are usually large and pointed. The outer  |integument|Integument|  epidermis of the  |seed_coat|Seed_Coat|  is cellular, and the  |phytomelanin|Phytomelanin|  pigment is lacking. The inner integument is also cellular and these features are  |plesiomorphic|Plesiomorphic| . The Liliales are predominantly  |perennial|Perennial|  erect or twining  |herbaceous|Herbaceous|  and  |climbing|Vines|  plants. They also include  |woody|Woody_Plants| |shrubs|Shrubs| , which have fleshy  |stems|Plant_Stems|  and underground  |storage|Storage_Organ|  or  |perennating|Perennating|  organs.         The stems contain  |fructans|Fructans| , the plants also contain  |Chelidonic_acid|Chelidonic_Acid| ,  |saponins|Saponins| , while some species contain  |Velamen|Velamen| . The  |epicuticular_wax|Epicuticular_Wax|  is of the Convallaria type, consisting of parallel orientated platelets.         The order includes  |taxa|Taxa|  with some of the largest  |genomes|Genomes|  among  |Angiosperms|Angiosperms| , particularly  |Melanthiaceae|Melanthiaceae| ,  |Alstroemeriaceae|Alstroemeriaceae|  and  |Liliaceae|Liliaceae| .           Earlier names for this order include the Coronarieae of the  |Bentham_&_Hooker_system|Bentham_&_Hooker_System| . The  |Wettstein_system|Wettstein_System| , last revised in 1935, used names similar to those in the Engler system: the order was named Liliiflorae placed in the class Monocotyledones of the subdivision Angiospermae. In circumscription the order was fairly similar to that of  |Cronquist|Arthur_Cronquist| .     In the  |Engler_system|Engler_System|  a similar order was named  |Liliiflorae|Liliiflorae| , placed in the class  |Monocotyledoneae|Monocotyledoneae|  of the subdivision  |Angiospermae|Angiospermae| .     The  |Cronquist_system|Cronquist_System|  placed the order in subclass  |Liliidae|Liliidae|  in the class  |Liliopsida|Liliopsida|  of division  |Magnoliophyta|Magnoliophyta|  It used a much wider circumscription  |Agavaceae|Agavaceae| |Aloaceae|Aloaceae| |Cyanastraceae|Cyanastraceae| |Dioscoreaceae|Dioscoreaceae| |Haemodoraceae|Haemodoraceae| |Hanguanaceae|Hanguanaceae| |Iridaceae|Iridaceae| |Philydraceae|Philydraceae| |Pontederiaceae|Pontederiaceae| |Smilacaceae|Smilacaceae| |Stemonaceae|Stemonaceae| |Taccaceae|Taccaceae| |Velloziaceae|Velloziaceae| |Xanthorrhoeaceae|Xanthorrhoeaceae|      The  |Dahlgren_system|Dahlgren_System|  placed the order in superorder Lilianae in subclass Liliidae of class Magnoliopsida and used this circumscription:   order Liliales   : family Alstroemeriaceae   : family  |Calochortaceae|Calochortaceae| |Uvulariaceae|Uvulariaceae|      The  |Thorne_system|Thorne_System|  placed the order in superorder  |Lilianae|Lilianae|  in subclass  |Liliidae|Liliidae|  of class  |Magnoliopsida|Magnoliopsida|  and used this circumscription:   order Liliales   : family Alstroemeriaceae   : family Campynemataceae   : family Colchicaceae   : family Iridaceae   : family Liliaceae   : family Melanthiaceae   : family  |Trilliaceae|Trilliaceae|          The  |APG_system|Apg_System|  also placed the order in the clade monocots, but with a slightly different circumscription :   order Liliales   : family  |Alstroemeriaceae|Alstroemeriaceae| |Campynemataceae|Campynemataceae| |Colchicaceae|Colchicaceae| |Liliaceae|Liliaceae| |Luzuriagaceae|Luzuriagaceae| |Melanthiaceae|Melanthiaceae| |Philesiaceae|Philesiaceae| |Ripogonaceae|Ripogonaceae| |Smilacaceae|Smilacaceae|      The  |APG_II_system|Apg_Ii_System|  places this order in the clade  |monocots|Monocots|  and uses this circumscription:   order Liliales   : family  |Alstroemeriaceae|Alstroemeriaceae| |Campynemataceae|Campynemataceae| |Colchicaceae|Colchicaceae| |Corsiaceae|Corsiaceae| |Liliaceae|Liliaceae| |Luzuriagaceae|Luzuriagaceae| |Melanthiaceae|Melanthiaceae| |Philesiaceae|Philesiaceae| |Ripogonaceae|Ripogonaceae| |Smilacaceae|Smilacaceae|      APG III uses this circumscription:   order Liliales   : family  |Alstroemeriaceae|Alstroemeriaceae| |Campynemataceae|Campynemataceae| |Colchicaceae|Colchicaceae| |Corsiaceae|Corsiaceae| |Liliaceae|Liliaceae| |Melanthiaceae|Melanthiaceae| |Petermannia|Petermannia| ceae   : family  |Philesiaceae|Philesiaceae| |Ripogonaceae|Ripogonaceae| |Smilacaceae|Smilacaceae|          According to the APWeb, the families of Liliales are related as follows:            Widely distributed but most commonly found in  |subtropical|Subtropical|  and  |temperate|Temperate|  regions, especially the    |Northern_Hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| . Since many species are  |cultivated|Horticulture|  they have been  |introduced|Introduced_Species|  in many regions and consequently worldwide, and a number have subsequently escaped and  |naturalised|Naturalisation| .       Liliales form important sources of food and  |pharmaceuticals|Pharmaceuticals|  as well as playing a significant role in  |horticulture|Horticulture|  and  |floriculture|Floriculture| .
