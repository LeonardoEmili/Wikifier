Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate. Each of them received £10 million upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

Despite Dianas wishes, the executors petitioned the probate court for a variance of the will , and the letter of wishes was ignored because it did not contain certain language required by British law . Eventually, one item from Dianas estate was given to each of her godchildren, while they would have received £100,000 each, had one-fourth of her estate been divided between them. The variance also prevented the estate from being distributed between her sons at the age of 25 but postponed it until they were 30.

Some have said it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew that they were the source of her power, thus she had overburdened herself with public duties and destroyed the border between private and public life. Diana was famously criticised by philosophy professor Anthony OHear who, in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was self-indulgent in her philanthropic efforts. Following his remarks, charity organisations that were supported by her defended the Princess, and Peter Luff called OHears comments distasteful and inappropriate . Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in turn demeaned her royal office . Dianas unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases sometimes had a negative reaction in the media.     Sally Bedell Smith characterised Diana as unpredictable, egocentric, and possessive. Smith also argued that in her desire to do charity works she was motivated by personal considerations, rather than by an ambitious urge to take on a societal problem .

She used to wear certain types of clothes at charity events which were appropriate for the people she would meet, such as wearing colourful dresses and jangling jewels so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who worked closely with the Princess alongside her brother, Dianas interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles. Versace also points out that think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what Diana did .     Catherine Walker was among Dianas favorite designers with whom she worked to create her royal uniform . For her foreign tours and state visits, Walker and her husband used to do research and were determined to design clothes that would not outshine the Princess, a viewpoint supported by Taki Theodoracopulos , who believes Diana did not want to let her clothes wear her .
