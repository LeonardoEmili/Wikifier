Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| ; an applied magnetic field creates an  |induced_magnetic_field|Induced_Magnetic_Field|  in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast,  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  and  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a  |quantum_mechanical|Quantum_Mechanical|  effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of  |magnetic_dipoles|Magnetic_Dipole|  in the material. The  |magnetic_permeability|Permeability|  of diamagnetic materials is less than μ 0 , the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a  |superconductor|Superconductivity|  acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.      Diamagnetism was first discovered when  |Sebald_Justinus_Brugmans|Sebald_Justinus_Brugmans|  observed in 1778 that  |bismuth|Bismuth|  and  |antimony|Antimony|  were repelled by magnetic fields. In 1845,  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday|  demonstrated that it was a property of matter and concluded that every material responded to an applied magnetic field. On a suggestion by  |William_Whewell|William_Whewell| , Faraday first referred to the phenomenon as diamagnetic , then later changed it to diamagnetism.            Diamagnetism is a property of all materials, and always makes a weak contribution to the materials response to a magnetic field. However, other forms of magnetism  are so much stronger that when multiple different forms of magnetism are present in a material, the diamagnetic contribution is usually negligible. Substances where the diamagnetic behaviour is the strongest effect are termed diamagnetic materials, or diamagnets. Diamagnetic materials are those that some people generally think of as non-magnetic, and include  |water|Water| ,  |wood|Wood| , most organic compounds such as petroleum and some plastics, and many metals including  |copper|Copper| , particularly the heavy ones with many  |core_electrons|Core_Electrons| , such as  |mercury|Mercury| ,  |gold|Gold|  and  |bismuth|Bismuth| . The magnetic susceptibility values of various molecular fragments are called  |Pascals_constants|Pascals_Constants| .     Diamagnetic materials, like water, or water-based materials, have a relative magnetic permeability that is less than or equal to 1, and therefore a  |magnetic_susceptibility|Magnetic_Susceptibility|  less than or equal to 0, since susceptibility is defined as . This means that diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields. However, since diamagnetism is such a weak property, its effects are not observable in everyday life. For example, the magnetic susceptibility of diamagnets such as water is . The most strongly diamagnetic material is  |bismuth|Bismuth| , , although  |pyrolytic_carbon|Pyrolytic_Carbon|  may have a susceptibility of  in one plane. Nevertheless, these values are orders of magnitude smaller than the magnetism exhibited by paramagnets and ferromagnets. Note that because χ v is derived from the ratio of the internal magnetic field to the applied field, it is a dimensionless value.     In rare cases, the diamagnetic contribution can be stronger than paramagnetic contribution. This is the case for  |gold|Gold| , which has a magnetic susceptibility less than 0 , but when measured carefully with  |X_ray_magnetic_circular_dichroism|X_Ray_Magnetic_Circular_Dichroism| , has an extremely weak paramagnetic contribution that is overcome by a stronger diamagnetic contribution.            |Superconductors|Superconductivity|  may be considered  |perfect_diamagnets|Superdiamagnetism|  , because they expel all magnetic fields due to the  |Meissner_effect|Meissner_Effect| .          If a powerful magnet  is covered with a layer of water then the field of the magnet significantly repels the water. This causes a slight dimple in the waters surface that may be seen by its reflection.                  Diamagnets may be levitated in stable equilibrium in a magnetic field, with no power consumption.  |Earnshaws_theorem|Earnshaws_Theorem|  seems to preclude the possibility of static magnetic levitation. However, Earnshaws theorem applies only to objects with positive susceptibilities, such as ferromagnets and paramagnets . These are attracted to field maxima, which do not exist in free space. Diamagnets are attracted to field minima, and there can be a field minimum in free space.     A thin slice of  |pyrolytic_graphite|Pyrolytic_Graphite| , which is an unusually strong diamagnetic material, can be stably floated in a magnetic field, such as that from  |rare_earth|Rare_Earth_Magnet|  permanent magnets. This can be done with all components at room temperature, making a visually effective demonstration of diamagnetism.     The  |Radboud_University_Nijmegen|Radboud_University_Nijmegen| , the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , has conducted experiments where water and other substances were successfully levitated. Most spectacularly, a live frog was levitated.      In September 2009, NASAs  |Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|  in Pasadena, California announced it had successfully levitated mice using a  |superconducting_magnet|Superconducting_Magnet| ,  an important step forward since mice are closer biologically to humans than frogs.  JPL said it hopes to perform experiments regarding the effects of microgravity on bone and muscle mass.     Recent experiments studying the growth of protein crystals have led to a technique using powerful magnets to allow growth in ways that counteract Earths gravity.      A simple homemade device for demonstration can be constructed out of bismuth plates and a few permanent magnets that levitate a permanent magnet.        The electrons in a material generally settle in orbitals, with effectively zero resistance and act like current loops. Thus it might be imagined that diamagnetism effects in general would be common, since any applied magnetic field would generate currents in these loops that would oppose the change, in a similar way to superconductors, which are essentially perfect diamagnets. However, since the electrons are rigidly held in orbitals by the charge of the protons and are further constrained by the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| , many materials exhibit diamagnetism, but typically respond very little to the applied field.     The  |Bohr–van_Leeuwen_theorem|Bohr–Van_Leeuwen_Theorem|  proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. However, the classical theory of Langevin for diamagnetism gives the same prediction as the quantum theory.  The classical theory is given below.          |Paul_Langevins|Paul_Langevin|  theory of diamagnetism  applies to materials containing atoms with closed shells . A field with intensity , applied to an  |electron|Electron|  with charge  and mass , gives rise to  |Larmor_precession|Larmor_Precession|  with frequency . The number of revolutions per unit time is , so the current for an atom with  electrons is      : I -      The  |magnetic_moment|Magnetic_Moment|  of a current loop is equal to the current times the area of the loop. Suppose the field is aligned with the  axis. The average loop area can be given as     , where     is the mean square distance of the  |electrons|Electrons|  perpendicular to the  axis. The magnetic moment is therefore     :   -      If the distribution of charge is spherically symmetric, we can suppose that the distribution of  coordinates are  |independent_and_identically_distributed|Independent_And_Identically_Distributed| . Then     x2       y2       z2       r2   , where     r2   is the mean square distance of the electrons from the nucleus. Therefore,             x2      y2       r2   . If n is the number of atoms per unit volume, the volume  |diamagnetic_susceptibility|Magnetic_Susceptibility|  in SI units is      :     -  r2        The Langevin theory is not the full picture for  |metals|Metals|  because there are also non-localized electrons. The theory that describes diamagnetism in a  |free_electron_gas|Fermi_Gas|  is called Landau diamagnetism, named after  |Lev_Landau|Lev_Landau| , Landau, L. D. Diamagnetismus der metalle. Zeitschrift für Physik A Hadrons and Nuclei 64.9 : 629-637. and instead considers the weak counteracting field that forms when the electrons trajectories are curved due to the  |Lorentz_force|Lorentz_Force| . Landau diamagnetism, however, should be contrasted with  |Pauli_paramagnetism|Paramagnetismpauli_Paramagnetism| , an effect associated with the polarization of delocalized electrons spins.   For the bulk case of a 3D system and low magnetic fields, the diamagnetic susceptibility can be calculated using  |Landau_quantization|Landau_Quantization| , which in SI units is     :   -      where E is the  |Fermi_energy|Fermi_Energy| . This is equivalent to -  g/3 , exactly -1/3 times Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility, where   is the  |Bohr_magneton|Bohr_Magneton|  and g is the  |density_of_states|Density_Of_States|  . This formula takes into account the spin degeneracy of the carriers .     In  |doped_semiconductors|Doping|  the ratio between Landau and Pauli susceptibilities may change due to the  |effective_mass|Effective_Mass|  of the charge carriers differing from the electron mass in vacuum, increasing the diamagnetic contribution. The formula presented here only applies for the bulk; in confined systems like  |quantum_dots|Quantum_Dot| , the description is altered due to  |quantum_confinement|Potential_Wellquantum_Confinement| .   Additionally, for strong magnetic fields, the susceptibility of delocalized electrons oscillates as a function of the field strength, a phenomenon known as the  |de_Haas–van_Alphen_effect|De_Haas–Van_Alphen_Effect| .
