Portsmouth is also the birthplace of author  |Charles_Dickens|Charles_Dickens| , engineer  |Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel|Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel|  and former Prime Minister  |James_Callaghan|James_Callaghan| .              The  |Romans|Roman_Britain|  built  |Portus_Adurni|Portus_Adurni| , a  |fort|Castra| , at nearby  |Portchester|Portchester|  in the late third century.  The citys  |Old_English|Old_English|  name Portesmuða is derived from port, meaning a haven, and muða, the mouth of a large river or estuary.  The  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  has a warrior called Port and his two sons killing a noble Briton in Portsmouth in 501.   |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| , in his  A History of the English-Speaking Peoples , says that Port was a pirate and he founded Portsmouth in 501.       The south coast was vulnerable to  |Danish_Viking|Danes|  invasions during the 8th and 9th centuries. In 787, it was assaulted and conquered by Danish pirates, and then during the reign of  |Æthelwulf|Æthelwulf| , King of  |Wessex|Wessex|  in 838, a Danish fleet landed between Portsmouth and Southampton and the surrounding area was plundered. In response, Æthelwulf sent Wulfherd and the governor of  |Dorsetshire|Dorsetshire|  to confront the Danes at Portsmouth, where most of their ships were docked. They were successful although Wulfherd was killed. In 1001, the Danes returned and pillaged Portsmouth and surrounding locations, threatening the English with extinction. The Danes were massacred by the survivors the following year and rebuilding began, although the town suffered further attacks until 1066.          Portsmouth was not mentioned in the  |Domesday_Survey|Domesday_Survey|  of 1086, but Bocheland , Copenore , and Frodentone  were.  Some sources maintain it was founded in 1180 by the Anglo-Norman merchant  |Jean_de_Gisors|Jean_De_Gisors| .     When King  |Henry_II|Henry_Ii_Of_England|  died in 1189, his son  |Richard_I|Richard_I_Of_England| , who had spent most of his life in France, arrived in Portsmouth before he was crowned in London. When Richard returned from captivity in  |Austria|Duchy_Of_Austria|  in May 1194, he summoned a fleet of 100 ships and an army to the port. He granted the town a  |royal_charter|Royal_Charter|  on 2 May, giving permission for an annual fifteen-day free market fair, weekly markets, and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from paying an annual tax of £18.  Richard granted the town the arms of  |Isaac_Komnenos_of_Cyprus|Isaac_Komnenos_Of_Cyprus| , whom he had defeated during the  |Third_Crusade|Third_Crusade|  in 1191, reflecting a significant involvement of local soldiers, sailors, and vessels in the holy war.  The 800 anniversary was celebrated in 1994 as the citys founding.       |King_John|John,_King_Of_England|  reaffirmed the rights and privileges awarded by RichardI and established the permanent naval base. The first docks were built by  |William_of_Wrotham|William_Of_Wrotham|  beginning in 1212.  John summoned his earls, barons, and military advisers to the town to plan an invasion of  |Normandy|Duchy_Of_Normandy| . In 1229, after a declaration of war against France,  |HenryIII|Henry_Iii_Of_England|  assembled a force described as one of the finest armies that had ever been raised in England by historian Lake Allen. The invasion stalled and returned from France in October 1231. In 1242 HenryIII summoned troops to invade  |Guienne|Guienne| , and in 1295  |EdwardI|Edward_I_Of_England|  sent supplies for his army in France. By the following century, commercial interests had grown and its exports included wool, corn, grain, and livestock.      |Edward_II|Edward_Ii_Of_England|  ordered all ports on the south coast to assemble their largest vessels at Portsmouth to carry soldiers and horses to the  |Duchy_of_Aquitaine|Duchy_Of_Aquitaine|  in 1324 to strengthen defences. In 1336 a French fleet under the command of  |David_II_of_Scotland|David_Ii_Of_Scotland|  attacked the  |English_Channel|English_Channel| , ransacked the  |Isle_of_Wight|Isle_Of_Wight|  and threatened the town. Concerned,  |EdwardIII|Edward_Iii_Of_England|  instructed all maritime towns to build vessels and raise troops to rendezvous at Portsmouth. Two years later, a French fleet led by  |Nicholas_Béhuchet|Nicholas_Béhuchet| |raided_Portsmouth|Raid_On_Portsmouth| , destroying much of the town. Only the stone-built church and hospital survived. After the raid, EdwardIII exempted the town from national taxes to aid reconstruction.  Upon EdwardIIIs death in 1377, his grandson  |RichardII|Richard_Ii_Of_England|  was crowned, and the French landed in Portsmouth in the same year. The town was plundered and burnt, but its inhabitants fought back and defeated them, which led the French to retreat and raid towns in the  |West_Country|West_Country|  instead.           |Henry_V|Henry_V_Of_England|  built the first permanent  |fortifications_of_Portsmouth|Fortifications_Of_Portsmouth| . In 1416, a number of French ships blockaded Portsmouth, which housed ships that were set to invade Normandy. Instead, Henry gathered a fleet at Southampton and invaded the Norman coast in August of that year. Recognising the towns growing importance, he ordered a wooden  |Round_Tower|Round_Tower|  to be built at the mouth of the harbour, which was completed in 1426.  |Henry_VII|Henry_Vii_Of_England|  rebuilt the fortifications with stone, assisted Robert Brygandine and Sir  |Reginald_Bray|Reginald_Bray|  in the construction of the worlds first  |dry_dock|Dry_Dock| , and raised the  |Square_Tower|Square_Tower|  in 1494. During his reign, HenryVII made Portsmouth a Royal Dock, and was Englands only dockyard to be considered national at the time. Although  |King_Alfred|Alfred_The_Great|  may have used Portsmouth to build ships as early as the 9th century, the first warship recorded as constructed in the town was the  |Sweepstake|Sweepstake| , built in the dry dock in 1497.      In 1539,  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  built  |Southsea_Castle|Southsea_Castle| , financed by the  |Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries|Dissolution_Of_The_Monasteries| , in anticipation of a French invasion.  He also invested large sums of money into the towns dockyard, and expanded its boundaries to . Around this time a Tudor  |defensive_boom|Boom|  stretched from the Round Tower to Fort Blockhouse in Gosport, as a protection to Portsmouth Harbour.      In 1545, from Southsea Castle, he witnessed his flagship  Mary Rose  sink with the loss of about 500 lives, whilst going into action against the French fleet in the  |Battle_of_the_Solent|Battle_Of_The_Solent| .  Some historians believe that the Mary Rose turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports, whereas others argue that it sank due to its poor design. Over the years, Portsmouths fortifications were rebuilt and improved by successive monarchs. In 1563, Portsmouth suffered from an outbreak of a  |plague|Plague| , resulting in about 300 deaths out of the towns population of 2000.          In 1623,  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England|  returned to Portsmouth from his travels in France and Spain. Five years later, Charles unpopular military adviser,  |George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|George_Villiers,_1St_Duke_Of_Buckingham| , was stabbed to death in an  |Old_Portsmouth|Old_Portsmouth|  pub by war veteran  |John_Felton|John_Felton| .  Felton never attempted to escape and was caught walking through the streets when soldiers confronted him, to which he responded: I know that he is dead, for I had the force of forty men when I struck the blow . Felton was then hanged, and his body was chained to a  |gibbet|Gibbet|  on  |Southsea_Common|Southsea_Common|  as a warning to others.  The murder took place in the Greyhound public house on High Street, which is now private and called Buckingham House; it bears a commemorative plaque.      Most residents, including the mayor, supported the  |parliamentarians|Roundhead|  during the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War| , although its military governor,  |Colonel_Goring|George_Goring,_Lord_Goring| , supported the  |royalists|Cavalier| . The town became a major base for the parliamentarian navy and was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to raid it by land in the  |Siege_of_Portsmouth|Siege_Of_Portsmouth| ; the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the royalist garrison in the town. Across the harbour, parliamentarians in  |Gosport|Gosport|  joined in the assault, with their guns damaging  |St_Thomass_Church|Portsmouth_Cathedral| .  On 5 September 1642, the remaining royalists in the garrison at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened to blow it up with gunpowder. In return, he and his garrison were allowed safe passage.     Under the  |Commonwealth_of_England|Commonwealth_Of_England| ,  |Robert_Blake|Robert_Blake|  used the harbour as his base during the  |First_Anglo-Dutch_War|First_Anglo-Dutch_War|  in 1652 and the  |Anglo_Spanish_War|Anglo-Spanish_War|  of 1654. He died within sight of the town returning from  |Cádiz|Cádiz| .  After the end of the Civil War in 1646, Portsmouth was among the first towns to declare  |CharlesII|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  as king and subsequently began to prosper. In 1650, the first ship to be built for more than 100 years, , was launched. Between 1650 and 1660, twelve ships were built. After the  |restoration_of_Monarchy|Restoration| , CharlesII married  |Catherine_of_Braganza|Catherine_Of_Braganza|  in the  |Royal_Garrison_Church|Domus_Dei| .  During the latter half of the 17th century the town continued to grow; a new wharf was constructed in 1663 for military use, and in 1665 a  |mast|Mast|  pond was dug out. In 1684 a list of ships docked in Portsmouth gave evidence of its increasing national importance; the town was the only place of naval rendezvous in England at the time. Between 1667 and 1685 the towns fortifications were rebuilt; new walls were constructed with  |bastions|Bastion|  and two moats were dug, making Portsmouth one of the most heavily fortified places in the world.     In 1759, General  |James_Wolfe|James_Wolfe|  sailed from the harbour to Canada on an expedition to capture  |Quebec|Quebec|  which, though successful, cost him his life. His body was brought back to Portsmouth in November that year and received the highest naval and military honours. Two years later, on 30 May 1775, Captain  |James_Cook|James_Cook|  arrived on board  after circumnavigating the world.  On 13 May 1787,  |eleven_ships_left|First_Fleet|  to establish the first European colony in  |Australia|Australia| , marking the beginning of prisoner transportation,   and in the same year, Captain  |William_Bligh|William_Bligh|  of  set sail from the harbour.  After the  |mutiny_on_the_Bounty|Mutiny_On_The_Bounty|  on 28 April 1789,  was dispatched from Portsmouth to bring back the mutineers for trial. The court martial opened on 12 September 1792 on board  in Portsmouth Harbour  – of the remaining ten men, three were sentenced to death. In 1789, a chapel was erected in Prince Georges Street and was dedicated to  |St_John|John_The_Apostle|  by the Bishop of Winchester. Around this time, a  |bill|Bill|  was passed in the House of Commons regarding the creation of a canal to link Portsmouth to Chichester, but the project was abandoned.     The citys nickname Pompey is thought to have derived from the log entry of  |Portsmouth_Point|Portsmouth_Point| , contracted to Pom.P.  as ships entered the harbour. Navigational charts use the contraction.  However, a historian argues that the name Pompey may have been brought back from a group of Portsmouth-based sailors who visited  |Pompeys_Pillar|Pompeys_Pillar|  in  |Alexandria|Alexandria| , Egypt, in around 1781. Another theory is that it is named after the harbours guardship,  Pompee , a 74-gun French ship of the line captured in 1793.     The boroughs coat of arms is attested in the early 19th century, as Azure a crescent or, surmounted by an estoile of eight points of the last. William Berry, Robert Glover, Encyclopædia Heraldica, 1828   This design is apparently based on seals of the mayoralty used in the 18th century. Robert East H. Lewis, Extracts from Records in the Possession of the Municipal Corporation of the Borough of Portsmouth and from Other Documents Relating Thereto, 1891, p. 656.   The claim connecting the coat of arms with the Great Seal of Richard I dates to the 20th century, see Valentine Dyall, Unsolved Mysteries: A Collection of Weird Problems from the Past, 1954, p. 14 |unched_in_18|Unched_In_18| |ili|Ili| German Supreme Army Command |ore_establishme|Ore_Establishme| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| |mmonwealth_real|Mmonwealth_Real| |cluding_Gunwharf_Quays,_the_dockyard_and_the_Spinnaker_tow|Cluding_Gunwharf_Quays,_The_Dockyard_And_The_Spinnaker_Tow| the  |M275_motorway|M275_Motorway| , the  |A3_road|A3_Road| , and the  |A2030_road|A2030_Road| 4th Ed 1982308-acre |e_island_which_Portsmouth_is_situated|E_Island_Which_Portsmouth_Is_Situated| |rtsmou|Rtsmou| |gla|Gla| formerly Milton Lakepart of the  |Bagshot_Formation|Bagshot_Formation| |rou|Rou|  0.4 sq.mi.  |K._politici|K._Politici| |chite|Chite| |ore_establishme|Ore_Establishme| nicknamed Lipstick Towerwhich includes a smaller venue, Edge of the Wedge |lt|Lt| |ari|Ari| |uths|Uths| |gla|Gla| |rtsmou|Rtsmou| |ghtle|Ghtle| |rtsmou|Rtsmou| |ore_establishme|Ore_Establishme| storekeeper |ich_cannot_be_seen_in_this_photogra|Ich_Cannot_Be_Seen_In_This_Photogra| the city is one of 34 British settlements with a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  cathedral1949 and 1950formerly known as Portsmouth Royal Navy |icket_grou|Icket_Grou| |ain_operating_compa|Ain_Operating_Compa| |ain_operating_compa|Ain_Operating_Compa| |ain_operating_compa|Ain_Operating_Compa| |mpshi|Mpshi| Anchorage ParkOcean Retail ParkAdmiral Lord Nelson School |ain_operating_compa|Ain_Operating_Compa| Portsmouth |dio_netwo|Dio_Netwo| IBAPortsmouth |ili|Ili| |hle|Hle| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| |rtsmouth|Rtsmouth| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| |yal_Na|Yal_Na| |yal_Navy_admir|Yal_Navy_Admir| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| |yal_Na|Yal_Na| |ore_establishment_19|Ore_Establishment_19| .
