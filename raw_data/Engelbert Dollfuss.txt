        Engelbert Dollfuss  was an Austrian politician who served as Chancellor of  |Austria|Federal_State_Of_Austria|  between 1932 and 1934. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, assumed dictatorial powers.  |Suppressing_the_Socialist_movement|Austrian_Civil_War|  in February 1934 during the  |Austrian_Civil_War|Austrian_Civil_War|  and later banned the  |Austrian_Nazi_party|Austrian_National_Socialism| , he cemented the rule of  |Austrofascism|Austrofascism|  through the  |authoritarian|Authoritarian|   First of May Constitution . Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by  |Nazi|Nazi_Party|  agents in 1934. His successor  |Kurt_Schuschnigg|Kurt_Schuschnigg|  maintained the regime until  |Adolf_Hitlers|Adolf_Hitler| |annexation_of_Austria|Anschluss|  in 1938.              Dollfuss was born to a poor, peasant family in the hamlet of Great Maierhof in the commune of St. Gotthard near  |Texingtal|Texingtal|  in  |Lower_Austria|Lower_Austria| . Young Dollfuss spent his childhood in his step-fathers house in the nearby commune of Kirnberg, where he also went to elementary school. The local parish priests helped to finance Dollfuss education, as his parents were unable to do so by themselves alone. He attended high school in  |Hollabrunn|Hollabrunn| . After graduating from high school, Dollfuss intended to become a priest, and thus he enrolled at the  |University_of_Vienna|University_Of_Vienna|  to study theology, but after a few months changed course and started studying law in 1912. As a student, he earned a livelihood giving lessons. He became a member of the Students Social Movement, a student organisation dedicated to social and charitable work among the workers.     As the  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  broke out, Dollfuss reported to be recruited in Vienna but was rejected because he was two centimetres shorter than the minimum. The same day he went to  |St._Pölten|St._Pölten|  where the recruiting commission for his district was located and insisted to be recruited, even though he didnt meet the minimum height standards, and was accepted. As a volunteer, he had a right to choose a regiment in which he would serve, and Dollfuss opted for the Tyrolese militia also known as the  Kaiserschützen . He was soon promoted to the rank of  |corporal|Corporal| . He served for 37 months at the  |Italian_Front|Italian_Front| , south of Tyrol. By 1916 he was promoted to  |lieutenant|Lieutenant| .     After the war, he was still a student and was employed by the Lower Austrian Peasants Union, which helped him to secure his material existence, and it was here where Dollfuss gained his first political experience. There, he organised peasants to help them recover from the war, as well as shield them from the influences of  |Marxism|Marxism| . Being recognised for his abilities he showed at the Union, he was sent for further studies to  |Berlin|Berlin| . In Berlin, he began to garner dislike for some of his professors, as academia there was substantially influenced by liberalism and socialism. In his studies, he devoted himself to the Christian principles of economics. In Germany, he became a member of the Federation of German Peasants Union and of the Preussenkasse   essentially, a central bank for member-cooperatives, where he gained practical experience. In Germany, he met his future wife  |Alwine_Glienke|Alwinedollfuß| , a descendant of a  |Pomeranian|Pomerania|  family. Dollfuss often met with  |Carl_Sonnenschein|Carl_Sonnenschein| , leader of social activities of students and the pioneer of the Catholic movement in Berlin.     After returning to Vienna, he was a secretary of the Lower Austrian Peasants Union. He devoted his efforts to consolidate that industry. Dollfuss was instrumental in the founding of the regional Chamber of Agriculture of Lower Austria, becoming its secretary and a director; the Federation of Agriculture and the Agricultural Labourers’ Insurance Institute; in organising the new Agrarian policy of Lower Austria and in laying the foundations for the corporative organisation of agriculture. A few years later, he was representative of Austria at the International Agrarian Congress, where his proposals made him internationally known in that sphere. He was seen as an unofficial leader of the Austrian peasantry.     On 1 October 1930 Dollfuss was appointed the president of the Federal Railways, the largest industrial corporation in Austria. There, Dollfuss came into contact with all branches of the industry. In March 1931, he was appointed Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.         On 10 May 1932, Dollfuss, age 39 and with only one years experience in the  |Federal_Government|Government_Of_Austria| , was offered the office of  |Chancellor|Chancellor_Of_Austria|  by President  |Wilhelm_Miklas|Wilhelm_Miklas| , also a member of the Christian-Social Party. Dollfuss refused to reply, instead spending the night in his favourite church praying, returning in the morning for a bath and a spartan meal before replying to the President he would accept the offer.  Dollfuss was sworn in on 20 May 1932 as head of a  |coalition_government|Coalition_Government|  between the Christian-Social Party, the  |Landbund|Landbund|  — a  |right-wing|Right-Wing| |agrarian|Agrarianism|  party — and  |Heimatblock|Heimwehr| , the parliamentary wing of the  Heimwehr , a  |paramilitary|Paramilitary| |ultra-nationalist|Ultra-Nationalist|  group. The coalition assumed the pressing task of tackling the problems of the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| . Much of the  |Austro-Hungarian_Empires|Austro-Hungarian_Empire|  industry had been situated in the areas that became part of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  and  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia|  after  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  as a result of the  |Treaty_of_Saint-Germain|Treaty_Of_Saint-Germain-En-Laye| . Postwar Austria was therefore economically disadvantaged.     Dollfuss majority in  |Parliament|Federal_Assembly_Of_Austria|  was marginal; his government had only a one-vote majority.                In March 1933, an argument arose over irregularities in the voting procedure. The Social Democratic president of the  |National_Council|National_Council_Of_Austria| |Karl_Renner|Karl_Renner|  resigned to be able to cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised  |President|President_Of_Austria| |Wilhelm_Miklas|Wilhelm_Miklas|  to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency decree with absolute power.     Dollfuss was concerned that with  |German_National_Socialist|Nsdap|  leader  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the  |Austrian_National_Socialists|Austrian_National_Socialism|  could gain a significant minority in future elections . Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945 In addition, the Soviet Unions influence in Europe had increased throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. Dollfuss banned the communists on 26 May 1933 and the DNSAP on 19 June 1933. Under the banner of  |Christian_Social_Party|Christian_Social_Party| , he later established a one-party dictatorship rule largely modeled after fascism in Italy, banning all other Austrian parties including the Social Democratic Labour Party . Social Democrats however continued to exist as an independent organization, nevertheless, without its paramilitary  Republikanischer Schutzbund , which until 31 March 1933  could have mustered tens of thousands against Dollfuss government.         Dollfuss modelled  |Austrofascism|Austrofascism|  according to  |Catholic|Catholic| |corporatist|Corporatist|  ideals with  |anti-secularist|Clericalism|  tones and in a similar way to Italian  |fascism|Fascism| , dropping Austrian pretenses of unification with Germany as long as the Nazi Party remained in power. In August 1933,  |Benito_Mussolinis|Benito_Mussolini|  regime issued a guarantee of Austrian independence. Dollfuss also exchanged Secret Letters with Mussolini about ways to guarantee Austrian independence. Mussolini was interested in Austria forming a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Dollfuss always stressed the similarity of the regimes of Hitler in Germany and  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  in the Soviet Union, and was convinced that Austrofascism and Italian fascism could counter  |totalitarian|Totalitarian|  national socialism and communism in Europe.     In September 1933 Dollfuss merged his Christian Social Party with elements of other nationalist and conservative groups, including the Heimwehr, which encompassed many workers who were unhappy with the radical leadership of the socialist party, to form the  Vaterländische Front , though the Heimwehr continued to exist as an independent organization until 1936, when Dollfuss successor  |Kurt_von_Schuschnigg|Kurt_Von_Schuschnigg|  forcibly merged it into the Front, instead creating the unabidingly loyal Frontmiliz as paramilitary task force. Dollfuss escaped an assassination attempt in October 1933 by  |Rudolf_Dertill|Rudolf_Dertill| , a 22-year-old who had been ejected from the military for his national socialist views.         In February 1934 the security forces provoked arrests of Social Democrats and unjustified searches for weapons of the Social Democrats already outlawed  |Republikanischer_Schutzbund|Republikanischer_Schutzbund| . After the Dollfuss dictatorship took steps against known Social Democrats, the Social Democrats called for nationwide resistance against the government.  |A_civil_war|Austrian_Civil_War|  began, which lasted sixteen days, from 12 until 27 February. Fierce fighting took place primarily in the East of Austria, especially in the streets of some outer  |Vienna|Vienna|  districts, where large fortress-like  |municipal_workers_buildings|Gemeindebau|  were situated, and in the northern, industrial areas of the province of  |Styria|Styria| , where Nazi agents had great interest in a bloodbath between security forces and workers militias. The resistance was suppressed by police and military power. The Social Democrats were outlawed,  and their leaders were imprisoned or fled abroad.         Dollfuss staged a parliamentary session with just his party members present in April 1934 to  |have_his_new_constitution_approved|May_Constitution_Of_1934| , effectively the second constitution in the world espousing  |corporatist|Corporatist|  ideas after that of the Portuguese  Estado Novo . Stanley G. Payne, Civil War in Europe, 1905-1949, 2011, p. 108. The session retrospectively made all the decrees already passed since March 1933 legal. The new constitution became effective on 1 May 1934 and swept away the last remnants of democracy and the system of the first Austrian Republic.              Dollfuss was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by ten Austrian Nazis    of Regiment 89  who entered the Chancellery building and shot him in an attempted  coup détat , the  |July_Putsch|July_Putsch| .  In his dying moments he asked for  |Viaticum|Viaticum| , the  |Eucharist|Eucharist|  administered to a person who is dying, but his assassins refused to give it to him. Mussolini had no hesitation in attributing the attack to the German dictator: the news reached him at  |Cesena|Cesena| , where he was examining the plans for a psychiatric hospital. Mussolini, known as Il Duce , personally gave the announcement to Dollfuss widow, who was a guest at his villa in  |Riccione|Riccione|  with her children. He also put at the disposal of  |Ernst_Rüdiger_Starhemberg|Ernst_Rüdiger_Starhemberg| , who spent a holiday in  |Venice|Venice| , a plane that allowed the prince to rush back to Vienna and to face the assailants with his militia, with the permission of President  |Wilhelm_Miklas|Wilhelm_Miklas| . Richard Lamb, Mussolini and the British, 1997, p. 149     Mussolini also mobilised a part of the Italian army on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria to thwart the putsch. Then he announced to the world: The independence of Austria, for which he has fallen, is a principle that has been defended and will be defended by Italy even more strenuously , and then replaced in the main square of  |Bolzano|Bolzano|  the statue  |:de:Walther-Denkmal|:De:Walther-Denkmal|  of  |Walther_von_der_Vogelweide|Walther_Von_Der_Vogelweide| , a Germanic troubadour, with that of  |Drusus|Nero_Claudius_Drusus| , a Roman general who conquered part of Germany. This was the greatest moment of friction between Fascism and National Socialism and Mussolini himself came down several times to reaffirm the differences in the field. The assassination of Dollfuss was accompanied by uprisings in many regions in Austria, resulting in further deaths. In  |Carinthia|Carinthia| , a large contingent of northern German Nazis tried to seize power but were subdued by the Italian units nearby. At first Hitler was jubilant, but the Italian reaction surprised him. Hitler became convinced that he could not face a conflict with the Western European powers, and he officially denied liability, stating his regret for the murder of the Austrian Prime Minister. He replaced the ambassador to Vienna with  |Franz_von_Papen|Franz_Von_Papen|  and prevented the conspirators entering Germany, also expelling them from the Austrian Nazi Party. The Nazi assassins in Vienna, after declaring the formation of a new government under Austrian Nazi  |Anton_Rintelen|Anton_Rintelen| , previously exiled by Dollfuss as Austrian Ambassador to Rome, surrendered after threats from Austrian military of blowing up the Chancellery using  |dynamite|Dynamite| , and were subsequently tried and executed by  |hanging|Hanging| .  |Kurt_Schuschnigg|Kurt_Schuschnigg| , previously Minister of Education, was appointed new chancellor of Austria after a few days, assuming the office from Dollfuss’ deputy Starhemberg.     Out of a population of 6.5 million, approximately 500,000 Austrians were present at Dollfuss’ burial in  |Vienna|Vienna| . He is interred in the  |Hietzing|Hietzing|  cemetery in Vienna  beside his wife  |Alwine_Dollfuss|Alwine_Dollfuß|  and two of his children, Hannerl and Eva, all of whom were in Italy as guests of  |Rachele_Mussolini|Rachele_Mussolini|  at the time of his death, an event which saw Mussolini himself shed tears over his slain ally.          In  |Bertolt_Brechts|Bertolt_Brecht|  1941 play  The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui , Dollfuss is represented by the character Dullfeet .          Das Kammersystem in der Landwirtschaft Österreichs.
