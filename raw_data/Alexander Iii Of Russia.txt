Alexander III  was the  |emperor_of_Russia|Emperor_Of_Russia| ,  |king_of_Poland|King_Of_Poland| , and  |grand_duke_of_Finland|Grand_Duke_Of_Finland|  from  until his death on . He was highly reactionary and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father,  |Alexander_II|Alexander_Ii_Of_Russia| . Under the influence of  |Konstantin_Pobedonostsev|Konstantin_Pobedonostsev|  he opposed any reform that limited his autocratic rule. During Alexanders reign Russia fought no major wars, and he was therefore styled The Peacemaker .                Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich was born on 10 March 1845 at the  |Winter_Palace|Winter_Palace|  in  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| ,  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| , the second son and third child of  |Emperor|Emperor_Of_Russiaemperors_Of_Russia| |_Alexander_II|Alexander_Ii_Of_Russia|  and his first wife  |Maria_Alexandrovna|Maria_Alexandrovna|  .     In disposition Alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning great-uncle  |Emperor_Alexander_I|Emperor_Alexander_I| , who could have been given the title of the first gentleman of  |Europe|Europe|  . Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the  |ballet|Ballet| , Alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities. More than six feet tall , he was also noted for his immense physical strength. A  |sebaceous_cyst|Sebaceous_Cyst|  on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.     An account from the memoirs of the artist  |Alexander_Benois|Alexander_Benois|  gives one impression of Alexander III:     After a performance of the ballet  Tsar Kandavl  at the  |Mariinsky_Theatre|Mariinsky_Theatre| , I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the  |muzhik|Muzhik|  Russian peasant about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsars gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely.       Though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother,  |Nicholas|Grand_Duke_Nicholas_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia| , who seemed of robust constitution. Even when Nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously, and he was betrothed to  |Princess_Dagmar_of_Denmark|Dagmar_Of_Denmark| , daughter of  |King_Christian_IX_of_Denmark|King_Christian_Ix_Of_Denmark|  and  |Queen_Louise_of_Denmark|Louise_Of_Hesse_Kassel| , and whose siblings included  |King_Frederick_VIII_of_Denmark|King_Frederick_Viii_Of_Denmark| ,  |Queen_Alexandra_of_the_United_Kingdom|Queen_Alexandra_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and  |King_George_I_of_Greece|King_George_I_Of_Greece| . Great solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as  |tsesarevich|Tsesarevich| , whereas Alexander received only the training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period. This included acquaintance with  |French|French_Language| , English and  |German|German_Language| , and  |military_drill|Military_Drill| .          Alexander became  |tsesarevich|Tsesarevich|  upon Nicholass sudden death in 1865; it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under  |Konstantin_Pobedonostsev|Konstantin_Pobedonostsev| , then a professor of  |civil_law|Civil_Law|  at  |Moscow_State_University|Moscow_State_University|  and later  |chief_procurator|Chief_Procurator|  of the  |Holy_Synod|Holy_Synod|  of the Orthodox Church in Russia. Pobedonostsev instilled into the young mans mind the belief that zeal for  |Russian_Orthodox|Russian_Orthodox_Church|  thought was an essential factor of Russian  |patriotism|Patriotism|  to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor. While he was  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent|  from 1865 to 1881 Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.     On his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor. This wish was swiftly realized when on  in the  |Grand_Church_of_the_Winter_Palace|Grand_Church_Of_The_Winter_Palace|  in  |St_Petersburg|St_Petersburg| , Alexander wed Dagmar, who converted to Orthodox Christianity and took the name  |Maria_Feodorovna|Maria_Feodorovna| . The union proved a happy one to the end; unlike his fathers, there was no adultery in his marriage. The couple spent their wedding night at the Tsarevichs private dacha known as My Property .     Later on the Tsarevich became estranged from his father; this was due to their vastly differing political views, as well was his resentment towards Alexander IIs long-standing relationship with  |Catherine_Dolgorukov|Catherine_Dolgorukov|  while his mother, the  |Empress|Marie_Alexandrovna_Tsarina_Of_Russia| , was suffering from chronic ill-health. Van Der Kiste, John The Romanovs: 1818–1959  p. 94 To the scandal of many at court, including the Tsarevich himself, Alexander II married Catherine a mere month after Marie Alexandrovnas death in 1880.       On 13 March 1881 Alexanders father,  |Alexander_II|Alexander_Ii_Of_Russia| , was assassinated by members of the  |terrorist|Terrorism|  organization  |Narodnaya_Volya|Narodnaya_Volya| . As a result, he ascended to the Russian imperial throne in  |Nennal|Ninasi| . He and Maria Feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the  |Assumption_Cathedral_in_Moscow|Assumption_Cathedral_In_Moscow|  on 27 May 1883. Alexanders ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of  |anti_Jewish_riots|Pogrom| .   ,  Das interessante Blatt , 7 June 1883. ,  The New York Times , 1 June 1883.         Alexander III disliked the extravagance of the rest of his family. It was also expensive for the Crown to pay so many grand dukes each year. Each one received an annual salary of 250,000 rubles, and grand duchesses received a dowry of a million when they married. He limited the title of grand duke and duchess to only children and male-line grandchildren of emperors. The rest would bear a princely title and the style of  |Serene_Highness|Serene_Highness| . He also forbade  |morganatic_marriages|Morganatic_Marriage| , as well as those outside of the Orthodoxy. Sebag Montefiore, p. 668            On the day of his assassination Alexander II had signed an  |ukaz|Ukaz|  setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch. On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took Pobedonostsevs advice and cancelled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his  |autocracy|Autocracy|  would not be limited.     All of Alexander IIIs internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his fathers reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian  |Orthodoxy_Autocracy_and_Nationality|Orthodoxy_Autocracy_And_Nationality|   would save Russia from revolutionary agitation.     Alexander weakened the power of the  zemstvo  and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These land captains  were feared and resented throughout the Empires peasant communities. These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperors personal control. In such policies Alexander III followed the advice of  |Konstantin_Pobedonostsev|Konstantin_Pobedonostsev| , who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod and who became tutor to Alexanders son and heir, Nicholas.  Other conservative advisors included Count  |D_A_Tolstoy|Dmitry_Tolstoy|  and  |I_N_Durnovo|Ivan_Durnovo|  .  |Mikhail_Katkov|Mikhail_Katkov|  and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy.      The  |Russian_famine_of_1891–92|Russian_Famine_Of_1891–92| , which caused 375,000 to 500,000 deaths, and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity, as the Russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief .     Alexanders political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality, language, and religion, all under one form of administration. Through the teaching of the Russian language in Russian schools in Germany, Poland, and Finland, the destruction of the remnants of German, Polish, and Swedish institutions in the respective provinces, and the patronization of  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox| y, he attempted to realize this ideal.      Alexander was hostile to Jews; His reign witnessed a sharp deterioration in the Jews economic, social, and political condition. His policy was eagerly implemented by tsarist officials in the  |May_Laws|May_Laws|  of 1882. I. Michael Aronson, The Attitudes of Russian Officials in the 1880s toward Jewish Assimilation and Emigration. Slavic Review 34.1 : 1-18.  They banned Jews from inhabiting rural areas and  |shtetls|Shtetl|   and restricted the occupations in which they could engage.  I. Michael Aronson, The Prospects for the Emancipation of Russian Jewry during the 1880s. Slavonic and East European Review : 348-369.      Encouraged by its successful assassination of Alexander II, the  |Narodnaya_Volya|Narodnaya_Volya|  movement began planning the murder of Alexander III. The  |Okhrana|Okhrana|  uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators, including  |Alexander_Ulyanov|Alexander_Ulyanov| , the older brother of  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin| , were captured and hanged in May 1887.               The general negative consensus about the tsars foreign policy follows the conclusions of the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury in 1885:   :It is very difficult to come to any satisfactory conclusion as to the real objects of Russian policy. I am more inclined to believe there are none; that the Emperor is really his own Minister, and so bad a Minister that no consequent or coherent policy is pursued; but that each influential person, military or civil, snatches from him as opportunity offers the decisions which such person at the moment wants and that the mutual effect of these decisions on each other is determined almost exclusively by chance. Margaret Maxwell, A Re-examination of the Role of N. K. Giers as Russian Foreign Minister under Alexander III pp 352–53.      In foreign affairs Alexander III was a man of peace, but not at any price, and held that the best means of averting war is to be well-prepared for it. Diplomat  |Nikolay_Girs|Nikolay_Girs| , scion of a rich and powerful family, served as his Foreign Minister from 1882 to 1895 and established the peaceful policies for which Alexander has been given credit. Girs was an architect of the  |Franco_Russian_Alliance|Franco_Russian_Alliance|  of 1891, which was later expanded into the  |Triple_Entente|Triple_Entente|  with the addition of Great Britain. That alliance brought France out of diplomatic isolation, and moved Russia from the German orbit to a coalition with France, that was strongly supported by French financial assistance to Russias economic modernization. Girs was in charge of a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements, treaties and conventions. These agreements defined Russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations. The most dramatic success came in 1885, settling long-standing tensions with Great Britain, which was fearful that Russian expansion to the South would be a threat to India. Raymond A. Mohl, Confrontation in Central Asia, 1885, History Today 1193 pp 176-183. Girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of Tsar Alexander convincing him that the very survival of the czarist system depended on avoiding major wars. With a deep insight into the tsars moods and views, Girs was usually able to shape the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists, ministers, and even the czarina, as well as his own ambassadors. His Russia fought no wars. Margaret Maxwell, A Re-examination of the Rôle of N.K. Giers as Russian Foreign Minister under Alexander III. European Studies Review 1.4 : 351-376.        Though Alexander was indignant at the conduct of German chancellor  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  towards Russia, he avoided an open rupture with Germany  even reviving the  |League_of_Three_Emperors|League_Of_Three_Emperors|  for a period of time and in 1887, signed the  |Reinsurance_Treaty|Reinsurance_Treaty|  with the Germans. However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor,  |Kaiser_Wilhelm_II|Kaiser_Wilhelm_Ii|  , and the unwillingness of Wilhelm IIs government to renew the treaty. In response Alexander III then began cordial relations with France, eventually entering into an  |alliance|Franco_Russian_Alliance|  with the French in 1892. Van Der Kiste, John The Romanovs: 1818–1959  p. 162     Despite chilly relations with Berlin, the Tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of  |Prince_Alexander|Alexander_Prince_Of_Bulgaria|  and afterwards of  |Stambolov|Stefan_Stambolov|  to destroy Russian influence in the principality roused his indignation, but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms. Charles Jelavich, Russo-Bulgarian relations, 1892-1896: with particular reference to the problem of the bulgarian succession. Journal of Modern History 24.4 : 341-351.      In  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending Russian domination without provoking conflict with the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland|  , and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand. His reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of  |Russian_history|History_Of_Russia| ; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress.     Alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at  |Langinkoski|Langinkoski|  manor near  |Kotka|Kotka|  on the  |Finnish|Finland|  coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.     Alexander deprecated foreign influence, German influence in particular, thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a Russia homogeneous in language, administration and religion. These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the  |Slavophiles|Slavophiles|  and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.      Some differences had first appeared during the  |Franco_Prussian_War|Franco_Prussian_War| , when Alexander II supported the cabinet of  |Berlin|Berlin|  while the Tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. These sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879, when the  |Eastern_Question|Eastern_Question|  excited Russian society. At first the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his  |phlegmatic|Phlegmatic|  nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| , where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  and the  |Treaty_of_San_Stefano|Treaty_Of_San_Stefano|  was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the  |Congress_of_Berlin|Congress_Of_Berlin| .      |Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor. In return for the Russian support which had enabled him to create the  |German_Empire|German_Empire| ,  it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with Russian interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of honest broker at the Congress, and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with  |Austria_Hungary|Austria_Hungary|  for the purpose of counteracting Russian designs in  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| .     The Tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.            Following his fathers assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the Winter Palace. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the  |Gatchina_Palace|Gatchina_Palace| , located twenty miles south of St. Petersburg, making it his primary residence. Under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the  |Anichkov_Palace|Anichkov_Palace| , as opposed to the Winter Palace.     In the 1860s Alexander fell madly in love with his mothers lady-in-waiting, Princess Maria Elimovna Meshcherskaya. Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in early 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved Dusenka . On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his fourth cousin. Before then, she had been the fiancée of his late elder brother Nicholas. At first Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and wanted to marry Maria. In response the enraged emperor ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary Farewell, dear Dusenka. Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova. Almost a year after her first appearance in Paris,  |Pavel_Pavlovich_Demidov_2nd_Prince_di_San_Donato|Pavel_Pavlovich_Demidov_2Nd_Prince_Of_San_Donato| , fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867. Maria would die giving birth to her son  |Elim_Pavlovich_Demidov_3rd_Prince_di_San_Donato|Elim_Pavlovich_Demidov_3Rd_Prince_Of_San_Donato| . Alexanders reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown.     Alexander soon grew fond of Dagmar and had six children by her, five of whom survived into adulthood:  |Nicholas|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia|  ,  |George|Grand_Duke_George_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  ,  |Xenia|Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_Of_Russia|  ,  |Michael|Grand_Duke_Michael_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  and  |Olga|Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_Of_Russia|  . Of his five surviving children, he was closest to his youngest two. In 1885 it was Alexander who commissioned  |Peter_Carl_Fabergé|Peter_Carl_Fabergé|  to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled Easter eggs  for her as an Easter gift, the  |First_Hen_egg|First_Hen_Egg| , which delighted her immensely and became an annual Easter tradition for Alexander and, upon his succession, for his son Nicholas as well.          Each summer his parents-in-law,  |King_Christian_IX|King_Christian_Ix_Of_Denmark|  and  |Queen_Louise|Louise_Of_Hesse_Kassel| , held family reunions at the Danish royal palaces of  |Fredensborg|Fredensborg_Palace|  and  |Bernstorff|Bernstorff_Palace| , bringing Alexander, Maria and their children to Denmark. Van Der Kiste, John The Romanovs: 1818–1959 , p. 151 His sister-in-law, the  |Princess_of_Wales|Queen_Alexandra| , would come from Great Britain with some of her children, and his brother-in-law,  |King_George_I_of_Greece|King_George_I_Of_Greece| , his wife,  |Queen_Olga|Queen_Olga_Of_Greece| , who was a first cousin of Alexander and a Romanov Grand Duchess by birth, came with their children from Athens. In contrast to the strict security observed in Russia, Alexander and Maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in Denmark, Alexander once commenting to the Prince and Princess of Wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in England, while he was returning to his Russian prison. Van Der Kiste, p. 152 In Denmark, he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles, sneaking into his father-in-laws orchard to steal apples, and playing pranks, such as turning a water hose on the visiting  |King_Oscar_II_of_Sweden|Oscar_Ii_Of_Sweden| .     As Tsesarevich  and then as Tsar  Alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother  |Grand_Duke_Vladimir|Grand_Duke_Vladimir_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia| . This tension was reflected in the rivalry between Maria Feodorovna and Vladimirs wife,  |Grand_Duchess_Marie_Pavlovna|Marie_Of_Mecklenburg_Schwerin| . Van Der Kiste, p. 141 Alexander had better relationships with his other brothers:  |Alexei|Grand_Duke_Alexei_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  ,  |Sergei|Grand_Duke_Sergei_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia|  and  |Paul|Grand_Duke_Paul_Alexandrovich_Of_Russia| .     Despite the antipathy that Alexander had towards his stepmother,  |Princess_Catherine_Dolgorukov|Catherine_Dolgorukov| , he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the Winter Palace for some time after his fathers assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him. These included Alexander IIs blood-soaked uniform that he died wearing, and his reading glasses.   Van Der Kiste, p. 118     On  the Imperial train  |derailed|Derailment|  in an  |accident|Borki_Train_Disaster|  at  |Borki|Borki_Kharkiv_Oblast| . At the moment of the crash, the imperial family was in the dining car. Its roof collapsed, and Alexander held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors. The onset of Alexanders kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident.           In 1894, Alexander III became ill with terminal kidney disease . Maria Fyodorovnas sister-in-law, Queen Olga of Greece, offered her villa of  |Mon_Repos|Mon_Repos_Corfu| , on the island of  |Corfu|Corfu| , in the hope that it might improve the Tsars condition.

King, p. 325 Recognizing that the Tsars days were numbered, various imperial relatives began to descend on Livadia. Even the famed clergyman  |John_of_Kronstadt|John_Of_Kronstadt|  paid a visit and administered Communion to the Tsar. John Perry & Constantine Pleshakov The Flight of the Romanovs: a Family Saga  p. 62 On 21 October, Alexander received Nicholass fiancée, Princess Alix, who had come from her native Darmstadt to receive the Tsars blessing. King, p. 326 Despite being exceedingly weak, Alexander insisted on receiving Alix in full dress uniform, an event that left him exhausted. King, p. 327 Soon after, his health began to deteriorate more rapidly. He died in the arms of his wife, and in the presence of his physician,  |Ernst_Viktor_von_Leyden|Ernst_Viktor_Von_Leyden| , at Maly Palace in Livadia on the afternoon of  at the age of forty-nine, and was succeeded by his eldest son Tsesarevich Nicholas, who took the throne as  |Nicholas_II|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia| . After leaving Livadia on 6 November and traveling to St. Petersburg by way of Moscow, his remains were interred on 18 November at the  |Peter_and_Paul_Fortress|Peter_And_Paul_Fortress| .            Alexander III had six children of his marriage with  |Princess_Dagmar_of_Denmark|Maria_Feodorovna| , also known as Marie Feodorovna.                           In 1909, a bronze  |equestrian_statue|Equestrian_Statue|  of Alexander III sculpted by  |Paolo_Troubetzkoy|Paolo_Troubetzkoy|  was placed in  |Znamenskaya_Square|Znamenskaya_Square|  in front of the  |Moscow_Rail_Terminal|Moskovsky_Rail_Terminal|  in  |St_Petersburg|St_Petersburg| . Both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form, leading to the nickname of hippopotamus . Troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a  |caricature|Caricature| , jesting that he wished to portray an animal atop another animal , and it was quite controversial at the time, with many, including the members of the Imperial Family, opposed to the design, but it was approved because the  |Empress_Dowager|Maria_Feodorovna|  unexpectedly liked the monument. Following the Revolution of 1917 the statue remained in place as a symbol of tsarist autocracy until 1937 when it was placed in storage. In 1994 it was again put on public display, in front of the  |Marble_Palace|Marble_Palace| .    Another memorial is located in the city of  |Irkutsk|Irkutsk|  at the  |Angara|Angara_River|  embankment.     On 18 November 2017, Vladimir Putin unveiled a bronze monument to Alexander III on the site of the former Maly Livadia Palace in Crimea. The four-meter monument by Russian sculptor  |Andrey_Kovalchuk|Andrey_Kovalchuk|  depicts Alexander III sitting on a stump, his stretched arms resting on a sabre.
