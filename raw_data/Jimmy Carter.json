During the signing ceremony, Carter cited the impending crisis of energy shortages with causing the necessity of the legislation.  At the start of a September 29, 1977 news conference, under the impression he had not come across well in addressing energy during his prior press session, Carter stated that the House of Representatives had adopted almost all of the energy proposal he had made five months prior and called the compromise a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.  The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senates ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.           On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been long and divisive and arduous as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.    In an April 11, 1978 news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise in the nature of a disappointment since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.      On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.  On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation.  During an April 30 news conference, Carter said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.

He used verbal insults and had an unwillingness to return political favors, which contributed to his lack of ability to pass legislation through Congress.  During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was inevitable that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found a growing sense of cooperation with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.  Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,  which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.  As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted the liberal wing of the Democratic Party was the most ardently against his policies, attributing this to Ted Kennedy wanting the presidency.

Now we have government by partnership.  At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. Ive been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual Members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where theyve been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.      On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan. The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government due to the vote and concluding the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation. He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on local or parochial interests and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.  Carters remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.  At the start of a July 25, 1979 news conference, Carter called on believers in the future of the US and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.  Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the Presidents legislative program and become an important issue in next years campaign.        Carters presidency had an economic history of two roughly equal periods, the first two years being a time of continuing recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession, which had left fixed investment at its lowest level since the 1970 recession and unemployment at 9%,  and the last two years marked by double-digit inflation, coupled with very high interest rates, Frum, p. 292 oil shortages, and slow economic growth.

        ".   The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,  and later defeated in the House.      During 1978, Carter also conducted meetings with Kennedy for a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.  Carter would later cite Kennedys disagreements as having thwarted Carters efforts to provide a comprehensive health-care system for the country.        Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to assist in fulfilling a campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In a February 28, 1978 address at the White House, Carter argued, Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various Government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.  On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.  On October 17, 1979, Carter signed the ": null

In a November 1, 1980 speech, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in Federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally .                     Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he:   :was in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional US policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, side-line the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.
