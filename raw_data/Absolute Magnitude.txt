Absolute magnitude  is a measure of the  |luminosity|Luminosity|  of a  |celestial_object|Celestial_Object| , on an inverse  |logarithmic|Logarithmic_Scale| |astronomical_magnitude|Magnitude|  scale. An objects absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly , without  |extinction|Extinction|  of its light due to absorption by  |interstellar_matter|Interstellar_Medium|  and  |cosmic_dust|Cosmic_Dust| . By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale.     As with all astronomical  |magnitudes|Magnitude| , the absolute magnitude can be specified for different  |wavelength|Wavelength|  ranges corresponding to specified  |filter|Filter|  bands or  |passbands|Passband| ; for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude, which uses the visual band of the spectrum . Absolute magnitudes are denoted by a capital M, with a subscript representing the filter band used for measurement, such as M V for absolute magnitude in the V band.     The more luminous an object, the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude. A difference of 5 magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to a ratio of 100 in their luminosities, and a difference of n magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to a luminosity ratio of 100 . For example, a star of absolute magnitude M V 3.0 would be 100 times more luminous than a star of absolute magnitude M V 8.0 as measured in the V filter band. The  |Sun|Sun|  has absolute magnitude M V +4.83. Highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes: for example, the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  galaxy has an absolute B magnitude of about −20.8.     An objects absolute bolometric magnitude represents its total  |luminosity|Luminosity|  over all  |wavelengths|Wavelengths| , rather than in a single filter band, as expressed on a logarithmic magnitude scale. To convert from an absolute magnitude in a specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude, a  |bolometric_correction|Bolometric_Correction|  is applied.     For  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  bodies that shine in reflected light, a different definition of absolute magnitude is used, based on a standard reference distance of one  |astronomical_unit|Astronomical_Unit| .       In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs . A star at 10 parsecs has a  |parallax|Parallax|  of 0.1″ . Galaxies  are much larger than 10 parsecs, their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky, and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances, but the same convention is used. A galaxys magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object, treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of a single point-like or star-like source, and computing the magnitude of that point-like source as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance. Consequently, the absolute magnitude of any object equals the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 10 parsecs away.     The measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called a  |bolometer|Bolometer| . When using an absolute magnitude, one must specify the type of  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  being measured. When referring to total energy output, the proper term is bolometric magnitude. The bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus a  |bolometric_correction|Bolometric_Correction| , . This correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation, whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation .     Some stars visible to the naked eye have such a low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to outshine the  |planets|Planet|  and cast shadows if they were at 10 parsecs from the Earth. Examples include  |Rigel|Rigel|  ,  |Deneb|Deneb|  ,  |Naos|Zeta_Puppis|  , and  |Betelgeuse|Betelgeuse|  . For comparison,  |Sirius|Sirius|  has an absolute magnitude of 1.4, which is brighter than the  |Sun|Sun| , whose absolute visual magnitude is  |4.83|Fifth_Magnitude_Star|  . The Suns absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily, usually at 4.75.   Absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from −10 to +17. The absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower . For example, the giant  |elliptical_galaxy_M87|Elliptical_Galaxy_M87|  has an absolute magnitude of −22 .            The Greek astronomer  |Hipparchus|Hipparchus|  established a numerical scale to describe the brightness of each star appearing in the sky. The brightest stars in the sky were assigned an apparent magnitude , and the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye are assigned . The difference between them corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness. For objects within the immediate neighborhood of the Sun, the absolute magnitude  and apparent magnitude  from any distance   is related by:     : 100        where  is the radiant flux measured at distance  ,  the radiant flux measured at distance . The relation can be written in terms of logarithm:     : M m - 5       where the insignificance of  |extinction_by_gas_and_dust|Extinction|  is assumed. Typical extinction rates within the galaxy are 1 to 2 magnitudes per kiloparsec, when  |dark_clouds|Dark_Nebula|  are taken into account.     For objects at very large distances the luminosity distance  must be used instead of  , because the Euclidean approximation is invalid for distant objects and  |general_relativity|General_Relativity|  must be taken into account. Moreover, the  |cosmological_redshift|Cosmological_Redshift|  complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude, because the radiation observed was shifted into the red range of the spectrum. To compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects, a  |K_correction|K_Correction|  might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects.     The absolute magnitude  can also be approximated using apparent magnitude  and  |stellar_parallax|Stellar_Parallax|   and  |distance_modulus|Distance_Modulus| |Rigel|Rigel|  has a visual magnitude  of 0.12 and distance about 860 light-years   : M  0.12 - 5   -7.0.      |Vega|Vega|  has a parallax  of 0.129″, and an apparent magnitude  of 0.03   : M  0.03 + 5   +0.6.     The  |Black_Eye_Galaxy|Black_Eye_Galaxy|  has a visual magnitude  of 9.36 and a distance modulus  of 31.06   : M  9.36 - 31.06 -21.7.         The  |bolometric|Bolometer|  magnitude , takes into account  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  at all  |wavelengths|Wavelengths| . It includes those unobserved due to instrumental  |passband|Passband| , the Earths atmospheric absorption, and  |extinction_by_interstellar_dust|Extinction| . It is defined based on the  |luminosity|Luminosity|  of the stars. In the case of stars with few observations, it must be computed assuming an  |effective_temperature|Effective_Temperature| .     Classically, the difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to:     : M  - M  -2.5         which makes by inversion:     :   10     where   : is the Suns luminosity   : is the stars luminosity   : is the bolometric magnitude of the Sun   : is the bolometric magnitude of the star.     In August 2015, the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  passed Resolution B2 defining the  |zero_points|Zero_Point|  of the absolute and apparent  |bolometric_magnitude|Bolometric_Magnitude|  scales in SI units for power  and irradiance , respectively. Although bolometric magnitudes had been used by astronomers for many decades, there had been systematic differences in the absolute magnitude-luminosity scales presented in various astronomical references, and no international standardization. This led to systematic differences in bolometric corrections scales. Combined with incorrect assumed absolute bolometric magnitudes for the Sun could lead to systematic errors in estimated stellar luminosities .     Resolution B2 defines an absolute bolometric magnitude scale where  corresponds to luminosity , with the zero point  |luminosity|Luminosity|   set such that the Sun  corresponds to absolute  |bolometric_magnitude|Bolometric_Magnitude|  4.74. Placing a  |radiation|Radiation|  source at the standard distance of 10  |parsecs|Parsecs| , it follows that the zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale  corresponds to  |irradiance|Irradiance|  . Using the IAU 2015 scale, the nominal total  |solar_irradiance|Solar_Irradiance|   measured at 1  |astronomical_unit|Astronomical_Unit|   corresponds to an apparent bolometric magnitude of the  |Sun|Sun|  of −26.832.     Following Resolution B2, the relation between a stars absolute bolometric magnitude and its luminosity is no longer directly tied to the Suns luminosity:     : M  -2.5       -2.5   L  + 71.197425     where   : is the stars luminosity in  |watts|Watt|    : is the zero point luminosity    : is the bolometric magnitude of the star     The new IAU absolute magnitude scale permanently disconnects the scale from the variable Sun. However, on this SI power scale, the nominal solar luminosity corresponds closely to 4.74, a value that was commonly adopted by astronomers before the 2015 IAU resolution.     The luminosity of the star in watts can be calculated as a function of its absolute bolometric magnitude  as:     : L  L0 10     using the variables as defined previously.
