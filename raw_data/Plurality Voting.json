It is entirely possible that a voter finds all major parties to have similar views on issues and that a voter does not have a meaningful way of expressing a dissenting opinion through their vote.     As fewer choices are offered to voters, voters may vote for a candidate although they disagree with them, because they disagree even more with their opponents.
