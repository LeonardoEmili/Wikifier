Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed.

Shortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, A Study in Scarlet , Watson assesses the detectives abilities:          Subsequent stories reveal that Watsons early assessment was incomplete in places and inaccurate in others, due to the passage of time if nothing else.

The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces ones ability to learn useful things. The later stories move away from this notion: in  The Valley of Fear , he says, All knowledge comes useful to the detective , and in The Adventure of the Lions Mane , the detective calls himself an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles .
