   A siddur  is a  |Jewish|Judaism| |prayer_book|Prayer_Book| , containing a set order of  |daily_prayers|List_Of_Jewish_Prayers_And_Blessings| . The word siddur comes from the Hebrew root  meaning order .       The earliest parts of Jewish prayer book are the  Shema Yisrael  , and the  |Priestly_Blessing|Priestly_Blessing|  , which are in the  |Torah|Torah| . A set of eighteen blessings called the Shemoneh Esreh or the  Amidah  , is traditionally ascribed to the  |Great_Assembly|Great_Assembly|  in the time of  |Ezra|Ezra| , at the end of the Biblical period.     The name Shemoneh Esreh, literally eighteen , is a historical anachronism, since it now contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end of the  |Second_Temple|Second_Temple|  period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah became standardized. Even at that time their precise wording and order was not yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. Many modern scholars believe that parts of the Amidah came from the  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language| |apocrypha|Apocrypha| l work  |Ben_Sira|Ben_Sira| .     According to the  |Talmud|Talmud| , soon after the destruction of the  |Temple_in_Jerusalem|Temple_In_Jerusalem|  a formal version of the Amidah was adopted at a rabbinical council in  |Yavne|Yavne| , under the leadership of Rabban  |Gamaliel_II|Gamaliel_Ii|  and his colleagues. However, the precise wording was still left open. The order, general ideas, opening and closing lines were fixed. Most of the wording was left to the individual reader. It was not until several centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed. By the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are still used today.     The siddur was printed by  |Soncino|Soncino_Family|  in Italy as early as 1486, though a siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865.  The siddur began appearing in the  |vernacular|Vernacular|  as early as 1538. The first English  |translation|Translation|  was published in London in 1738 by an author writing under the  |pseudonym|Pseudonym|  Gamaliel ben Pedahzur; a different translation was released in the United States in 1837.       Readings from the  |Torah|Torah|  and the  |Neviim|Neviim|  form part of the prayer services. To this framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time, various prayers, and, for festivals especially, numerous hymns.     The earliest existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Rav  |Amram_Gaon|Amram_Gaon|  of Sura, Babylon, about 850 CE. Half a century later Rav  |Saadia_Gaon|Saadia_Gaon| , also of Sura, composed a siddur, in which the rubrical matter is in  |Arabic|Arabic_Language| . These were the basis of Simcha ben Samuels  |Machzor_Vitry|Machzor_Vitry|  , which was based on the ideas of his teacher,  |Rashi|Rashi| . Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  to the laws of prayer in his  |Mishneh_Torah|Mishneh_Torah| |Jacob_Emden|Jacob_Emden|  and the  |Vilna_Gaon|Vilna_Gaon| .             There are differences among, amongst others, the  |Sephardic|Sephardic_Law_And_Customsliturgy|  ,  |Teimani|Yemenite_Jews|  ,    |Chasidic|Hasidic_Judaism| ,  |Ashkenazic|Ashkenazi_Jews|  ,  |Bené_Roma_or_Italkim|Italian_Jewsitalian_Rite_Jews| ,  |Romaniote|Romaniotes|  and also Persian-, Kurdish-, Bukharian-, Georgian-, Mountain Jewish-, Ethiopian- and Cochin-Jewish liturgies. Most of these are slight differences in the wording of the prayers; for instance, Oriental Sephardic and some Hasidic prayer books state חננו מאתך חכמה בינה ודעת , Graciously bestow upon us from You wisdom , understanding  and knowledge  , in allusion to the  |Kabbalistic|Kabbalah| |sefirot|Sefirot|  of those names, while the Nusach Ashkenaz, as well as  |Western_Sephardic|Spanish_And_Portuguese_Jews|  and other Hasidic versions retain the older wording חננו מאתך דעה בינה והשכל , Graciously bestow upon us from You knowledge, understanding, and reason . In some cases, however, the order of the preparation for the Amidah is drastically different, reflecting the different halakhic and kabbalistic formulae that the various scholars relied on in assembling their siddurim, as well as the minhagim, or customs, or their locales.     Some forms of the Sephardi rite are considered to be very overtly  |kabbalistic|Kabbalah| , depending on how far they reflect the ritual of  |Isaac_Luria|Isaac_Luria| . This is partly because the  |Tetragrammaton|Tetragrammaton|  frequently appears with varying vowel points beneath the letters and different Names of God appear in small print within the final hei of the Tetragrammaton. In some editions, there is a Psalm in the preparations for the  |Amidah|Amidah|  that is printed in the outline of a  |menorah|Menorah| , and the worshipper meditates on this shape as he recites the psalm.     The Ashkenazi rite is more common than the Sephardi rite in America. While Nusach Ashkenaz does contain some kabbalistic elements, such as acrostics and allusions to the sefirot , these are not easily seen unless the reader is already initiated. It is notable that although many other traditions avoid using the poem  |Anim_Zemirot|Anim_Zemirot| h on the Sabbath, for fear that its holiness would be less appreciated due to the frequency of the Sabbath, the poem is usually sung by Ashkenazi congregations before concluding the Sabbath  |Musaf|Musaf|  service with the daily psalm. The ark is opened for the duration of the song.     Hasidim, though usually ethnically Ashkenazi, usually use liturgies with varying degrees of Sephardic influence, such as  |Nusach_Sefard|Nusach_Sefard|  and  |Nusach_Ari|Nusach_Ari| , in order to follow the order of the prayers set by  |Rabbi_Isaac_Luria|Rabbi_Isaac_Luria| , often called Ari HaKadosh , or The Holy Lion . Although the Ari himself was born Ashkenazi, he borrowed many elements from Sephardi and other traditions, since he felt that they followed Kabbalah and  |Halacha|Halacha|  more faithfully. The Ari did not publish any siddur, but orally transmitted his particular usages to his students with interpretations and certain meditations. Nusach HaAri Siddur, published by Merkos LInyonei Chinuch. Many siddurim containing some form of the Sephardic rite together with the usages of the Ari were published, both by actual Sephardic communities and for the use of Hasidim and other Ashkenazim interested in Kabbalah. In 1803, Rabbi  |Schneur_Zalman_of_Liadi|Schneur_Zalman_Of_Liadi|  compiled an authoritative siddur from the sixty siddurim that he checked for compliance with Hebrew grammar, Jewish law, and Kabbalah: this is what is known today as the Nusach Ari , and is used by Lubavitch Hasidim. Those that use Nusach HaAri claim that it is an all-encompassing nusach that is valid for any Jew, no matter what his ancestral tribe or identity, a view attributed to the  |Maggid_of_Mezeritch|Maggid_Of_Mezeritch| .     The  |Mahzor|Mahzor|  of each rite is distinguished by hymns  composed by authors . The most important writers are  |Yose_ben_Yoseh|Yose_Ben_Yoseh| , probably in the 6th century, chiefly known for his compositions for  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur| ;  |Eleazar_Kalir|Eleazar_Kalir| , the founder of the payyetanic style, perhaps in the 7th century;  |Saadia_Gaon|Saadia_Gaon| ; and the Spanish school, consisting of  |Joseph_ibn_Abitur|Joseph_Ibn_Abitur|  ,  |ibn_Gabirol|Ibn_Gabirol| ,  |Isaac_Gayyath|Isaac_Gayyath| ,  |Moses_ibn_Ezra|Moses_Ibn_Ezra| ,  |Abraham_ibn_Ezra|Abraham_Ibn_Ezra|  and  |Judah_ha-Levi|Judah_Ha-Levi| , Moses ben Nahman  and  |Isaac_Luria|Isaac_Luria| . In the case of Nusach HaAri, however, many of these High Holiday piyyutim are absent: the older piyyutim were not present in the Sephardic rite, on which Nusach HaAri was based, and the followers of the Ari removed the piyyutim composed by the Spanish school.         Some siddurim have only prayers for weekdays; others have prayers for weekdays and  |Shabbat|Shabbat| . Many have prayers for weekdays, Shabbat, and the three Biblical festivals,  |Sukkot|Sukkot|  ,  |Shavuot|Shavuot|  and  |Pesach|Pesach|  . The latter are referred to as a Siddur Shalem .       There are many additional liturgical variations and additions to the siddur for the Yamim Noraim . As such, a special siddur has developed for just this period, known as a  mahzor  . The mahzor contains not only the basic liturgy, but also many piyutim, Hebrew liturgical poems. Sometimes the term mahzor is also used for the prayer books for the three pilgrim festivals, Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot.   On  Tisha bAv , a special siddur is used that includes the text of the  |Book_of_Lamentations|Book_Of_Lamentations| , the  |Torah|Torah|  and  |Haftarah|Haftarah|  readings for that day, and Kinot or special mournful piyyutim for that day. This siddur is usually called Kinot as well. Traditionally, every year many Jews hope that the  |Messiah|Messiah|  will come and the  |Third_Temple|Third_Temple|  will be rebuilt, so Tisha bAv will not happen again. So after the fast ends, many traditions place their Kinot siddurim in a  geniza , or a burial place for sacred texts.       Below are listed many popular siddurim used by religious Jews. This list mostly excludes prayer books specifically for the High Holidays; see  |Machzor|Machzorpopular_Versions| .           https://www.korenpub.com/korenenusd/koren/tefilla/siddur-prayer-book/siddur-avodat-halev.html Siddur Avodat HaLev, ed.
