   Glorantha is a  |fantasy_world|Fantasy_World|  created by  |Greg_Stafford|Greg_Stafford| . It was first introduced in the board game  White Bear and Red Moon  by  |Chaosium|Chaosium| , and thereafter in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including  RuneQuest  and  HeroQuest , as well as several works of fiction and the computer strategy game  King of Dragon Pass . The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of  |Joseph_Campbell|Joseph_Campbell|  and  |Mircea_Eliade|Mircea_Eliade| , its  |sword_and_sorcery|Sword_And_Sorcery|  ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and  its relative lack of  |Tolkienesque|J_R_R_Tolkien|  influence.     Stafford began imagining Glorantha in 1966 as a way to deepen his own understanding of mythology. He founded the company Chaosium to publish the board wargame  White Bear and Red Moon  in 1974 , which was set in Glorantha. Chaosium later published other games in the setting, including the critically acclaimed  RuneQuest . Various later editions of RuneQuest, the narrative role-playing game  HeroQuest  , and the video game King of Dragon Pass were also set in Glorantha, as were several prominent fan efforts. Stafford has also explored the Gloranthan setting in the fantasy novel King of Sartar Stafford Greg, King of Sartar, Berkley Publishing Group, February 1993,  and a number of unfinished works published under the collective name of the Stafford Library .     In Glorantha, magic operates from the everyday level of prayers and charms to the creation and maintenance of the world. Heroes make their way in the world, and may also venture into metaphysical realms to gain knowledge and power, at the risk of body and soul. In the more recent material competing magical outlooks, such as theism, shamanism and mysticism, exist to explain the world. Within each metaphysical system, adherents may also compete - such as when theistic worshipers of rival gods battle each other. The world is flat, with a dome-like sky, and it has been shaped in large and small ways by the mythic actions of the gods. The historical world of Glorantha is in a more or less fallen state, having recovered only partially from a universal battle against Chaos in the mythic Godtime.     Humans are the dominant race, but other sentient beings abound. Some, such as the mystic dragonewts, are unique to Glorantha. Familiar nonhuman races, such as elves and dwarves, are distinct from their common, Tolkienesque portrayals.         Glorantha has been the background for: two board-games , two role-playing games , one video game , one comic book series , five novels or collections of fiction , and numerous pieces of myth and fiction created by the Glorantha community, featuring in magazines such as  Tales of the Reaching Moon . Several hundred gaming miniatures by various licensees and about a dozen plush toys have also been produced at various times.         Gloranthas origins lie in experiments with mythology, storytelling, and recreation and blending of ancient societies, unlike its contemporary,  Dungeons & Dragons  which has its roots in  |wargaming|Wargaming| .     Staffords first imaginings of Glorantha date back to 1966, when he began his studies at  |Beloit_College|Beloit_College| , as a vehicle for him to deepen his own understanding of mythology by creating his own mythology. Stafford was greatly influenced by the ideas on mythology of  |Joseph_Campbell|Joseph_Campbell| , and echoes of Campbells work are to be found in many aspects of Glorantha; for instance the story of the God Learners can be seen as an exercise on the implications of Campbells idea of a unifying  |monomyth|Monomyth| , and the story of Prince Argrath an exploration of Campbells  The Hero with a Thousand Faces  . More abstractly, Campbells idea that myths are how we shape our lives deeply informs the picture of life in Glorantha throughout the game worlds publication history.     The first game system set in Glorantha was the  |board_game|Board_Game|   White Bear and Red Moon . Stafford first tried to sell the game to established publishers, but despite being accepted by three different game companies, each attempt ended in failure; eventually he founded his own game company in 1974, the influential  |Chaosium|Chaosium| , to publish his game. The game detailed the rise of the barbarian Prince Argrath to defend his homeland of Sartar against the red tide of the civilized Lunar Empire, and filled out the area of Dragon Pass; the game has undergone several reissues since that time.     The next publication was also a board game,  Nomad Gods , published by Chaosium in 1978, which detailed the raids and wars between the beast-riding spirit-worshiping tribes of Prax, a cursed land to the east of Dragon Pass. A French language edition was published by Oriflam under license from  |Chaosium|Chaosium|  under the name Les Dieux Nomades in 1994.       The first edition of the role-playing game  RuneQuest  was released in 1978. On the back cover of this edition, the game world was called Glorontha . Several later editions were made; the second edition in 1979 introduced many sophisticated game aids, such as  Cults of Prax  and  Cults of Terror , and highly polished campaign packs, such as  Griffin Mountain . Using materials such as Cults of Prax, players aligned their characters with any of several distinct religions, grounding those characters in the political, cultural, and metaphysical conflicts of Glorantha. Each religion offered a distinct worldview and cultural outlook, none of which are objectively correct. This approach of offering competing mythical histories and value systems continues in current Glorantha material. Cults of Terror focused on the worship of evil gods and adversaries, such as Vivamort, a  |vampire|Vampire|  cult, and Lunar and Chaos cults.     In an attempt to leverage the power of a much bigger gaming company, a third edition, RuneQuest 3, was published with  |Avalon_Hill|Avalon_Hill|  in 1984. This edition both loosened the connection between RuneQuest and Glorantha, introducing Fantasy Europe as the principal game world for RuneQuest, and much broadened the scope of Glorantha, which was treated as an alternative game world. Unfortunately, RuneQuest did not prosper with its association with Avalon Hill, and the relationship between Chaosium, who held the rights to Glorantha, and Avalon Hill, who held the rights to RuneQuest, finally broke down completely in 1995. A draft of the RuneQuest 4 rules, called  RuneQuest:Slayers , was written but never published. It has since been renamed RuneSlayers and released as a free download; it is not set in Glorantha.     During this period of breakdown, Glorantha continued to evolve. The advent of popular use of the internet caused a boom in fan creations in Glorantha, supported by some unofficial business ventures, such as Reaching Moon Megacorp, and a lively convention scene. Loren Miller proposed his  |Maximum_Game_Fun|Maximum_Game_Fun|  principle as a basis for gaming, which soon became a game system in its own right, David Dunham proposed his  PenDragon Pass  system, a nearly freeform game system, and several ambitious  |freeform|Freeform_Role_Playing_Game|  games were played at conventions, such as Home of the Bold with up to eighty participants. The  |video_game|Video_Game|   King of Dragon Pass  was released by  |A_Sharp|A_Sharp| , allowing the player to play an Orlanthi hero who seeks to unite the clans and tribes of Dragon Pass in a kingdom; the game features exceptional depth of coverage of the area of Dragon Pass, and featured the first compelling public view of Staffords ideas about the hero quest. Also Stafford was at this time publishing material about the history and mythology of Glorantha in non-game form as books such as King of Sartar and The Glorious Ascent of Yelm.       In recent years, Gloranthan gaming has been supported by two lines of game systems: the  Hero Wars / HeroQuest  game system, originally published by  |Issaries_Inc_|Issaries_Inc_|  in 2000 and now available from  |Moon_Design_Publications|Moon_Design_Publications| , and  RuneQuest , originally published by  |Mongoose_Publishing|Mongoose_Publishing|  in 2006 and now available from  |The_Design_Mechanism|The_Design_Mechanism| .     The HeroQuest game system, written by  |Robin_Laws|Robin_Laws|  in collaboration with Greg Stafford, is radically different from RuneQuest in that it emphasises  |narrativist|Gnstheorynarrativist|  aspects of role-playing; in contrast, RuneQuest emphasised  |simulationist|Gnstheorysimulationist|  aspects. Because of this change in approach some RuneQuest fans found it difficult to adjust to HeroQuest. However, other long-term fans felt that the game fit Glorantha far better than RuneQuest. A rewritten second edition was published in Spring 2009 by Moon Design Publications, and is being supported with comprehensive Gloranthan sourcebooks: Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes , Sartar Companion and Pavis: Gateway to Adventure .     The RuneQuest game system was licensed to  |Mongoose_Publishing|Mongoose_Publishing|  by  |Issaries|Issaries_Inc_| , allowing Mongoose to publish material concerning the little-explored Second Age of Gloranthan history. Their new fourth edition  debuted in August 2006, with many Gloranthan supplements following. A fifth edition  was published in January 2010, but Mongoose Publishings licence for Gloranthan material lapsed in May 2011. The RuneQuest II game system has been retitled Legend , and contains no Gloranthan material. A new company, The Design Mechanism, was formed by the authors of RuneQuest II, and ownership of the Gloranthan supplements produced for the RuneQuest II line was transferred to them . There are close links between The Design Mechanism and Moon Design Publications, with The Design Mechanism founders writing material for both companies. A new sixth edition of the RuneQuest rules, RuneQuest 6 , was published in August 2012, but no Gloranthan material has yet been published.     Latest publication is RuneQuest Roleplaying in Glorantha, published 21 st of september 2018. For a first time the rulebook is written completely in the Glorantha and the rulebook works as basic encyclopedia about the Glorantha. There is already couple new PDF publications to support the rules set and the rules are close enough to RuneQuest second edition to be used with the older material.         There are a variety of cultures in Glorantha that have strikingly different perceptions of their world, the magic that pervades it and the major events that have shaped it.     The Glorantha website  introduces Glorantha as:       Glorantha is an action-packed world of adventure. Gods and Goddesses struggle here, with nations of people nothing but their pawns. The stormy barbarians with their brutal but honest Storm God struggle against the Lunar Empire, led by the imperial Sun God and devious Moon Goddess.     Glorantha is an exciting world of heroes. Legends are being made by great individuals, many who are not even human beings. Some work with the deities, other heroes and heroines fight against them.     Glorantha is colorful and full of magic. Supernatural animals are found, ranging from unicorns to seven types of merfolk and the Goddess of Lions.     Glorantha is immense. If explored, it has different worlds and dimensions, whole realms where Gods, spirits and sorcerous powers come from. Unlike many fantasy settings, Glorantha emphasises religion, myth and belief to a level rarely seen in role-playing or fantasy fiction elsewhere.     Glorantha shares some fantasy tropes such as  |dwarves|Dwarf| ,  |elves|Elf| ,  |trolls|Troll| ,  |giants|Giant| , but has developed them differently to the more conventional versions based on the work of  |Tolkien|J_R_R_Tolkien| . Dwarves are literally made of stone and exist as manifest rigid inflexible laws of creation, while elves are intelligent, mobile plants. Glorantha is full of surprises.     Glorantha is as deep as you want it to be, or not. Hackers and choppers have what they want, while scholars and mythologists have a vast playground of new stories, legends and myths to enjoy.       The world of Glorantha has various cultures analogous to Earth spread over two major landmasses and a widespread  |archipelago|Archipelago| . The northern continent of  |Genertela|Genertela|  has a caste society of roughly Vedic type to the west, an autocratic Oriental society to the east and a classical style Bronze Age culture in the center. The southern continent of  |Pamaltela|Pamaltela|  is somewhat like Africa, but with many differences.         Broos are creatures of chaos. As a result of their ability to mate with anything, they have the body of a man and features of their animal parent, often deer, goats, antelope, cattle, and sheep. The animal parent normally dies with the child eating its way out of the host at full gestation. They worship Malia, the Mother of Disease, and Thed, the goddess of rape and mother of Chaos. Stafford & Richard , page 97     Scorpionmen are belligerent folk, who look like a sort of scorpion-human  |centaur|Centaur| . They are described as stupid, vicious and live in violent  |matriarchies|Matriarchies|  with a religious emphasis on devouring. They are chaotic in nature.     Ducks or Durulz are large intelligent ducks with arms instead of wings . They reside around rivers, mainly in Sartar, and have an unexplained mystical affinity with Death.     Aldryami are Gloranthan plantmen, nature and sun worshipping—mainly worshipping Aldrya, deity of plants. Unlike  |Tolkienesque|Tolkienesque| |_elves|Elves| , they are alien, physically plant-like and often hostile to normal humans . Like many other fictional elf races, they are excellent archers.
