      Palladium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   Pd and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by  |William_Hyde_Wollaston|William_Hyde_Wollaston| . He named it after the  |asteroid_Pallas|2_Pallas| , which was itself named after the  |epithet|Epithet|  of the Greek goddess  |Athena|Athena| , acquired by her when she slew  |Pallas|Pallas| . Palladium,  |platinum|Platinum| ,  |rhodium|Rhodium| ,  |ruthenium|Ruthenium| ,  |iridium|Iridium|  and  |osmium|Osmium|  form a group of elements referred to as the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group|  metals . These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.     More than half the supply of palladium and its  |congener|Congener|  platinum is used in  |catalytic_converters|Catalytic_Converter| , which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust  into less noxious substances . Palladium is also used in electronics,  |dentistry|Dentistry| ,  |medicine|Medicine| ,  |hydrogen_purification|Hydrogen_Purification| , chemical applications,  |groundwater_treatment|Groundwater_Remediation| , and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of  |fuel_cells|Fuel_Cell| , which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.      |Ore|Ore| |deposits|Deposit|  of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the  |Bushveld_Igneous_Complex|Bushveld_Igneous_Complex|  covering the  |Transvaal_Basin|Transvaal_Basin|  in South Africa, the  |Stillwater_Complex|Stillwater_Igneous_Complex|  in  |Montana|Montana| , United States; the  |Sudbury_Basin|Sudbury_Basin|  and  |Thunder_Bay_District|Thunder_Bay_District|  of  |Ontario|Ontario| , Canada, and the  |Norilsk_Complex|Norilsk|  in Russia.  |Recycling|Recycling|  is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable  |investment|Palladium_As_An_Investment|  interest.       Palladium belongs to  |group_10|Group_10_Element|  in the periodic table, but the configuration in the outermost electrons are in accordance with  |Hunds_rule|Hunds_Rule| . Electrons in the  |s_orbital|Atomic_Orbital|  migrate to fill the  |d_orbitals|Atomic_Orbital|  because they have less energy.        This 5s 0 configuration, unique in  |period_5|Period_5_Element| , makes palladium the heaviest element having only one incomplete  |electron_shell|Electron_Shell| , with all shells above it empty.     Palladium is a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  of the platinum group metals. It is soft and  |ductile|Ductility|  when  |annealed|Annealing|  and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| , in hot, concentrated  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| , and when finely ground, in  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| .  It dissolves readily at room temperature in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| .     Palladium does not react with  |oxygen|Oxygen|  at standard temperature . Palladium heated to 800  °C will produce a layer of palladium oxide . It may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time, likely due to the formation of a surface layer of its monoxide.     Palladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having T c 3.2 K. B. Strizker, Phys. Rev. Lett., 42, 1769 .            Naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven  |isotopes|Isotope| , six of which are stable. The most stable  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  are  |107_Pd|Palladium-107|  with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 6.5 million years ,  |103_Pd|Pd-103|  with 17 days, and 100 Pd with 3.63 days. Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with  |atomic_weights|Atomic_Weight|  ranging from 90.94948  |u|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  to 122.93426  u .  These have half-lives of less than thirty minutes, except 101 Pd , 109 Pd , and 112 Pd .      For isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, 106 Pd, the primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  is  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  with the primary  |decay_product|Decay_Product|  being rhodium. The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  with the primary product of this decay being  |silver|Silver| .      |Radiogenic|Radiogenic|  107 Ag is a decay product of 107 Pd and was first discovered in 1978  in the  |Santa_Clara|Santa_Clara,_Durango|   meteorite of 1976. The discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a  |nucleosynthetic|Nucleosynthetic|  event. 107 Pd versus Ag correlations observed in bodies, which have been melted since accretion of the  |solar_system|Solar_System| , must reflect the presence of short-lived nuclides in the early solar system.        :    Palladium compounds primarily exist in the 0 and +2 oxidation state. Other less common states are also recognized. Generally the compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element.          Palladium chloride is the principal starting material for other palladium compounds. It arises by the reaction of palladium with chlorine. It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts such as palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on carbon, and palladium chloride on carbon.  Solutions of PdCl 2 in nitric acid react with  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid|  to give  |palladium_acetate|Palladium_Acetate| , also a versatile reagent. PdCl 2 reacts with ligands to give square planar complexes of the type PdCl 2 L 2 . One example of such complexes is the  |benzonitrile|Benzonitrile|  derivative PdX 2 2 .     : PdCl 2 + 2 L → PdCl 2 L 2   The complex  |bispalladium_dichloride|Bispalladium_Dichloride|  is a useful catalyst.             Palladium forms a range of zerovalent complexes with the formula PdL 4 , PdL 3 and PdL 2 . For example, reduction of a mixture of PdCl 2 2 and PPh 3 gives  |tetrakispalladium|Tetrakispalladium|    :2 PdCl 2 2 + 4 PPh 3 + 5  |N_2_H_4|Hydrazine|  → 2 Pd 4 + N 2 + 4 N 2 H 5 + Cl −     Another major palladium complex,  |trisdipalladium|Trisdipalladium|  , is prepared by reducing  |sodium_tetrachloropalladate|Sodium_Tetrachloropalladate|  in the presence of  |dibenzylideneacetone|Dibenzylideneacetone| .      Palladium, as well as palladium, are catalysts in  |coupling_reactions|Palladium-Catalyzed_Coupling_Reactions| , as has been recognized by the 2010  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  to  |Richard_F._Heck|Richard_F._Heck| ,  |Ei-ichi_Negishi|Ei-Ichi_Negishi| , and  |Akira_Suzuki|Akira_Suzuki| . Such reactions are widely practiced for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Prominent coupling reactions include the  |Heck|Heck_Reaction| ,  |Suzuki|Suzuki_Reaction| ,  |Sonogashira_coupling|Sonogashira_Coupling| ,  |Stille_reactions|Stille_Reaction| , and the  |Kumada_coupling|Kumada_Coupling| .  |Palladium_acetate|Palladium_Acetate| ,  |tetrakispalladium|Tetrakispalladium|         .
