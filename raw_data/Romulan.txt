   The Romulans  are a fictional  |extraterrestrial|Extraterrestrials_In_Fiction|  race in the American  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  franchise  Star Trek . They first appeared in the series  Star Trek  . They have appeared in most subsequent Star Trek releases, including:  The Animated Series ,  The Next Generation ,  Deep Space Nine ,  Voyager , and  Enterprise . They have also appeared in the Star Trek  |feature_films|Star_Trek|   Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan  ,  Star Trek V: The Final Frontier  ,  Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country  ,  Star Trek: Nemesis  and  Star Trek  . They also appear in various other spin-off media, including books, comics, toys and games.     Writer  |Paul_Schneider|Paul_Schneider|  created the Romulans for use in the 1966  Star Trek  episode  |Balance_of_Terror|Balance_Of_Terror|  . As a basis, he considered what the ancient  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  might have looked like had it developed to the point of  |spaceflight|Spaceflight| . Physically, the Romulans were presented as  |humanoid|Humanoid| , but the shows make-up department gave them pointed ears to distinguish them from humans. In the series, which is set in the 23rd century, the Romulans were speculated as to having split from another alien species, the  |Vulcans|Vulcan| , in the distant past. In contrast to the Vulcans, who were presented as peaceful and logic-oriented, the Romulans were depicted as militaristic, having founded an interstellar empire. The Romulans were used as antagonists for the series protagonists, the Earth ship USS Enterprise, her crew, and their fictional government, the  |United_Federation_of_Planets|United_Federation_Of_Planets| .     In 1987, the writers of Star Trek: The Next Generation—set in the 24th century—again used the Romulans as antagonists of the Federation. The shows designers gave the Romulans new costumes and added a V-shaped ridge on their foreheads. The 2009 film,  Star Trek , depicted the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, being destroyed by a  |supernova|Supernova|  in the year 2387; again, the films designers altered the appearance of the Romulans, removing the V-shaped ridges. The impact of Romulus destruction forms a plot-theme in the forthcoming  Star Trek: Picard  series.             The Romulans were devised for the episode  |Balance_of_Terror|Balance_Of_Terror|  . In 2014, Balance of Terror was rated the best episode in the franchise by  |Io9|Io9| .      The Romulans were reused for the second season episode  |The_Deadly_Years|The_Deadly_Years|  and the third season episode  |The_Enterprise_Incident|The_Enterprise_Incident|  .         After the launch of  Star Trek: The Next Generation  in 1987, the shows writers introduced the Romulans in the final episode of the first season,  |The_Neutral_Zone|The_Neutral_Zone|  , which aired in the U.S. in May 1988. The episode was written by  |Maurice_Hurley|Maurice_Hurley| , who later acknowledged rushing it, putting together a script in a day and a half. In the episode, which is set in the year 2364, the Starfleet ship  |USS_Enterprise-D|Uss_Enterprise-D| —whose crew are the series main protagonists—responds to the disappearance of Federation colonies along the Neutral Zone, fearing that it reflects growing Romulan activity in the region. Investigating, the Enterprise crew encounter a Romulan spaceship; it is stated that this is the first encounter between the two peoples for 53 years. The Romulans reveal that they have had colonies destroyed on their side of the border too, and the two species agree to share information on the issue in future. In later episodes it is revealed that these colonies were destroyed by a previously unknown species, the  |Borg|Borg| , whom the shows writers had devised as a new alien antagonist following dissatisfaction with their previous attempt, the  |Ferengi|Ferengi| . Initial thoughts by the script-writers had proposed a multi-episode storyline in which the Federation and Romulan governments would co-operate to fight the Borg; ultimately only certain elements of this idea entered The Neutral Zone and the Borg would be introduced not in the first season, but in the second season episode  |Q_Who|Q_Who|  .          New costumes were designed for the actors playing Romulans, created by the shows costume designer William Theiss.   The newly designed Romulan ship that appeared in The Neutral Zone was built as a miniature model by  |Greg_Jein|Greg_Jein| . The ship featured a newly-designed Romulan crest, featuring a stylised bird of prey clutching two planets, Romulus and Remus, in its claws. Later in the series, this ship type would be explicitly referred to as a warbird . In 1989,  |AMT|Aluminum_Model_Toys|  released a plastic kit of the vessel, alongside other kits for a Ferengi ship and a Klingon bird of prey vessel.     The Romulans were re-used for the second season episode  |Contagion|Contagion|  , written by Steve Gerber and Beth Woods and first aired in March 1989. In this episode, the Enterprise-D entered the Neutral Zone to answer a distress call and ends up in conflict with a Romulan vessel, with both spaceships being disabled by an alien computer virus. Contagion was the first episode in the Star Trek franchise in which the Romulan ship was given a name, in this case the Haakona. In the third season episode  |The_Enemy|The_Enemy|  , written by David Kemper and Michael Piller and first screened in November 1989, the Enterprise-D is depicted rescuing a crashed Romulan ship. The episode introduced the Romulan character Tomalak, played by  |Andreas_Katsulas|Andreas_Katsulas| , who would reappear in three further Next Generation episodes. It also further established the idea of a significant enmity between the Romulans and the Klingons, with the Enterprises Klingon officer, Worf , refusing to donate blood to save the life of an injured Romulan; the scriptwriters had debated whether to include this, with Dorn initially reticent.     Three episodes later, in The Defector , written by Ronald D. Moore and first screened in January 1990, a Romulan admiral is presented as seeking to defect to the Federation. The episode is the first in the franchise to include images of Romulus itself and introduced the design of a Romulan scout vessel. The Defector also includes a reference to the Battle of Cheron, an incident in the 22nd century Earth-Romulan War that was previously mentioned in Balance of Terror .     Deep Space Nine and Voyager |Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine|Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine| , a Romulan link was introduced. The episode, which was written by Ira Steven Behr , Robert Hewitt Wolfe , and Ronald D. Moore, featured the introduction of a new Starfleet ship, the USS Defiant ; the scriptwriters included the idea that it had been equipped with a cloaking device by the Romulans in return for intelligence that the Federation gathered on another alien power, the Dominion . A Romulan character, TRul , was included to oversee the devices use aboard the Defiant. The shows writers had initially planned on including TRul as a permanent fixture on the show but decided that she did not offer enough potential for new storylines.     The Romulans were reused later that season in Visionary , where they are presented as attempting to destroy the Deep Space Nine space station as part of their plan to collapse the nearby wormhole and thus prevent a Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant , the region of space where both the Federation and Romulans reside. Three episodes later, the follow-on episodes Improbable Cause and The Die Is Cast again featured the Romulans, in this case portraying a joint mission by the Romulan Tal Shiar and Cardassian Obsidian Order to fatally cripple the Dominion by eradicating its leaders, the Founders . For these episodes, new Tal Shiar outfits were designed; Moore related that this was partly his decision, for he hated, underline hated, the Romulan costumes introduced in the first season of The Next Generation. Big shoulder pads, the quilting, I just loathed it. Costume designer Robert Blackman noted that his team created eight new Romulan uniforms, using the same fabric as the old ones but dyed it down slightly, and we made them much sleeker and a little more menacing .         thu     After Star Trek: Nemesis proved a financial failure and Star Trek: Enterprise was cancelled, the franchises executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film entitled Star Trek: The Beginning, which was to be set during the 22nd century Earth-Romulan War. The project never materialised. Instead, the decision was made to reboot the series by creating a film using the characters of the original Star Trek series but played by new actors. Putting together a script for the new film, the director J. J. Abrams stated that he wanted Romulans to be the antagonists because they had featured less than the Klingons in the original Star Trek series. The films writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman , thought that it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons as villains again after they had been presented heroically in later Star Trek series; they also wanted to use Spock as a central character in the film and believed that the Romulan presence would continue Spocks story from his last chronological appearance in Unification .     In the reboot film, titled  |Star_Trek|Star_Trek|  and released in 2009, the planet Romulus is destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387. A Romulan mining ship, the Narada, survives and travels back in time to the 23rd century; its commander, Nero , is committed to destroying the planet Vulcan to punish Spock for failing to save Romulus. The actors playing Romulans in this film wore three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his characters head. The films Romulans lacked the V-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Neros crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloid s reminiscent of the V-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough.     According to sources involved in the production of  |Star_Trek:_Picard|Star_Trek:_Picard| , the forthcoming series features the character of Jean-Luc Picard deeply affected by the destruction of Romulus.       The Romulans have been the focus of a number of books, and have appeared or been mentioned in many others. Among their key appearances have been:     Diane Duane s miniseries  |Star_Trek:_Rihannsu|Star_Trek:_Rihannsu| , consisting to-date of five books written between 1984 and 2006, is regarded as one of deepest works focusing on the Romulans.   In Dalla Van Hises  |Killing_Time|Killing_Time|  , the Romulans use time travel to alter history, which results in James T. Kirk becoming an ensign and Spock a starship captain.   A prototype Romulan warbird is the focus of Simon Hawke s novel  |The_Romulan_Prize|Simon_Hawkestar_Trek_The_Next_Generation|  .   Robert Greenbergers The Romulan Stratagem involves Jean-Luc Picard and his crew competing with the Romulan officer Sela to convince a planet to join their respective states.   In Diane Carey s Red Sector , Spock and Leonard McCoy try to cure a virus that has infected the Romulan royal family.   Josepha Sherman and Susan M. Schwartzs Vulcans Heart involved Spock traveling to Romulus to aid the Romulan Commander from The Enterprise Incident .    |Captains_Blood|Captains_Blood|  , one of many collaborative works between Star Trek lead William Shatner and husband-and-wife team Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens , focused on the involvement of Kirk in preventing a Romulan civil war in the aftermath of  |Star_Trek:_Nemesis|Star_Trek:_Nemesis| .   The Tomed Incident is the focus of David R. George IIIs novel Serpents Among the Ruins , which featured the crew of the  |Enterprise-B|Uss_Enterprise| .   Star Trek: Vulcans Soul is a trilogy written by Sherman and Shwartz between 2004 and 2007; set in the aftermath of the Dominion War , it focuses on members of Kirks original crew becoming involved in a war between the Romulans and a fellow Vulcan offshoot, the Watraii.   In  |Star_Trek:_Titan|Star_Trek:_Titan|  premier Taking Wing , the Romulan Star Empire collapses into civil war in the wake of Star Trek: Nemesis.   The Star Trek: Titan novel The Red King opens with the disappearance of a Romulan fleet and features Donatra, the Romulan commander featured in Star Trek: Nemesis, working alongside William Riker and his crew.   In the novel Kobayashi Maru by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels, Admiral Valdore attempts once again to cause conflict in the region approximately one year after the incident involving the Aenar, this time using a telecapture system, designed to take over and control enemy ships. Using three Klingon vessels, Valdore attacks Coalition of Planets allies hoping to weaken or destroy two enemies of the Romulan Star Empire by provoking a war. Captain Archer is eventually able to provide evidence of this Romulan deception. This is followed by yet another unsuccessful attempt to break apart the alliance which involves using telecaptured Vulcan cruisers against Proxima Centauri . In the book, the event that finally sparks the Coalitions declaration of war against the Romulans is the destruction of the Earth freighter  |Kobayashi_Maru|Kobayashi_Maru| .   The sequel to the novel Kobayashi Maru is titled The Romulan War: Beneath the Raptors Wing .
