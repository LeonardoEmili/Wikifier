        Lake Ladoga  is a  |freshwater|Fresh_Water| |_lake|Lake|  located in the  |Republic_of_Karelia|Republic_Of_Karelia|  and  |Leningrad_Oblast|Leningrad_Oblast|  in northwestern  |Russia|Russia| , in the vicinity of  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| .     It is the largest lake entirely in  |Europe|Europe| , and the  |14th_largest_freshwater_lake_by_area|List_Of_Lakes_By_Area|  in the world.  Ladoga Lacus , a  |methane|Methane|  lake on  |Saturns|Saturn| |_moon|Moons| |_Titan|Titan| , is named after the lake.       In one of  |Nestors|Nestor_The_Chronicler|  chronicles from the 12th century he mentions a lake called the Great Nevo , a clear link to the  |Neva_River|Neva_River|  and, possibly furthermore, to  |Finnish|Finnish_Language|  nevo sea or neva bog, quagmire .  |Evgeny_Pospelov|_Ru_Поспелов_Евгений_Михайлович| Geographical names of the world.

Ancient  |Norse_sagas|Norse_Sagas|  and Hanseatic treaties both mention a city made of lakes named  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse|  Aldeigja or Aldoga. S. V. Kirilovsky: Did you know? In: Gazetteer Leningrad region. Lenizdat, Leningrad 1974, p. 79 f. Since the beginning of the 14th century this hydronym was commonly known as Ladoga. According to T. N. Jackson, it can be taken almost for granted, that the name of Ladoga first referred to the river, then the city, and only then the lake. Therefore, he considers the primary hydronym Ladoga to originate in the eponymous inflow to the lower reaches of the  |Volkhov_River|Volkhov_River|  whose  |Finnic|Finnic_Languages|  name was Alodejoki  river of the lowlands .     The Germanic toponym was soon borrowed by the Slavic population and transformed by means of the Old Russian metathesis ald- → lad- to . The Old Norse intermediary word between Finnish and Old Russian word is fully supported by archeology, since the Scandinavians first appeared in Ladoga in the early 750s, that is, a couple of decades before the  |Slavs|Ilmen_Slavs| . T. N. Jackson:  Памятники средневековой культуры: Открытия и версии. Saint-Petersburg, 1994. С. 77—79.     Other theories about the origin of the name derive it from  wave and  wavy ; or from the Russian dialectal word алодь, meaning open lake, extensive water field . N. Mammoth: .  |Eugene_Helimski|Eugene_Helimski|  by contrast, offers an etymology rooted in  |German|German_Language| . In his opinion, the primary name of the lake was  old source , associated to the open sea, in contrast to the name of the  |Neva_River|Neva_River|  which would derive from the German expression for the new . Through the intermediate form Aldaugja,  cam about, referring to Ladoga . Eugene Helimski: .        The lake has an average surface area of 17,891  km 2 . Its north-to-south length is 219  km and its average width is 83  km; the average depth is 51  m, although it reaches a maximum of 230  m in the north-western part. Basin area: 276,000  km 2 , volume: 837  km 3 Sorokin, Aleksander I. et al. . .  Hydrobiologia  322.1–3, 65–67. . There are around 660 islands, with a total area of about 435  km 2 . Ladoga is, on average, 5  m above sea level. Калесник С.В. Ладожское озеро. Л.: Гидрометеоиздат, 1968. Most of the islands, including the famous  |Valaam|Valaam|  archipelago,  |Kilpola|Kilpola|  and  |Konevets|Konevets| , are situated in the northwest of the lake.     Separated from the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  by the  |Karelian_Isthmus|Karelian_Isthmus| , it drains into the  |Gulf_of_Finland|Gulf_Of_Finland|  via the  |Neva_River|Neva_River| .     Lake Ladoga is navigable, being a part of the  |Volga_Baltic_Waterway|Volga_Baltic_Waterway|  connecting the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  with the  |Volga_River|Volga_River| . The  |Ladoga_Canal|Ladoga_Canal|  bypasses the lake in the southern part, connecting the Neva to the Svir.     The basin of Lake Ladoga includes about 50,000 lakes and 3,500 rivers longer than 10  km. About 85% of the water inflow is due to tributaries, 13% is due to  |precipitation|Precipitation|        Geologically, the Lake Ladoga depression is a  |graben|Graben|  and  |syncline|Syncline| |_structure|Structural_Geology|  of  |Proterozoic|Proterozoic|  age . This Ladoga–Pasha structure , as it known, hosts  |Jotnian_sediments|Jotnian| . During the  |Pleistocene_glaciations|Quaternary_Glaciation|  the depression was partially stripped of its  |sedimentary_rock|Sedimentary_Rock|  fill by glacial  |overdeepening|Overdeepening| .  During the  |Last_Glacial_Maximum|Last_Glacial_Maximum| , about 17,000 years  |BP|Before_Present| , the lake served likely as a channel that concentrated ice of the  |Fennoscandian_Ice_Sheet|Fennoscandian_Ice_Sheet|  into an  |ice_stream|Ice_Stream|  that fed glacier lobes further east.      Deglaciation following the  |Weichselian_glaciation|Weichselian_Glaciation|  took place in the Lake Ladoga basin between 12,500 and 11,500  |radiocarbon_years_BP|Before_Present| . Lake Ladoga was initially part of the  |Baltic_Ice_Lake|Baltic_Ice_Lake|  , a historical  |freshwater|Freshwater|  stage of  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| . It is possible, though not certain, that Ladoga was isolated from it during  |regression|Regression|  of the subsequent  |Yoldia_Sea|Yoldia_Sea| |_brackish|Brackish|  stage . The isolation threshold should be at  |Heinjoki|Heinjoki|  to the east of  |Vyborg|Vyborg| , where the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  and Ladoga were connected by a strait or a river outlet at least until the formation of the River Neva, and possibly even much later, until the 12th century AD or so.  Davydova, Natalia N. et al. . .  Hydrobiologia  322.1–3, 199–204.     At 9,500 BP,  |Lake_Onega|Lake_Onega| , previously draining into the  |White_Sea|White_Sea| , started emptying into Ladoga via the  |River_Svir|River_Svir| . Between 9,500 and 9,100 BP, during the transgression of  |Ancylus_Lake|Ancylus_Lake| , the next freshwater stage of the Baltic, Ladoga certainly became part of it, even if they hadnt been connected immediately before. During the Ancylus Lake subsequent regression, around 8,800 BP Ladoga became isolated.       Ladoga slowly  |transgressed|Transgression|  in its southern part due to uplift of the  |Baltic_Shield|Baltic_Shield|  in the north. It has been hypothesized, but not proven, that waters of the  |Litorina_Sea|Litorina_Sea| , the next brackish-water stage of the Baltic, occasionally invaded Ladoga between 7,000 and 5,000 BP. Around 5,000 BP the waters of the  |Saimaa_Lake|Saimaa_Lake|  penetrated  |Salpausselkä|Salpausselkä|  and formed a new outlet,  |River_Vuoksi|River_Vuoksi| , entering Lake Ladoga in the northwestern corner and raising its level by 1–2 m. Saarnisto, Matti . The Late Weichselian and Flandrian history of the Saimaa Lake complex. Societas Scientiarium Fennicae. Commentationes Physico-Mathematicae 37.     The  |River_Neva|River_Neva|  originated when the Ladoga waters at last broke through the threshold at Porogi into the lower portions of  |Izhora_River|Izhora_River| , then a tributary of the  |Gulf_of_Finland|Gulf_Of_Finland| , between 4,000 and 2,000 BP. Dating of some sediments in the northwestern part of Lake Ladoga suggests it happened at 3,100  |radiocarbon_years_BP|Before_Present|  . Saarnisto, Matti & Tuulikki Grönlund . .

The Ladoga is rich with fish. 48 forms of fish have been encountered in the lake, including  |roach|Rutilus| ,  |carp_bream|Carp_Bream| ,  |zander|Zander| ,  |European_perch|European_Perch| ,  |ruffe|Ruffe| , endemic variety of  |smelt|Smelt| , two varieties of  Coregonus albula  , eight varieties of  Coregonus lavaretus, a number of other  Salmonidae  as well as, albeit rarely, endangered  |European_sea_sturgeon|European_Sea_Sturgeon| . Commercial fishing was once a major industry but has been hurt by overfishing. After the war, between 1945–1954, the total annual catch increased and reached a maximum of 4,900 tonnes. However, unbalanced fishery led to the drastic decrease of catch in 1955–1963, sometimes to 1,600 tonnes per year.  |Trawling|Trawling|  has been forbidden in Lake Ladoga since 1956 and some other restrictions were imposed. The situation gradually recovered, and in 1971–1990 the catch ranged between 4,900 and 6,900 tonnes per year, about the same level as the total catch in 1938. Kudersky, Leonid K. et al. . .  Hydrobiologia  322.1–3, 57–64. Fish farms and recreational fishing are developing.      It has its own  |endemic|Endemic| |_ringed_seal|Ringed_Seal|  subspecies known as the  |Ladoga_seal|Ladoga_Seal| .     Since the beginning of the 1960s Ladoga has become considerably  |eutrophic|Eutrophic| ated. Holopainen, Anna-Liisa et al.   .  Hydrobiologia  322.1–3, 9–16.      |Nizhnesvirsky_Natural_Reserve|Nizhnesvirsky_Natural_Reserve|  is situated along the shore of Lake Ladoga immediately to the north of the mouth of the  |River_Svir|River_Svir| .     The Ladoga has a population of  |Arctic_char|Arctic_Char|  that is genetically close to the  |chars_of_Lake_Sommen|Sommen_Charr|  and  |Lake_Vättern|Vättern|  in southern Sweden.           In the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , the lake formed a vital part of the  |_trade_route_from_the_Varangians_to_the_Eastern_Roman_Empire|Trade_Route_From_The_Varangians_To_The_Greeks| , with the Norse emporium at  |Staraya_Ladoga|Staraya_Ladoga|  defending the mouth of the Volkhov since the 8th century. In the course of the  |Swedish–Novgorodian_Wars|Swedish–Novgorodian_Wars| , the area was disputed between the  |Novgorod_Republic|Novgorod_Republic|  and  |Sweden|Sweden| . In the early 14th century, the fortresses of  |Korela|Korela_Fortress|  and  |Oreshek|Oreshek|  were established along the banks of the lake.     The ancient  |Valaam_Monastery|Valaam_Monastery|  was founded on the island of  |Valaam|Valaam| , the largest in Lake Ladoga, abandoned between 1611–1715, magnificently restored in the 18th century, and evacuated to Finland during the  |Winter_War|Winter_War|  in 1940. In 1989 the monastic activities in the Valaam were resumed. Other historic cloisters in the vicinity are the  |Konevets_Monastery|Konevets_Monastery| , which sits on the  |Konevets|Konevets|  island, and the  |Alexander_Svirsky_Monastery|Alexander_Svirsky_Monastery| , which preserves fine samples of medieval Muscovite architecture.     During the  |Ingrian_War|Ingrian_War| , a fraction of the Ladoga coast was occupied by  |Sweden|Sweden| . In 1617, by the  |Treaty_of_Stolbovo|Treaty_Of_Stolbovo| , the northern and western coast was ceded by Russia to Sweden. In 1721, after the  |Great_Northern_War|Great_Northern_War| , it was restitution to Russia by the  |Treaty_of_Nystad|Treaty_Of_Nystad| . In the 18th century, the  |Ladoga_Canal|Ladoga_Canal|  were built to bypass the lake which was prone to winds and storms that destroyed hundreds of cargo ships. Нежиховский Р.А. Река Нева. 3-е изд. Leningrad: Гидрометеоиздат, 1973. P. 158.     Later, in 1812–1940 the lake was shared between Finland and Russia. According to the conditions of the 1920  |Tartu_Peace_Treaty|Treaty_Of_Tartu|  militarization of the lake was severely restricted. However, both Soviet Russia and Finland had flotillas in Ladoga . After the  |Winter_War|Winter_War|  according to the  |Moscow_Peace_Treaty|Moscow_Peace_Treaty| , Ladoga, previously shared with Finland, became an internal basin of the Soviet Union.     During the  |Continuation_War|Continuation_War|  not only Finnish and Soviet, but also German and Italian vessels operated there . Under these circumstances, during much of the  |Siege_of_Leningrad|Siege_Of_Leningrad|  , Lake Ladoga provided the only access to the besieged city because a section of the eastern shore remained in Soviet hands. Supplies were transported into  |Leningrad|Saint_Petersburg|  with trucks on winter roads over the ice, the  |Road_of_Life|Road_Of_Life|  , and by boat in the summer. After World War II, Finland lost the  |Karelia|Karelia|  region again to the USSR, and all Finnish citizens were  |evacuated_from_the_ceded_territory|Evacuation_Of_Finnish_Karelia| . Ladoga became an internal Soviet basin once again. The northern shore,  |Ladoga_Karelia|Ladoga_Karelia|  with the town of  |Sortavala|Sortavala| , is now part of the  |Republic_of_Karelia|Republic_Of_Karelia| .
