   Physical chemistry is the study of  |macroscopic|Macroscopic_Scale| ,  |atomic|Atomic_Spacing| , subatomic, and particulate phenomena in  |chemical|Chemistry|  systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of  |physics|Physics|  such as  |motion|Motion| ,  |energy|Energy| ,  |force|Force| ,  |time|Time| ,  |thermodynamics|Thermodynamics| ,  |quantum_chemistry|Quantum_Chemistry| ,  |statistical_mechanics|Statistical_Mechanics| ,  |analytical_dynamics|Analytical_Dynamics|  and  |chemical_equilibrium|Chemical_Equilibrium| .     Physical chemistry, in contrast to  |chemical_physics|Chemical_Physics| , is predominantly a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which it was founded relate to the bulk rather than the molecular/atomic structure alone .     Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:    |Intermolecular_forces|Intermolecular_Force|  that act upon the physical properties of materials .    |Reaction_kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics|  on the  |rate_of_a_reaction|Reaction_Rate| .   The identity of ions and the electrical conductivity of materials.    |Surface_science|Surface_Science|  and  |electrochemistry|Electrochemistry|  of  |cell_membranes|Cell_Membrane| .    Interaction of one body with another in terms of quantities of  |heat|Heat|  and  |work|Work|  called thermodynamics.   Transfer of heat between a chemical system and its surroundings during change of  |phase|Phase|  or  |chemical_reaction|Chemical_Reaction|  taking place called  |thermochemistry|Thermochemistry|    Study of  |colligative_properties|Colligative_Properties|  of number of species present in solution.   Number of phases, number of components and degree of freedom can be correlated with one another with help of  |phase_rule|Phase_Rule| .   Reactions of  |electrochemical_cells|Electrochemical_Cell| .       The key concepts of physical chemistry are the ways in which pure  |physics|Physics|  is applied to chemical problems.     One of the key concepts in classical chemistry is that all  |chemical_compounds|Chemical_Species|  can be described as groups of  |atoms|Atoms| |_bonded|Chemical_Bond|  together and  |chemical_reactions|Chemical_Reactions|  can be described as the making and breaking of those bonds. Predicting the properties of chemical compounds from a description of atoms and how they bond is one of the major goals of physical chemistry. To describe the atoms and bonds precisely, it is necessary to know both where the  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus|  of the atoms are, and how electrons are distributed around them. Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald . Molecular Quantum Mechanics, p. 249. Oxford University Press, New York. .    |Quantum_chemistry|Quantum_Chemistry| , a subfield of physical chemistry especially concerned with the application of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  to chemical problems, provides tools to determine how strong and what shape bonds are, how nuclei move, and how light can be absorbed or emitted by a chemical compound. Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald . Molecular Quantum Mechanics, p. 342. Oxford University Press, New York. .  |Spectroscopy|Spectroscopy|  is the related sub-discipline of physical chemistry which is specifically concerned with the interaction of  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  with matter.     Another set of important questions in chemistry concerns what kind of reactions can happen spontaneously and which properties are possible for a given chemical mixture. This is studied in  |chemical_thermodynamics|Chemical_Thermodynamics| , which sets limits on quantities like how far a reaction can proceed, or how much  |energy|Energy|  can be converted into work in an  |internal_combustion_engine|Internal_Combustion_Engine| , and which provides links between properties like the  |thermal_expansion_coefficient|Thermal_Expansion_Coefficient|  and rate of change of  |entropy|Entropy|  with  |pressure|Pressure|  for a  |gas|Gas|  or a  |liquid|Liquid| . Landau, L.D. and Lifshitz, E.M. . Statistical Physics, 3rd Ed. p. 52. Elsevier Butterworth Heinemann, New York. . It can frequently be used to assess whether a reactor or engine design is feasible, or to check the validity of experimental data. To a limited extent,  |quasi_equilibrium|Quasi_Equilibrium|  and  |non_equilibrium_thermodynamics|Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics|  can describe irreversible changes. Hill, Terrell L. . Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics, p. 1. Dover Publications, New York. . However, classical thermodynamics is mostly concerned with systems in  |equilibrium|Thermodynamic_Equilibrium|  and  |reversible_changes|Reversible_Process|  and not what actually does happen, or how fast, away from equilibrium.     Which reactions do occur and how fast is the subject of  |chemical_kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics| , another branch of physical chemistry. A key idea in chemical kinetics is that for  |reactants|Reagent|  to react and form  |products|Product| , most chemical species must go through  |transition_states|Transition_State|  which are higher in  |energy|Thermodynamic_Free_Energy|  than either the reactants or the products and serve as a barrier to reaction. Schmidt, Lanny D. . The Engineering of Chemical Reactions, 2nd Ed. p. 30. Oxford University Press, New York. . In general, the higher the barrier, the slower the reaction. A second is that most chemical reactions occur as a sequence of  |elementary_reactions|Elementary_Reaction| , Schmidt, Lanny D. . The Engineering of Chemical Reactions, 2nd Ed. pp. 25, 32. Oxford University Press, New York. . each with its own transition state. Key questions in kinetics include how the rate of reaction depends on temperature and on the concentrations of reactants and  |catalysts|Catalysts|  in the reaction mixture, as well as how catalysts and reaction conditions can be engineered to optimize the reaction rate.     The fact that how fast reactions occur can often be specified with just a few concentrations and a temperature, instead of needing to know all the positions and speeds of every molecule in a mixture, is a special case of another key concept in physical chemistry, which is that to the extent an engineer needs to know, everything going on in a mixture of very large numbers  of particles can often be described by just a few variables like pressure, temperature, and concentration. The precise reasons for this are described in  |statistical_mechanics|Statistical_Mechanics| , Chandler, David . Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics, p. 54. Oxford University Press, New York. . a specialty within physical chemistry which is also shared with physics. Statistical mechanics also provides ways to predict the properties we see in everyday life from molecular properties without relying on empirical correlations based on chemical similarities.             The term physical chemistry was coined by  |Mikhail_Lomonosov|Mikhail_Lomonosov|  in 1752, when he presented a lecture course entitled A Course in True Physical Chemistry before the students of  |Petersburg_University|Petersburg_University| .  In the preamble to these lectures he gives the definition: Physical chemistry is the science that must explain under provisions of physical experiments the reason for what is happening in complex bodies through chemical operations .     Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on  |chemical_thermodynamics|Chemical_Thermodynamics| ,  |electrolytes|Electrolyte|  in solutions,  |chemical_kinetics|Chemical_Kinetics|  and other subjects. One milestone was the publication in 1876 by  |Josiah_Willard_Gibbs|Josiah_Willard_Gibbs|  of his paper,  On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances . This paper introduced several of the cornerstones of physical chemistry, such as  |Gibbs_energy|Gibbs_Free_Energy| ,  |chemical_potentials|Chemical_Potential| , and  |Gibbs_phase_rule|Gibbs_Phase_Rule| . Josiah Willard Gibbs, 1876,  |On_the_Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances|On_The_Equilibrium_Of_Heterogeneous_Substances|  , Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences     The first  |scientific_journal|Scientific_Journal|  specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal,  Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie , founded in 1887 by  |Wilhelm_Ostwald|Wilhelm_Ostwald|  and  |Jacobus_Henricus_van_t_Hoff|Jacobus_Henricus_Van_T_Hoff| . Together with  |Svante_August_Arrhenius|Svante_August_Arrhenius| ,  these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  between 1901–1909.     Developments in the following decades include the application of  |statistical_mechanics|Statistical_Mechanics|  to chemical systems and work on  |colloids|Colloid|  and  |surface_chemistry|Surface_Chemistry| , where  |Irving_Langmuir|Irving_Langmuir|  made many contributions. Another important step was the development of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  into  |quantum_chemistry|Quantum_Chemistry|  from the 1930s, where  |Linus_Pauling|Linus_Pauling|  was one of the leading names. Theoretical developments have gone hand in hand with developments in experimental methods, where the use of different forms of  |spectroscopy|Spectroscopy| , such as  |infrared_spectroscopy|Infrared_Spectroscopy| ,  |microwave_spectroscopy|Microwave_Spectroscopy| ,  |electron_paramagnetic_resonance|Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance|  and  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy| , is probably the most important 20th century development.     Further development in physical chemistry may be attributed to discoveries in  |nuclear_chemistry|Nuclear_Chemistry| , especially in isotope separation , more recent discoveries in  |astrochemistry|Astrochemistry| ,  as well as the development of calculation algorithms in the field of additive physicochemical properties , and herein lies the practical importance of contemporary physical chemistry.
