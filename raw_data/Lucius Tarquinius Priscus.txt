Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, or Tarquin the Elder, was the legendary fifth  |king_of_Rome|Kings_Of_Rome|  from 616 to 579 BC. His wife was  |Tanaquil|Tanaquil| .       According to  |Livy|Livy| , Tarquin came from  |Etruria|Etruria| . Livy claims that his original  |Etruscan|Etruscan_Language|  name was Lucumo, but since  |lucumo|Lucumo|   is the Etruscan word for king , there is reason to believe that Priscus name and title have been confused in the official tradition. After inheriting his fathers entire fortune, Lucius attempted to gain a political office. Disgruntled with his opportunities in Etruria , he migrated to  |Rome|Rome|  with his wife  |Tanaquil|Tanaquil| , at her suggestion. Legend has it that on his arrival in Rome in a  |chariot|Chariot| , an eagle took his cap, flew away and then returned it back upon his head. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, interpreted this as an  |omen|Omen|  of his future greatness. In Rome, he attained respect through his courtesy. The king himself noticed Tarquinius and, by his will, appointed Tarquinius guardian of his own sons.  |Livy|Livy| ,  Ab urbe condita ,  |1_34|S_From_The_Founding_Of_The_City_Book_134|           Although  |Ancus_Marcius|Ancus_Marcius| , the Roman king, was the grandson of  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius| , the second King of Rome, the principle of hereditary monarchy was not yet established at Rome; none of the first three kings had been succeeded by their sons, and each subsequent king had been acclaimed by the people. Upon the death of Marcius, Tarquin addressed the  Comitia Curiata  and convinced them that he should be elected king over Marcius natural sons, who were still only youths. In one tradition, the sons were away on a hunting expedition at the time of their fathers death, and were thus unable to affect the assemblys choice.  |Livy|Livy| ,  Ab urbe condita ,  |1_35|S_From_The_Founding_Of_The_City_Book_135|      According to Livy, Tarquin increased the number of the  |Senate|Senate_Of_The_Roman_Kingdom|  by adding one hundred men from the leading minor families. Among these was the family of the  |Octavii|Octavia| , from whom the first emperor,  |Augustus|Augustus| , was descended.  |Suetonius|Suetonius| , The Life of Augustus .     Tarquins first war was waged against the  |Latins|Latin_Leaguewar_With_Rome_Under_Tarquinius_Priscus| . Tarquinius took the Latin town of  |Apiolae|Apiolae|  by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome. According to the  Fasti Triumphales , this war must have occurred prior to 588 BC.     His military ability was then tested by an  |attack|Roman_Sabine_Warswar_With_Tarquinius_Priscus|  from the  |Sabines|Sabines| , who received auxiliaries from five Etruscan cities. Tarquin doubled the numbers of  |equites|Roman_Equestrian_Order|  to help the war effort. The Sabines were defeated after difficult street fighting in the city of Rome.  |Eutropius|Eutropius| , Breviarium historiae romanae, I, 6. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquin received the town of  |Collatia|Collatia| , and appointed his nephew,  |Arruns_Tarquinius|Arruns_Tarquinius| , better known as Egerius, as commander of the garrison there. Tarquin returned to Rome and celebrated a  |triumph|Roman_Triumph|  on September 13, 585 BC. Fasti Triumphales     Subsequently, the Latin cities of  |Corniculum|Corniculum| , old  |Ficulea|Ficulea| ,  |Cameria|Cameria| ,  |Crustumerium|Crustumerium| ,  |Ameriola|Ameriola| ,  |Medullia|Medullia| , and  |Nomentum|Nomentum|  were subdued and became Roman.  |Livy|Livy| ,  Ab urbe condita ,  |1_38|S_From_The_Founding_Of_The_City_Book_138|      Since Tarquin had kept the captured Etruscan auxiliaries prisoners for meddling in the war with the Sabines, the five Etruscan cities who had taken part declared war on Rome. Seven other Etruscan cities joined forces with them. The Etruscans soon captured the Roman colony at Fidenae, which thereupon became the focal point of the war. After several bloody battles, Tarquin was once again victorious, and he subjugated the Etruscan cities who had taken part in the war. At the successful conclusion of each of his wars, Rome was enriched by Tarquins plunder.      Tarquin is said to have built the  |Circus_Maximus|Circus_Maximus| , the first and largest stadium at Rome, for chariot racing. Raised seating was erected privately by the senators and equites, and other areas were marked out for private citizens. There the king established a series of annual games; according to Livy, the first horses and boxers to participate were brought from Etruria.     After a great flood, Tarquin drained the damp lowlands of Rome by constructing the  |Cloaca_Maxima|Cloaca_Maxima| , Romes great sewer. He also constructed a stone wall around the city, and began the construction of a temple in honour of  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  Optimus Maximus on the  |Capitoline_Hill|Capitoline_Hill| . The latter is said to have been funded in part by the plunder seized from the Sabines.     According to Florus, Tarquin celebrated his triumphs in the Etruscan fashion, riding a golden chariot drawn by four horses, while wearing a gold-embroidered  |toga|Toga|  and the tunica palmata, a tunic upon which palm-leaves were embroidered. He also introduced other Etruscan insignia of civilian authority and military distinction: the  |sceptre|Sceptre|  of the king; the  |trabea|Trabea| , a purple garment that varied in form, but was perhaps most often used as a mantle; the  |fasces|Fasces|  carried by the  |lictors|Lictor| ; the  |curule_chair|Curule_Seat| ; the  |toga_praetexta|Togavarieties| , later worn by various magistrates and officials; the rings worn by  |senators|Roman_Senate| ; the  |paludamentum|Paludamentum| , a cloak associated with military command; and the  |phalera|Phalera| , a disc of metal worn on a soldiers breastplate during parades, or displayed on the standards of various military units.  |Florus|Florus| , Epitoma de Tito Livio bellorum omnium annorum DCC, I, 5.6. Strabo reports that Tarquin introduced Etruscan sacrificial and divinitory rites, as well as the  |tuba|Roman_Tuba| , a straight horn used chiefly for military purposes. Strabo, Geographia, V, 2.2        Tarquin is said to have reigned for thirty-eight years. According to legend, the sons of his predecessor, Ancus Marcius, believed that the throne should have been theirs. They arranged the kings  |assassination|Assassination| , disguised as a riot, during which Tarquin received a fatal blow to the head. However, the queen, Tanaquil, gave out that the king was merely wounded, and took advantage of the confusion to establish  |Servius_Tullius|Servius_Tullius|  as regent; when the death of Tarquin was confirmed, Tullius became king, in place of Marcius sons, or those of Tarquin.     Tullius, said to have been the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who had fallen in battle against Tarquin, was brought to the palace as a child with his mother, Ocreisia. According to legend, Tanaquil discovered his potential for greatness by means of various omens, and therefore preferred him to her own sons. Tullius married  |Tarquinia|Tarquinia| , one of Priscus daughters, thus providing a vital link between the families. Tullius own daughters were subsequently married to the kings sons , Lucius and  |Arruns|Arruns_Tarquinius| .     Most ancient writers regarded Tarquin as the father of  |Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus|Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus| , the seventh and last King of Rome, but some stated that the younger Tarquin was his grandson. As the younger Tarquin died about 496 BC, more than eighty years after Tarquinius Priscus, chronology seems to support the latter tradition. An Etruscan legend related by the emperor  |Claudius|Claudius|  equates Servius Tullius with Macstarna , a companion of the Etruscan heroes Aulus and  |Caelius_Vibenna|Caelius_Vibenna| , who helped free the brothers from captivity, slaying their captors, including a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius. This episode is depicted in a fresco at the tomb of the Etruscan Saties family at  |Vulci|Volci| , now known as the  |François_Tomb|François_Tomb| . This tradition suggests that perhaps the sons of the elder Tarquin attempted to seize power, but were defeated by the regent, Servius Tullius, and his companions; Tullius would then have attempted to end the dynastic struggle by marrying his daughters to the grandsons of Tarquinius Priscus. However, this plan ultimately failed, as Tullius was himself assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law, who succeeded him.
