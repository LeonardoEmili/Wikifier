Tolkien was one of the first critics to treat Beowulf as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, and his 1936 lecture  Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics  is still required in some Old English courses. Tolkien borrowed several elements from Beowulf, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon.  Certain descriptions in The Hobbit seem to have been lifted straight out of Beowulf with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders.  Likewise, Tolkiens descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in Beowulf. Other specific plot elements and features in The Hobbit that show similarities to Beowulf include the title thief, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaugs personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.  Tolkien refines parts of Beowulf plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragons intellect and personality.      Another influence from Old English sources is the appearance of named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action.

In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thrors map, and the Map of Wilderland , both printed in black and red on the papers cream background.      Originally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkiens first tendered sketches so charmed the publishers staff that they opted to include them without raising the books price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: The Hill: Hobbiton -across-the-Water, The Trolls , The Mountain Path, The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate ,  Beorn s Hall,  Mirkwood ,  The Elvenking s Gate,  Lake Town , The Front Gate , and The Hall at Bag-End . All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.      Satisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket.

Once illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later.

Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: ...The first men to talk of trees and stars saw things very differently.

The tale as such explores the theme of heroism.

Publication of the sequel The Lord of the Rings altered many critics reception of the work. Instead of approaching The Hobbit as a childrens book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of The Hobbit as being a prelude , relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work.

Commentators such as Paul Kocher,  John D. Rateliff  and C. W. Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately, both because The Hobbit was conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers expectations of tone and style.         The Lord of the RingsThe Hobbit has been adapted and elaborated upon in many ways, its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often claimed to be its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novels main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground ; they engage another group of elves ; they traverse a desolate region ; they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men ; they fight in a massive battle ; their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak ; a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne ; and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition .        The Lord of the Rings contains several more supporting scenes, and has a more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not. Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children, and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication.
