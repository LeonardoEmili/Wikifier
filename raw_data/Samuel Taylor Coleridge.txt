              Samuel Taylor Coleridge   was an English  |poet|Poet| ,  |literary_critic|Literary_Criticism| ,  |philosopher|Philosopher|  and theologian who, with his friend  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth| , was a founder of the  |Romantic_Movement|Romanticism|  in England and a member of the  |Lake_Poets|Lake_Poets| . He also shared volumes and collaborated with  |Charles_Lamb|Charles_Lamb| ,  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey| , and  |Charles_Lloyd|Charles_Lloyd| . He wrote the poems  The Rime of the Ancient Mariner  and  Kubla Khan , as well as the major prose work  Biographia Literaria . His critical work, especially on  |William_Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare| , was highly influential, and he helped introduce  |German_idealist|German_Idealism|  philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including  |suspension_of_disbelief|Suspension_Of_Disbelief| . He had a major influence on  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|  and on American  |transcendentalism|Transcendentalism| .     Throughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had  |bipolar_disorder|Bipolar_Disorder| , which had not been defined during his lifetime. Jamison, Kay Redfield. Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. Free Press , 219–224. He was physically unhealthy, which may have stemmed from a bout of  |rheumatic_fever|Rheumatic_Fever|  and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with  |laudanum|Laudanum| , which fostered a lifelong  |opium|Opium|  addiction.            Coleridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the town of  |Ottery_St_Mary|Ottery_St_Mary|  in  |Devon|Devon| , England. Radley, 13 Samuels father was the Reverend John Coleridge , the well-respected  |vicar|Vicar|  of  |St_Marys_Church,_Ottery_St_Mary|St_Marys_Church,_Ottery_St_Mary|  and was headmaster of the  |Kings_School|Kings_School_Ottery_St._Mary| , a free  |grammar_school|Grammar_School|  established by King  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  in the town. He had previously been master of  |Hugh_Squiers|Hugh_Squier|  School in  |South_Molton|South_Molton| , Devon, and lecturer of nearby  |Molland|Molland| . Unsworth, John, The Early Background of S.T.

Shewell, & Sanborn p.2 After John Coleridge died in 1781, 8-year-old Samuel was sent to  |Christs_Hospital|Christs_Hospital| , a charity school which was founded in the 16th century in  |Greyfriars|Christs_Hospital| , London, where he remained throughout his childhood, studying and writing poetry. At that school Coleridge became friends with  |Charles_Lamb|Charles_Lamb| , a schoolmate, and studied the works of  |Virgil|Virgil|  and  |William_Lisle_Bowles|William_Lisle_Bowles| . Morley, Henry. Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christobel, & c. New York: Routledge pp.i-iv   In one of a series of autobiographical letters written to  |Thomas_Poole|Thomas_Poole| , Coleridge wrote: At six years old I remember to have read Belisarius,  Robinson Crusoe , and Philip Quarll – and then I found the Arabian Nights Entertainments – one tale of which made so deep an impression on me that I was haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark – and I distinctly remember the anxious and fearful eagerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books lay – and whenever the sun lay upon them, I would seize it, carry it by the wall, and bask, and read.     Coleridge seems to have appreciated his teacher, as he wrote in recollections of his school days in Biographia Literaria |Greek_Tragic_Poets|Ancient_Greek_Literature| , he made us read  |Shakespeare|Shakespeare|  and  |Milton|John_Milton|  as lessons: and they were the lessons too, which required most time and trouble to bring up, so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest, and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes. In our own English compositions he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image, unsupported by a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words... In fancy I can almost hear him now, exclaiming Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean! Muse, boy, Muse? your Nurses daughter, you mean! Pierian spring? Oh aye! the cloister-pump, I suppose! Be this as it may, there was one custom of our masters, which I cannot pass over in silence, because I think it ... worthy of imitation. He would often permit our theme exercises, ... to accumulate, till each lad had four or five to be looked over. Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk, he would ask the writer, why this or that sentence might not have found as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis: and if no satisfying answer could be returned, and two faults of the same kind were found in one exercise, the irrevocable verdict followed, the exercise was torn up, and another on the same subject to be produced, in addition to the tasks of the day. Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Biographia Literaria. Princeton UP, 1985, p. 10.     He later wrote of his loneliness at school in the poem  Frost at Midnight  |Jesus_College,_Cambridge|Jesus_College,_Cambridge| .  In 1792, he won the Browne Gold Medal for an ode that he wrote on the  |slave_trade|Slave_Trade| . Radley, 14 In December 1793, he left the college and enlisted in the 15th Light Dragoons using the false name Silas Tomkyn Comberbache , Holmes, 4 perhaps because of debt or because the girl that he loved,  |Mary_Evans|Mary_Evans| , had rejected him. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of insanity and he was readmitted to Jesus College, though he would never receive a degree from the university.                 At Jesus College, Coleridge was introduced to political and theological ideas then considered radical, including those of the poet  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey|  with whom he collaborated on the play  The Fall of Robespierre . Coleridge joined Southey in a plan, later abandoned, to found a  |utopia|Utopia| n  |commune|Commune| -like society, called  |Pantisocracy|Pantisocracy| , in the wilderness of  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania| . In 1795, the two friends married sisters Sara and Edith Fricker, in  |St_Mary_Redcliffe|St_Mary_Redcliffe| , Bristol,  but Coleridges marriage with Sara proved unhappy. He grew to detest his wife, whom he married mainly because of social constraints. Following the birth of their fourth child, he eventually separated from her.     A third sister, Mary, had already married a third poet  |Robert_Lovell|Robert_Lovell|  and both became partners in Pantisocracy. Lovell also introduced Coleridge and Southey to their future patron  |Joseph_Cottle|Joseph_Cottle|  but died of a fever in April 1796. Coleridge was with him at his death.     In 1796 he released his first volume of poems entitled Poems on various subjects, which also included four poems by Charles Lamb as well as a collaboration with Robert Southey and a work suggested by his and Lambs schoolfriend Robert Favell. Among the poems were  Religious Musings ,  Monody on the Death of Chatterton  and an early version of  The Eolian Harp  entitled Effusion 35. A second edition was printed in 1797, this time including an appendix of works by Lamb and  |Charles_Lloyd|Charles_Lloyd| , a young poet to whom Coleridge had become a private tutor.     In 1796 he also privately printed Sonnets from Various Authors, including sonnets by Lamb, Lloyd, Southey and himself as well as older poets such as  |William_Lisle_Bowles|William_Lisle_Bowles| .     Coleridge made plans to establish a journal,  The Watchman , to be printed every eight days to avoid a weekly newspaper tax. Bate, 24 The first issue of the short-lived journal was published in March 1796. It had ceased publication by May of that year. Radley, 16     The years 1797 and 1798, during which he lived in what is now known as  |Coleridge_Cottage|Coleridge_Cottage| , in  |Nether_Stowey|Nether_Stowey| , Somerset, were among the most fruitful of Coleridges life. In 1795, Coleridge met poet  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  and his sister  |Dorothy|Dorothy_Wordsworth| .  Besides  The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , Coleridge composed the symbolic poem  Kubla Khan , written—Coleridge himself claimed—as a result of an opium dream, in a kind of a reverie ; and the first part of the narrative poem Christabel. The writing of Kubla Khan, written about the  |Mongol|Mongol|  emperor  |Kublai_Khan|Kublai_Khan|  and his legendary palace at  |Xanadu|Xanadu,_Inner_Mongolia| , was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a  |Person_from_Porlock|Person_From_Porlock|  – an event that has been embellished upon in such varied contexts as science fiction and Nabokovs  Lolita . During this period, he also produced his much-praised  |conversation_poems|Conversation_Poems|   This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison ,  Frost at Midnight , and  The Nightingale .     In 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth published a joint volume of poetry,  Lyrical Ballads , which proved to be the starting point for the English  |romantic_age|Romantic_Age| . Wordsworth may have contributed more poems, but the real star of the collection was Coleridges first version of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It was the longest work and drew more praise and attention than anything else in the volume. In the spring Coleridge temporarily took over for Rev.  |Joshua_Toulmin|Joshua_Toulmin|  at Tauntons  |Mary_Street_Unitarian_Chapel|Taunton_Unitarian_Chapel|  Welcome to Tauntons Historic Unitarian Congregation and Chapel . . Obtained 21 October 2006. while Rev. Toulmin grieved over the drowning death of his daughter Jane. Poetically commenting on Toulmins strength, Coleridge wrote in a 1798 letter to  |John_Prior_Estlin|John_Prior_Estlin| , I walked into Taunton and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. I suppose you must have heard that his daughter, in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between  |Sidmouth|Sidmouth|  and Bere  . These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian, – there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the  |Heavenly_Father|Heavenly_Father| .           Coleridge also worked briefly in  |Shropshire|Shropshire| , where he came in December 1797 as locum to its local Unitarian minister, Dr Rowe, in their church in the High Street at  |Shrewsbury|Shrewsbury| . He is said to have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner at a literary evening in Mardol. He was then contemplating a career in the ministry, and gave a probationary sermon in High Street church on Sunday, 14 January 1798.  |William_Hazlitt|William_Hazlitt| , a Unitarian ministers son, was in the congregation, having walked from  |Wem|Wem|  to hear him. Coleridge later visited Hazlitt and  |his_father|William_Hazlitt|  at Wem but within a day or two of preaching he received a letter from  |Josiah_Wedgwood_II|Josiah_Wedgwood_Ii| , who had offered to help him out of financial difficulties with an annuity of £150  per year on condition he give up his ministerial career. Coleridge accepted this, to the disappointment of Hazlitt who hoped to have him as a neighbour in Shropshire.      From 16 September 1798, Coleridge and the Wordsworths left for a stay in Germany; Coleridge soon went his own way and spent much of his time in university towns. In February 1799 he enrolled at the  |University_of_Göttingen|University_Of_Göttingen| , where he attended lectures by  |Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach|Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach|  and  |Johann_Gottfried_Eichhorn|Johann_Gottfried_Eichhorn| .  During this period, he became interested in German philosophy, especially the  |transcendental_idealism|Transcendental_Idealism|  and  |critical_philosophy|Critical_Philosophy|  of  |Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel_Kant| , and in the  |literary_criticism|Literary_Criticism|  of the 18th-century dramatist  |Gotthold_Lessing|Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing| . Coleridge studied German and, after his return to England, translated the dramatic trilogy Wallenstein by the German Classical poet  |Friedrich_Schiller|Friedrich_Schiller|  into English. He continued to pioneer these ideas through his own critical writings for the rest of his life , although they were unfamiliar and difficult for a culture dominated by  |empiricism|Empiricism| .     In 1799, Coleridge and the Wordsworths stayed at Thomas Hutchinsons farm on the  |River_Tees|River_Tees|  at  |Sockburn|Sockburn| , near  |Darlington|Darlington| .        It was at Sockburn that Coleridge wrote his ballad-poem Love, addressed to Sara Hutchinson. The knight mentioned is the mailed figure on the Conyers tomb in ruined Sockburn church. The figure has a  |wyvern|Wyvern|  at his feet, a reference to the  |Sockburn_Worm|Sockburn_Worm|  slain by Sir John Conyers . The worm was supposedly buried under the rock in the nearby pasture; this was the greystone of Coleridges first draft, later transformed into a mount. The poem was a direct inspiration for  |John_Keats|John_Keats|  famous poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci. The Conyers falchion is traditionally presented to incoming  |Bishops_of_Durham|Bishops_Of_Durham| , as they ride across the bridge at  |Croft|Croft-On-Tees| .     Coleridges early intellectual debts, besides German idealists like Kant and critics like Lessing, were first to  |William_Godwins|William_Godwin|  Political Justice, especially during his Pantisocratic period, and to  |David_Hartleys|David_Hartley|  Observations on Man, which is the source of the psychology which is found in Frost at Midnight. Hartley argued that one becomes aware of sensory events as impressions, and that ideas are derived by noticing similarities and differences between impressions and then by naming them. Connections resulting from the coincidence of impressions create linkages, so that the occurrence of one impression triggers those links and calls up the memory of those ideas with which it is associated .     Coleridge was critical of the literary taste of his contemporaries, and a literary conservative insofar as he was afraid that the lack of taste in the ever growing masses of literate people would mean a continued desecration of literature itself.     In 1800, he returned to England and shortly thereafter settled with his family and friends at  |Keswick|Keswick,_Cumbria|  in the  |Lake_District|Lake_District|  of  |Cumberland|Cumberland,_England|  to be near  |Grasmere|Grasmere| , where Wordsworth had moved. He was a houseguest of the Wordsworths for eighteen months, but was a difficult houseguest, as his dependency on  |laudanum|Laudanum|  grew and his frequent nightmares would wake the children. He was also a fussy eater, to  |Dorothy_Wordsworths|Dorothy_Wordsworth|  frustration, who had to cook. For example, not content with salt, Coleridge sprinkled  |cayenne_pepper|Cayenne_Pepper|  on his eggs, which he ate from a teacup.  His marital problems, nightmares, illnesses, increased opium dependency, tensions with Wordsworth, and a lack of confidence in his poetic powers fuelled the composition of Dejection: An Ode and an intensification of his philosophical studies.      In 1802, Coleridge took a nine-day walking holiday in the fells of the  |Lake_District|Lake_District| . Coleridge is credited with the first recorded descent of  |Scafell|Scafell|  to  |Mickledore|Mickledore|  via Broad Stand, although this was more due to his getting lost than a keenness for mountaineering.                The Friend |Sicily|Sicily|  and  |Malta|Malta| , working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner,  |Alexander_Ball|Alexander_Ball| , a task he performed quite successfully. He lived in  |San_Anton_Palace|San_Anton_Palace|  in the village of  |Attard|Attard| . He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return. From 1807 to 1808, Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy, in the hope that leaving Britains damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium.  |Thomas_De_Quincey|Thomas_De_Quincey|  alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth. It has been suggested that this reflects De Quinceys own experiences more than Coleridges.      His opium addiction  now began to take over his life: he separated from his wife Sara in 1808, quarrelled with Wordsworth in 1810, lost part of his annuity in 1811, and put himself under the care of Dr. Daniel in 1814. His addiction caused severe constipation, which required regular and humiliating enemas. Holmes, Richard. Coleridge: Darker Reflections, London: HarperCollins, 1998, pp. 12–14 .      In 1809, Coleridge made his second attempt to become a newspaper publisher with the publication of the journal entitled The Friend. It was a weekly publication that, in Coleridge’s typically ambitious style, was written, edited, and published almost entirely single-handedly. Given that Coleridge tended to be highly disorganised and had no head for business, the publication was probably doomed from the start. Coleridge financed the journal by selling over five hundred subscriptions, over two dozen of which were sold to members of Parliament, but in late 1809, publication was crippled by a financial crisis and Coleridge was obliged to approach  |Conversation_Sharp|Richard_Sharp| , For an appraisal of Sharps role in Coleridges career, see Knapman, D. Conversation Sharp: the Biography of a London Gentleman, Richard Sharp , in Letters, Prose and Verse. Tom Poole and one or two other wealthy friends for an emergency loan to continue. The Friend was an eclectic publication that drew upon every corner of Coleridges remarkably diverse knowledge of law, philosophy, morals, politics, history, and literary criticism. Although it was often turgid, rambling, and inaccessible to most readers, it ran for 25 issues and was republished in book form a number of times. Years after its initial publication, The Friend became a highly influential work and its effect was felt on writers and philosophers from  |John_Stuart_Mill|John_Stuart_Mill|  to  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson| .          Between 1810 and 1820, Coleridge gave a series of lectures in London and  |Bristol|Bristol|  – those on  |Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare|  renewed interest in the playwright as a model for contemporary writers. Much of Coleridges reputation as a literary critic is founded on the lectures that he undertook in the winter of 1810–11, which were sponsored by the Philosophical Institution and given at Scots Corporation Hall off Fetter Lane, Fleet Street. These lectures were heralded in the prospectus as A Course of Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, in Illustration of the Principles of Poetry. Coleridges ill-health, opium-addiction problems, and somewhat unstable personality meant that all his lectures were plagued with problems of delays and a general irregularity of quality from one lecture to the next. As a result of these factors, Coleridge often failed to prepare anything but the loosest set of notes for his lectures and regularly entered into extremely long digressions which his audiences found difficult to follow. However, it was the lecture on  Hamlet  given on 2 January 1812 that was considered the best and has influenced Hamlet studies ever since. Before Coleridge, Hamlet was often denigrated and belittled by critics from  |Voltaire|Voltaire|  to  |Dr._Johnson|Samuel_Johnson| . Coleridge rescued the plays reputation, and his thoughts on it are often still published as supplements to the text.     In 1812 he allowed Robert Southey to make use of extracts from his vast number of private notebooks in their collaboration Omniana; Or, Horae Otiosiores.     In August 1814, Coleridge was approached by  |Lord_Byrons|Lord_Byron|  publisher,  |John_Murray|John_Murray| , about the possibility of translating Goethes classic  Faust  . Coleridge was regarded by many as the greatest living writer on the  |demonic|Demonology|  and he accepted the commission, only to abandon work on it after six weeks. Until recently, scholars were in agreement that Coleridge never returned to the project, despite Goethes own belief in the 1820s that he had in fact completed a long translation of the work. In September 2007,  |Oxford_University_Press|Oxford_University_Press|  sparked a heated scholarly controversy by publishing an English translation of Goethes work that purported to be Coleridges long-lost masterpiece . The debate is being followed at a dedicated page on .     Between 1814 and 1816, Coleridge lived in  |Calne|Calne| ,  |Wiltshire|Wiltshire|  and seemed able to focus on his work and manage his addiction, drafting  Biographia Literaria . He rented rooms from a local surgeon, Mr Page, on Church Street, just opposite the entrance to the churchyard. A  |blue_plaque|Blue_Plaque|  marks the property today.       In April 1816, Coleridge, with his addiction worsening, his spirits depressed, and his family alienated, took residence in the  |Highgate|Highgate|  homes, then just north of London, of the physician James Gillman, first at South Grove and later at the nearby 3 The Grove. Holmes , p.429. It is unclear whether his growing use of opium was a symptom or a cause of his growing depression. Gillman was partially successful in controlling the poets addiction. Coleridge remained in Highgate for the rest of his life, and the house became a place of literary pilgrimage for writers including  |Carlyle|Thomas_Carlyle|  and Emerson.     In Gillmans home, Coleridge finished his major prose work, the Biographia Literaria , a volume composed of 23 chapters of autobiographical notes and dissertations on various subjects, including some incisive literary theory and criticism. He composed a considerable amount of poetry, of variable quality. He published other writings while he was living at the Gillman homes, notably the Lay Sermons of 1816 and 1817, Sibylline Leaves , Hush , Aids to Reflection , and On the Constitution of the Church and State .  He also produced essays published shortly after his death, such as Essay on Faith  and Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit .  A number of his followers were central to the  |Oxford_Movement|Oxford_Movement| , and his religious writings profoundly shaped Anglicanism in the mid-nineteenth century. See Stephen Prickett, Romanticism and Religion .     Coleridge also worked extensively on the various manuscripts which form his Opus Maximum , a work which was in part intended as a post-Kantian work of philosophical synthesis. The work was never published in his lifetime, and has frequently been seen as evidence for his tendency to conceive grand projects which he then had difficulty in carrying through to completion. But while he frequently berated himself for his indolence , the long list of his published works calls this myth into some question. Critics are divided on whether the Opus Maximum , first published in 2002, successfully resolved the philosophical issues he had been exploring for most of his adult life. Mary Anne Perkins and Nicholas Reid both argue that in September 1818 Coleridge resolved the problems he had earlier faced in his discussion of Schelling in the Biographia, and that the Opus Maximum accordingly sets out a relatively systematic post-Kantian position .     Coleridge died in Highgate, London on 25 July 1834 as a result of heart failure compounded by an unknown lung disorder, possibly linked to his use of opium. Coleridge had spent 18 years under the roof of the Gillman family, who built an addition onto their home to accommodate the poet.  Faith may be defined as fidelity to our own being, so far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses; and hence, by clear inference or implication to being generally, as far as the same is not the object of the senses; and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition, or concomitant, or consequence of the same. This will be best explained by an instance or example. That I am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as I would they should do unto me; in other words a categorical imperative; that the maxim  of my actions, both inward and outward, should be such as I could, without any contradiction arising therefrom, will to be the law of all moral and rational beings. Essay on Faith     Carlyle described him at Highgate: Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill, in those years, looking down on London and its smoke-tumult, like a sage escaped from the inanity of lifes battle ... The practical intellects of the world did not much heed him, or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer: but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as a kind of Magus, girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove whispering strange things, uncertain whether oracles or jargon. Carlye, Thomas, Life of John Sterling, Book 1 Chapter 8       Coleridge is buried in the aisle of St. Michaels Parish Church in  |Highgate,_London|Highgate| . He was originally buried at Old Highgate Chapel but was re-interred in St. Michaels in 1961.  Coleridge could see the red door of the then new church from his last residence across the green, where he lived with a doctor he had hoped might cure him . When it was discovered Coleridge’s vault had become derelict, the coffins – Coleridges and those of his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and grandson – were moved to St. Michael’s after an international fundraising appeal.      Drew Clode, a member of St. Michael’s stewardship committee states, “they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them”. A recent excavation revealed the coffins were not in the location most believed, the far corner of the crypt, but actually below a memorial slab in the nave inscribed with: “Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge”.     St. Michaels plans to restore the crypt and allow public access. Says vicar Kunle Ayodeji of the plans: “. . we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses, which would also allow access to Coleridge’s cellar.”       Coleridge is one of the most important figures in English poetry. His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet, and Southey and Wordsworth were dependent on his professional advice. His influence on Wordsworth is particularly important because many critics have credited Coleridge with the very idea of Conversational Poetry . The idea of utilising common, everyday language to express profound poetic images and ideas for which Wordsworth became so famous may have originated almost entirely in Coleridge’s mind. It is difficult to imagine Wordsworth’s great poems, The Excursion or The Prelude, ever having been written without the direct influence of Coleridge’s originality.     As important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet, he was equally important to poetry as a critic. His philosophy of poetry, which he developed over many years, has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism. This influence can be seen in such critics as  |A._O._Lovejoy|A._O._Lovejoy|  and  |I._A._Richards|I._A._Richards| .      The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and Kubla Khan   Coleridge is probably best known for his long poems  The Rime of the Ancient Mariner  and  Christabel . Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence: its words have given the English language the  |metaphor|Albatross|  of an  |albatross|Albatross|  around ones neck, the quotation of water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink , and the phrase a sadder and a wiser man . The phrase All creatures great and small may have been inspired by The Rime Christabel  is known for its musical rhythm, language, and its  |Gothic|Gothic_Fiction|  tale.      Kubla Khan , or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment, although shorter, is also widely known. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have an additional  |Romantic|Romanticism|  aura because they were never finished.  |Stopford_Brooke|Stopford_Brooke|  characterised both poems as having no rival due to their exquisite metrical movement and imaginative phrasing.             The eight of Coleridges poems listed above are now often discussed as a group entitled Conversation poems . The term itself was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper, who borrowed the subtitle of The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem to describe the seven other poems as well. Harper , pp. 3–27. Magnuson , p. 45. The poems are considered by many critics to be among Coleridges finest verses; thus  |Harold_Bloom|Harold_Bloom|  has written, With Dejection, The Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, Frost at Midnight shows Coleridge at his most impressive. Bloom , p. 202. They are also among his most influential poems, as discussed further below.     Harper himself considered that the eight poems represented a form of  |blank_verse|Blank_Verse|  that is ...more fluent and easy than Miltons, or any that had been written since Milton . Harper , p. 11. In 2006 Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent easiness , noting that Conversation poems such as ... Coleridges The Eolian Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech, employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un-symbolic and un-musical: language that lets itself be taken as merely talk rather than rapturous song. Koelzer , p. 68.          The last ten lines of Frost at Midnight were chosen by Harper as the best example of the peculiar kind of blank verse Coleridge had evolved, as natural-seeming as prose, but as exquisitely artistic as the most complicated sonnet. Harper , p. 15. The speaker of the poem is addressing his infant son, asleep by his side:     Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,   Whether the summer clothe the general earth   With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing   Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch   Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch   Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall   Heard only in the trances of the blast,   Or if the secret ministry of frost   Shall hang them up in silent icicles,   Quietly shining to the quiet Moon.       In 1965,  |M._H._Abrams|M._H._Abrams|  wrote a broad description that applies to the Conversation poems: The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation. Abrams , p. In fact, Abrams was describing both the Conversation poems and later poems influenced by them. Abrams essay has been called a touchstone of literary criticism . Koelzer . p. 67. As Paul Magnuson described it in 2002, Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the greater Romantic lyric, a genre that began with Coleridges Conversation poems, and included Wordsworths Tintern Abbey, Shelleys Stanzas Written in Dejection and Keatss Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W. H. Auden.         Biographia Literaria Biographia Literaria , a collection of his thoughts and opinions on literature which he published in 1817. The work delivered both biographical explanations of the authors life as well as his impressions on literature. The collection also contained an analysis of a broad range of philosophical principles of literature ranging from Aristotle to  |Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel_Kant|  and  |Schelling|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling|  and applied them to the poetry of peers such as  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth| . Beckson , pp. 265–266. See article on  |Mimesis|Mimesis|  Coleridges explanation of  |metaphysical|Metaphysics|  principles were popular topics of discourse in academic communities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and  |T.S._Eliot|T.S._Eliot|  stated that he believed that Coleridge was perhaps the greatest of English critics, and in a sense the last. Eliot suggests that Coleridge displayed natural abilities far greater than his contemporaries, dissecting literature and applying philosophical principles of metaphysics in a way that brought the subject of his criticisms away from the text and into a world of logical analysis that mixed logical analysis and emotion. However, Eliot also criticises Coleridge for allowing his emotion to play a role in the metaphysical process, believing that critics should not have emotions that are not provoked by the work being studied. Eliot , pp. 50–56.  |Hugh_Kenner|Hugh_Kenner|  in Historical Fictions, discusses Norman Frumans Coleridge, the Damaged Archangel and suggests that the term criticism is too often applied to Biographia Literaria, which both he and Fruman describe as having failed to explain or help the reader understand works of art. To Kenner, Coleridges attempt to discuss complex philosophical concepts without describing the rational process behind them displays a lack of critical thinking that makes the volume more of a biography than a work of criticism. Kenner , pp. 40–45.     In Biographia Literaria and his poetry, symbols are not merely objective correlatives to Coleridge, but instruments for making the universe and personal experience intelligible and spiritually covalent. To Coleridge, the cinque spotted spider, making its way upstream by fits and starts, is not merely a comment on the intermittent nature of creativity, imagination, or spiritual progress, but the journey and destination of his life. The spiders five legs represent the central problem that Coleridge lived to resolve, the conflict between Aristotelian logic and Christian philosophy. Two legs of the spider represent the me-not me of thesis and antithesis, the idea that a thing cannot be itself and its opposite simultaneously, the basis of the clockwork Newtonian world view that Coleridge rejected. The remaining three legs—exothesis, mesothesis and synthesis or the Holy trinity—represent the idea that things can diverge without being contradictory. Taken together, the five legs—with synthesis in the center, form the Holy Cross of Ramist logic. The cinque-spotted spider is Coleridges emblem of holism, the quest and substance of Coleridges thought and spiritual life.          Coleridge wrote reviews of  |Ann_Radcliffes|Ann_Radcliffe|  books and The Mad Monk, among others. He comments in his reviews: Situations of torment, and images of naked horror, are easily conceived; and a writer in whose works they abound, deserves our gratitude almost equally with him who should drag us by way of sport through a military hospital, or force us to sit at the dissecting-table of a natural philosopher. To trace the nice boundaries, beyond which terror and sympathy are deserted by the pleasurable emotions, – to reach those limits, yet never to pass them, hic labor, hic opus est. and The horrible and the preternatural have usually seized on the popular taste, at the rise and decline of literature. Most powerful stimulants, they can never be required except by the torpor of an unawakened, or the languor of an exhausted, appetite... We trust, however, that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that, wearied with fiends, incomprehensible characters, with shrieks, murders, and subterraneous dungeons, the public will learn, by the multitude of the manufacturers, with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured.     However, Coleridge used these elements in poems such as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , Christabel and Kubla Khan and certainly influenced other poets and writers of the time. Poems like these both drew inspiration from and helped to inflame the craze for  |Gothic|Gothic_Fiction|  romance. Coleridge also made considerable use of Gothic elements in his commercially successful play  |Remorse|Remorse| . Parker, p. 111      |Mary_Shelley|Mary_Shelley| , who knew Coleridge well, mentions The Rime of the Ancient Mariner twice directly in  Frankenstein , and some of the descriptions in the novel echo it indirectly. Although  |William_Godwin|William_Godwin| , her father, disagreed with Coleridge on some important issues, he respected his opinions and Coleridge often visited the Godwins. Mary Shelley later recalled hiding behind the sofa and hearing his voice chanting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.      |C._S._Lewis|C._S._Lewis|  also makes mention of his name in  The Screwtape Letters  .              Although his father was an  |Anglican|Anglicanism|  vicar, Coleridge worked as a  |Unitarian|Unitarianism|  preacher between 1796 and 1797. He eventually returned to the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England|  in 1814. His most noteworthy writings on religion are Lay Sermons , Aids to Reflection and The Constitution of Church and State .        Despite being mostly remembered today for his poetry and literary criticism, Coleridge was also a  |theologian|Theology| . His writings include discussions of the status of scripture, the doctrines of the  |Fall|Fall_Of_Man| , justification and sanctification, and the personality and infinity of God. A key figure in the Anglican theology of his day, his writings are still regularly referred to by contemporary Anglican theologians.  |F._D._Maurice|Frederick_Denison_Maurice| ,  |F._J._A._Hort|Fenton_Hort| ,  |F._W._Robertson|Frederick_William_Robertson| ,  |B._F._Westcott|Brooke_Foss_Westcott| , John Oman and  |Thomas_Erskine|Thomas_Erskine|  were all influenced by him.       Coleridge was also a profound political thinker. While he began his life as a political radical, and an enthusiast for the French Revolution; over the years Coleridge developed a more conservative view of society, somewhat in the manner of  |Burke|Edmund_Burke| . D Daiches ed., Companion to Literature 1 p. 110 Although seen as cowardly treachery by the next generation of Romantic poets, D Hay, Young Romantics p. 38 and p. 67 Coleridges later thought became a fruitful source for the evolving  |radicalism|Philosophical_Radical|  of  |J._S._Mill|J._S._Mill| . E Halevy, The Triumph of Reform p. 158 Mill found three aspects of Coleridges thought especially illuminating:     First, there was Coleridges insistence on what he called the Idea behind an institution – its social function, in later terminology – as opposed to the possible flaws in its actual implementation. A Ryan, J S Mill p. 70 Coleridge sought to understand meaning from within a social matrix, not outside it, using an imaginative reconstruction of the past  or of unfamiliar systems. J Skorupski, Why Read Mill Today? p. 7-8   Secondly, Coleridge explored the necessary conditions for social stability – what he termed Permanence, as distinct from Progress, in a polity J S Mill, On Liberty Etc p. 192 – stressing the importance of a shared public sense of community, and national education. A Ryan, J S Mill p. 57-8   Coleridge also usefully employed the organic metaphor of natural growth to shed light on the historical development of British history, as exemplified in the common law tradition – working his way thereby towards a sociology of jurisprudence. P Edwards, The Statesman’s Science p. 2-3       A current standard edition is The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, edited by  |Kathleen_Coburn|Kathleen_Coburn|  and many others from 1969 to 2002.
