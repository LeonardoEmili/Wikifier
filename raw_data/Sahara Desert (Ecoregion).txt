The Sahara Desert ecoregion , as defined by the  |World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature|World_Wide_Fund_For_Nature|  , includes the hyper-arid center of the  |Sahara|Sahara| , between 18° and 30° N. It is one of several  |desert_and_xeric_shrubland|Deserts_And_Xeric_Shrublands|  ecoregions that cover the northern portion of the  |Africa|Africa| n continent.       The  |Sahara_Desert|Sahara_Desert|  is the worlds largest hot, non-polar desert and is located in  |North_Africa|North_Africa| . It stretches from the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  to the  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| . The vast desert encompasses several ecologically distinct regions. The Sahara Desert ecoregion covers an area of  in the hot, hyper-arid center of the Sahara, surrounded on the north, south, east, and west by desert ecoregions with higher rainfall and more vegetation.     The  |North_Saharan_steppe_and_woodlands|North_Saharan_Steppe_And_Woodlands|  ecoregion lies to the north and west, bordering the  |Mediterranean_climate|Mediterranean_Climate|  regions of Africas  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean_Sea|  and  |North_Atlantic|North_Atlantic|  coasts. The North Saharan steppe and woodlands receives more regular winter rainfall than the Sahara Desert ecoregion. The  |South_Saharan_steppe_and_woodlands|South_Saharan_Steppe_And_Woodlands|  ecoregion lies to the south, between the Sahara Desert ecoregion and the  |Sahel|Sahel|  grasslands. The South Saharan steppe and woodlands receive most of its annual rainfall during the summer. The Red Sea coastal desert lies in the coastal strip between the Sahara Desert ecoregion and the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea| .     Some mountain ranges rise up from the desert and receive more rainfall and cooler temperatures. These Saharan mountains are home to two distinct ecoregions; the  |West_Saharan_montane_xeric_woodlands|West_Saharan_Montane_Xeric_Woodlands|  in the  |Ahaggar|Ahaggar| ,  |Tassili_nAjjer|Tassili_Najjer| ,  |Aïr|Aïr| , and other ranges in the western and central Sahara Desert and the  |Tibesti-Jebel_Uweinat_montane_xeric_woodlands|Tibesti-Jebel_Uweinat_Montane_Xeric_Woodlands|  in the  |Tibesti|Tibesti|  and  |Jebel_Uweinat|Jebel_Uweinat|  of the eastern Sahara.      The surface of the desert ranges from large areas of sand dunes , to stone plateaus , gravel plains , dry valleys , and salt flats. The only permanent river that crosses the ecoregion is the  |Nile_River|Nile_River| , which originates in central Africa and empties northwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Some areas encompass vast underground aquifers resulting in  |oases|Oasis| , while other regions severely lack water reserves.          The Sahara Desert features a  |hot_desert_climate|Hot_Desert_Climate|  . The Sahara Desert is one of the driest and hottest regions of the world, with a mean temperature sometimes over  and the average high temperatures in summer are over  for months at a time, and can even soar to . In desert rocky mountains such as the  |Tibesti|Tibesti|  in Libya or the  |Hoggar|Hoggar|  in Algeria, average highs in summer are slightly moderated by the high elevation and are between  at  elevation. Daily variations may also be extreme: a swing from  has been observed.  Typical temperature swings are between .     Precipitation in the Sahara Desert is scarce, as the whole desert generally receives less than  of rain per year except on the northernmost and southernmost edge as well as in the highest desert mountains. More than half of the desert area is hyper-arid and virtually rainless, with an average annual precipitation below  and many consecutive years may pass without any rainfall. The south of the Sahara Desert, along the boundary with the  |hot_semi-arid_climate|Hot_Semi-Arid_Climate|   of the  |Sahel|Sahel| , receives most of its annual rainfall during the highest-sun months when the  |Inter-Tropical_Convergence_Zone|Inter-Tropical_Convergence_Zone|  moves up from the south.  |Wind-|Windstorm|  and  |sandstorms|Sandstorm|  occur in early spring. Local inhabitants protect themselves from the heat, the sunshine, the dry air, the high diurnal temperature ranges and the sometimes dusty or sandy winds by covering their heads, such as the  |cheche|Tagelmust|  garment worn by  |Tuareg|Tuareg_People| .          The Sahara was one of the first regions of Africa to be farmed. Some 5,000 years ago, the area was not so arid and the vegetation might have been closer to a  |savanna|Savanna| . Previous fauna may be recognised in stone carvings. However,  |desertification|Desertification|  set in around 3000 BCE, and the area became much like it is today.     The Sahara is largely undisturbed. The most degradation is found in areas where there is water, such as  |aquifer_oases|Oasis|  or along the desert margins where some rain usually falls most years. In these areas, animals such as  |addax|Addax| es,  |scimitar-horned_oryx|Scimitar-Horned_Oryx| es, and  |bustards|Bustard|  are  |over-hunted|Over-Hunting|  for their meat.
