   Fra Bartolomeo or Bartolommeo  , also known as Bartolommeo di Pagholo, Bartolommeo di S. Marco, and his original name Baccio della Porta, was an  |Italian|Italian_People| |Renaissance|Renaissance|  painter of religious subjects. He spent all his career in  |Florence|Florence|  until his mid-forties, when he travelled to work in various cities, as far south as Rome. He trained with  |Cosimo_Roselli|Cosimo_Roselli|  and in the 1490s fell under the influence of  |Savonarola|Girolamo_Savonarola| , which led him to become a  |Dominican|Dominican_Order| |friar|Friar|  in 1500, renouncing painting for several years.     He was instructed to resume painting for the benefit of his order in 1504, and then developed an idealized  |High_Renaissance|High_Renaissance|  style, seen in his Vision of St Bernard of that year, now in poor condition but whose figures and drapery move with a seraphic grace that must have struck the young  |Raphael|Raphael|  with the force of revelation .    He remained friends with Raphael, and each influenced the other.     His portrait of Savonarola remains the best known image of the reformer. Fra Bartolomeo painted both in oils and fresco, and some of his drawings are pure landscape sketches that are the earliest of this type from any Italian artist.               He was born in  |Savignano_di_Prato|Savignano_Di_Prato| ,  |Tuscany|Tuscany| . He received the nickname of Baccio della Porta for his house was near the Gate of San Pier Gattolini.     Starting from 1483 or 1484, by recommendation of  |Benedetto_da_Maiano|Benedetto_Da_Maiano| , he apprenticed in the workshop of  |Cosimo_Rosselli|Cosimo_Rosselli| . In 1490 or 1491 he began a collaboration with  |Mariotto_Albertinelli|Mariotto_Albertinelli| . In the late 1490s, Baccio was drawn to the teachings of  |Fra_Girolamo_Savonarola|Girolamo_Savonarola| , who denounced what he viewed as vain and corrupt contemporary art. Savonarola argued for art serving as a direct visual illustration of the  |Bible|Bible|  to educate those unable to read the book. From 1498 is his famous portrait of Savonarola, now in the  |Museo_Nazionale_di_San_Marco|Museo_Nazionale_Di_San_Marco|  in Florence. The following year he was commissioned a fresco of the Universal Judgement for the  |Ospedale_di_Santa_Maria_Nuova|Ospedale_Di_Santa_Maria_Nuova| , completed by Albertinelli and  |Giuliano_Bugiardini|Giuliano_Bugiardini|  when Baccio became a  |Dominican|Dominican_Order| |friar|Friar|  on July 26, 1500. The following year he entered the convent of San Marco.     He renounced painting for several years, not resuming until 1504 when he became the head of the monastery workshop in obedience to his superior. In that year he began a Vision of St. Bernard for Bernardo Biancos family chapel in the  |Badia_Fiorentina|Badia_Fiorentina| , finished in 1507. Soon thereafter,  |Raphael|Raphael|  visited Florence and befriended the friar. Bartolomeo learned perspective from the younger artist, while Raphael added skills in coloring and handling of drapery, which was noticeable in the works he produced after their meeting. With Raphael, he remained on the friendliest terms, and when he departed from Rome, left in his hands two unfinished pictures which Raphael completed.     At the beginning of 1508, Bartolomeo moved to  |Venice|Venice|  to paint a Holy Father, St. Mary Magdalene and St. Catherine of Siena for the Dominicans of  |San_Pietro_Martire|San_Pietro_Martire,_Murano|  in  |Murano|Murano| , influenced somewhat by Venetian colorism. As the Dominicans did not pay for the work, he took it back to  |Lucca|Lucca| , where it can be seen now. Also in Lucca, in October 1509, he painted with Albertinelli an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints for the  |local_cathedral|Cathedral_Of_Lucca| . On November 26, 1510  |Pier_Soderini|Pier_Soderini|  commissioned him an altarpiece for the Sala del Consiglio of Florence, now in the Museum of San Marco. Two years later he finished another altarpiece for the  |cathedral|Besançon_Cathedral|  of  |Besançon|Besançon| .     In 1513, he went to Rome, where he painted a Peter and Paul, now in the  |Pinacoteca_Vaticana|Pinacoteca_Vaticana| , while from the following years are the  St. Mark Evangelist  of  |Palazzo_Pitti|Palazzo_Pitti|  in Florence and the frescoes in the Dominican convent of Pian di Mugnone, a  |frazione|Frazione|  of  |Fiesole|Fiesole| , just outside Florence. After a promised Feast of Venus for Duke  |Alfonso_I_dEste|Alfonso_I_Deste|  of  |Ferrara|Ferrara| , of which only drawings remain, his last work is a fresco of  Noli me tangere  also in Pian di Mugnone.        He died in Florence in 1517.                 Initially, his works showed the influence of Rossellis assistant,  |Piero_di_Cosimo|Piero_Di_Cosimo| , and those of  |Domenico_Ghirlandaio|Domenico_Ghirlandaio|  and  |Filippino_Lippi|Filippino_Lippi| . After his hiatus from 1500 to 1503, he seemed to change vision, taking from Raphael the representation of light and its effects over moving shapes.     Fra Bartolomeos figures are generally small and draped. These qualities were alleged against him as defects, and to prove that his style was not the result of want of power, he painted the magnificent figure of the St Mark Evangelist , and the undraped figure of  |Saint_Sebastian|Saint_Sebastian| . It is alleged that the latter was felt to be so strongly expressive of suffering and agony, that it was found necessary to remove it from the place where it had been exhibited in the chapel of a convent.     Fra Bartolomeos compositions are remarkable for skill in the massing of light and shade, richness and delicacy of colouring, and for the admirable drapery of the figures, Bartolomeo having been the first to introduce and use the lay-figure with joints.     Among his pupils were Cecchino del Frate, Benedetto Ciamfanini, Gabriel Rustici,  |Ridolfo_Ghirlandaio|Ridolfo_Ghirlandaio|  , and  |Fra_Paolo_Pistolese|Fra_Paolo_Pistolese| .
