Aristophanes is also notable for the persecution he underwent.    Aristophanes plays turned upon images of filth and disease.

The political  |comedy|Comedy| , The Return of the Deputy , by  |Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz|Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz| —Polish poet, playwright, statesman, and comrade-in-arms of  |Tadeusz_Kościuszko|Tadeusz_Kościuszko| —was written in about two weeks time while Niemcewicz was serving as a deputy to the historic  |Four_Year_Sejm|Four_Year_Sejm|  of 1788–92. The comedys premiere in January 1791 was an enormous success, sparking widespread debate, royal communiques, and diplomatic correspondence. As Niemcewicz had hoped, it set the stage for passage of Polands epochal  |Constitution_of_3_May_1791|Constitution_Of_May_3_1791| , which is regarded as Europes first, and the worlds second, modern written national constitution, after the  |United_States_Constitution|United_States_Constitution|  implemented in 1789. The comedy pits proponents against opponents of political reforms: of abolishing the destabilizing  |free_election|Royal_Elections_In_Poland|  of Polands kings; of abolishing the legislatively destructive  liberum veto ; of granting greater rights to  |peasants|Peasant|  and townspeople; of curbing the privileges of the mostly self-interested  |noble_class|Szlachta| ; and of promoting a more active Polish role in international affairs, in the interest of stopping the depredations of Polands neighbors, Russia, Prussia, and Austria . Romantic interest is provided by a rivalry between a reformer and a conservative for a young ladys hand—which is won by the proponent of reforms.  |Zdzisław_Skwarczyński|_Pl_Zdzisław_Skwarczyński| , wstęp to  |Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz|Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz| ,  Powrót posła  , Wrocław,  |Ossolineum|Ossolineum| , 1983.       An early example of the political novel is  The Betrothed  by  |Alessandro_Manzoni|Alessandro_Manzoni| , an Italian  |historical_novel|Historical_Novel| . Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years of direct Spanish rule, it has been seen sometimes as a veiled attack on the  |Austrian_Empire|Austrian_Empire| , which controlled  |Italy|Italy|  at the time the novel was written. It has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language. Archibald Colquhoun. Manzoni and his Times. J. M. Dent & Sons, London, 1954.     In the 1840s British politician  |Benjamin_Disraeli|Benjamin_Disraeli|  wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With  Coningsby; or, The New Generation  , Disraeli, in historian  |Robert_Blakes|Robert_Blake_Baron_Blake|  view, infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that Englands future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians. ,  Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism, eNotes, accessed 25 August 2013 Coningsby was followed by  Sybil; or, The Two Nations  , another political novel, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than Coningsby; the two nations of its subtitle referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last of Disraelis political-novel trilogy,  Tancred; or, The New Crusade  , promoted the Church of Englands role in reviving Britains flagging spirituality.      |Ivan_Turgenev|Ivan_Turgenev|  wrote  Fathers and Sons  as a response to the growing cultural schism that he saw between  |Russias|Russia|  liberals of the 1830s and 1840s, and the growing Russian  |nihilist_movement|Nihilist_Movement|  among their sons. Both the nihilists and the 1830s liberals sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the  |Slavophiles|Slavophile| , who believed that Russias path lay in its  |traditional_spirituality|Russian_Orthodox_Church| . Turgenevs novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term  |nihilism|Nihilist_Movement|  , which became widely used after the novel was published.      The Polish writer  |Bolesław_Prus|Bolesław_Prus|  novel,  Pharaoh  , is set in the Egypt of 1087  85 BCE as that country experiences internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its  |Twentieth_Dynasty|Twentieth_Dynasty|  and  |New_Kingdom|New_Kingdom| . The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge  |the_powers_that_be|The_Powers_That_Be|  are vulnerable to co-option,  |seduction|Seduction| , subornation,  |defamation|Defamation| , intimidation, and  |assassination|Assassination| . Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of  |knowledge|Knowledge| . Prus vision of the fall of an ancient civilization derives some of its power from the authors intimate awareness of the final demise of the  |Polish_Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish_Lithuanian_Commonwealth|  in 1795, a century before he completed Pharaoh. This is a political awareness that Prus shared with his 10-years-junior novelist compatriot,  |Joseph_Conrad|Joseph_Conrad| , who was an admirer of Prus writings. Pharaoh has been translated into 20 languages and adapted as a 1966 Polish  |feature_film|Pharaoh| .  |Christopher_Kasparek|Christopher_Kasparek| , Prus Pharaoh and Curtins Translation ,  The Polish Review , vol.

Nostromo is set amid political upheaval in the fictitious  |South_America|South_America| n country of Costaguana, where a trusted Italian-descended longshoreman, Giovanni Battista Fidanza—the novels  |eponym|Eponym| ous Nostromo —is instructed by English-descended silver-mine owner Charles Gould to take Goulds silver abroad so that it will not fall into the hands of revolutionaries.  |Joseph_Conrad|Joseph_Conrad| ,  Nostromo , 1904. The role of politics is paramount in The Secret Agent, as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The plot to destroy  |Greenwich_Observatory|Greenwich_Observatory|  is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing must be purely destructive and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion should make it clear that are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation. . However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency. Conrads third political novel, Under Western Eyes, is connected to Russian history. Its first audience read it against the backdrop of the failed  |Revolution_of_1905|Revolution_Of_1905|  and in the shadow of the movements and impulses that would take shape as the  |revolutions_of_1917|Russian_Revolution| .  Conrads earlier novella,  Heart of Darkness  , also had political implications, in its depiction of European  |colonial|Colonialism|  depredations in  |Africa|Africa| , which Conrad witnessed during his employ in the  |Belgian_Congo|Congo_Free_State| . The Norton Anthology, 7th edition, 2000, p. 1957.      |John_Steinbecks|John_Steinbeck|  novel  The Grapes of Wrath  is a passionate depiction of the plight of the poor. However, many of Steinbecks contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack writes: Steinbeck was attacked as a  |propagandist|Propaganda|  and a  |socialist|Socialism|  from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the books depiction of California farmers attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a pack of lies and labeled it communist propaganda .  Some accused Steinbeck of exaggerating camp conditions to make a political point. Steinbeck had visited the camps well before publication of the novel  and argued that their inhumane nature destroyed the settlers spirit.      The Quiet American  by English novelist  |Graham_Greene|Graham_Greene|  questions the foundations of growing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s. The novel has received much attention due to its prediction of the outcome of the Vietnam War and subsequent American foreign policy since the 1950s. Graham Greene portrays a U.S. official named Pyle as so blinded by  |American_exceptionalism|American_Exceptionalism|  that he cannot see the calamities he brings upon the Vietnamese. The book uses Greenes experiences as a war correspondent for  The Times  and  Le Figaro  in  |French_Indochina|French_Indochina|  in 1951–54. Andrew J. Bacevich, Best Intentions: An Appreciation of Graham Greene . World Affairs       The Gay Place  is a set of politically-themed novellas with interlocking plots and characters by American author  |Billy_Lee_Brammer|Billy_Lee_Brammer| . Set in an unnamed state identical to Texas, each novella has a different protagonist: Roy Sherwood, a member of the state legislature; Neil Christiansen, the states junior senator; and Jay McGown, the governors speech-writer. The governor himself, Arthur Fenstemaker, a master politician  serves as the dominant figure throughout. The book also includes characters based on Brammer, his wife Nadine,        Johnsons wife  |Ladybird|Lady_Bird_Johnson| , and his brother  |Sam_Houston_Johnson|Sam_Houston_Johnson| .
