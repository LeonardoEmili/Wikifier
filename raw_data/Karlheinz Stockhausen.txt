               Karlheinz Stockhausen  was a German composer, widely acknowledged by critics as one of the most important  but also controversial  composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. A critic calls him one of the great visionaries of 20th-century music . He is known for his groundbreaking work in  |electronic_music|Electronic_Music| , for introducing controlled chance  into  |serial_composition|Serialism| , and for musical  |spatialization|Spatial_Music| .     He was educated at the  |Hochschule_für_Musik_Köln|Hochschule_Für_Musik_Köln|  and the  |University_of_Cologne|University_Of_Cologne| , later studying with  |Olivier_Messiaen|Olivier_Messiaen|  in Paris and with  |Werner_Meyer-Eppler|Werner_Meyer-Eppler|  at the  |University_of_Bonn|University_Of_Bonn| . One of the leading figures of the  |Darmstadt_School|Darmstadt_School| , his compositions and theories were and remain widely influential, not only on composers of  |art_music|Art_Music| , but also on  |jazz|Jazz|  and  |popular_music|Popular_Music| . His works, composed over a period of nearly sixty years, eschew traditional forms. In addition to electronic music—both with and without live performers—they range from miniatures for  |musical_box|Musical_Box| es through works for solo instruments, songs,  |chamber_music|Chamber_Music| ,  |choral|Choir|  and orchestral music, to a cycle of seven full-length operas. His  |theoretical|Music_Theory|  and other writings comprise ten large volumes. He received numerous prizes and distinctions for his compositions, recordings, and for the scores produced by his publishing company.     His notable compositions include the series of nineteen  Klavierstücke  ,  Kontra-Punkte  for ten instruments, the electronic/ |musique-concrète|Musique_Concrète|   Gesang der Jünglinge ,  Gruppen  for three orchestras, the percussion solo  Zyklus ,  Kontakte , the cantata  Momente , the live-electronic  Mikrophonie I ,  Hymnen ,  Stimmung  for six vocalists,  Aus den sieben Tagen ,  Mantra  for two pianos and electronics,  Tierkreis ,  Inori  for soloists and orchestra, and the gigantic opera cycle  Licht .     He died of sudden heart failure at the age of 79, on 5 December 2007 at his home in  |Kürten|Kürten| , Germany.              Stockhausen was born in  |Burg_Mödrath|Mödrathalt-Mödrath| , the castle of the village of Mödrath. The village, located near  |Kerpen|Kerpen|  in the  |Cologne|Cologne|  region, was displaced in 1956 to make way for  |lignite|Lignite|  strip mining, but the castle itself still stands. Despite its name, the building is not actually a castle at all, but rather was a manor house built in 1830 by a local businessman named Arend. Because of its imposing size, locals began calling it Burg Mödrath . From 1925 to 1932 it was the maternity home of the  |Bergheim_district|Rhein-Erft-Kreis| , and after the war it served for a time as a shelter for war refugees. In 1950, the owners, the Düsseldorf chapter of the  |Knights_of_Malta|Sovereign_Military_Order_Of_Malta| , turned it into an orphanage, but it was subsequently returned to private ownership and became a private residence again . In 2017, an anonymous patron purchased the house and opened it in April 2017 as an exhibition space for modern art, with the first floor to be used as the permanent home of the museum of the  |WDR_Electronic_Music_Studio|Studio_For_Electronic_Music| , where Stockhausen had worked from 1953 until shortly before WDR closed the studio in 2000 .     His father, Simon Stockhausen, was a  |schoolteacher|Schoolteacher| , and his mother Gertrud was the daughter of a prosperous family of farmers in Neurath in the  |Cologne_Bight|Cologne_Bight| . A daughter, Katherina, was born the year after Karlheinz, and a second son, Hermann-Josef followed in 1932. Gertrud played the piano and accompanied her own singing but, after three pregnancies in as many years, experienced a mental breakdown and was  |institutionalized|Psychiatric_Hospital|  in December 1932, followed a few months later by the death of her younger son, Hermann .     From the age of seven, Stockhausen lived in  |Altenberg|Altenberg| , where he received his first piano lessons from the Protestant  |organist|Organist|  of the  |Altenberger_Dom|Altenberger_Dom| , Franz-Josef Kloth . In 1938 his father remarried. His new wife, Luzia, had been the familys housekeeper. The couple had two daughters . Because his relationship with his new stepmother was less than happy, in January 1942 Karlheinz became a boarder at the teachers training college in  |Xanten|Xanten| , where he continued his piano training and also studied oboe and violin . In 1941 he learned that his mother had died, ostensibly from leukemia, although everyone at the same hospital had supposedly died of the same disease. It was generally understood that she had been a victim of the Nazi policy of killing  |useless_eaters|Action_T4Killing_Of_Adults|  . The official letter to the family falsely claimed she had died 16 June 1941, but recent research by Lisa Quernes, a student at the Landesmusikgymnasium in  |Montabaur|Montabaur| , has determined that she was gassed along with 89 other people at the  |Hadamar_Euthanasia_Centre|Hadamar_Euthanasia_Centre|  in Hesse-Nassau on 27 May 1941 . Stockhausen dramatized his mothers death in hospital by lethal injection, in Act 1 scene 2  of the opera  |Donnerstag_aus_Licht|Donnerstag_Aus_Licht|  . In the autumn of 1944, he was conscripted to serve as a stretcher bearer in  |Bedburg|Bedburg|  . In February 1945, he met his father for the last time in Altenberg. Simon, who was on leave from the front, told his son, Im not coming back. Look after things . By the end of the war, his father was regarded as missing in action, and may have been killed in Hungary . A comrade later reported to Karlheinz that he saw his father wounded in action . Fifty-five years after the fact, a journalist writing for the Guardian newspaper stated unequivocally, though without offering any fresh evidence, that Simon Stockhausen was killed in Hungary in 1945  .       From 1947 to 1951, Stockhausen studied music  |pedagogy|Pedagogy|  and piano at the  |Hochschule_für_Musik_Köln|Hochschule_Für_Musik_Köln|  and  |musicology|Musicology| , philosophy, and  |Germanics|German_Studies|  at the  |University_of_Cologne|University_Of_Cologne| . He had training in  |harmony|Harmony|  and  |counterpoint|Counterpoint| , the latter with  |Hermann_Schroeder|Hermann_Schroeder| , but he did not develop a real interest in  |composition|Musical_Composition|  until 1950. He was admitted at the end of that year to the class of Swiss composer  |Frank_Martin|Frank_Martin| , who had just begun a seven-year tenure in Cologne . At the  |Darmstädter_Ferienkurse|Darmstädter_Ferienkurse|  in 1951, Stockhausen met Belgian composer  |Karel_Goeyvaerts|Karel_Goeyvaerts| , who had just completed studies with  |Olivier_Messiaen|Olivier_Messiaen|  and  |Darius_Milhaud|Darius_Milhaud|  in Paris, and Stockhausen resolved to do likewise . He arrived in Paris on 8 January 1952 and began attending Messiaens courses in aesthetics and analysis, as well as Milhauds composition classes. He continued with Messiaen for a year, but he was disappointed with Milhaud and abandoned his lessons after a few weeks . In March 1953, he left Paris to take up a position as assistant to  |Herbert_Eimert|Herbert_Eimert|  at the newly established  |Electronic_Music_Studio|Studio_For_Electronic_Music|  of  |Nordwestdeutscher_Rundfunk|Nordwestdeutscher_Rundfunk|   in Cologne . In 1963, he succeeded Eimert as director of the studio . From 1954 to 1956, he studied phonetics, acoustics, and information theory with  |Werner_Meyer-Eppler|Werner_Meyer-Eppler|  at the  |University_of_Bonn|University_Of_Bonn|  . Together with Eimert, Stockhausen edited the journal  Die Reihe  from 1955 to 1962 .              On 29 December 1951, in Hamburg, Stockhausen married Doris Andreae . Together they had four children: Suja , Christel ,  |Markus|Markus_Stockhausen|  , and Majella . They were divorced in 1965 . On 3 April 1967, in San Francisco, he married  |Mary_Bauermeister|Mary_Bauermeister| , with whom he had two children: Julika and Simon . They were divorced in 1972 .     Four of Stockhausens children became professional musicians , and he composed some of his works specifically for them. A large number of pieces for the trumpet—from Sirius to the trumpet version of In Freundschaft —were composed for and premièred by his son Markus . Markus, at the age of 4 years, had performed the part of The Child in the Cologne première of Originale, alternating performances with his sister Christel . Klavierstück XII and Klavierstück XIII  were written for his daughter Majella, and were first performed by her at the ages of 16 and 20, respectively . The saxophone duet in the second act of Donnerstag aus Licht, and a number of synthesizer parts in the Licht operas, including Klavierstück XV from  Dienstag , were composed for his son Simon , who also assisted his father in the production of the electronic music from Freitag aus Licht. His daughter Christel is a flautist who performed and gave a course on interpretation of Tierkreis in 1977 , later published as an article .     In 1961, Stockhausen acquired a parcel of land in the vicinity of  |Kürten|Kürten| , a village east of Cologne, near  |Bergisch_Gladbach|Bergisch_Gladbach|  in the  |Bergisches_Land|Bergisches_Land| . He had a house built there, which was designed to his specifications by the architect Erich Schneider-Wessling, and he resided there from its completion in the autumn of 1965 .          After lecturing at the  |Internationale_Ferienkurse_für_Neue_Musik|Darmstädter_Ferienkurse|  at Darmstadt , Stockhausen gave lectures and concerts in Europe, North America, and Asia . He was guest professor of composition at the  |University_of_Pennsylvania|University_Of_Pennsylvania|  in 1965 and at the  |University_of_California,_Davis|University_Of_California,_Davis|  in 1966–67 . He founded and directed the Cologne Courses for New Music from 1963 to 1968, and was appointed Professor of Composition at the  |Hochschule_für_Musik_Köln|Hochschule_Für_Musik_Köln|  in 1971, where he taught until 1977 . In 1998, he founded the Stockhausen Courses, which are held annually in Kürten .       From the mid-1950s onward, Stockhausen designed his own musical scores for his publisher,  |Universal_Edition|Universal_Edition| , which often involved unconventional devices. The score for his piece Refrain, for instance, includes a rotatable  on a transparent plastic strip. Early in the 1970s, he ended his agreement with Universal Edition and began publishing his own scores under the Stockhausen-Verlag imprint . This arrangement allowed him to extend his notational innovations  and resulted in eight German Music Publishers Society Awards between 1992  and 2005  . The Momente score, published just before Stockhausens death in 2007, won this prize for the ninth time .     In the early 1990s, Stockhausen reacquired the licenses to most of the recordings of his music he had made to that point, and started his own record company to make this music permanently available on Compact Disc .               Stockhausen died of sudden heart failure on the morning of 5 December 2007 in  |Kürten|Kürten| , North Rhine-Westphalia. Just the night before, he had finished a work for performance by the Mozart Orchestra of  |Bologna|Bologna|  . He was 79 years old.          Stockhausen wrote 370 individual works. He often departs radically from musical tradition and his work is influenced by  |Olivier_Messiaen|Olivier_Messiaen| ,  |Edgard_Varèse|Edgard_Varèse| , and  |Anton_Webern|Anton_Webern| , as well as by film  and by painters such as  |Piet_Mondrian|Piet_Mondrian|   and  |Paul_Klee|Paul_Klee|  .       Stockhausen began to compose in earnest only during his third year at the conservatory . His early student compositions remained out of the public eye until, in 1971, he published  Chöre für Doris ,  Drei Lieder  for alto voice and chamber orchestra, Choral for a cappella choir , and a  |Sonatine|Sonatine|  for Violin and Piano .     In August 1951, just after his first Darmstadt visit, Stockhausen began working with a form of  |athematic|Theme| |serial|Serialism|  composition that rejected the  |twelve-tone_technique|Twelve-Tone_Technique|  of  |Schoenberg|Arnold_Schoenberg|  . He characterized many of these earliest compositions as  punktuelle  Musik, though one critic concluded after analysing several of these early works that Stockhausen never really composed punctually . Compositions from this phase include  Kreuzspiel  , the  Klavierstücke I–IV  , and the first versions of  Punkte  and Kontra-Punkte . However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition , that of group composition , found in Stockhausens works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career . This principle was first publicly described by Stockhausen in a radio talk from December 1955, titled Gruppenkomposition:  Klavierstück I  .     In December 1952, he composed a Konkrete Etüde, realized in  |Pierre_Schaeffers|Pierre_Schaeffer|  Paris  |musique_concrète|Musique_Concrète|  studio. In March 1953, he moved to the NWDR studio in Cologne and turned to  |electronic_music|Electronic_Music|  with two  Electronic Studies  , and then introducing spatial placements of sound sources with his mixed concrète and electronic work  Gesang der Jünglinge  . Experiences gained from the Studies made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities . Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new statistical criteria for composition, focussing attention on the  |aleatoric|Aleatoric_Music| , directional tendencies of sound movement, the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state . Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc; the integration of all concrete and abstract sound possibilities , and the controlled projection of sound in space . His position as the leading German composer of his generation  was established with Gesang der Jünglinge and three concurrently composed pieces in different media:  Zeitmaße  for five woodwinds, Gruppen for three orchestras, and  Klavierstück XI  . The principles underlying the latter three compositions are presented in Stockhausens best-known theoretical article, . . . wie die Zeit vergeht . . . , first published in 1957 in vol. 3 of  Die Reihe  .     His work with electronic music and its utter fixity led him to explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance may determine certain aspects of a composition. He called this variable form . In other cases, a work may be presented from a number of different perspectives. In  Zyklus  , for example, he began using  |graphic_notation|Graphic_Notation|  for instrumental music. The  |score|Sheet_Music|  is written so that the performance can start on any page, and it may be read upside down, or from right to left, as the performer chooses . Still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts. Stockhausen called both of these possibilities polyvalent form , which may be either  |open_form|Aleatoric_Music_Open_Form_Chance_Music|  , as with Klavierstück XI , or closed form as with Momente .     In many of his works, elements are played off against one another, simultaneously and successively: in Kontra-Punkte , which, in its revised form became his official opus 1 , a process leading from an initial point texture of isolated notes toward a florid, ornamental ending is opposed by a tendency from diversity toward uniformity . In Gruppen , fanfares and passages of varying speed  are occasionally flung between three full orchestras, giving the impression of movement in space .     In his  Kontakte  for electronic sounds , he achieved for the first time an  |isomorphism|Isomorphism|  of the four parameters of pitch, duration, dynamics, and timbre .       In 1960, Stockhausen returned to the composition of vocal music  with  Carré  for four orchestras and four choirs . Two years later, he began an expansive  |cantata|Cantata|  titled Momente , for solo soprano, four choir groups and thirteen instrumentalists . In 1963, Stockhausen created  Plus-Minus , 2 × 7 pages for realisation containing basic note materials and a complex system of transformations to which those materials are to be subjected in order to produce an unlimited number of different compositions . Through the rest of the 1960s, he continued to explore such possibilities of  |process_composition|Process_Music|  in works for live performance, such as Prozession ,  Kurzwellen , and  Spiral  , culminating in the verbally described intuitive music compositions of  Aus den sieben Tagen  and  Für kommende Zeiten  . Some of his later works, such as  Ylem  and the first three parts of  Herbstmusik  , also fall under this rubric . Several of these process compositions were featured in the all-day programmes presented at Expo 70, for which Stockhausen composed two more similar pieces, Pole for two players, and Expo for three . In other compositions, such as Stop for orchestra ,  Adieu  for wind quintet , and the Dr. K Sextett, which was written in 1968–69 in honour of Alfred Kalmus of Universal Edition, he presented his performers with more restricted improvisational possibilities .     He pioneered live electronics in  Mixtur  for orchestra and electronics ,  Mikrophonie I  for  |tam-tam|Tam-Tam| , two microphones, two filters with  |potentiometers|Potentiometer|  ,  Mikrophonie II  for choir,  |Hammond_organ|Hammond_Organ| , and four  |ring_modulators|Ring_Modulation|  , and Solo for a melody instrument with feedback . Improvisation also plays a part in all of these works, but especially in Solo . He also composed two electronic works for  |tape|Tape_Recorder| , Telemusik and  Hymnen  . The latter also exists in a version with partially improvising soloists, and the third of its four regions in a version with orchestra . At this time, Stockhausen also began to incorporate pre-existent music from world traditions into his compositions . Telemusik was the first overt example of this trend .     In 1968, Stockhausen composed the vocal sextet  Stimmung , for the  |Collegium_Vocale_Köln|Collegium_Vocale_Köln| , an hour-long work based entirely on the  |overtones|Overtone|  of a low  |B-flat|B♭|  . In the following year, he created  Fresco  for four orchestral groups, a Wandelmusik composition . This was intended to be played for about five hours in the foyers and grounds of the Beethovenhalle auditorium complex in  |Bonn|Bonn| , before, after, and during a group of concerts of his music in the auditoriums of the facility . The overall project was given the title Musik für die Beethovenhalle . This had precedents in two collective-composition seminar projects that Stockhausen gave at Darmstadt in 1967 and 1968: Ensemble and Musik für ein Haus , and would have successors in the park music composition for five spatially separated groups,  Sternklang  of 1971, the orchestral work Trans, composed in the same year and the thirteen simultaneous musical scenes for soloists and duets titled  Alphabet für Liège  .          Since the mid-1950s, Stockhausen had been developing concepts of  |spatialization|Spatial_Music|  in his works, not only in electronic music, such as the 5-channel  Gesang der Jünglinge  and  Telemusik  , and 4-channel  Kontakte  and  Hymnen  . Instrumental/vocal works like Gruppen for three orchestras and Carré for four orchestras and four choirs also exhibit this trait . In lectures such as Music in Space from 1958 , he called for new kinds of concert halls to be built, suited to the requirements of spatial music . His idea was  In 1968, the  |West_German|West_Germany|  government invited Stockhausen to collaborate on the German Pavilion at the  |1970_World_Fair|Expo_70|  in  |Osaka|Osaka|  and to create a joint multimedia project for it with artist  |Otto_Piene|Otto_Piene| . Other collaborators on the project included the pavilions architect,  |Fritz_Bornemann|Fritz_Bornemann| , Fritz Winckel, director of the Electronic Music Studio at the  |Technical_University_of_Berlin|Technical_University_Of_Berlin| , and engineer Max Mengeringhausen. The pavilion theme was gardens of music , in keeping with which Bornemann intended planting the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn, with a connected auditorium sprouting above ground. Initially, Bornemann conceived this auditorium in the form of an  |amphitheatre|Amphitheatre| , with a central orchestra podium and surrounding audience space. In the summer of 1968, Stockhausen met with Bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the centre, surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different latitudes around the interior walls of the sphere .     Although Stockhausen and Pienes planned multimedia project, titled Hinab-Hinauf, was developed in detail , the World Fair committee rejected their concept as too extravagant and instead asked Stockhausen to present daily five-hour programs of his music . Stockhausens works were performed for 5½ hours every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners . According to Stockhausens biographer, Michael Kurtz, Many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general hubbub, and after a while it became one of the main attractions of Expo 1970 .          Beginning with  Mantra  for two pianos and electronics , Stockhausen turned to  |formula_composition|Formula_Composition| , a technique which involves the projection and multiplication of a single, double, or triple  |melodic|Melody| -line formula . Sometimes, as in Mantra and the large orchestral composition with mime soloists, Inori, the simple formula is stated at the outset as an introduction. He continued to use this technique  through the completion of the opera-cycle Licht in 2003 . Some works from the 1970s did not employ formula technique—e.g., the vocal duet  |Am_Himmel_wandre_ich|Alphabet_Für_Liègeindianerlieder|  , Laub und Regen .
