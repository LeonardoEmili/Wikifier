              Eugene Wesley Roddenberry was an American television  |screenwriter|Screenwriter| ,  |producer|Tv_Producer|  and creator of the  |original_Star_Trek_television_series|Star_Trek_The_Original_Series| , and its first spin-off  The Next Generation . Born in  |El_Paso_Texas|El_Paso_Texas| , Roddenberry grew up in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , where his father was a police officer. Roddenberry flew 89 combat missions in the  |Army_Air_Forces|United_States_Army_Air_Forces|  during World War  II, and worked as a commercial pilot after the war. Later, he followed in his fathers footsteps and joined the  |Los_Angeles_Police_Department|Los_Angeles_Police_Department| , where he also began to write scripts for television.     As a  |freelance_writer|Freelance_Writer| , Roddenberry wrote scripts for  Highway Patrol ,  Have Gun–Will Travel , and other series, before creating and producing his own television series  The Lieutenant . In 1964, Roddenberry created  Star Trek , which premiered in 1966 and ran for three seasons before being canceled. He then worked on other projects, including a string of failed television pilots. The syndication of Star Trek led to its growing popularity; this, in turn, resulted in the  |Star_Trek_feature_films|Star_Trek| , on which Roddenberry continued to produce and consult. In 1987, the sequel series  Star Trek: The Next Generation  began airing on television in  |first_run_syndication|First_Run_Syndication| ; Roddenberry was heavily involved in the initial development of the series, but took a less active role after the first season due to ill health. He continued to consult on the series until his death in 1991.     In 1985, he became the first TV writer with a star on the  |Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|Hollywood_Walk_Of_Fame| , and he was later inducted by both the  |Science_Fiction_Hall_of_Fame|Emp_Museumscience_Fiction_And_Fantasy_Hall_Of_Fame|  and the  |Academy_of_Television_Arts_Sciences|Academy_Of_Television_Arts_Sciences|  Hall of Fame. Years after his death, Roddenberry was one of the first humans to have his ashes carried into earth orbit. The popularity of the Star Trek universe and films has inspired films, books, comic books, video games, and  |fan_films|Star_Trek_Fan_Productions|  set in the Star Trek universe.             Roddenberry was born on August 19, 1921, in his parents rented home in El Paso, Texas, the first child of Eugene Edward Roddenberry and Caroline Glen Roddenberry. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1923 after Genes father passed the  |Civil_Service|Civil_Service|  test and was given a police commission there.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |pulp_magazines|Pulp_Magazine| ,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|  John Carter of Mars ,  Tarzan , and the  Skylark  series by  |E_E_Smith|E_E_Smith| .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |police_science|Police_Science|  at  |Los_Angeles_City_College|Los_Angeles_City_College| ,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|  where he began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat and became interested in  |aeronautical_engineering|Aeronautical_Engineering| .

The plane came down in the  |Syrian_Desert|Syrian_Desert| , and Roddenberry, who took control as the ranking flight officer, suffered two  |broken_ribs|Rib_Fracture|  but was able to drag injured passengers out of the burning plane and led the group to get help.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 20, 1947, p4 people died in the crash; 11 passengers needed hospital treatment, and eight were unharmed.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Los_Angeles_Police_Department|Los_Angeles_Police_Department|  on January 10, 1949,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995|  Mr. District Attorney , which led to him writing for the show under his pseudonym Robert Wesley .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Ziv_Television_Programs|Ziv_Television_Programs| ,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|  p. 145 and continued to sell scripts to Mr. District Attorney, in addition to Zivs  Highway Patrol . In early 1956, he sold two story ideas for  I Led Three Lives , and he found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to be a writer and a policeman.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995|        Roddenberry was promoted to head writer for  The West Point Story , and wrote 10 scripts for the first season, about a third of the total episodes.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |CBS|Cbs|  set aboard a  |cruise_ship|Cruise_Ship| , Hawaii Passage,  but they did not buy it, as he wanted to become a  |producer|Producer|  and have full creative control. He wrote another script for Zivs series  Harbourmaster  titled Coastal Security , and signed a contract with the company to develop a show called Junior Executive with  |Quinn_Martin|Quinn_Martin| . Nothing came of the series.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|    He wrote scripts for a number of other series in his early years as a professional writer, including  Bat Masterson  and  Jefferson Drum . Roddenberrys episode of the series  Have Gun – Will Travel , Helen of Abajinian , won the  |Writers_Guild_of_America|Writers_Guild_Of_America|  award for Best Teleplay in 1958. He also continued to create series of his own, including a series based on an agent for  |Lloyds_of_London|Lloyds_Of_London|  called The Man from Lloyds. He pitched a police-based series called Footbeat to CBS, Hollis Productions, and  |Screen_Gems|Screen_Gems| . It nearly made it into  |ABCs|Abc|  Sunday-night lineup, but they opted to show only  |Western|Western|  series that night.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he discovered that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job.  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| |Lew_Grade|Lew_Grade|  wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|  The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show  titled  Wrangler .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| The Wild Blue, went to pilot, but was not picked up.

His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Erle_Stanley_Gardner|Erle_Stanley_Gardner| . The  Perry Mason  creator claimed that Defiance County had infringed his character  |Doug_Selby|Doug_Selby| .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Defiance County never proceeded past the pilot stage.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|    In 1961, he agreed to appear in an advertisement for  |MONY|Mony|  , as long as he had final approval.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Beverly_Hills|Beverly_Hills| .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |airship|Airship|  travelling the world, based on the film  Master of the World  , with fellow writer Christopher Knopf at  |MGM|Mgm| . As the time was not right for science fiction, he began work on  The Lieutenant  for Arena Productions. This made it to the  |NBC|Nbc|  Saturday night lineup at 7:30  pm, and premiered on September 14, 1963. The show set a new ratings record for the time slot.  Roddenberry worked with several cast and crew who would later join him on Star Trek, including:  |Gene_L_Coon|Gene_L_Coon| , star  |Gary_Lockwood|Gary_Lockwood| , Joe DAgosta,  |Leonard_Nimoy|Leonard_Nimoy| ,  |Nichelle_Nichols|Nichelle_Nichols| , and Majel Barrett.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| The Lieutenant was produced with the co-operation of  |the_Pentagon|The_Pentagon| , which allowed them to film at an actual Marine base. During the production of the series, Roddenberry clashed regularly with the  |Department_of_Defense|United_States_Department_Of_Defense|  over potential plots.  The department withdrew its support after Roddenberry pressed ahead with a plot titled  |To_Set_It_Right|To_Set_It_Right|  in which a white and a black man find a common cause in their roles as Marines.  To Set It Right was the first time he worked with Nichols, and it was her first television role. The episode has been preserved at the  |Museum_of_Television_and_Radio|Museum_Of_Television_And_Radio|  in New York City.  |Nichols_|Nichols1994| Hawaii Passage and added a  |Horatio_Hornblower|Horatio_Hornblower|  character, plus the multiracial crew from his airship idea. He decided to write it as science fiction, and by March 11, 1964, he brought together a 16-page pitch. On April 24, he sent three copies and two dollars to the  |Writers_Guild_of_America|Writers_Guild_Of_America|  to register his series. He called it Star Trek.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek   When Roddenberry pitched Star Trek to MGM, it was warmly received, but no offer was made.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Desilu_Productions|Desilu_Productions| , but rather than being offered a one-script deal, he was hired as a producer and allowed to work on his own projects. His first was a half-hour pilot called Police Story , which was not picked up by the networks. Having not sold a pilot in five years, Desilu was having financial difficulties; its only success was  I Love Lucy .  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| Star Trek idea to Oscar Katz, head of programming, and the duo immediately started work on a plan to sell the series to the networks. They took it to CBS, which ultimately passed on it. The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about Star Trek because it had a science fiction series in development— Lost in Space . Roddenberry and Katz next took the idea to Mort Werner at NBC, this time downplaying the science fiction elements and highlighting the links to  Gunsmoke  and  Wagon Train .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |The_Cage|The_Cage|  , to be made into a pilot. While most of the money for the pilot came from NBC, the remaining costs were covered by Desilu.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |D_C_Fontana|D_C_Fontana| , as his assistant. They had worked together previously on The Lieutenant, and she had eight script credits to her name.      Roddenberry and Barrett had begun an affair by the early days of Star Trek, and he specifically wrote the part of the character  |Number_One|Number_One|  in the pilot with her in mind; no other actresses were considered for the role. Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of  |Spock|Spock| . He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on The Lieutenant, and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features of the actor, he did not consider anyone else for the part.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek would be broadcast at 8:00  pm on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Mudds_Women|Mudds_Women|  ,  |The_Omega_Glory|The_Omega_Glory|  , and with the help of  |Samuel_A_Peeples|Samuel_A_Peeples| ,  |Where_No_Man_Has_Gone_Before|Where_No_Man_Has_Gone_Before|  . NBC selected the last one, leading to later rumors that Peeples created Star Trek, something he always denied.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |George_Takei|George_Takei|  when he came for his audition.  The episode went into production on July 15, 1965, and was completed at around half the cost of The Cage , since the sets were already built.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek theme; this angered the themes composer,  |Alexander_Courage|Alexander_Courage| , as it meant that royalties would be split between them. In February 1966, NBC informed Desilu that they were buying Star Trek and that it would be included in the fall 1966 television schedule.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek series went into production;  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |World_Science_Fiction_Convention|World_Science_Fiction_Convention|  and previewed Where No Man Has Gone Before . After the episode was shown, he received a standing ovation. The first episode to air on NBC was  |The_Man_Trap|The_Man_Trap|  , on September 8, 1966, at 8:00  pm.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Harlan_Ellison|Harlan_Ellison|  to ask if he could use his name in letters to the network to save the show. Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Isaac_Asimov|Isaac_Asimov|  about how to address the issue of Spocks growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995|  Chicago Tribune  quoted studio executives as stating that the letter-writing campaign had been wasted because they had already been planning to renew Star Trek.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|    Roddenberry often rewrote submitted scripts, although he did not always take credit for these.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |The_City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever|The_City_On_The_Edge_Of_Forever|  after Roddenberry rewrote Ellisons script to make it both financially feasible to film and usable for the series context.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Don_Ingalls|Don_Ingalls|  had his script for  |A_Private_Little_War|A_Private_Little_War|  altered drastically, and as a result, Ingalls declared that he would only be credited under the pseudonym Jud Crucis , claiming he had been  |crucified|Crucified|  by the process.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |The_Menagerie|The_Menagerie|  , based on footage originally shot for The Cage , resulted in a Writers Guild arbitration board hearing. The Guild ruled in his favor over  |John_D_F_Black|John_D_F_Black| , the complainant.  The script won a  |Hugo_Award|Hugo_Award| , but the awards board neglected to inform Roddenberry, who found out through correspondence with Asimov.      As the second season was drawing to a close, Roddenberry once again faced the threat of cancellation. He enlisted the help of Asimov,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek fan  |Bjo_Trimble|Bjo_Trimble| , who led a fan writing campaign to save the series. Trimble later noted that this campaign of writing to fans who had written to Desilu about the show, urging them to write NBC, had created an organized  |Star_Trek_fandom|Star_Trek_Fandom| .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek would return for a third season.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek in the 7:30  pm Monday-night time slot freed up by  The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  completing its run. Instead, the enraged  |George_Schlatter|George_Schlatter|  forced the network to insert  Rowan and Martins Laugh-In  into the slot, and Roddenberrys series was moved to 10:00  pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: I had to get some money somewhere. Im sure not going to get it from the profits of Star Trek.  |Solow_Justman_|Solowjustman1996| |Robert_H_Justman|Robert_H_Justman|  observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him the opportunity to become the first chronicler of televisions successful unsuccessful series. Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers  |Aluminum_Model_Toys|Aluminum_Model_Toys| , better known as AMT , which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run  |Lincoln_Enterprises|Lincoln_Enterprises| , Roddenberrys company set up to sell the series merchandise.      Having stepped aside from the majority of his Star Trek duties, Roddenberry sought instead to create a film based on Asimovs  |I_Robot|I_Robot|  and also began work on a Tarzan script for  |National_General_Pictures|National_General_Pictures| .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |TV_movie|Tv_Movie| , he canceled the deal.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek cancellation in February 1969. A similar but much smaller letter-writing campaign followed news of the cancellation.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek aired 47 days before  |Neil_Armstrong|Neil_Armstrong|  stepped onto the moon as part of the  |Apollo_11|Apollo_11|  mission,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995|        Following the cancellation of Star Trek, Roddenberry felt  |typecast|Typecasting|  as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories.  |Asherman_|Asherman1988| |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992|  Roddenberry had sold his interest in Star Trek to  |Paramount_Studios|Paramount_Studios|  in return for a third of the ongoing profits. However, this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982.  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992|  Pretty Maids All in a Row  , a  |sexploitation|Sexploitation|  film directed by  |Roger_Vadim|Roger_Vadim| , for MGM. The cast included  |Rock_Hudson|Rock_Hudson| ,  |Angie_Dickinson|Angie_Dickinson| ,  |Telly_Savalas|Telly_Savalas| , and  |Roddy_McDowall|Roddy_Mcdowall|  alongside Star Trek regular  |James_Doohan|James_Doohan| , and  |William_J_Campbell|William_Campbell| , who had appeared as a guest in two Star Trek episodes, The Squire Of Gothos and The Trouble With Tribbles .  Variety  was unimpressed: Whatever substance was in the original or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results.  Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.      Faced with a mortgage and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation as a result of his 1969 divorce, he began to support himself largely by giving college lectures and appearances at science fiction conventions.  |Engel_|Engel1994| |Nemecek_|Nemecek2003| Star Trek.   The conventions began to build the fan support to bring back Star Trek, leading  TV Guide  to describe it, in 1972, as the show that wont die.      In 1972 and 1973, Roddenberry made a comeback to science fiction, selling ideas for four new series to a variety of networks. Roddenberrys  Genesis II  was set in a postapocalyptic Earth. He had hoped to recreate the success of Star Trek without doing another space-hopping show. He created a 45-page writing guide, and proposed several story ideas based on the concept that pockets of civilisation had regressed to past eras or changed altogether.  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| Thursday Night Movie of the Week. Roddenberry was asked to produce four more scripts for episodes, but before production could begin again, CBS aired the film  Planet of the Apes . It was watched by an even greater audience than Genesis II. CBS scrapped Genesis II and replaced it with a  |television_series|Planet_Of_The_Apes|  based on the film;  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| Planet of the Apes was quickly canceled.      The Questor Tapes  project reunited him with his Star Trek collaborator, Gene L. Coon, who was in failing health at the time. NBC ordered 16 episodes, and tentatively scheduled the series to follow  The Rockford Files  on Friday nights; the pilot launched on January 23, 1974,  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| Genesis II concept as a second pilot,  Planet Earth , for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science-fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered.  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992|  Strange New World . Alexander, David, Star Trek Creator. ROC Books, an imprint of Dutton Signet, a division of Penguin Books USA, New York, June 1994, , pp. 398–403. He began developing MAGNA I, an underwater science-fiction series, for  |20th_Century_Fox_Television|20Th_Century_Fox_Television| . By the time the work on the script was complete, though, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by Tribunes, a science-fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years;  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992|      In 1974, Roddenberry was paid $25,000 by  |John_Whitmore|John_Whitmore|  to write a script called The Nine. Intended to be about  |Andrija_Puharichs|Andrija_Puharich|  parapsychological research, it evolved into a frank exploration of his experiences attempting to earn a living attending science fiction conventions.  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992|      The pilot  Spectre , Roddenberrys 1977 attempt to create an  |occult_detective|Occult_Detective_Fiction|  duo similar to  |Sherlock_Holmes|Sherlock_Holmes|  and  |Dr_Watson|Dr_Watson| ,  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992|      Star Trek revival   Lacking funds in the early 1970s, Roddenberry was unable to buy the full rights to Star Trek for $150,000 from Paramount.  |Lou_Scheimer|Lou_Scheimer|  approached Paramount in 1973 about creating an animated Star Trek series.  Credited as executive consultant and paid $2,500 per episode, Roddenberry was granted full creative control of  Star Trek: The Animated Series . Although he read all the scripts and sometimes touches of his own , he relinquished most of his authority to de facto showrunner/associate producer D. C. Fontana.  |Clark_|Clark2012|      However, the groundswell of vociferous fan support  led Paramount to hire Roddenberry to create and produce a feature film based on the franchise in May 1975.  |Reeves_Stevens_Reeves_Stevens_|Reeves_Stevens1997|  The studio was unimpressed with the ideas being put forward; John D. F. Blacks opinion was that their ideas were never big enough for the studio, even when one scenario involved the end of the universe.  At the time, several ideas were partly developed including  Star Trek: The God Thing  and  Star Trek: Planet of the Titans .  |Reeves_Stevens_Reeves_Stevens_|Reeves_Stevens1997|  Star Wars , in June 1977, Paramount instead green-lit a new series set in the franchise titled  Star Trek: Phase II , with Roddenberry and most of the original cast, except Nimoy, set to reprise their respective roles.  It was to be the anchor show of a proposed Paramount-owned fourth network ,  but plans for the network were scrapped and the project was reworked into a feature film.  The result,  Star Trek: The Motion Picture , troubled the studio because of budgetary concerns,  but was a box-office hit. Adjusted for  |inflation|Inflation| , it was the third-highest grossing Star Trek movie, with the  |2009_film|Star_Trek|  coming in first and the  |2013_film|Star_Trek_Into_Darkness|  second.      In 1980, Roddenberry submitted a treatment for a proposed sequel about the crew preventing the alien  |Klingons|Klingon|  from thwarting the  |assassination_of_John_F_Kennedy|Assassination_Of_John_F_Kennedy| . Mindful of the tumult that suffused the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Paramount rejected the proposal. After he was replaced on the project by television producer  |Harve_Bennett|Harve_Bennett| , Roddenberry was named  |executive_consultant|Executive_Consultant|  for the project, a position he retained for all subsequent Star Trek franchise films produced during his lifetime. Under this arrangement, he was compensated with a producers fee and a percentage of the net profits of the film in exchange for proffering non-binding story notes and corresponding with the fan community; much to his ongoing chagrin, these memos were largely disregarded by Bennett and other producers.  An initial script for  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan  was circulated to eight people; Bennett attributed the subsequent plot leak of the death of Spock to Roddenberry. About 20% of the plot was based on Roddenberrys ideas.      Roddenberry was involved in creating the television series  Star Trek: The Next Generation , which premiered with  |Encounter_at_Farpoint|Encounter_At_Farpoint|  on September 28, 1987.  He was given a bonus of $1 million in addition to an ongoing salary to produce the series, and celebrated by purchasing a new  |Rolls_Royce|Rolls_Royce_Motors|  for $100,000.  The arrangement did not entitle him to be executive producer of the series. However, Paramount was already concerned about the original cast not returning, and fearing fan reaction if Roddenberry was not involved, agreed to his demand for control of the show.  Roddenberry rewrote the  |series_bible|Bible|  from an original version by  |David_Gerrold|David_Gerrold| , who had previously written The Original Series episode  |The_Trouble_with_Tribbles|The_Trouble_With_Tribbles|  , and The Animated Series follow-up,  |More_Tribbles_More_Troubles|More_Tribbles_More_Troubles|  .         According to producer  |Rick_Berman|Rick_Berman| , Roddenberrys involvement in The Next Generation diminished greatly after the first season, but the nature of his increasingly peripheral role was not disclosed because of the value of his name to fans.  |Tulock_Jenkins_|Tulockjenkins1995| |Datalore|Datalore|  , the 13th episode of the first season.     Although commercially successful from its inception, the series was initially marred by  |Writers_Guild_of_America|Writers_Guild_Of_America|  grievances from Fontana and Gerrold, both of whom left the series under acrimonious circumstances; frequent turnover among the writing staff ;  and allegations that longtime Roddenberry attorney Leonard Maizlish had become the producers point man and proxy , ghostwriting memos, sitting in on meetings, and contributing to scripts despite not being on staff.  Writer  |Tracy_Tormé|Tracy_Tormé|  described the first few seasons of The Next Generation under Roddenberry as an insane asylum .      In 1990,  |Nicholas_Meyer|Nicholas_Meyer|  was brought in to direct the sixth film in the series:  Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country . Creatively, Meyer clashed with Roddenberry, who felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer described a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying: His guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt Id behaved very well, very diplomatically. I came out of it feeling not very good, and Ive not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didnt have to take him on. Not my finest hour.  In Joel Engels biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a good job .  In contrast, Nimoy and Shatners memoirs report that after the screening, Roddenberry called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.      In addition to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors , it was the first in a series of hundreds of Star Trek-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books  |imprint|Imprint|  of  |Simon_Schuster|Simon_Schuster| , whose parent company also owned  |Paramount_Pictures_Corporation|Paramount_Pictures_Corporation| .  |Ayers_|Ayers2006| The God Thing, a proposed novel based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976.

While at  |Los_Angeles_City_College|Los_Angeles_City_College| , Roddenberry began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat. They became engaged before Roddenberry left Los Angeles during his military service,  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| Star Trek, he began relationships with both Nichelle Nichols and Majel Barrett.

Roddenberry and Barrett had a son together, Eugene Jr., commonly referred to as  |Rod_Roddenberry|Rod_Roddenberry| , in February 1974.  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| |Sackett_|Sackett2002| |Southern_Baptist|Southern_Baptist| ;  |Van_Hise_|Vanhise1992| |humanist|Humanism| . He began questioning religion around the age of 14, and came to the conclusion that it was nonsense . As a child, he served in the  |choir|Choir|  at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the  |American_Baptist_Convention|American_Baptist_Convention|  for skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts . For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the  |National_Council_of_Churches|National_Council_Of_Churches|  regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Christianity|Christianity| , How can I take seriously a God-image that requires that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That sounds to me like a very insecure personality. At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing.  Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher  |Charles_Musès|Charles_Musès| , who said that Roddenberrys views were a far cry from  |atheism|Atheism|  .  |Fern_|Fern1994| |Fern_|Fern1994| |Fern_|Fern1994| |Catholicism|Catholic_Church|  a very beautiful religion.

While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.  |Asherman_|Asherman1988| |Ronald_D_Moore|Ronald_D_Moore| , Roddenberry felt very strongly that contemporary Earth religions would be gone by the 23rd century .   |Brannon_Braga|Brannon_Braga|  said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking were not to be included.  Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of The Next Generation resulted in Roddenberrys chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that Star Trek had evolved into sort of a secular parallel to the  |Catholic_Mass|Catholic_Mass|  .  |Fern_|Fern1994| Star Trek is more than just my political philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition.  |Nichols_|Nichols1994| |American_Humanist_Association|American_Humanist_Association| .        In the late 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted by the first manifestations of  |cerebral_vascular_disease|Cerebral_Vascular_Disease|  and  |encephalopathy|Encephalopathy|  as a result of his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including  |alcohol|Alcoholic_Beverage| ,  |methaqualone|Methaqualone| ,   |methylphenidate|Methylphenidate| ,  |Dexamyl|Dexamyl| , and  |cocaine|Cocaine|  .  Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially  |amphetamines|Amphetamine| .  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |diabetes|Diabetes_Mellitus_Type_2| ,   |high_blood_pressure|High_Blood_Pressure| , and  |antidepressant|Antidepressant|  prescriptions.     Following a  |stroke|Stroke|  at a family reunion in  |Tallahassee_Florida|Tallahassee_Florida| , in September 1989,  |Nichols_|Nichols1994| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |cardiopulmonary_arrest|Cardiopulmonary_Arrest| , and he died in the doctors office shortly afterwards.  |Alexander_|Alexander1995| |Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation|Cardiopulmonary_Resuscitation|  was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the  |Santa_Monica_Medical_Center|Ucla_Medical_Center_Santa_Monica| , where he was pronounced dead.       The funeral was arranged for November 1, with the public invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the  |Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park|Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park| , in  |Hollywood_Hills|Hollywood_Hills| .  It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been  |cremated|Cremated|  before the event. More than 300 Star Trek fans attended, and stood in the balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichelle Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first  |Yesterday|Yesterday|  and then a song she wrote herself titled Gene . Both songs had been requested by Barrett.  |Nichols_|Nichols1994| |Ray_Bradbury|Ray_Bradbury| ,  |Whoopi_Goldberg|Whoopi_Goldberg| , Christopher Knopf,  |E_Jack_Neuman|E_Jack_Neuman| ,  and  |Patrick_Stewart|Patrick_Stewart| . The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing  |Amazing_Grace|Amazing_Grace|  as a recorded message by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane  |flypast|Flypast| , in the  |missing_man_formation|Missing_Man_Formation| , followed some 30 minutes later.  After his death, Star Trek: The Next Generation aired a two-part episode of season five, called  |Unification|Unification|  , which featured a dedication to Roddenberry.      Roddenberrys will left the majority of his $30 million estate to Barrett, in a trust. He also left money to his children and his first wife Eileen. However, his daughter Dawn contested the will based upon the grounds that Barrett had undue influence on her father. In a hearing held in 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that improprieties existed in the management of the trust and removed Barrett as executor. In another decision, the court found that Roddenberry had hidden assets from Star Trek in the  |Norway_Corporation|Norway_Corporation|  to keep funds away from his first wife, and ordered the payment of 50% of those assets to Eileen, as well as punitive damages.  In 1996, the  |California_Court_of_Appeals|California_Courts_Of_Appeal|  ruled that the original will, which stated that anyone who contested it would be disinherited, would stand. As a result, Dawn lost $500,000 from the estate, as well as a share of the trust upon Barretts death.  The appellate court also overturned the earlier decision to award Roddenberrys first wife, Eileen, 50% of his assets. The judge called that case one that should never have been .         In 1992, some of Roddenberrys ashes were flown into space, and returned to Earth, on the  |Space_Shuttle_Columbia|Space_Shuttle_Columbia|  mission  |STS_52|Sts_52| .   On April 21, 1997, a  |_Celestis_spacecraft|Celestis|  with 7 grams of the cremated remains of Roddenberry,  along with those of  |Timothy_Leary|Timothy_Leary| ,  |Gerard_K_ONeill|Gerard_K_Oneill|  and 21 other people, was launched into Earth orbit aboard a  |Pegasus_XL|Pegasus|  rocket from a site near the  |Canary_Islands|Canary_Islands| .   On May 20, 2002, the spacecrafts orbit deteriorated and it disintegrated in the atmosphere. Another flight to launch more of his ashes into deep space, along with those of Barrett, who died in 2008, was initially planned to take place in 2009. Unlike previous flights, the intention was that this flight would not return to burn up in the Earths atmosphere.  The payload was to include the ashes of  |James_Doohan|James_Doohan|  in addition to the Roddenberrys and several others and was scheduled to fly in 2016 on the  |Sunjammer|Sunjammer|  solar sail experiment,  but the project was canceled in 2014.  At this time, it is not known if there is another mission being planned.             In 1985, Gene Roddenberry was the first television writer to receive a star on the  |Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|Hollywood_Walk_Of_Fame| .  |Pearson_|Pearson2011| |Sci_Fi_Channel|Sci_Fi_Channel|  was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two science fiction pioneers :  |Engel_|Engel1994| |Roddenberry_crater|Roddenberry|  on Mars is named after him,  |Ayers_|Ayers2006| |4659_Roddenberry|4659_Roddenberry| .  |Hamilton_|Hamilton2007| Star Trek have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with  |George_Lucas|George_Lucas|  crediting the series for enabling Star Wars to be produced.   |J_Michael_Straczynski|J_Michael_Straczynski| , creator of the  Babylon 5  franchise, appreciated Star Trek amongst other science fiction series and what they had to say about who we are, and where we are going.      David Alexander collaborated with Roddenberry on a biography over two decades.  Titled Star Trek Creator, it was published in 1995.  Yvonne Ferns book, Gene Roddenberry: The Last Conversation, detailed a series of conversations she had with Roddenberry over the last months of his life.  |Hall_|Hall1997|  The  |Science_Fiction_Hall_of_Fame|Emp_Museumscience_Fiction_And_Fantasy_Hall_Of_Fame|  inducted Roddenberry in 2007,  and the  |Television_Academy_Hall_of_Fame|Television_Academy_Hall_Of_Fame|  in January 2010.         Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  was already in development when Roddenberry died. Berman said that while he never discussed the ideas for the season, he was given a blessing by Roddenberry to pursue it.  Berman later stated, I dont believe the 24th century is going to be like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be, that people will be free from poverty and greed. But if youre going to write and produce for Star Trek, youve got to buy into that.  In early 1996, Majel Barret-Roddenberry uncovered scripts for a series called Battleground Earth. The project was sent to distributors by the  |Creative_Artists_Agency|Creative_Artists_Agency| , and it was picked up by  |Tribune_Entertainment|Tribune_Entertainment| , which set the budget at over $1 million per episode.  The series was renamed  Earth: Final Conflict  before launch, and premiered in 1997, six years after Genes death; it ran for 5 seasons until 2002.      Two further series ideas were developed from Roddenberrys notes, Genesis and  Andromeda .  After an initial order for two seasons,  |110_episodes|List_Of_Andromeda_Episodes|  of Andromeda were aired over five seasons.   Tribune also worked on another Roddenberry series. Titled Starship; they aimed to launch it via the network route rather than into syndication.  Rod Roddenberry, president of Roddenberry Productions, announced in 2010, at his fathers posthumous induction into the  |Academy_of_Television_Arts_and_Sciences|Academy_Of_Television_Arts_And_Sciences|  Hall of Fame, that he was aiming to take The Questor Tapes to television.  Rod was developing the series alongside  |Imagine_Television|Imagine_Television| . Rod would go on to create the two-hour television movie  Trek Nation  regarding the impact of his fathers work.           The majority of the awards and nominations received by Roddenberry throughout his career were related to Star Trek. He was credited for Star Trek during the nominations for two  |Emmy_Awards|Emmy_Award| ,   and won two Hugo Awards.   One Hugo was a special award for the series, while another was for The Menagerie , the episode which used footage from the original unaired pilot for Star Trek, The Cage .  |Cushman_Osborn_|Cushmanosborn2013| |National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People|National_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Colored_People|  for his work in the advancement of  |African_American|African_American|  characters on television.  |Reginald_|Reginald1979| Star Trek, he was nominated for Hugo Awards for Genesis II and The Questor Tapes.
