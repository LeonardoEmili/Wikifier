            Cavalry  or horsemen are  |soldiers|Soldier|  or  |warriors|Warrior|  who  |fight_mounted|Horses_In_Warfare|  on  |horseback|Horseback| . Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the  |combat_arms|Combat_Arms| . An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman,  dragoon , or  trooper . The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any  |military_forces_that_used_other_animals|Military_Animal| , such as  |camels|Camel_Cavalry| , mules or  |elephants|War_Elephant| .  |Infantry|Infantry|  who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as  |dragoons|Dragoon| , a class of  |mounted_infantry|Mounted_Infantry|  which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.     Cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and  |inertial_mass|Inertial_Mass|  over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.     The speed, mobility and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the  |Ancient|Ancient_Era|  and  |Middle_Ages|Horses_In_The_Middle_Ages| ; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in  |nomadic_societies_of_Asia|Eurasian_Nomads| , notably the  |Mongol_armies|Mongol_Army| . In Europe cavalry became increasingly  |armoured|Heavy_Cavalry| , and eventually evolving into the mounted  |knights|Knight|  of the medieval period. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened  |cuirass|Cuirass|  that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.     In  |the_period|Interwar_Period|  between the  |World_Wars|World_Wars| , many cavalry units were converted into  |motorized_infantry|Motorized_Infantry|  and  |mechanized_infantry|Mechanized_Infantry|  units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , notably in the  |Red_Army|Red_Army| , the  |Mongolian_Peoples_Army|Mongolian_Peoples_Army| , the  |Royal_Italian_Army|Royal_Italian_Army| , the  |Romanian_Army|Romania_In_World_War_Ii| , the  |Polish_Land_Forces|Polish_Land_Forces| , and light reconnaissance units within the  |Waffen_SS|Waffen_Ss| . Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition .                    In many modern armies, the term cavalry is still often used to refer to units that are a  |combat_arm|Combat_Arms|  of the  |armed_forces|Armed_Forces|  which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat  |light_cavalry|Light_Cavalry|  roles. These include  |scouting|Reconnaissance| ,  |skirmishing|Skirmishing|  with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of the disposition of the main body of troops, forward security, offensive  |reconnaissance_by_combat|Reconnaissancereconnaissance-In-Force| , defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement,  |retreat|Retreat| , restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines,  |relief_in_place|Relief_In_Place| , linkup,  |breakout|Breakout|  operations, and  |raiding|Raid| . The  |shock|Shock_Attack|  role, traditionally filled by  |heavy_cavalry|Heavy_Cavalry| , is generally filled by  |units|Military_Unit|  with the  |armored|Armoured_Warfare|  designation.                Before the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| , the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light  |chariots|Chariot| . The chariot originated with the  |Sintashta-Petrovka|Sintashta-Petrovka|  culture in  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia|  and spread by  |nomad|Nomad| ic or semi-nomadic  |Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranians| . p. 1, Menon The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the  |pharaohs|Pharaoh|  of the  |New_Kingdom_of_Egypt|New_Kingdom_Of_Egypt|  from 1550 BC as well as the  |Assyrian_army|Assyrian_Army|  and  |Babylonia|Babylonia| n royalty. Terrence Wise, p. 18, Ancient Armies of the Middle East , Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981      The power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of  |horses|Horse|  to carry heavy  |armor|Armor| . Cavalry techniques were an innovation of  |equestrian_nomads|Equestrian_Nomad|  of the Central Asian and  |Iranian|Iranian_Peoples|  steppe and  |pastoralist|Pastoral_Farming| |tribes|Tribe|  such as the  |Iranic|Persian_People| |Parthia|Parthia| ns and  |Sarmatians|Sarmatians| .        The photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865–860 BC. At this time, the men had no  |spurs|Spur| ,  |saddles|Saddle| ,  |saddle_cloths|Saddle_Cloth| , or  |stirrups|Stirrup| . Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the  |mounted_archer|Mounted_Archer|  were controlled by his neighbours hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse. Terrence Wise, plate H, Ancient Armies of the Middle East , Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981      As early as 490 BC a  |breed_of_large_horses|Nisean_Horse|  was bred in the  |Nisaean_plain|Nisaean_Plain|  in Media to carry  |men_with_increasing_amounts_of_armour|Cataphract|  , but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the fourth century BC the Chinese during the  |Warring_States_period|Warring_States_Period|  began to use cavalry against rival states, Ebrey and others, Pre-Modern East Asia, pp. 29  30. and by 331 BC when  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive  |scythed_chariots|Scythed_Chariot| . The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the  |Battle_of_Telamon|Battle_Of_Telamon|  in 225 BC.    However, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a  |Roman_triumph|Roman_Triumph| , or for racing.     Outside of mainland Europe, the southern  |Britons|Britons|  met  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  with chariots in  |55_and_54_BC|Caesars_Invasions_Of_Britain| , but by the time of the  |Roman_conquest_of_Britain|Roman_Conquest_Of_Britain|  a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the  |Caledonia|Caledonia| ns at the  |Mons_Graupius|Battle_Of_Mons_Graupius| , in 84 AD.               During the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with  |javelins|Javelin| , could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using  |lances|Lance| , had the ability to close in on their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the  |hoplites|Hoplites|  or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.      Cavalry played a relatively minor role in  |ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greece| |city-states|City-States| , with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However,  |Thebes|Ancient_Thebes|  produced  |Pelopidas|Pelopidas| , her first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by  |Phillip_II_of_Macedon|Phillip_Ii_Of_Macedon|  when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes.  |Thessaly|Thessaly|  was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen,  and later experiences in wars both with and against the  |Persians|Achaemenid_Empire|  taught the  |Greeks|Greeks|  the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The  |Athenian|Athens|  author and soldier  |Xenophon|Xenophon|  in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.      The  |Macedon|Macedon| ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the hetairoi   of Philip II of Macedon and  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| . In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen  called  |prodromoi|Prodromoi|  for scouting and screening, as well as the  |Macedonian_pike_phalanx|Macedonian_Phalanx|  and various kinds of  |light_infantry|Light_Infantry| . There were also the Ippiko , Greek heavy cavalry, armed with  |kontos|Kontos|  , and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. The effectiveness of this combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexanders conquests of  |Persia|Persia| ,  |Bactria|Bactria| , and northwestern India.                 The cavalry in the early  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic|  remained the preserve of the wealthy  |landed_class|Landed_Class|  known as the  equites —men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common  |legions|Roman_Legion| . Horses were provided by the Republic and could be withdrawn if neglected or misused, together with the status of being a cavalryman.      As the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian  |socii|Socii|  for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the  |Second_Punic_War|Second_Punic_War|  where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the  |Battle_of_Cannae|Battle_Of_Cannae| , where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among  |Gauls|Gauls| ,  |Iberians|Iberians| , and  |Numidians|Numidians| , the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts .  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the  Cohortes Equitatae . Early emperors maintained an  |ala|Ala|  of  |Batavi|Batavi| an cavalry as their  |personal_bodyguards|Germanic_Bodyguard|  until the unit was dismissed by  |Galba|Galba|  after the  |Batavian_Rebellion|Batavian_Rebellion| .     For the most part, Roman cavalry during the early Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the standing force comprising a consular army. Except in times of major mobilisation about 1,800 horsemen were maintained, with three hundred attached to each legion.    The relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the  |Battle_of_Aquilonia|Battle_Of_Aquilonia| .     After defeats such as the  |Battle_of_Carrhae|Battle_Of_Carrhae| , the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the  |Parthians|Parthian_Empire| .    At the same time heavy spears and shields modelled on those favoured by the horsemen of the Greek city-states were adopted to replace the lighter weaponry of early Rome.    These improvements in tactics and equipment reflected those of a thousand years earlier when the first Iranians to reach the  |Iranian_Plateau|Iranian_Plateau|  forced the  |Assyrians|Assyrian_People|  to undertake similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their  |heavy_infantry|Heavy_Infantry|  supported by auxiliary cavalry.            In the army of the late  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , cavalry played an increasingly important role. The  |Spatha|Spatha| , the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empires cavalry forces.     The most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Iranian empires, the  |Parthians|Parthian_Empire|  and their  |Persian|Persians| |Sasanian|Sasanian_Empire|  successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the  |cataphract|Cataphract|  even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter  |horse_archers|Horse_Archer| . The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the  |Hellenistic_period|Hellenistic_Period|  with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the  |Roman–Persian_Wars|Roman–Persian_Wars| . At first the Parthians mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and clibanarii.      The decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman  |saddle|Horse_Tack|  by variants on the Scythian model, with  |pommel|Pommel|  and cantle, The raised rear part of a saddle was also a significant factor as was the adoption of  |stirrups|Stirrup|  and the concomitant increase in stability of the riders seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by  |Persia|History_Of_Iran| n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.     The late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders—individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.                      |Xiongnu|Xiongnu| ,  |Tujue|Tujue| ,  |Avars|Avars| ,  |Kipchaks|Kipchaks| ,  |Mongols|Mongol| ,  |Don_Cossacks|Don_Cossack|  and the various  |Turkic_peoples|Turkic_Peoples|  are also examples of the horse-mounted groups that managed to gain substantial successes in military conflicts with settled agrarian and urban societies, due to their strategic and tactical mobility. As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic  |nation-states|Nation-States|  supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.        The best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| . In eastern Europe, Russia, and out onto the  |steppes|Steppes| , cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early 17th century and even beyond, as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for the semi-nomadic  |pastoralist|Pastoralism|  lives that many steppe cultures led.  |Tibet|Tibet| ans also had a tradition of cavalry warfare, in several military engagements with the Chinese  |Tang_dynasty|Tang_Dynasty|  .       |Mongol|Mongol| |Tatar|Tatar|  vanguard in  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe|  13th–14th centuries.                   Further east, the  |military_history_of_China|Military_History_Of_China| , specifically  |northern_China|North_China| , held a long tradition of intense military exchange between  |Han_Chinese|Han_Chinese|  infantry forces of the settled dynastic empires and the mounted  |nomads|Nomads|  or barbarians of the north. The  |naval_history_of_China|Naval_History_Of_China|  was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept  |navy|Naval_Warfare| .     In 307 BC,  |King_Wuling_of_Zhao|King_Wuling_Of_Zhao| , the ancient Chinese ruler of the former  |State_of_Jin|Jin|  territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the  |trousers|Trousers|  of the  |nomads|Nomad|  as well as practice the nomads form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.        The adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the  |chariot|Chariot| -riding  |Chinese_aristocracy|Four_Occupations|  in battle, which had been in use since the ancient  |Shang_Dynasty|Shang_Dynasty|  . Ebrey, 29. By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force. Ebrey, 30. The handheld pistol-and-trigger  |crossbow|Crossbow|  was invented in China in the fourth century BC; Ebrey, The Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 41. it was written by the  |Song_dynasty|Song_Dynasty|  scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book  Wujing Zongyao  that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges. Peers, 130. we can right anything        On many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire|  and its sinicized part, the  |Yuan_Dynasty|Yuan_Dynasty|  . The Chinese recognized early on during the  |Han_Dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies.  |Emperor_Wu_of_Han|Emperor_Wu_Of_Han|  went to war with the  |Dayuan|Dayuan|  for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the  |Hellenized|Hellenized| – |Greek|Greeks|  region of  |Fergana|Fergana|  . Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wus war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.     Cavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached  |stirrup|Stirrup|  by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a  |Jin_Dynasty|Jin_Dynasty|  tomb of the year 322 AD.   The stirrup – history of Chinese science . UNESCO Courier, October 1988 The Chinese invention of the horse collar by the 5th century was also a great improvement from the breast harness, allowing the horse to haul greater weight without heavy burden on its skeletal structure.

Since at least the 3rd century BC, there was influence of northern nomad ic peoples and Yemaek peoples on Korean warfare. By roughly the first century BC, the ancient kingdom of Buyeo also had mounted warriors. Ebrey, 120. The cavalry of Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , were called Gaemamusa , and were renowned as a fearsome heavy cavalry force. King Gwanggaeto the Great often led expeditions into the Baekje , Gaya confederacy , Buyeo , Later Yan and against Japanese invaders with his cavalry. Lee, Peter H & Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, pp. 24–26. Columbia University Press, 1997.   In the 12th century, Jurchen tribes began to violate the Goryeo–Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded Goryeo Korea. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general Yun Gwan realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo–Jurchen borders . thu with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet. Circa 1878.     The ancient Japanese of the Kofun period also adopted cavalry and equine culture by the 5th century AD. The emergence of the samurai aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging lancer cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.     An example is Yabusame , a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special turnip-headed arrows successively at three wooden targets.     This style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.   Currently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto . It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.     Kasagake or Kasakake is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.       In the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the Gupta Dynasty period onwards. India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe- stirrup s.     Indian literature contains numerous references to the cavalry forces of the Central Asia n horse nomads like the Saka s, Kambojas , Yavanas , Pahlavas and Paradas . Numerous Puranic texts refer to a conflict in ancient India pp. 182–183, Pargiter. in which the cavalry forces of five nations, called five hordes  or Kṣatriya hordes , attacked and captured the throne of Ayudhya by dethroning its Vedic King Bahu Harivamsa 14.1–19; Vayu Purana 88.127–43; Brahma Purana ; Brahamanda Purana ; Shiva Purana ; Vishnu Purana , Padama Purana etc.     thu     The Mahabharata , Ramayana , numerous Puranas and some foreign sources numerously attest that Kamboja cavalry was frequently requisitioned in ancient wars.
