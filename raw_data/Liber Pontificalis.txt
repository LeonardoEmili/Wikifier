        The Liber Pontificalis  is a book of  |biographies|Biography|  of  |popes|Pope|  from  |Saint_Peter|Saint_Peter|  until the 15th century. The original publication of the Liber Pontificalis stopped with  |Pope_Adrian_II|Pope_Adrian_Ii|  or  |Pope_Stephen_V|Pope_Stephen_V|  , but it was later supplemented in a different style until  |Pope_Eugene_IV|Pope_Eugene_Iv|  and then  |Pope_Pius_II|Pope_Pius_Ii|  .  Although quoted virtually uncritically from the 8th to 18th centuries, Loomis, 2006, p. xi. the Liber Pontificalis has undergone intense modern scholarly scrutiny. The work of the French priest  |Louis_Duchesne|Louis_Duchesne|  , and of others has highlighted some of the underlying redactional motivations of different sections, though such interests are so disparate and varied as to render improbable one popularizers claim that it is an unofficial instrument of pontifical propaganda.     The title Liber Pontificalis goes back to the 12th century, although it only became current in the 15th century, and the canonical title of the work since the edition of Duchesne in the 19th century. In the earliest extant manuscripts it is referred to as Liber episcopalis in quo continentur acta beatorum pontificum Urbis Romae and later the Gesta or Chronica pontificum. Levillain, Philippe. 2002. The Papacy: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. . p. 941.          During the Middle Ages,  |Saint_Jerome|Jerome|  was considered the author of all the biographies up until those of  |Pope_Damasus_I|Pope_Damasus_I|  , based on an  |apocrypha|Apocrypha| l letter between Saint Jerome and Pope Damasus published as a preface to the Medieval manuscripts. The attribution originated with  |Rabanus_Maurus|Rabanus_Maurus|  and is repeated by  |Martin_of_Opava|Martin_Of_Opava| , who extended the work into the 13th century. Other sources attribute the early work to  |Hegesippus|Hegesippus|  and  |Irenaeus|Irenaeus| , having been continued by  |Eusebius_of_Caesarea|Eusebius_Of_Caesarea| .      In the 16th century,  |Onofrio_Panvinio|Onofrio_Panvinio|  attributed the biographies after Damasus until  |Pope_Nicholas_I|Pope_Nicholas_I|  to  |Anastasius_Bibliothecarius|Anastasius_Bibliothecarius| ; Anastasius continued to be cited as the author into the 17th century, although this attribution was disputed by the scholarship of  |Caesar_Baronius|Caesar_Baronius| ,  |Ciampini|Ciampini| ,  |Schelstrate|Schelstrate|  and others.      The modern interpretation, following that of  |Louis_Duchesne|Louis_Duchesne| , is that the Liber Pontificalis was gradually and unsystematically compiled, and that the authorship is impossible to determine, with a few exceptions . Duchesne and others have viewed the beginning of the Liber Pontificalis up until the biographies of  |Pope_Felix_III|Pope_Felix_Iii|  as the work of a single author, who was a contemporary of  |Pope_Anastasius_II|Pope_Anastasius_Ii|  , relying on  Catalogus Liberianus , which in turn draws from the papal catalogue of  |Hippolytus_of_Rome|Hippolytus_Of_Rome| , and the  Leonine Catalogue , which is no longer extant. Lightfoot, Joseph Barber. 1890. The Apostolic Fathers: A Revised Text with Introductions, Notes, Dissertations, and Translations. Macmillan. p. 311. Most scholars believe the Liber Pontificalis was first compiled in the 5th or 6th century. Lightfoot, 1890, p. 65.     Because of the use of the  vestiarium , the records of the  |papal_treasury|Apostolic_Camera| , some have hypothesized that the author of the early Liber Pontificalis was a clerk of the papal treasury.  |Edward_Gibbons|Edward_Gibbon|   Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire  summarised the scholarly consensus as being that the Liber Pontificalis was composed by apostolic librarians and notaries of the viii th and ix th centuries with only the most recent portion being composed by Anastasius.  |Gibbon_Edward|Edward_Gibbon| . 1788.  Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Vol V. Chapter XLIX. Note 32.     Duchesne and others believe that the author of the first addition to the Liber Pontificalis was a contemporary of  |Pope_Silverius|Pope_Silverius|  , and that the author of another addition was a contemporary of  |Pope_Conon|Pope_Conon|  , with later popes being added individually and during their reigns or shortly after their deaths.       The Liber Pontificalis originally only contained the names of the bishops of Rome and the durations of their pontificates. Tuker, Mildred Anna Rosalie, and Malleson, Hope. 1899. Handbook to Christian and Ecclesiastical Rome. A. and C. Black. pp. 559-560. As enlarged in the 6th century, each biography consists of: the birth name of the pope and that of his father, place of birth, profession before elevation, length of pontificate, historical notes of varying thoroughness, major theological pronouncements and decrees, administrative milestones ,  |ordinations|Ordination| , date of death, place of burial, and the duration of the ensuing  sede vacante .      |Pope_Adrian_II|Pope_Adrian_Ii|  is the last pope for which there are extant manuscripts of the original Liber Pontificalis |Pope_John_VIII|Pope_John_Viii| ,  |Pope_Marinus_I|Pope_Marinus_I| , and  |Pope_Adrian_III|Pope_Adrian_Iii|  are missing and the biography of  |Pope_Stephen_V|Pope_Stephen_V|  is incomplete. From Stephen V through the 10th and 11th centuries, the historical notes are extremely abbreviated, usually with only the popes origin and reign duration.       It was only in the 12th century that the Liber Pontificalis was systematically continued, although papal biographies exist in the interim period in other sources.       Duchesne refers to the 12th century work by  |Petrus_Guillermi|Petrus_Guillermi|  in 1142 at the  |monastery_of_St_Gilles|Monastery_Of_St_Gilles|   as the Liber Pontificalis of Petrus Guillermi . Guillermis version is mostly copied from other works with small additions or excisions from the papal biographies of Pandulf, nephew of  |Hugo_of_Alatri|Hugo_Of_Alatri| , which in turn was copied almost verbatim from the original Liber Pontificalis , then from other sources until  |Pope_Honorius_II|Pope_Honorius_Ii|  , and with contemporary information from  |Pope_Paschal_II|Pope_Paschal_Ii|  to  |Pope_Urban_II|Pope_Urban_Ii|  .     Duchesne attributes all biographies from  |Pope_Gregory_VII|Pope_Gregory_Vii|  to Urban II to  |Pandulf|Pandolfo_Da_Lucca| , while earlier historians like  |Giesebrecht|Giesebrecht|  Allgemeine Monatsschrift , Halle, 1852, 260 sqq. and  |Watterich|Watterich|  Romanorum Pontificum vitæ, I, LXVIII sqq. attributed the biographies of Gregory VII, Victor III, and Urban II to  |Petrus_Pisanus|Cardinal_Petrus_Pisanus| , and the subsequent biographies to Pandulf. These biographies until those of  |Pope_Martin_IV|Pope_Martin_Iv|  are extant only as revised by Petrus Guillermi in the manuscripts of the monastery of St. Gilles having been taken from the Chronicle of  |Martin_of_Opava|Martin_Of_Opava| .     Early in the 14th century, an unknown author built upon the continuation of Petrus Guillermi, adding the biographies of popes  |Martin_IV|Pope_Martin_Iv|  through  |John_XXII|Pope_John_Xxii|  , with information taken from the  |Chronicon_Pontificum|Chronicon_Pontificum|  of  |Bernardus_Guidonis|Bernard_Gui| , stopping abruptly in 1328.       Independently, the  |cardinal_nephew|Cardinal_Nephew|  of  |Pope_Adrian_IV|Pope_Adrian_Iv| ,  |Cardinal_Boso|Boso_Breakspeare|  intended to extend the Liber Pontificalis from where it left off with Stephen V, although his work was only published posthumously as the  Gesta Romanorum Pontificum  alongside the  Liber Censuum  of  |Pope_Honorius_III|Pope_Honorius_Iii| . Boso drew on  |Bonizo_of_Sutri|Bonizo_Of_Sutri|  for popes from  |John_XII|Pope_John_Xii|  to  |Gregory_VII|Pope_Gregory_Vii| , and wrote from his own experiences about the popes from  |Gelasius_II|Pope_Gelasius_Ii|  to  |Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii|  .       An independent continuation appeared in the reign of  |Pope_Eugene_IV|Pope_Eugene_Iv|  , appending biographies from  |Pope_Urban_V|Pope_Urban_V|  to  |Pope_Martin_V|Pope_Martin_V|  , encompassing the period of the  |Western_Schism|Western_Schism| . A later recension of this continuation was expanded under  |Pope_Eugene_IV|Pope_Eugene_Iv| .       The two collections of papal biographies of the 15th century remain independent, although they may have been intended to be continuations of the Liber Pontificalis. The first extends from popes  |Benedict_XII|Pope_Benedict_Xii|  to  |Martin_V|Pope_Martin_V|  , or in one manuscript to  |Eugene_IV|Pope_Eugene_Iv|  . The second extends from  |Pope_Urban_VI|Pope_Urban_Vi|  to  |Pope_Pius_II|Pope_Pius_Ii|  .          The Liber Pontificalis was  |first_edited|Editio_Princeps|  by  |Joannes_Busaeus|Joannes_Busaeus|  under the title Anastasii bibliothecarii Vitæ seu Gesta. Romanorum Pontificum . A new edition, including the  Historia ecclesiastica  of Anastasius, was edited by Fabrotti . Another edition, editing the older Liber Pontificalis up to  |Pope_Adrian_II|Pope_Adrian_Ii|  and adding  |Pope_Stephen_VI|Pope_Stephen_Vi| , was compiled by Fr. Bianchini . Muratori reprinted Bianchinis edition, adding the remaining popes through  |John_XXII|Pope_John_Xxii|  . Migne also republished Bianchinis edition, adding several appendixes .     Modern editions include those of  |Louis_Duchesne|Louis_Duchesne|   and  |Theodor_Mommsen|Theodor_Mommsen|  . Duchesne incorporates the  Annales Romani  into his edition of the Liber Pontificalis .
