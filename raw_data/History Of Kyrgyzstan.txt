         The history of the  |Kyrgyz_people|Kyrgyz_People|  and the land now called  |Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan|  goes back more than 2,000 years. Although geographically isolated by its mountainous location, it had an important role as part of the historical  |Silk_Road|Silk_Road|  trade route. In between periods of self-government it was ruled by  |Göktürks|Göktürks| , the  |Uyghur_Empire|Uyghur_Empire| , and the  |Khitan_people|Khitan_People| , before being conquered by the  |Mongols|Mongol_Empire|  in the 13th century; subsequently it regained independence but was invaded by  |Kalmyks|Kalmyk_People| ,  |Manchus|Manchu|  and  |Uzbeks|Uzbeks| . In 1876 it became part of the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| , remaining in the  |USSR|Ussr|  as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic after the  |Russian_Revolution|Russian_Revolution| . Following  |Mikhael_Gorbachevs|Mikhael_Gorbachev|  democratic reforms in the USSR, in 1990 pro-independence candidate  |Askar_Akayev|Askar_Akayev|  was elected president of the SSR. On 31 August 1991, Kyrgyzstan declared independence from Moscow, and a democratic government was subsequently established.       Stone implements found in the  |Tian_Shan|Tian_Shan|  mountains indicate the presence of human society in what is now  |Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan|  as many as 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. The first written records of a civilization in the area occupied by Kyrgyzstan appear in Chinese chronicles beginning about 2000 BCE.          The  |Yenisei_Kirghiz|Yenisei_Kirghiz|  lived in the upper  |Yenisey_River|Yenisey_River|  valley, central  |Siberia|Siberia| . Chinese sources of the 2nd century BCE and Muslim sources of the 7th–12th centuries CE describe the Kyrgyz as red-haired with fair complexion and green eyes. First appearing in Chinese  Records of the Grand Historian  as Gekun or  Jiankun  , and later as part of the  |Tiele|Tiele_People|  tribes, they came under the rule of the  |Göktürks|Göktürks|  and  |Uyghurs|Uyghur_People| . Later  |Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan|  it was part of the  |Kushan_empire|Kushan_Empire|  during Buddhism.   The early Kyrgyz state reached its greatest expansion after defeating the  |Uyghur_Khaganate|Uyghur_Khaganate|  in 840 CE. Then Kyrgyz quickly moved as far as the  |Tian_Shan|Tian_Shan|  range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years. In the 12th century, however, the Kyrgyz domination had shrunk to the  |Altay|Altay_Mountains|  Range and the  |Sayan_Mountains|Sayan_Mountains|  as a result of the rising  |Mongol|Mongol|  expansion. With the rise of the  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire|  in the 13th century, the Kyrgyz migrated south.  |Plano_Carpin|Giovanni_Da_Pian_Del_Carpine| , an envoy of the  |Papal_states|Papal_States| , and  |William_Rubruck|William_Rubruck| , an envoy of  |France|France| , all wrote about their life under the Mongols. Various  |Turkic_peoples|Turkic_Peoples|  ruled them until 1685, when they came under the control of the  |Oirats|Oirats|  .     63% of the modern Kyrgyz men carry  |Haplogroup_R1a1|Haplogroup_R1A1| , comparable to the prevalence of the haplogroup among the  |Tajiks|Tājik_People|  .     |inting_circa_1589-|Inting_Circa_1589-| including Kyrgyzstan突厥 tú juéd.  552KarakhojaKumulthe  |Karluks|Karluks| or the  |Karakhanids|Karakhanids| Traditional Chinese: 西遼; Simplified Chinese: 西辽; pinyin: Xī Liáo, 1124–1218耶律大石 |15–12|15–12| The term Kara-Kyrgyz was used until the mid-1920s by the Russians to distinguish them from the Kazakhs, who were also referred to as Kyrgyz. |26–19|26–19| SSRCPSUCISand, to a certain extent, to create from scratch75% of voteout of six |OSCE|Organization_For_Security_And_Co-Operation_In_Europe| International Herald Tribune |298284|298284| |rgyzst|Rgyzst| |rgyzst|Rgyzst| GKNB.
