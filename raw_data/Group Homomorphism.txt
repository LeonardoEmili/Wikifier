     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , given two  |groups|Group| ,  and , a group homomorphism from  to  is a  |function|Function|  h : G → H such that for all u and v in G it holds that   : h h   h     where the group operation on the left hand side of the equation is that of G and on the right hand side that of H.     From this property, one can deduce that h maps the  |identity_element|Identity_Element|  e G  of G to the identity element e H  of H,   : h eH     and it also maps inverses to inverses in the sense that   : h  h.       Hence one can say that h is compatible with the group structure .     Older notations for the homomorphism h may be x h or x h , though this may be confused as an index or a general subscript. A more recent trend is to write group homomorphisms on the right of their arguments, omitting brackets, so that h becomes simply x h. This approach is especially prevalent in areas of group theory where  |automata|Automata_Theory|  play a role, since it accords better with the convention that automata read words from left to right.     In areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a homomorphism sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure but also the extra structure. For example, a homomorphism of  |topological_groups|Topological_Group|  is often required to be continuous.       The purpose of defining a group homomorphism is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. An equivalent definition of group homomorphism is: The function h : G → H is a group homomorphism if whenever     a ∗ b c   we have   h ⋅ h h.     In other words, the group H in some sense has a similar algebraic structure as G and the homomorphism h preserves that.       ; |Monomorphism|Monomorphism| |injective|Injective_Function|  ; i.e., preserves distinctness.   ; |Epimorphism|Epimorphism| |surjective|Surjective_Function|  ; i.e., reaches every point in the codomain.   ; |Isomorphism|Group_Isomorphism| |bijective|Bijection| ; i.e., injective and surjective. Its inverse is also a group homomorphism. In this case, the groups G and H are called isomorphic; they differ only in the notation of their elements and are identical for all practical purposes.   ; |Endomorphism|Endomorphism| hG → G; the domain and codomain are the same. Also called an endomorphism of G.   ; |Automorphism|Automorphism| |automorphisms|Automorphism|  of a group G, with functional composition as operation, forms itself a group, the automorphism group of G. It is denoted by Aut. As an example, the automorphism group of  contains only two elements, the identity transformation and multiplication with −1; it is isomorphic to Z/2Z.          We define the  kernel of h to be the set of elements in G which are mapped to the identity in H   :           and the  image of h to be   :     h         The kernel and image of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. The  |first_isomorphism_theorem|Isomorphism_Theorem|  states that the image of a group homomorphism, h is isomorphic to the quotient group G/ker h.     The kernel of h is a  |normal_subgroup|Normal_Subgroup|  of G and the image of h is a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of H, the homomorphism, h, is a  |group_monomorphism|Monomorphism| ; i.e., h is injective . Injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and a unique element in the kernel gives injection:   :     & & h & h       & & h   h & eH       & & h  & eH,            & & g1   g2 & eG       & & g1 & g2           Consider the  |cyclic_group|Cyclic_Group|  Z/3Z and the group of integers Z with addition. The map h : Z → Z/3Z with h u  |mod|Modular_Arithmetic|  3 is a group homomorphism. It is  |surjective|Surjective|  and its kernel consists of all integers which are divisible by 3.
