   Neptunium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Np and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  93. A  |radioactive|Radioactivity| |actinide|Actinide|  metal, neptunium is the first  |transuranic_element|Transuranic_Element| . Its position in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  just after  |uranium|Uranium| , named after the planet  |Uranus|Uranus| , led to it being named after  |Neptune|Neptune| , the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93  |protons|Proton|  and 93 electrons, of which seven are  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron| . Neptunium metal is silvery and  |tarnish|Tarnish| es when exposed to air. The element occurs in three  |allotropic|Allotrope|  forms and it normally exhibits five  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State| , ranging from +3 to +7. It is  |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| ,  |poisonous|Radiation_Poisoning| ,  |pyrophoric|Pyrophoricity| , and capable of accumulating in  |bones|Bone| , which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.     Although many false claims of its discovery were made over the years, the element was first synthesized by  |Edwin_McMillan|Edwin_Mcmillan|  and  |Philip_H._Abelson|Philip_H._Abelson|  at the  |Berkeley_Radiation_Laboratory|Berkeley_Radiation_Laboratory|  in 1940.  Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by  |neutron_irradiation|Neutron_Irradiation|  of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional  |nuclear_power|Nuclear_Power|  reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it is used as a precursor for the formation of  |plutonium-238|Plutonium-238| , used in  |radioisotope_thermal_generators|Radioisotope_Thermal_Generator|  to provide electricity for  |spacecraft|Spacecraft| . Neptunium has also been used in  |detectors|Neutron_Detector|  of high-energy  |neutrons|Neutron| .     The longest-lived  |isotope|Isotope|  of neptunium, neptunium-237, is a by-product of  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor|  and  |plutonium|Plutonium|  production. It, and the isotope neptunium-239, are also found in trace amounts in  |uranium|Uranium|  ores due to  |neutron_capture_reactions|Neutron_Capture|  and  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| .    TOC           Neptunium is a  |hard|Hardness| , silvery,  |ductile|Ductility| ,  |radioactive|Radioactivity|  actinide  |metal|Metal| . In the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , it is located to the right of the actinide  |uranium|Uranium| , to the left of the actinide  |plutonium|Plutonium|  and below the  |lanthanide|Lanthanide| |promethium|Promethium| . Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118   |GPa|Pascal| , comparable to that of  |manganese|Manganese| .  Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3  °C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium , is due to the  |hybridization|Orbital_Hybridization|  of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174  °C is extrapolated from the  |vapor_pressure|Vapor_Pressure|  of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element .     Neptunium is found in at least three  |allotropes|Allotrope| . Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven. Yoshida et al., p. 718. This multiplicity of allotropes is common among the actinides. The  |crystal_structures|Crystal_Structure|  of neptunium,  |protactinium|Protactinium| , uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d   |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| .              α-neptunium takes on an  |orthorhombic|Orthorhombic|  structure, resembling a highly distorted body-centered cubic structure. Lemire, R. J. et al.,Chemical Thermodynamics of Neptunium and Plutonium, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2001.  Each neptunium atom is coordinated to four others and the Np–Np bond lengths are 260  pm. Yoshida et al., p. 719. It is the densest of all the actinides and the fifth-densest of all naturally occurring elements, behind only  |rhenium|Rhenium| ,  |platinum|Platinum| ,  |iridium|Iridium| , and  |osmium|Osmium| . Theodore Gray. The Elements. Page 215. α-neptunium has  |semimetal|Semimetal| lic properties, such as strong  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond| ing and a high  |electrical_resistivity|Electrical_Resistivity_And_Conductivity| , and its metallic physical properties are closer to those of the  |metalloids|Metalloid|  than the true metals. Some allotropes of the other actinides also exhibit similar behaviour, though to a lesser degree. Hindman J. C. 1968, Neptunium , in C. A. Hampel , The encyclopedia of the chemical elements, Reinhold, New York, pp. 434.  The densities of different isotopes of neptunium in the alpha phase are expected to be observably different: α- 235 Np should have density 20.303  g/cm 3 ; α- 236 Np, density 20.389  g/cm 3 ; α- 237 Np, density 20.476  g/cm 3 .      β-neptunium takes on a distorted tetragonal close-packed structure. Four atoms of neptunium make up a unit cell, and the Np–Np bond lengths are 276  pm. γ-neptunium has a  |body-centered_cubic|Body-Centered_Cubic|  structure and has Np–Np bond length of 297  pm. The γ form becomes less stable with increased pressure, though the melting point of neptunium also increases with pressure. The β-Np/γ-Np/liquid  |triple_point|Triple_Point|  occurs at 725  °C and 3200   |MPa|Pascal| .        Due to the presence of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal|  to the local moment behavior typical of  |scandium|Scandium| ,  |yttrium|Yttrium| , and the  |lanthanides|Lanthanide| . This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal  |ligands|Ligand| , and the fact that the 5f orbital is  |relativistically|Relativistic_Effects|  destabilized and extends outwards. Yoshida et al., pp. 719–20. For example, pure neptunium is  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic| , Np |Al|Aluminium|  3 is  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic| , Np |Ge|Germanium|  3 has no magnetic ordering, and Np |Sn|Tin|  3 behaves  |fermion|Fermion| ically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium,  |americium|Americium| ,  |plutonium|Plutonium| ,  |zirconium|Zirconium| , and  |iron|Iron| , so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.     One neptunium-based  |superconductor|Superconductivity|  alloy has been discovered with formula Np |Pd|Palladium|  5 Al 2 . This occurrence in neptunium compounds is somewhat surprising because they often exhibit strong magnetism, which usually destroys superconductivity. The alloy has a tetragonal structure with a superconductivity transition temperature of −268.3  °C .        Neptunium has five ionic  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  ranging from +3 to +7 when forming chemical compounds, which can be simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its valence electrons in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of  |coordination_compounds|Coordination_Compound| .        A neptunium atom has 93 electrons, arranged in the  |configuration|Electron_Configuration| |Rn|Radon|  5f 4 6d 1 7s 2 . This differs from the configuration expected by the  |Aufbau_principle|Aufbau_Principle|  in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This is because of the similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas|  radon;  more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np 3+ is  5f 4 , with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptuniums lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their  5f n electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first  |ionization_potential|Ionization_Potential|  of neptunium was measured to be at most  in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d;  more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657  eV.

All of the remaining  |radioactive|Radioactive|  isotopes have half-lives that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 50 minutes. This element also has at least four  |meta_states|Meta_State| , with the most stable being 236m Np with a half-life of 22.5 hours.  .     The isotopes of neptunium range in  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Weight|  from 219.032  |u|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  to 244.068 u , though 221 Np and 222 Np have not yet been reported. Most of the isotopes that are lighter than the most stable one, 237 Np,  |decay|Radioactive_Decay|  primarily by  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  although a sizable number, most notably 229 Np and 230 Np, also exhibit various levels of decay via  |alpha_emission|Alpha_Emission|  to become  |protactinium|Protactinium| . 237 Np itself, being the  |beta-stable_isobar|Beta-Decay_Stable_Isobars|  of mass number 237, decays almost exclusively by alpha emission into 233  |Pa|Isotopes_Of_Protactinium| , with very rare  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission|  and  |cluster_decay|Cluster_Decay|  . All of the known isotopes except one that are heavier than this decay exclusively via  |beta_emission|Beta_Emission| . The lone exception, 240m Np, exhibits a rare  ref nameunc/ sup /sup  ref name lanl  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref namecritical/  ref nameWeiss  /ref  sup /sup  ref namecritical/  ref nameWeiss/ sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  ref nameYoshida702/ sup /sup ref nameJukka  /ref  sup /sup ref nameYoshida704 /ref sup /sup  ref name Himiya neptuniya /  ref nameCRC/ ref nameemsley345347 /ref sup /sup sup /sup  ref nameYoshida704/ sup /sup  sup /sup ref nameYoshida704/ sup /sup  sup /sup ref nameYoshida704/ ref name thompson1to4  /ref ref nameNUBASE  /ref  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup ref nameYoshida704/ ref namethompson1to4/ ref  /ref sup /sup sup /sup  ref nameYoshida704/  ref namethompson1to4/ ref nameatwood4 /ref  ref namethompson1to4/ ref nameatwood4/ ref name atwood1 /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sup /sup  sup /sup  ref /ref ref /ref  ref name Fermi  /ref  ref /ref ref  /ref ref /ref  ref /ref ref /ref  ref name Koblic  /ref ref /ref ref  /ref  ref nameemsley345347/ ref name fontani  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref /ref ref /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  |up_/su|Up_/Su|  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup ref nameIkeda  /ref  ref  /ref ref /ref ref /ref  sup /sup ref name EL93 / chem  .
