Most of Steinbecks work is set in  |central_California|Central_California| , particularly in the  |Salinas_Valley|Salinas_Valley|  and the  |California_Coast_Ranges|California_Coast_Ranges|  region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or  |everyman|Everyman| |_protagonists|Protagonists|  .         Steinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in  |Salinas_California|Salinas_California| .  He was of  |German|German_American| ,  |English|English_American| , and  |Irish|Irish_American|  descent.  Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck , Steinbecks paternal grandfather, shortened the family name to Steinbeck when he immigrated to the United States. The family farm in  |Heiligenhaus|Heiligenhaus| ,  |Mettmann|Mettmann| ,  |North_Rhine_Westphalia|North_Rhine_Westphalia| , Germany, is still named Großsteinbeck.

Steinbeck lived in a small rural valley set in some of the worlds most fertile soil, about twenty-five miles from the  |Pacific_Coast|Pacific_Coast| . Both valley and coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction.  He spent his summers working on nearby ranches and later with migrant workers on  |Spreckels|Spreckels_California|  sugar beet farms. There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in  Of Mice and Men . He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms. Introduction to John Steinbeck, The Long Valley, pp. 9–10, John Timmerman, Penguin Publishing, 1995 While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write. He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned. Jackson J. Benson, The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer New York: The Viking Press, 1984. , pp. 147, 915a, 915b, 133        Steinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English Literature at  |Stanford_University|Stanford_University|  near  |Palo_Alto|Palo_Alto| , leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker at  |Lake_Tahoe|Lake_Tahoe| , where he met Carol Henning, his first wife.

When their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to  |Pacific_Grove_California|Pacific_Grove_California| , to a cottage owned by his father, on the  |Monterey_Peninsula|Monterey_Peninsula|  a few blocks outside the  |Monterey|Monterey_California|  city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing, paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crab that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market. Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends. Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbecks novel  |Cannery_Row|Cannery_Row| .     In 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist  |Ed_Ricketts|Ed_Ricketts| , who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology. Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbecks attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from  |Warder_Clyde_Allee|Warder_Clyde_Allee| , a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on  |ecology|Ecology| . Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand. Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.     Between 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbecks wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper. Steinbeck helped on an informal basis. Jackson J.

It centers on Morgans assault and sacking of the city of  |Panama|Panama| , sometimes referred to as the Cup of Gold, and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there.     Between 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works.  The Pastures of Heaven , published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish  |corporal|Corporal|  while chasing runaway  |Indian|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published  The Red Pony , a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbecks childhood.  To a God Unknown , named after a  |Vedic|Vedic|  hymn, follows the life of a  |homesteader|Homestead_Act|  and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works. Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.     Steinbeck achieved his first critical success with  Tortilla Flat  , a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California  |Commonwealth_Clubs|Commonwealth_Club_Of_California|  Gold Medal. It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , just before U.S.  |prohibition|Prohibition_In_The_United_States| . They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of  |King_Arthurs_Knights_of_the_Round_Table|Round_Table| . It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression.   Tortilla Flat was adapted as a  |1942_film_of_the_same_name|Tortilla_Flat| , starring  |Spencer_Tracy|Spencer_Tracy| ,  |Hedy_Lamarr|Hedy_Lamarr|  and  |John_Garfield|John_Garfield| , a friend of Steinbeck. With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in  |Los_Gatos|Los_Gatos| .     Steinbeck began to write a series of California novels and  |Dust_Bowl|Dust_Bowl|  fiction, set among common people during the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| . These included  In Dubious Battle ,  Of Mice and Men  and  The Grapes of Wrath . He also wrote an article series called  The Harvest Gypsies  for the San Francisco News about the plight of the migrant worker.     Of Mice and Men was a  |drama|Drama|  about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. It was critically acclaimed and Steinbecks 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a little masterpiece .   Its stage production was a hit, starring  |Wallace_Ford|Wallace_Ford|  as George and  |Broderick_Crawford|Broderick_Crawford|  as Georges companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director  |George_S_Kaufman|George_S_Kaufman|  that the play as it existed in his own mind was perfect and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays .     Of Mice and Men was also adapted as a  |1939_Hollywood_film|Of_Mice_And_Men| , with  |Lon_Chaney_Jr_|Lon_Chaney_Jr_|  as Lennie and  |Burgess_Meredith|Burgess_Meredith|  as George.  Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades. Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie.          Steinbeck followed this wave of success with  The Grapes of Wrath  , based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to The New York Times, it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the  |National_Book_Award|List_Of_National_Book_Award_Winners1935_To_1941| , favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the  |American_Booksellers_Association|American_Booksellers_Association| . 1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Grosecloses Ararat is Picked as Work Which Failed to Get Due Recognition , The New York Times, February 14, 1940, p. 25.

It is completely out of hand; I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.      The film versions of The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men were in production simultaneously, allowing Steinbeck to spend a full day on the set of The Grapes of Wrath and the next day on the set of Of Mice and Men.       In the 1930s and 1940s,  |Ed_Ricketts|Ed_Ricketts|  strongly influenced Steinbecks writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their joint book about a collecting expedition to the  |Gulf_of_California|Gulf_Of_California|  in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well.  However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as  The Log from the Sea of Cortez , under his name only . This work remains in print today.   Retrieved July 6, 2009.     Although Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book.

Steinbecks close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol. Ricketts biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that, except for  East of Eden  , Steinbecks writing declined after Ricketts untimely death in 1948.

Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary  Once There Was a War  .     Steinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from  |shrapnel|Shrapnel|  and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing.

The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him. The book has a very different tone from Steinbecks amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row. It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel, but were disappointed that it was not another Grapes of Wrath. Cynthia Burkhead, The students companion to John Steinbeck, Greenwood Press, 2002, p. 24    In the Nobel Prize presentation speech next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.     Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.         In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception. The selection was heavily criticized, and described as one of the Academys biggest mistakes in one Swedish newspaper.  The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising , noting that e international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age . Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: Frankly, no. Biographer Jackson Benson notes, is honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into the main currents of American writing as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value. In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:          Fifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a compromise choice among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors  |Robert_Graves|Robert_Graves|  and  |Lawrence_Durrell|Lawrence_Durrell| , French dramatist  |Jean_Anouilh|Jean_Anouilh|  and Danish author  |Karen_Blixen|Karen_Blixen| . The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot. There arent any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation, wrote committee member  |Henry_Olsson|Henry_Olsson| . Although the committee believed Steinbecks best work was behind him by 1962, committee member  |Anders_Österling|Anders_Österling|  believed the release of his novel  The Winter of Our Discontent  showed that after some signs of slowing down in recent years, regained his position as a social truth-teller authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.     Although modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist  |Al_Capp|Al_Capp| , creator of the satirical  Lil Abner , possibly the best writer in the world today. . animationarchive.org .
