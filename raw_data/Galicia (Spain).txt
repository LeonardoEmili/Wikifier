         Galicia  is an  |autonomous_community|Autonomous_Communities_Of_Spain|  of  |Spain|Spain|  and  |historic_nationality|Nationalities_And_Regions_Of_Spain|  under Spanish law. Galicia, a historic nationality, constitutes itself as an autonomous community for accessing to its self-government , Galicia, nacionalidade histórica, constitúese en Comunidade Autónoma para acceder ó seu autogoberno  |Statute_of_Autonomy_of_Galicia|Galician_Statute_Of_Autonomy_Of_1981| , 1. Located in the northwest  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula| , it includes the  |provinces|Provinces_Of_Spain|  of  |A_Coruña|A_Coruña| ,  |Lugo|Lugo| ,  |Ourense|Ourense|  and  |Pontevedra|Pontevedra| .     Galicia is bordered by  |Portugal|Portugal|  to the south, the Spanish autonomous communities of  |Castile_and_León|Castile_And_León|  and  |Asturias|Asturias|  to the east, the  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean|  to the west, and the  |Cantabrian_Sea|Cantabrian_Sea|  to the north. It had a population of 2,701,743 in 2018 and a total area of . Galicia has over  of coastline,  including its offshore islands and islets, among them  |Cíes_Islands|Cíes_Islands| ,  |Ons|Ons_Island| ,  |Sálvora|Sálvora| ,  |Cortegada|Cortegada| , and the largest and most populated,  |A_Illa_de_Arousa|A_Illa_De_Arousa| .     The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the  |Middle_Paleolithic|Middle_Paleolithic|  period, and takes its name from the  |Gallaeci|Gallaeci| , the  |Celtic_people|Celts|  living north of the  |Douro|Douro|  River during the last millennium BC. Galicia was incorporated into the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  at the end of the  |Cantabrian_Wars|Cantabrian_Wars|  in 19 BC, and was made a  |Roman_province|Roman_Province|  in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic  |Suebi|Suebi|  established a  |kingdom|Kingdom_Of_The_Suebi|  with its capital in  |Braga|Braga| ; this kingdom was incorporated into that of the  |Visigoths|Visigoths|  in 585. In 711, the  |Islamic|Islamic| |Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad_Caliphate|  invaded the Iberian Peninsula conquering the  |Visigoth_kingdom_of_Hispania|Visigothic_Kingdom|  by 718,  but soon Galicia was incorporated into the Christian  |kingdom_of_Asturias|Kingdom_Of_Asturias|  by 740. During the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , the  |kingdom_of_Galicia|Kingdom_Of_Galicia|  was occasionally ruled  |by_its_own_kings|Kings_Of_Galicia| ,  but most of the time it was leagued to the  |kingdom_of_Leon|Kingdom_Of_Leon|  and later to that of  |Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile| , while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an  Adiantado-mór , whose attributions passed to the  Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the  Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or  Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia .  This institution was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the culture of Galicia. This resulted in the  |Statute_of_Autonomy_of_1936|Galician_Statute_Of_Autonomy| , soon frustrated by Francos coup detat and subsequent long dictatorship. After democracy was restored the legislature passed the  |Statute_of_Autonomy_of_1981|Galician_Statute_Of_Autonomy_Of_1981| , approved in referendum and currently in force, providing Galicia with self-government.     The interior of Galicia is characterized by a hilly landscape; mountain ranges rise to  in the east and south. The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of  rías  and cliffs. The climate of Galicia is usually temperate and rainy, with markedly drier summers; it is usually classified as  |Oceanic|Oceanic_Climate| . Its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of Galicias wealth for most of its history, allowing for a relative high density of population. Galicia had a population of 1,345,803 inhabitants in 1787, some 44 inhabitants per square kilometer, out of a total of 9,307,804 in metropolitan Spain. Cf.  With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was based on a farming and fishing economy until after the mid-20th century, when it began to industrialize. In 2018, the  |nominal_gross_domestic_product|Nominal_Gross_Domestic_Product|  was €62,900  million,  with a nominal  |GDP_per_capita|Gdp_Per_Capita|  of €23,300. Galicia is characterised, unlike other Spanish regions, by the absence of a metropolis dominating the territory. Indeed, the urban network is made up of 7 main cities  and other small towns. The population is largely concentrated in two main areas: from  |Ferrol|Ferrol,_Spain|  to  |A_Coruña|A_Coruña|  in the northern coast, and in the  |Rías_Baixas|Rías_Baixas|  region in the southwest, including the cities of  |Vigo|Vigo| ,  |Pontevedra|Pontevedra| , and the interior city of  |Santiago_de_Compostela|Santiago_De_Compostela| . There are smaller populations around the interior cities of  |Lugo|Lugo|  and  |Ourense|Ourense| . The political capital is Santiago de Compostela, in the province of A Coruña.  |A_Coruña|A_Coruña|  is the largest city with 213,418 while Vigo, in the province of  |Pontevedra|Pontevedra| , is the largest municipality, with 292,817 .  |INE|Instituto_Nacional_De_Estadística|  2013     Two languages are official and widely used today in Galicia: the native  |Galician|Galician_Language| , a  |Romance_language|Romance_Language|  closely related to  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  with which it shares the  |Galician-Portuguese|Galician-Portuguese|  medieval literature; and  |Spanish|Spanish_Language| , usually known locally as Castilian. While most Galicians are bilingual, a 2013 survey reported that 51% of the Galician population spoke Galician most often on a day-to-day basis, while 48% most often used Spanish.                 The name Galicia derives from the Latin toponym Callaecia, later  Gallaecia , related to the name of an ancient Celtic tribe that resided north of the  |Douro|Douro|  river, the  |Gallaeci_or_Callaeci|Gallaeci|  in  |Latin|Latin| , or   in  |Greek|Ancient_Greek| .  These  Callaeci  were the first tribe in the area to help the  |Lusitanians|Lusitanians|  against the invading Romans. The Romans applied their name to all the other tribes in the northwest who spoke the  |same_language|Gallaecian_Language|  and lived the same life.

Parsons and Patrick Sims-Williams editors.     The etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors such as  |Isidore_of_Seville|Isidore_Of_Seville| , who wrote that Galicians are called so, because of their fair skin, as the Gauls , relating the name to the Greek word for milk. In the 21st century, some scholars have derived the name of the ancient Callaeci either from  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European| |suffix|Suffix|  -aik-, so meaning the hill ; or either from  |Proto-Celtic|Proto-Celtic|  . CUADERNOS DE ESTUDIOS GALLEGOS LV : 111. In any case, Galicia, being per se a derivation of the ethnic name Kallaikói, means the land of the Galicians.     The most recent proposal comes from linguist  |Francesco_Benozzo|Francesco_Benozzo|  after identifying the root gall- / kall- in a number of Celtic words with the meaning stone or rock , as follows: gall , gal , gailleichan , kailhoù , galagh and gall . Hence, Benozzo explains the ethnonym Callaeci as being the stone people or the people of the stone , in reference to the builders of the ancient  |megaliths|Megalith|  and stone formations so common in Galicia.

The name evolved during the Middle Ages from Gallaecia, sometimes written Galletia, to Gallicia. In the 13th century, with the written emergence of the Galician language, Galiza became the most usual written form of the name of the country, being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form, Galicia. This coincides with the spelling of the  |Castilian_Spanish|Castilian_Spanish|  name. The historical denomination Galiza became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three-quarters of the 20th century, and is still used with some frequency today. The  |Xunta_de_Galicia|Xunta_De_Galicia| , the local  |devolved_government|Devolved_Government| , uses Galicia. The  |Royal_Galician_Academy|Royal_Galician_Academy| , the institution responsible for regulating the Galician language, whilst recognizing Galiza as a legitimate current denomination, has stated that the only official name of the country is Galicia.                     The oldest attestation of human presence in Galicia has been found in the Eirós Cave, in the municipality of  |Triacastela|Triacastela| , which has preserved animal remains and  |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  stone objects from the  |Middle_Paleolithic|Middle_Paleolithic| . The earliest culture to have left significant architectural traces is the  |Megalithic|Megalithic|  culture, which expanded along the western European coasts during the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  and  |Calcolithic|Calcolithic|  eras. Thousands of Megalithic  |tumuli|Tumulus|  are distributed throughout the country, but mostly along the coastal areas. Antonio de la Peña Santos,  , ; soldiers who had not joined the rebellion, such as Generals  |Rogelio_Caridad_Pita|Rogelio_Caridad_Pita|  and  |Enrique_Salcedo_Molinuevo|Enrique_Salcedo_Molinuevo|  and Admiral  |Antonio_Azarola|Antonio_Azarola| ; and the founders of the PG,  |Alexandre_Bóveda|Alexandre_Bóveda|  and  |Víctor_Casas|Víctor_Casas| ,  as well as other professionals akin to republicans and nationalists, as the journalist  |Manuel_Lustres_Rivas|Manuel_Lustres_Rivas|  or physician  |Luis_Poza_Pastrana|Luis_Poza_Pastrana| . Many others were forced to escape into exile, or were victims of other reprisals and removed from their jobs and positions.   General  |Francisco_Franco|Francisco_Franco|  – himself a Galician from  |Ferrol|Ferrol,_Spain|  – ruled as dictator from the civil war until his death in 1975. Francos centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language, including the use of Galician names for newborns, although its everyday oral use was not forbidden. Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by  |José_Castro_Veiga|José_Castro_Veiga|  and  |Benigno_Andrade|Benigno_Andrade|  , both of whom were ultimately captured and executed.   In the 1960s, ministers such as  |Manuel_Fraga_Iribarne|Manuel_Fraga_Iribarne|  introduced some reforms allowing  |technocrats|Technocrat|  affiliated with  |Opus_Dei|Opus_Dei|  to modernize administration in a way that facilitated  |capitalist|Capitalism|  economic development. However, for decades Galicia was largely confined to the role of a supplier of raw materials and energy to the rest of Spain, causing environmental havoc and leading to a wave of migration to  |Venezuela|Venezuela|  and to various parts of Europe.  |Fenosa|Unión_Fenosa| , the monopolistic supplier of electricity, built hydroelectric dams, flooding many Galician river valleys.      The Galician economy finally began to modernize with a  |Citroën|Citroën|  factory in Vigo, the modernization of the canning industry and the fishing fleet, and eventually a modernization of small peasant farming practices, especially in the production of cows milk. In the province of Ourense, businessman and politician  |Eulogio_Gómez_Franqueira|Eulogio_Gómez_Franqueira|  gave impetus to the raising of livestock and poultry by establishing the  |Cooperativa_Orensana_S.A.|Cooperativa_Orensana_S.A.|  .     During the last decade of Francos rule, there was a renewal of nationalist feeling in Galicia. The early 1970s were a time of unrest among university students, workers, and farmers. In 1972, general strikes in Vigo and Ferrol cost the lives of Amador Rey and Daniel Niebla.  Later, the bishop of  |Mondoñedo|Mondoñedo| - |Ferrol|Ferrol,_Spain| ,  |Miguel_Anxo_Araúxo_Iglesias|Miguel_Anxo_Araúxo_Iglesias| , wrote a pastoral letter that was not well received by the Franco regime, about a demonstration in  |Bazán|Navantia|  where two workers died.      As part of the  |transition_to_democracy|Spanish_Transition_To_Democracy|  upon the death of Franco in 1975, Galicia regained its status as an autonomous region within Spain with the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, which begins, Galicia, historical nationality, is constituted as an Autonomous Community to access to its self-government, in agreement with the  |Spanish_Constitution|Spanish_Constitution|  and with the present Statute . Varying degrees of  |nationalist|Nationalisms_And_Regionalisms_Of_Spain|  or independentist sentiment are evident at the political level. The  Bloque Nacionalista Galego  or BNG, is a conglomerate of  |left-wing|Left-Wing|  parties and individuals that claims Galician political status as a nation.        From 1990 to 2005, Manuel Fraga, former minister and ambassador in the Franco dictature, presided over the Galician autonomous government, the  |Xunta_de_Galicia|Xunta_De_Galicia| . Fraga was associated with the  Partido Popular   since its founding. In 2002, when the oil tanker  |Prestige|Prestige|  sank and covered the Galician coast in oil, Fraga was accused by the grassroots movement  Nunca Mais  of having been unwilling to react. In the 2005 Galician elections, the Peoples Party lost its absolute majority, though remaining the largest party in the parliament, with 43% of the total votes. As a result, power passed to a coalition of the  Partido dos Socialistas de Galicia  , a federal sister-party of Spains main social-democratic party, the  Partido Socialista Obrero Español  and the nationalist  Bloque Nacionalista Galego  . As the senior partner in the new coalition, the PSdeG nominated its leader,  |Emilio_Perez_Touriño|Emilio_Perez_Touriño| , to serve as Galicias new president, with  |Anxo_Quintana|Anxo_Quintana| , the leader of BNG, as its vice president.     In 2009, the PSdG-BNG coalition lost the elections and the government went back to the Peoples Party , even though the PSdG-BNG coalition actually obtained the most votes.  |Alberto_Núñez_Feijóo|Alberto_Núñez_Feijóo|  is now Galicias president.     In 2012 several parties and individuals abandoned the BNG.   |Encontro_Irmandiño|Encontro_Irmandiño|  abandoned the bloc  and joined with  |Fronte_Obreira_Galega|Galician_Workers_Front| , the  |FPG|Galician_Peoples_Front| ,  |Movemento_pola_Base|Movemento_Pola_Base|  and other collectives to form  |Anova-Nationalist_Brotherhood|Anova-Nationalist_Brotherhood| .  Anova obtained 9 seats in the  |2012_Galician_election|Galician_Parliamentary_Election,_2012|  as part of the  |Galician_Left_Alternative|Galician_Left_Alternative|  coalition. BNG obtained 7 seats and PPdG won the elections again.             Galicia has a surface area of . , Xunta de Galicia, Consellaría de Cultura e Deporte.
