      The exabyte is a multiple of the unit  |byte|Byte|  for  |digital_information|Computer_Data_Storage| . In the  |International_System_of_Units|International_System_Of_Units|  , the  |prefix|Si_Prefix|   exa  indicates multiplication by the sixth power of 1000 . Therefore, one exabyte is one  |quintillion|Quintillion| |bytes|Byte|  . The unit symbol for the exabyte is EB.     : 1 EB    1000   |petabytes|Petabyte|   .   : 1000 EB 1  |zettabyte|Zettabyte|      A related unit, the  |exbibyte|Exbibyte| , using a  |binary_prefix|Binary_Prefix| , is equal to  , about 15% larger.       A processor with a  |64-bit|64-Bit_Computing|  address bus can  |address|Address_Space|  16  |exbibytes|Exbibyte|  of memory,  which is over 18  exabytes.   The worlds technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 exabytes in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 exabytes in 2007. This is equivalent to less than one  |CD|Compact_Disc|  per person in 1986 , roughly four in 1993, 12 in 2000, and almost 61 in 2007. Piling up the imagined 404 billion CDs from 2007 would create a stack from the  |Earth|Earth|  to the  |Moon|Moon|  and a quarter of this distance beyond .  See also:    The worlds technological capacity to receive information through one-way  |broadcast|Broadcast|  networks was 432  exabytes of information in 1986, 715 exabytes in 1993, 1,200 exabytes in 2000, and 1,900 in 2007 .   The worlds effective capacity to exchange information through two-way  |telecommunication|Telecommunication|  networks was 0.281  exabytes of information in 1986, 0.471 in 1993, 2.2 in 2000, and 65 exabytes in 2007 .   In 2004, the global monthly  |Internet_traffic|Internet_Traffic|  passed 1  exabyte for the first time. In January 2007, Bret Swanson of the  |Discovery_Institute|Discovery_Institute|  coined the term exaflood for a supposedly impending flood of exabytes that would cause the Internets  |congestive_collapse|Congestive_Collapse| .   Nevertheless, the global Internet traffic has continued its  |exponential_growth|Exponential_Growth| , undisturbed, and , it was estimated at 21  exabytes per month.    The global data volume at the end of 2009 had reached 800  exabytes.  |International_Data_Corporation|International_Data_Corporation|  paper sponsored by  |EMC_Corporation|Dell_Emc| , 161  exabytes of data were created in 2006, 3 million times the amount of information contained in all the books ever written , with the number expected to hit 988  exabytes in 2010.      A gram of  |DNA|Dna|  can theoretically hold 455 exabytes.    In 2014,  |DARPAs|Darpa| |ARGUS-IS|Argus-Is| |surveillance_system|Surveillance_System|  could stream 1 exabyte of  |high-definition_video|High-Definition_Video|  per day.    According to the  |CSIRO|Csiro| , in the next decade,  |astronomers|Astronomer|  expect to be processing 10  |petabytes|Petabytes|  of data every hour from the  |Square_Kilometre_Array|Square_Kilometre_Array|  telescope.  The array is thus expected to generate approximately one exabyte every four days of operation. According to  |IBM|Ibm| , the new SKA telescope initiative will generate over an exabyte of data every day. IBM is designing hardware to process this information.    According to the Digital Britain Report, 494  exabytes of data was transferred across the globe on June 15, 2009.    Several filesystems use disk formats that support theoretical volume sizes of several exabytes, including  |Btrfs|Btrfs| ,  |XFS|Xfs| ,  |ZFS|Zfs| ,  |exFAT|Exfat| ,  |NTFS|Ntfs| ,  |HFS_Plus|Hfs_Plus| , and  |ReFS|Refs| .   The  |ext4|Ext4|  file system format supports volumes up to 1.1529215  exabytes in size, although the  |userspace|Userspace|  tools cannot yet administer such  |filesystems|Filesystem| .    |Oracle_Corporation|Oracle_Corporation|  claimed the first exabyte tape library with the SL8500 and the T10000C  |tape_drive|Tape_Drive|  in January 2011.        Allegedly, all words ever spoken by human beings could be stored in approximately 5 exabytes of data.    This claim often cites a project at the  |UC_Berkeley_School_of_Information|Uc_Berkeley_School_Of_Information|  in support .  The 2003  |University_of_California,_Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley| , report credits the estimate to the website of  |Caltech|Caltech|  researcher Roy Williams, where the statement can be found as early as May 1999.  This statement has been criticized.    |Mark_Liberman|Mark_Liberman|  calculated the storage requirements for all human speech at 42  |zettabytes|Zettabyte|  if digitized as 16  kHz 16-bit audio, although he did freely confess that maybe the authors were thinking about text .      Earlier studies from the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that by the end of 1999, the sum of human-produced information was about 12 exabytes of data.  The 2003 Berkeley report stated that in 2002 alone, telephone calls worldwide on both  |landlines|Landline|  and mobile phones contained 17.3 exabytes of new information if stored in digital form and that it would take 9.25 exabytes of storage to hold all U.S. calls each year .  |International_Data_Corporation|International_Data_Corporation|  estimates that approximately 160 exabytes of digital information were created, captured, and replicated worldwide in 2006.  Research from the  |University_of_Southern_California|University_Of_Southern_California|  estimates that the amount of data stored in the world by 2007 was 295 exabytes and the amount of information shared on two-way communications technology, such as cell phones, in 2007 as 65 exabytes.         The content of the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress|  is commonly estimated to hold 10  terabytes of data in all printed material. Recent estimates of the size including audio, video, and digital materials start at 3  petabytes  to 20  petabytes. Therefore, one exabyte could hold a hundred thousand times the printed material or 50 to 300 times all the content of the Library of Congress.       In 2013,  |Randall_Munroe|Randall_Munroe|  compiled published assertions about  |Googles|Google|  data centers, and estimated that the company has about 10  exabytes stored on disk, and additionally approximately 5  exabytes on tape backup.  The company has not commented on Munroes estimate.
