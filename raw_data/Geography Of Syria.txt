 Syria  is located in  |Western_Asia|Western_Asia| , north of the  |Arabian_Peninsula|Arabian_Peninsula| , at the eastern end of the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea| . It is bordered by  |Turkey|Turkey|  to the north,  |Lebanon|Lebanon|  and  |Israel|Israel|  to the west and southwest,  |Iraq|Iraq|  to the east, and  |Jordan|Jordan|  to the south. It consists of mountain ranges in the west and a steep area inland. In the east is the  |Syrian_Desert|Syrian_Desert|  and in the south is the  |Jabal_al_Druze_Range|Jabal_Al_Druze| . The former is bisected by the  |Euphrates|Euphrates|  valley. A  |dam|Dam|  built in 1973 on the Euphrates created a reservoir named  |Lake_Assad|Lake_Assad| , the largest lake in Syria. The highest point in Syria is  |Mount_Hermon|Mount_Hermon|   on the Lebanese border. Between the humid Mediterranean coast and the arid desert regions lies a semiarid steep zone extending across three-quarters of the country, which receives hot, dry winds blowing across the desert. Syria is extensively depleted, with 28 percent of the land arable, 4 percent dedicated to permanent crops, 46 percent utilized as meadows and pastures, and only 3 percent forest and woodland.     Syria is divided into fourteen  |governorates|Governorate| , or muhafazat . The governorates are divided into a total of sixty districts, or manatiq , which are further divided into sub-districts, or nawahi . The capital  |Damascus|Damascus|  is the second largest city in Syria, and the metropolitan area is a  |governorate|Damascus_Governorate|  on its own.  |Aleppo|Aleppo|  in northern Syria is the largest city.  |Latakia|Latakia|  along with  |Tartus|Tartus|  are Syrias main ports on the Mediterranean Sea.            The area includes about 185,180 square kilometers of deserts, plains, and mountains. It is divided into a coastal zone—with a narrow, double mountain belt enclosing a  |depression|Depression|  in the west—and a much larger eastern  |plateau|Plateau| . The climate is predominantly dry; about three-fifths of the country has less than  of rain a year. Fertile land is the states most important natural resource, and efforts have been made to increase the amount of  |arable_land|Arable_Land|  through irrigation projects.       Along the Mediterranean, a narrow coastal plain stretches south from the Turkish border to Lebanon. The flatness of this  |littoral|Littoral| , covered with  |sand_dunes|Sand_Dune| , is broken only by lateral  |promontories|Promontory|  running down from the mountains to the sea. The major ports are  |Latakia|Latakia|  and  |Tartous|Tartous| . Syria claimed a territorial limit of  off its Mediterranean coastline. However, in 2003, Syria unilaterally declared its maritime zones, adhering to the 12 nautical miles allowed by the United Nations Law of the Sea.            The  |Jabal_an_Nusayriyah|Al_Ansariyah_Mountains| , a mountain range paralleling the coastal plain, has an average elevation of just over 1,212 meters above sea level; the highest peak, Nabi Yunis, is about 1,575 meters above sea level. The western slopes catch moisture-laden western sea winds and are thus more fertile and more heavily populated than the eastern slopes, which receive only hot, dry winds blowing across the desert. Before reaching the Lebanese border and the  |Anti_Lebanon|Anti_Lebanon|  Mountains, the Jabal an Nusayriyah range terminates, leaving a corridor  the  |Homs_Gap|Homs_Gap|   through which run the highway and railroad from  |Homs|Homs|  to the Lebanese port of  |Tripoli|Tripoli_Lebanon| . For centuries the Homs Gap has been a favorite trade and invasion route from the coast to the countrys interior and to other parts of Asia. Eastward, the line of  |al_Ansariyah_mountains|Al_Ansariyah_Mountains|  is separated from the Jabal az Zawiyah range and the plateau region by the Al  |Ghab_valley|Ghab_Valley| , a fertile, irrigated trench crossed by the meandering  |Orontes_River|Orontes_River| .      Inland and farther south, the  |Anti_Lebanon_Mountains|Anti_Lebanon_Mountains|  rise to peaks of over 2,700 meters above sea level on the Syrian-Lebanese frontier and spread in spurs eastward toward the plateau region. The eastern slopes have little rainfall and vegetation and merge eventually with the desert.      In the southwest, the lofty  |Mount_Hermon|Mount_Hermon|  , also on the border between Syria and Lebanon, descends to the  |Hawran|Hawran|  Plateau that receives rain-bearing winds from the Mediterranean. All but the lowest slopes of Mount Hermon are uninhabited, however. Volcanic cones, some of which reach over 900 meters, intersperse the open, rolling, once-fertile Hawran Plateau south of Damascus and east of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Southwest of the Hawran lies the high volcanic region of the  |Jabal_al_Druze|Jabal_Al_Druze|  range home of the countrys  |Druze|Druze|  population. This is part of the  |Harrat_ash_Shaam|Harrat_Ash_Shaam|  volcanic field that stretches all the way to Saudi Arabia. Northeast of Jabal al-Druze is a large lava field called  |Al_Safa|Al_Safa|  that stands out in satellite views.       The entire eastern plateau region is intersected by a low chain of mountains, the Jabal ar Ruwaq, the Jabal Abu Rujmayn, and the  |Jebel_Bishri|Jebel_Bishri| , extending northeastward from the Jabal Al Arab to the Euphrates. South of these mountains lies a barren desert region known as the  |Hamad|Syrian_Desert| . North of the Jabal ar Ruwaq and east of the city of Homs is another barren area known as the Homs Desert, which has a hard-packed dirt surface.     Northeast of the Euphrates, which originates in the mountains of Turkey and flows diagonally across Syria into Iraq, is the fertile  |Jazira|Al_Jazira_Mesopotamia|  region. This region is watered by two tributaries to the Euphrates, the  |Balikh|Balikh_River|  and the  |Khabur|Khabur| . The area underwent irrigation improvements during the 1960s and 1970s, and it provides substantial cereal and cotton crops. Oil and natural gas discoveries in the extreme northeastern portion of the Jazira have significantly enhanced the regions economic potential.          The countrys waterways are of vital importance to its agricultural development. The longest and most important river is the Euphrates, which represents more than 80 percent of Syrias water resources. Its main left-bank tributaries, the Balikh and the Khabur, are small perennial rivers that both rise in the Syro-Turkish border region. The right-bank tributaries of the Euphrates are mostly small seasonal streams called wadis. In 1973, Syria completed construction of the  |Tabqa_Dam|Tabqa_Dam|  on the Euphrates River upstream from the town of  |Raqqa|Raqqa| . The dam created a reservoir named  |Lake_Assad|Lake_Assad|  , a body of water about 80 kilometers long and averaging eight kilometers in width.     Throughout the arid plateau region east of Damascus, oases, streams, and a few interior rivers that empty into swamps and small lakes provide water for local irrigation. Most important of these is the  |Barada|Barada| , a river that rises in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and disappears into the desert. The Barada creates the Al Ghutah Oasis, site of Damascus. This verdant area, some 370 square kilometers, has enabled Damascus to prosper since ancient times. In the mid-1980s, the size of Al Ghutah was gradually being eroded as suburban housing and light industry from Damascus encroached on the oasis.     Areas in the Jazira have been brought under cultivation with the waters of the Khabur River . The  |Sinn|Nahr_As_Sinn| , a minor river which marks the borders between  |Tartus_Governorate|Tartus_Governorate|  and  |Latakia_Governorate|Latakia_Governorate| , is used to irrigate the area west of the Jabal an Nusayriyah, about 32 kilometers southwest of the port of Latakia. In the south the springs that feed the upper  |Yarmouk_River|Yarmouk_River|  are diverted for irrigation of the Hawran. Underground water reservoirs that are mainly natural springs are tapped for both irrigation and drinking. The richest in underground water resources is the Al Ghab region, which contains about 19 major springs and underground rivers that have a combined yield of thousands of liters per minute.          The most striking feature of the climate is the contrast. Between the humid Mediterranean coast and the arid desert regions lies a semiarid steppe zone extending across three-quarters of the country and bordered on the west by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and the Jabal an Nusayriyah, on the north by the Turkish mountain region, and on the southeast by the Jabal al Arab, Jabal ar Ruwaq, Jabal Abu Rujmayn, and the Jabal Bishri ranges.     Rainfall in this area is fairly abundant, annual precipitation ranging between . Most of the rain, carried by winds from the Mediterranean, falls between November and May. The annual mean temperatures range from  in January to  in August. Because the high ridges of the Jabal an Nusayriyah catch most of the rains from the Mediterranean, the Al Ghab depression, located east of these mountains, is in a relatively arid zone with warm, dry winds and scanty rainfall. Frost is unknown in any season, although the peaks of the Jabal an Nusayriyah are sometimes snow-covered.     Farther south, rain-bearing clouds from the Mediterranean pass through the gap between the Jabal an Nusayriyah and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, reaching the area of Homs and, sometimes, the steppe region east of that city. Still farther to the south, however, the Anti-Lebanon Mountains bar the rains from the Mediterranean, and the area, including the capital city of Damascus, becomes part of the semiarid climatic zone of the steppe, with precipitation averaging less than  a year and with temperatures from  in January to  in July and August. The vicinity of the capital is, nevertheless, verdant and cultivable because of irrigation from the Barada River by aqueducts built during Roman times.     In the southeast, the humidity decreases, and annual precipitation falls below . The scanty amounts of rain, moreover, are highly variable from year to year, causing periodic droughts. In the barren stony desert south of the Jabal ar Ruwaq, Jabal Abu Rujmayn, and Jabal Bishri ranges, temperatures in July often exceed . Sandstorms, common during February and May, damage vegetation and prevent grazing. North of the desert ranges and east of the Al Ghab depression lie the vast steppes of the plateau, where cloudless skies and high daytime temperatures prevail during the summer, but frosts, at times severe, are common from November to March. Precipitation averages  a year but falls below  in a large belt along the southern desert area. In this belt, only the Euphrates and Khabur rivers provide sufficient water for settlement and cultivation.
