     A Molokan  is a member of various  |Spiritual_Christian|Spiritual_Christianity| |sects|Sect|  that evolved from  |Eastern_Christianity|Eastern_Christianity|  in the  |East_Slavic|East_Slavs|  lands. Their traditions—especially  |dairy|Dairy_Product|  consumption during Christian fasts—did not conform to those of the  |Russian_Orthodox_Church|Russian_Orthodox_Church| , and they were regarded as heretics . The term Molokan is an  |exonym|Exonym|  used by their  |Orthodox|Russian_Orthodox_Church|  neighbors; they tend to identify themselves as Spiritual Christians .     Unlike the Protestant reformists of Western Europe, Molokans rejected conformity. There are almost as many different ways among Molokans as there are Molokans. Some built chapels for worship, kept sacraments, and revered saints and icons, while others  discarded these practices in the pursuit of  |individual_approaches_to_scripture|Sola_Scriptura| . In general, they rejected the institutionalized formalism of Orthodoxy and denominations with similar doctrines in favor of more emphasis on  |_Original_Christianity_|Origins_Of_Christianity|  as they understood it. They emphasized  |spirituality|Spirituality|  and spiritual practice; such sacramental practices as water baptism have been permitted only as tangible signs and symbols of more important spiritual truths.     Similar to  |Presbyterians|Presbyterian|  among Protestants, and considered heretical by the Orthodox Church, they elect a  |council|Presbyterian_Polity|  of dominant  |elders|Elder|  who preserve a sort of  |apostolic_succession|Apostolic_Succession| . Molokans had some practices similar to the European  |Quakers|Quakers|  and  |Mennonites|Mennonites| , such as  |pacifism|Pacifism| , communal organization, spiritual meetings, and sub-groupings. But they arose in Russia together with the  |Doukhobors|Doukhobors|  and Sabbatarians  and similar Spiritual Christian movements of  |Duhovnye_Kristyanye|Duhovnye_Kristyanye|  and Ikonobortsy. They migrated into central Russia and Ukraine around the same time.              There are approximately 200  |fasting|Fasting|  days —especially the  |Great_Fast|Great_Fast|  — when drinking milk was prohibited by Orthodox ecclesiastical authorities. Milk-drinking practice during these fasts was first sanctioned by the  |Nestorian_Church|Nestorian_Church|  in the 11th century in order to accommodate the conversion of some 200,000 Turkic Christians, who lived on meat and milk, to Nestorian Christianity.  Arriving in  |the_Rus_lands|All_Russian_Nationbackground|  with the 13th century Tatar invasion  of  |Batu|Batu_Khan|  and  |Möngke|Möngke_Khan| , the practice was adopted by other Christians, who had pastoral communities on the Eurasian plains . Turkic Molokan Pastors still use the term for an Armenian Catholic Priest .       The  |Judaizers|Judaizers|  preceded the modern day Molokans. Although they are sometimes also called Molokans , they constitute an independent movement. Their leader  |Matvei_Simyonich_Dalmatov_|Matvei_Dalmatov|  became a martyr in a monastery prison by  |wheeling|Breaking_Wheel| .       The first recorded use of the term Molokan appears in the 1670s, in reference to the people who had the practice of drinking milk on the 200 fasting days stipulated by the Orthodox Church. . Nonetheless, these were Spiritual Christians not directly related to the group later known as Molokans .     The Molokans that are known today by that name split in 1779/80 from the  |Doukhobors|Doukhobors|  because they thought that the Doukhobors neglected the Bible in their belief that God had placed the Word directly into their hearts. The Molokans, however, held the written Bible into the highest regard. The founder of the Molokans,  |Semen_Matveev_Uklein|Semen_Matveev_Uklein|  , was a son-in-law of the Doukhobor leader  |Ilarion_Poberokhin|Ilarion_Poberokhin|  as explained by O. Beznosova : Soon a group broke away from Pobirohins disciples.It was led by his son in law Simeon Uklein who did not share the mystical spirit and self-deification of the former leader and defended the need for reliance on the Gospel texts in the organization of church life . This group became a rational direction of. Spiritual Christianity, as opposed to the mystics - christoverchestvo adherents, Doukhobors and  |skoptsy|Skoptsy|  .     Ukleins Molokans from Tambov energetically proselytized in settlements along the  |Volga_River|Volga_River|  and Russias south-eastern frontier, spreading the Molokan faith in  |Orenburg|Orenburg| ,  |Saratov|Saratov|  and  |Astrakhan|Astrakhan|  provinces and organizing congregations until his death in 1809.       From the intervention of Count  |Nikolay_Zubov|Nikolay_Alexandrovich_Zubov|  in 1795, Molokans were tolerated under Tsarina Catherine but constrained by strict rules imposed upon them intended to curb community growth.  Those who ignored the restrictions were punished in  |Tsarist_Russia|Imperial_Russia|  as  |heretics|Christian_Heresy| .  Molokan evangelists and missionaries suffered imprisonment, banishment and other forms of punishment. Prohibited from winning converts,  the Molokans were forced into  |endogamy|Endogamy| . The governments policy was to send the Molokans away from the center of Russia into the Caucasus , and other outlying areas to prevent their having influence on other peasants; they were sent to  |Armenia|Armenia| ,  |Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan|  ,  |Ukraine|Ukraine|  , central  |Asia|Asia| , and  |Siberia|Siberia| , where many communities have survived into the present.     It is said that, in 1900, despite the persecution there could have been about a half-million Spiritual Christians in the Russia empire. These figures appear, however, to be vastly exaggerated. In 1912, there were only 133,935 Molokane and 4,844 Pryguny counted in Russia .     Fewer than one thousand Molokane fled Russia in the early 1900s , many of whom settled near other non-Orthodox immigrants from Russia in an ethnic  |enclave|Enclave|  on and near  |Potrero_Hill|Potrero_Hill| ,  |San_Francisco_California|San_Francisco| , where they built a prayer hall in 1929. A second prayer hall was established near  |Sheridan_California|Sheridan_Placer_County_California|  to serve those scattered in Northern California. There was never a Molokan Church in Southern California.  Though some Spiritual Christian faith groups fled Russia in the early 1900s to avoid the military draft, all eligible Molokan boys registered for the  |Selective_Service_Act_of_1917|Selective_Service_Act_Of_1917| , but were disqualified as aliens who did not speak English. During World War II, 136 eligible American Molokan boys enlisted during World War II, and two were  |conscientious_objectors|Conscientious_Objectors| .      Being prohibited from winning converts under the laws of the Russian Empire, they adopted  |endogamy|Endogamy|  and were classified as an ethnic group under the Bolsheviks.       There were many different Molokan movements including the Constants , the Jumpers , the Maximists and the Commmunalists .            The Russian term constant  applied to the Molokans has been used with two different intentions. By original Molokans who either refused to be evangelized by Protestant denominations or insisted that they will retain their faith unchanged by the Jumper revivalist movement in the 1830s. They originally constituted the by far largest segment of Molokanism.   In 1833, a  |schism|Schism|  took place within the Molokan faith. This event was framed by collective cataclysms of disease, famine, and persecution.   A portion of the Molokans during this time began to experience a charismatic outpouring of the Holy Spirit,  similar to later  |Pentecostal|Pentecostal|  faiths. Eventually this sect evolved into what is known today as the Molokan Jumpers.  The old Molokans were termed Constants , and the newly evolved Molokans Jumpers  also called Skakuny . The Molokan Jumpers believed they were visited by a manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and this new smaller Molokan sect began a revival with intense zeal, reporting miracles that purportedly rivaled those of Christs apostles.       The Constant Molokan sect condemned the new sect to authorities, resulting in betrayals and imprisonment for many of the Molokan Jumpers. Some of these Molokan Jumpers called themselves New Israelites , when their leader  |Maxim_Rudometkin|Maxim_Rudometkin|  in Nikitino, Erivan Guberniya was announced to be the King of the Spirits in 1853. The group, also known as Maximists , considered  |Efim_Gerasimovic_Klubnikin|Efim_Gerasimovic_Klubnikin|  in Romanovka, Kars oblast, a divinely inspired 12-year-old boy prophet. He prophesied a coming time that would be unbearable and that the time to leave Russia was now. During the early 20th century under his leadership, about 2,000 Pryguny emigrated to the  |United_States|United_States| , first settling on the east side of  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| . Most seeking rural isolation moved to Baja Mexico, then Arizona, Central California, and some other parts of the West Coast and Canada. Other Jumpers received a land grant from the  |Mexican_government|Mexican_Government|  and settled in the  |Guadalupe_Valley|Guadalupe_Baja_California|  in  |Baja_California|Baja_California| ,  |Mexico|Mexico| .     In Los Angeles, a small number of the Molokan Jumpers joined the development of the American Revival called the  |Pentecostal|Pentecostal| |_Azusa_Street_Revival|Azusa_Street_Revival| . The founder of  |The_Full_Gospel_Business_Mens_Association|The_Full_Gospel_Business_Mens_Association|  associates this  |Pentecostal|Pentecostal| |_Revival|Christian_Revival|  to a child prophet of the Molokan Jumpers, E.G. Klubnikin.          About 20,000 people identify as Molokans, at least ethnically, in the former Soviet Union. There are approximately 200 Molokan churches, 150 of them in Russia and  |Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan| . They also lived in the  |North_Caucasus|North_Caucasus| ,  |Southern_Ukraine|Southern_Ukraine| ,  |Armenia|Armenia| , and  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , where ancestors had been exiled long ago.     Approximately 25,000 Molokans reside in the United States, of whom about 5,000 ethnically identify as Molokans. The majority live in or near  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , particularly in  |East_Los_Angeles|East_Los_Angeles_California| ,  |Boyle_Heights|Boyle_Heights_Los_Angeles| , and  |Commerce|Commerce_California| .      During the 1960s other Molokans settled in southern  |Alaska|Alaska|  and  |Australia|Australia| . Molokans are said to be numerous in  |Australia|Australia| . The majority are in  |South_Australia|South_Australia| , with a number of families in  |Western_Australia|Western_Australia|  and a small group residing in  |Queensland|Queensland| . Over 1,000 reside in Canada in the province of  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia|  and hundreds more in  |Alberta|Alberta| , keeping their traditional communal lifestyle. A group of Molokan families are also living in  |South_America|South_America|  in the country of  |Uruguay|Uruguay| .     A small Molokan community was located in the eastern province of  |Kars|Kars| ,  |Turkey|Turkey| . Most of the community returned to Russia years ago; in the 21st century only one family of Molokans is left in Kars. , Todays Zaman       Molokans adhere to Old Testament laws in the spirit of the Christian  |New_Covenant|New_Covenant| . All sects refrain from eating pork, shellfish, or other unclean foods, as defined in the Bible. Molokans refer to the sabbath on Sunday. Some refuse to serve on juries or file lawsuits against fellow church members. Church services, led by a  |Lector|Lector| , are conducted predominantly in the Russian language, but also in  |Old_Slavonic|Old_Church_Slavonic| , which was common to the Orthodox Church. Men and women sit apart, and services are usually quite active. They do not worship saints, and do not worship symbols or images, such as icons or crosses. as the Molokans traditionally practice  |endogamy|Endogamy|  and marry within the faith.           Molokans are known for having different spellings of last names within the same immediate family for a few reasons. 1. The names were horribly misspelled when they arrived in the United States, two they were terribly translated and others changed the spelling because they were afraid to be taken back. They also in several cases chose to go with American versions of their names. So Vasilli Bukroff becomes Bill or William Bukroff or Ivan Metchikoff will become John Mitchell and Dunya Tikunov will be Julie Tyler . They also sometimes use first names that are not their legal names and are based on nicknames from childhood within the church that stuck with people as adults. For example, Hazel Valov became known as Percy Valov , for being very persistent . Another naming practice that can become confusing for those who are unfamiliar is those who settled in the Guadalupe Valley, Mexico. Many settlers took on the Mexican versions of their names so Rodion Pavlov became Rodolfo Pabloff and when they had children they also adopted the Mexican format so you will see what would have been a Russian name like Ivan Pavilovich Pabloff  .
