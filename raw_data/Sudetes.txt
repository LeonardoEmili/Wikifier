The  |Sudeten_Germans|Sudeten_Germans|   as well as the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|   are named after the Sudetes.       The name Sudetes is derived from Sudeti montes, a  |Latin|Latin| ization of the name Soudeta ore used in the  Geographia  by the Greco-Roman writer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  c. AD 150 for a range of mountains in  |Germania|Germania|  in the general region of the modern Czech republic.     There is no consensus about which mountains he meant, and he could for example have intended the  |Ore_Mountains|Ore_Mountains| , joining the modern Sudetes to their west, or even the  |Bohemian_Forest|Bohemian_Forest|  .  The modern Sudetes are probably Ptolemys Askiburgion mountains.      Ptolemy wrote Σούδητα in  |Greek|Ancient_Greek| , which is a neuter plural. Latin mons, however, is a masculine, hence Sudeti. The Latin version, and the modern geographical identification, is likely to be a scholastic innovation, as it is not attested in classical Latin literature. The meaning of the name is not known. In one hypothetical derivation, it means Mountains of Wild Boar s, relying on  |Indo_European|Proto_Indo_European_Language| |_Eastern_Sudetes|Eastern_Sudetes|   in the Czech Republic and Poland    |Oderské_vrchy|Oderské_Vrchy| |_Hrubý_Jeseník|Hrubý_Jeseník|  Mountains with Mt.  |Praděd|Praděd| ,   |Opawskie_Mountains|Opawskie_Mountains| |_Golden_Mountains|Golden_Mountains| |_Śnieżnik_Mountains|Śnieżnik_Mountains| |_Hanušovická_vrchovina|Hanušovická_Vrchovina| |_Central_Sudetes|Central_Sudetes| , in the Czech Republic and Poland    |Orlické_Mountains|Orlické_Hory|  with Mt.  |Velká_Deštná|Velká_Deštná| ,   |Bystrzyckie_Mountains|Bystrzyckie_Mountains| |_Bardzkie_Mountains|Bardzkie_Mountains| |_Table_Mountains|Stołowe_Mountains| |_Owl_Mountains|Owl_Mountains| |_Krucze_Mountains|Krucze_Mountains| |_Stone_Mountains|Stone_Mountains| |_Waldenburg_Mountains|Waldenburg_Mountains| |_Ślęża|Ślęża|  massif    |Western_Sudetes|Western_Sudetes| , in Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland    |Ještěd_Kozákov_Ridge|Ještěd_Kozákov_Ridge| |_Jizera_Mountains|Jizera_Mountains| |_Kaczawskie_Mountains|Kaczawskie_Mountains| |_Krkonoše|Krkonoše|  with Mt.  |Sněžka|Sněžka| ,   |Lusatian_Mountains|Lusatian_Mountains| |_Rudawy_Janowickie|Rudawy_Janowickie| |_Lusatian_Highlands|Lusatian_Highlands|  , , last 10,000 years |pulation_biolo|Pulation_Biolo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |olo|Olo| |195landfo|195Landfo| |ck_formati|Ck_Formati| |olo|Olo| |ndfo|Ndfo| |ograp|Ograp| Troppau |Sudeten_Germans|Sudeten_Germans| |18–19e|18–19| .g.
