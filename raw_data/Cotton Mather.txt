          Cotton Mather    was a  |New_England|History_Of_New_England| |_Puritan|Puritan|  minister, prolific author, and  |pamphleteer|Pamphleteer| . He left a scientific legacy due to his  |hybridization|Hybrid|  experiments and his promotion of  |inoculation|Inoculation|  for disease prevention, though he is most frequently remembered today for his involvement in the  |Salem_witch_trials|Salem_Witch_Trials| . He was subsequently denied the presidency of Harvard College which his father,  |Increase_Mather|Increase_Mather| , had held.             Mather was born in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, the son of Maria and  |Increase_Mather|Increase_Mather| , and grandson of both  |John_Cotton|John_Cotton|  and  |Richard_Mather|Richard_Mather| , all also prominent Puritan ministers. Mather was named after his maternal grandfather John Cotton. He attended  |Boston_Latin_School|Boston_Latin_School| , where his name was posthumously added to its  |Hall_of_Fame|Boston_Latin_Schoolhall_Of_Fame| , and graduated from Harvard in 1678 at age 15. After completing his post-graduate work, he joined his father as assistant pastor of Bostons original  |North_Church|Second_Church_Boston|  . In 1685, Mather assumed full responsibilities as pastor of the church.          Mather wrote more than 450 books and pamphlets, and his ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential religious leaders in America. He set the moral tone in the colonies and sounded the call for second- and third-generation Puritans, whose parents had left  |England|England|  for the  |New_England|New_England|  colonies, to return to the  |theological|Theology|  roots of  |Puritan|Puritan| ism . The most important of these was  Magnalia Christi Americana  which comprises seven distinct books, many of which depict biographical and historical narratives.        Mather influenced early American science. In 1716, he conducted one of the first recorded experiments with plant  |hybridization|Hybrid|  based on his observations of corn varieties. This observation was memorialized in a letter to his friend James Petiver: Zirkle 1935, p.         In November 1713, Mathers wife, newborn twins, and two-year-old daughter all succumbed during a measles epidemic.  He was twice widowed, and only two of his 15 children survived him; he died on the day after his 65th birthday and was buried on  |Copps_Hill|Copps_Hill| , near  |Old_North_Church|Old_North_Church| .         |Robert_Boyle|Robert_Boyle|  was a huge influence throughout Mathers career. He read Boyles The Usefulness of Experimental Natural Philosophy closely throughout the 1680s, and his own early works on science and religion borrowed greatly from it, using almost identical language to Boyle. .        Mathers relationship with his father  |Increase_Mather|Increase_Mather|  is thought by some to have been strained and difficult. Increase was a pastor of the  |North_Square_Church|Second_Church_Boston|  and president of  |Harvard_College|Harvard_College| ; he led an accomplished life. Despite Cottons efforts, he never became quite as well known and successful in politics as his father. He did surpass his fathers output as a writer, writing more than 400 books. One of the most public displays of their strained relationship emerged during the witch trials, which Increase Mather reportedly did not support. Hovey, pp. 531–32       Cotton Mather helped convince  |Elihu_Yale|Elihu_Yale|  to make a donation to a new college in New Haven which became  |Yale_College|Yale_College| . .         In 1689, Mather published Memorable Providences detailing the supposed afflictions of several children in the Goodwin family in Boston. Mather had a prominent role in the witchcraft case against Catholic washerwoman  |Goody_Glover|Ann_Glover| , which ultimately resulted in her conviction and execution.  Besides praying for the children, which also included fasting and meditation, he would also observe and record their activities. The children were subject to hysterical fits, which he detailed in Memorable Providences.  In his book, Mather argued that since there are witches and devils, there are immortal souls. He also claimed that witches appear spectrally as themselves.  He opposed any natural explanations for the fits; he believed that people who confessed to using witchcraft were sane; he warned against performing magic due to its connection with the devil; and he argued that  |spectral_evidence|Spectral_Evidence|  should not be used as evidence for witchcraft.     |Robert_Calef|Robert_Calef|  was a contemporary of Mather and critical of him, and he considered this book responsible for laying the groundwork for the  |Salem_witch_trials|Salem_Witch_Trials|  three years later:          Nineteenth-century historian  |Charles_Wentworth_Upham|Charles_Wentworth_Upham|  shared the view that the afflicted in Salem were imitating the Goodwin children, but he put the blame on both Cotton and his father  |Increase_Mather|Increase_Mather|        Mather was influential in the construction of the court for the trials from the beginning. Sir  |William_Phips|William_Phips| , governor of the newly chartered  |Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay|Province_Of_Massachusetts_Bay| , appointed his lieutenant governor,  |William_Stoughton|William_Stoughton| , as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts, where he presided over the witch trials. According to George Bancroft, Mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular Stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under Phips through the intervention of Mathers own politically powerful father, Increase. Intercession had been made by Cotton Mather for the advancement of Stoughton, a man of cold affections, proud, self-willed and covetous of distinction.  Apparently Mather saw in Stoughton, a bachelor who had never wed, an ally for church-related matters. Bancroft quotes Mathers reaction to Stoughtons appointment as follows:          Mather claimed not to have attended the trials in Salem . His contemporaries Calef and  |Thomas_Brattle|Thomas_Brattle|  place him at the executions . Mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end: If in the midst of the many Dissatisfaction among us, the publication of these Trials may promote such a pious Thankfulness unto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall Re-joyce that God is Glorified. Mather called himself a historian not an advocate but, according to one modern writer, his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling Martha Carrier a rampant hag . Mather referred to George Burroughs Burroughs was a Harvard alumnus who survived Indian attacks in  |Maine|Maine| . He was an unordained minister hanged the same day as Martha Carrier, John Proctor, George Jacobs, and John Willard as a very puny man whose tergiversations, contradictions, and falsehoods made his testimony not worth considering . Stacy Schiff. The Witches of Salem: Diabolical doings in a Puritan village , The New Yorker, September 7, 2015, pp. 46-55. .        The afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant, invisible to any but themselves, was tormenting them; this was considered evidence of witchcraft, despite the defendants denial and profession of strongly held Christian beliefs. On May 31, 1692, Mather wrote to one of the judges,  |John_Richards|John_Richards| , a member of his congregation, expressing his support of the prosecutions, but cautioning; do not lay more stress on pure  |spectral_evidence|Spectral_Evidence|  than it will bear … It is very certain that the Devils have sometimes represented the Shapes of persons not only innocent, but also very virtuous. Though I believe that the just God then ordinarily provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused.      An opinion on the matter was sought from the ministers of the area and a response was submitted June 15, 1692. Cotton Mather seems to take credit for the varied responses when anonymously celebrating himself years later: drawn up at their desire, by Cotton Mather the younger, as I have been informed. . The Return of the Several Ministers ambivalently discussed whether or not to allow  |spectral_evidence|Spectral_Evidence| . The original full version of the letter was reprinted in late 1692 in the final two pages of  |Increase_Mathers|Increase_Mather|  Cases of Conscience. It is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument. Calef calls it perfectly Ambidexter, giving as great as greater Encouragement to proceed in those dark methods, then cautions against them… indeed the Advice then given, looks most like a thing of his Composing, as carrying both Fire to increase and Water to quench the Conflagration.  It seems likely that the Several ministers consulted did not agree, and thus Cotton Mathers construction and presentation of the advice could have been crucial to its interpretation.      |Thomas_Hutchinson|Thomas_Hutchinson|  summarized the Return, The two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others, and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before. Reprinting the Return five years later in his anonymously published Life of Phips , Cotton Mather omitted the fateful two first and the last sections, though they were the ones he had already given most attention in his Wonders of the Invisible World rushed into publication in the summer and early autumn of 1692.     On August 19, 1692, Mather attended the execution of George Burroughs Three independent contemporary sources place him there: Thomas Brattle, Samuel Sewall, and Robert Calef. Brattle refers to him C.M. in Burr Narratives p. 177. Calefs account is also reprinted in Burr Narratives p. 360. Diary of Samuel Sewall p. 363 and Robert Calef presents him as playing a direct and influential role:             On September 2, 1692, after eleven of the accused had been executed, Cotton Mather wrote a  |letter_to_Chief_Justice_William_Stoughton|September_2_1692_Letter_By_Cotton_Mather|  congratulating him on extinguishing of as wonderful a piece of devilism as has been seen in the world and claiming that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen.     Regarding spectral evidence, Upham concludes that Cotton Mather never in any public writing denounced the admission of it, never advised its absolute exclusion; but on the contrary recognized it as a ground of presumption … nothing could stand against it. Character, reason, common sense, were swept away.   . In a letter to an English clergyman in 1692, Boston intellectual  |Thomas_Brattle|Thomas_Brattle| , criticizing the trials, said of the judges use of spectral evidence:          The later exclusion of spectral evidence from trials by Governor Phips, around the same time his own wifes name coincidentally started being bandied about in connection with witchcraft, began in January 1693. This immediately brought about a sharp decrease in convictions. Due to a reprieve by Phips, there were no further executions. Phipss actions were vigorously opposed by William Stoughton.     Bancroft notes that Mather considered witches among the poor, and vile, and ragged beggars upon Earth , and Bancroft asserts that Mather considered the people against the witch trials to be witch advocates.       In the years after the trials, of the principal actors in the trial, whose lives are recorded after, neither he nor  |Stoughton|William_Stoughton|  admitted strong misgivings. For several years after the trials, Cotton Mather continued to defend them and seemed to hold out a hope for their return.       Wonders of the Invisible World contained a few of Mathers sermons, the conditions of the colony and a description of witch trials in Europe.   He somewhat clarified the contradictory advice he had given in Return of the Several Ministers, by defending the use of spectral evidence. Wonders of the Invisible World appeared around the same time as Increase Mathers Cases of Conscience.          Mather did not sign his name or support his fathers book initially:          The last major events in Mathers involvement with witchcraft were his interactions with Mercy Short in December 1692 and Margaret Rule in September 1693. The latter brought a five year campaign by Boston merchant  |Robert_Calef|Robert_Calef|  against the influential and powerful Mathers. Calefs book More Wonders of the Invisible World was inspired by the fear that Mather would succeed in once again stirring up new witchcraft trials, and the need to bear witness to the horrible experiences of 1692. He quotes the public apologies of the men on the jury and one of the judges.  |Increase_Mather|Increase_Mather|  was said to have publicly burned Calefs book in Harvard Yard around the time he was removed from the head of the college and replaced by  |Samuel_Willard|Samuel_Willard| . MHS secretary John Eliot seems to be the first to make this claim in Biographical Dictionary PD available online. p 95-6.         |Charles_Wentworth_Upham|Charles_Wentworth_Upham|  wrote Salem Witchcraft Volumes I and II With an Account of Salem Village and a History of Opinions on Witchcraft and Kindred Subjects, which runs to almost 1,000 pages. It came out in 1867 and cites numerous criticisms of Mather by  |Robert_Calef|Robert_Calef| .      |William_Frederick_Poole|William_Frederick_Poole|  defended Mather from these criticisms.     In 1869, Poole quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on Cotton Mathers role in the Witch Trial       If anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly, let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking,...   Who got up Salem Witchcraft?... he will reply, Cotton Mather. Let him try another boy...   Who was Cotton Mather? and the answer will come, The man who was on horseback, and hung witches.      Poole was a librarian, and a lover of literature, including Mathers Magnalia and other books and tracts, numbering nearly 400 were never so prized by collectors as today. Poole announced his intention to redeem Mathers name, using as a springboard a harsh critique of  |Uphams|Charles_Wentworth_Upham|  book, via his own book Cotton Mather and Salem witchcraft. A quick search of the name Mather in Uphams book shows that it occurs 96 times. Pooles critique runs less than 70 pages but the name Mather occurs many more times than the other book, which is more than ten times as long. Upham shows a balanced and complicated view of Cotton Mather, such as this first mention: One of Cotton Mathers most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master. It flows from a heart warm with gratitude.     Uphams book refers to  |Robert_Calef|Robert_Calef|  no fewer than 25 times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by Calef in the mid-1690s and stating: Although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, there is no ground to dispute the veracity of Calef as to matters of fact. He goes on to say that Calefs collection of writings gave a shock to Mathers influence, from which it never recovered.     Calef produced only the one book; he is self-effacing and apologetic for his limitations, and on the title page he is listed not as author but collector . Poole, champion of literature, could not accept Calef whose faculties, as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order;… , and his book in our opinion, has a reputation much beyond its merits. Poole refers to Calef as Mathers personal enemy and opens a line, Without discussing the character and motives of Calef… but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn Calef. Upham responded to Poole in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title but with the clauses reversed: Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather. Many of Pooles arguments were addressed, but both authors emphasize the importance of Cotton Mathers difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence, as copied in the final pages, called The Return of Several Ministers , of Increase Mathers Cases of Conscience . .       Evidenced by the published opinion in the years that followed the Poole vs Upham debate, it would seem Upham was considered the clear winner . In 1891, Harvard English professor Barrett Wendall wrote . His book often expresses agreement with Upham but also announces an intention to show Cotton Mather in a more positive light. gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other… And some pages later: Calefs temper was that of the rational Eighteenth century; the Mathers belonged rather to the Sixteenth, the age of passionate religious enthusiasm.     In 1907,  |George_Lyman_Kittredge|George_Lyman_Kittredge|  published an essay that would become foundational to a major change in the 20th-century view of witchcraft and Mather culpability therein. Kittredge is dismissive of Robert Calef, and sarcastic toward Upham, but shows a fondness for Poole and a similar soft touch toward Cotton Mather. Responding to Kittredge in 1911,  |George_Lincoln_Burr|George_Lincoln_Burr| , a historian at Cornell, published an  that begins in a professional and friendly fashion toward both Poole and Kittredge, but quickly becomes a passionate and direct criticism, stating that Kittredge in the zeal of his apology… reached results so startlingly new, so contradictory of what my own lifelong study in this field has seemed to teach, so unconfirmed by further research… and withal so much more generous to our ancestors than I can find it in my conscience to deem fair, that I should be less than honest did I not seize this earliest opportunity share with you the reasons for my doubts… GL Burr, Englands Place in the History of Witchcraft AAS, pp 4-5. These page numbers refer to original book format, available PD online. Also see link to PDF from AAS. The final paragraph of Burrs 1911 essay pushes these mens debate into the realm of a progressive creed     … I fear that they who begin by excusing their ancestors may end by excusing themselves. GL Burr, NE Place in Witchcraft, 1911, p 35.     Perhaps as a continuation of his argument, in 1914,  |George_Lincoln_Burr|George_Lincoln_Burr|  published a large compilation Narratives . This book arguably continues to be the single most cited reference on the subject. Unlike Poole and Upham, Burr avoids forwarding his previous debate with Kittredge directly into his book and mentions Kittredge only once, briefly in a footnote citing both of their essays from 1907 and 1911, but without further comment. Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706. PD available online. p xxi footnote 1. But in addition to the viewpoint displayed by Burrs selections, he weighs in on the Poole vs Upham debate at various times, including siding with Upham in a note on  |Thomas_Brattles|Thomas_Brattle|  letter, The strange suggestion of W. F. Poole that Brattle here means Cotton Mather himself, is adequately answered by Upham… Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706. PD available online. p 188 footnote 3. Burrs Narratives reprint a lengthy but abridged portion of Calefs book and introducing it he digs deep into the historical record for information on Calef and concludes …that he had else any grievance against the Mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think. Burr finds that a comparison between Calefs work and original documents in the historical record collections testify to the care and exactness… Burr, George Lincoln.

PD available online. p 293.         1920–3  |Kenneth_B_Murdock|Secret_Court_Of_1920|  wrote a doctoral dissertation on Increase Mather advised by  |Chester_Noyes_Greenough|Secret_Court_Of_1920|  and Kittredge. Murdocks father was a banker hired in 1920 to run the Harvard Press Max Hall Harvard University Press A History 1986 Harvard University Press Cambridge MA p 43, 61 and he published his sons dissertation as a handsome volume in 1925: Increase Mather, The Foremost American Puritan . Kittredge was right hand man to the elder Murdock at the Press. Max Hall Harvard University Press, p 43, 61. This work focuses on Increase Mather and is more critical of the son, but the following year he published a selection of Cotton Mathers writings with an introduction that claims Cotton Mather was not less but more humane than his contemporaries. Scholars have demonstrated that his advice to the witch judges was always that they should be more cautious in accepting evidence against the accused. K Murdock Selections from Cotton Mather . See introduction. Murdocks statement seems to claim a majority view. But one wonders who Murdock would have meant by scholars at this time other than Poole, Kittredge, and TJ Holmes For contrast, see Herbert Schneider, of Columbia University, who in 1930 described the Mathers as smug ministers of God whose misdeeds in 1692 put an official end to the theocracy. Schneider, Herbert Wallace, The Puritan Mind, Henry Holt & Co, 1930, p. 92. and Murdocks obituary calls him a pioneer in the reversal of a movement among historians of American culture to discredit the Puritan and colonial period…      1924  was an Englishman with no college education, but he apprenticed in bookbinding and emigrated to the U.S. and become the librarian at the William G. Mather Library in Ohio See link above containing obituary by CK Shipley in AAS Proceedings. where he likely met Murdock. In 1924, Holmes wrote an essay for the Bibliographical Society of America identifying himself as part of the Poole-Kittredge lineage and citing Kenneth B. Murdocks still unpublished dissertation. In 1932 Holmes published a bibliography of Increase Mather followed by Cotton Mather, A Bibliography . Holmes often cites Murdock and Kittredge and is highly knowledgeable about the construction of books. Holmes work also includes Cotton Mathers October 20, 1692 letter to his uncle opposing an end to the trials.     1930 Samuel Eliot Morison published Builders of the Bay Colony. Morison chose not to include anyone with the surname Mather or Cotton in his collection of twelve builders and in the bibliography writes I have a higher opinion than most historians of Cotton Mathers Magnalia… Although Mather is inaccurate, pedantic, and not above suppresio veri, he does succeed in giving a living picture of the person he writes about. Whereas Kittredge and Murdock worked from the English department, Morison was from Harvards history department. Morisons view seems to have evolved over the course of the 1930s, as can be seen in Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century published while Kittredge ran the Harvard press, and in a year that coincided with the tercentary of the college: Since the appearance of Professor Kittredges work, it is not necessary to argue that a man of learning… of that era should be judged on his view of witchcraft. Morison, Samuel E Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1936 p 494-497 In The Intellectual Life of Colonial New England , Morison writes that Cotton Mather found balance and level-thinking during the witchcraft trials. Like Poole, Morison suggests Calef had an agenda against Mather, without providing supporting evidence.      1953 Perry Miller published The New England Mind: From Colony to Province . Miller worked from the Harvard English Department and his expansive prose contains few citations, but the Bibliographical Notes for Chapter XIII The Judgement of the Witches references the bibliographies of TJ Holmes calling Holmes portrayal of Cotton Mathers composition of Wonders an epoch in the study of Salem Witchcraft. However, following the discovery of the authentic holograph of the September 2, 1692 letter, in 1985, David Levin writes that the letter demonstrates that the timeline employed by TJ Holmes and Perry Miller, is off by three weeks. David Levin,  p.35. Levins answer to the question presented in his title would seem to be no, the Mathers did not fundamentally disagree. Contrary to the evidence in the later arriving letter, Miller portrays Phips and Stoughton as pressuring Cotton Mather to write the book : If ever there was a false book produced by a man whose heart was not in it, it is The Wonders….he was insecure, frightened, sick at heart… The book has ever since scarred his reputation, Perry Miller writes. Miller seems to imagine Cotton Mather as sensitive, tender, and a good vehicle for his jeremiad thesis: His mind was bubbling with every sentence of the jeremiads, for he was heart and soul in the effort to reorganize them.     1969 Chadwick Hansen Witchcraft at Salem. Hansen states a purpose to set the record straight and reverse the traditional interpretation of what happened at Salem… and names Poole and Kittredge as like-minded influences. Hansen presents Mather as a positive influence on the Salem Trials and considers Mathers handling of the Goodwin children sane and temperate. Hansen posits that Mather was a moderating influence by opposing the death penalty for those who confessed—or feigned confession—such as Tituba and Dorcas Good, and that most negative impressions of him stem from his defense of the ongoing trials in Wonders of the Invisible World. Writing an introduction to a facsimile of Robert Calefs book in 1972, Hansen compares  |Robert_Calef|Robert_Calef|  to  |Joseph_Goebbels|Joseph_Goebbels| , and also explains that, in Hansens opinion, women are more subject to hysteria than men. Chadwick Hansen introduction to Robert Calef More Wonders pp. v, xv note 4.     1971 The Admirable Cotton Mather by James Playsted Wood. A young adult book. In the preface, Wood discusses the Harvard-based revision and writes that Kittredge and Murdock added to a better understanding of a vital and courageous man…       1985 David Hall writes, With one great phase of interpretation came to a dead end. David D Hall, Witchcraft and the Limits of Interpretation NEQ Vol 58 No. 2 see p 261-3.  Note, Hall doesnt mention the  |September_2_1692|September_2_1692_Letter_By_Cotton_Mather|  letter in this essay and no subsequent mention of the letter in his later publications has been located. Hall writes that whether the old interpretation favored by antiquarians had begun with the malice of  |Robert_Calef|Robert_Calef|  or deep hostility to Puritanism, either way such notions are no longer… the concern of the historian. But David Hall notes one minor exception. Debate continues on the attitude and role of Cotton Mather…       Toward the later half of the twentieth century, a number of historians at universities far from New England seemed to find inspiration in the Kittredge lineage. In Selected Letters of Cotton Mather Ken Silverman writes, Actually, Mather had very little to do with the trials. Ken Silverman Selected Letters of Cotton Mather, p 31. Twelve pages later Silverman publishes, for the first time, a letter to chief judge William Stoughton on  |September_2_1692|September_2_1692_Letter_By_Cotton_Mather| , in which Cotton Mather writes … I hope I can may say that one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen … I have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers with something of a designed contrivance… See  |link_to_this_letter|September_2_1692_Letter_By_Cotton_Mather|  for a complex discussion of the provenance, as it did not arrive at the archives until 1985.   Writing in the early 1980s, historian  |John_Demos|John_Putnam_Demos|  imputed to Mather a purportedly moderating influence on the trials.       Coinciding with the tercentary of the trials in 1992, there was a flurry of publications.     Historian  highlights Mathers cloudy thinking and confusion between sympathy for the possessed, and the boundlessness of spectral evidence when Mather stated, the devil have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent, but also the very virtuous.         The practice of smallpox  |inoculation|Inoculation|   was developed possibly in 8th-century India Hopkins, Donald R. . The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History; , p. 140. or 10th-century China. . Spreading its reach in seventeenth-century Turkey, inoculation or, rather,  |variolation|Variolation| , involved infecting a person via a cut in the skin with  |exudate|Exudate|  from a patient with a relatively mild case of smallpox , to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity. By the beginning of the 18th century, the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  in England was discussing the practice of inoculation, and the smallpox epidemic in 1713 spurred further interest. Blake 1952, pp. 489–90 It was not until 1721, however, that England recorded its first case of inoculation. Coss, Stephen. . The Fever of 1721: the Epidemic that Revolutionized Medicine and American Politics. New York: Simon & Schuster, p. 87;        Smallpox was a serious threat in colonial America, most devastating to Native Americans, but also to Anglo-American settlers. New England suffered smallpox epidemics in 1677, 1689–90, and 1702. Aronson and Newman 2002 It was highly contagious, and mortality could reach as high as 30 percent. Gronim 2007, p. 248. Boston had been plagued by smallpox outbreaks in 1690 and 1702. During this era, public authorities in Massachusetts dealt with the threat primarily by means of quarantine. Incoming ships were quarantined in  |Boston_Harbor|Boston_Harbor| , and any smallpox patients in town were held under guard or in a pesthouse . Blake 1952, p. 489     In 1706, Mathers slave,  |Onesimus|Onesimus| , explained to Mather how he had been inoculated as a child in  |Africa|Africa| .  Mather was fascinated by the idea. By July 1716, he had read an endorsement of inoculation by Dr Emanuel Timonius of Constantinople in the  Philosophical Transactions . Mather then declared, in a letter to Dr  |John_Woodward|John_Woodward|  of  |Gresham_College|Gresham_College|  in London, that he planned to press Bostons doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again. Blake 1952, pp. 490–91     By 1721, a whole generation of young Bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemics horrors had by and large disappeared. Winslow 1974, pp. 24–29  |Smallpox_returned|1721_Boston_Smallpox_Outbreak|  on April 22 of that year, when HMS Seahorse arrived from the West Indies carrying smallpox on board. Despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine, nine known cases of smallpox appeared in Boston by May 27, and by mid-June, the disease was spreading at an alarming rate. As a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread, many residents fled to outlying rural settlements. The combination of exodus, quarantine, and outside traders fears disrupted business in the capital of the Bay Colony for weeks. Guards were stationed at the House of Representatives to keep Bostonians from entering without special permission. The death toll reached 101 in September, and the  |Selectmen|Selectmen| , powerless to stop it, severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll. Blake 1952, p. 495 As one response, legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who, under these conditions, could no longer support their families.     On June 6, 1721, Mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by Timonius and Jacobus Pylarinus to local physicians, urging them to consult about the matter. He received no response. Next, Mather pleaded his case to Dr.  |Zabdiel_Boylston|Zabdiel_Boylston| , who tried the procedure on his youngest son and two slaves—one grown and one a boy. All recovered in about a week. Boylston inoculated seven more people by mid-July. The epidemic peaked in October 1721, with 411 deaths; by February 26, 1722, Boston was again free from smallpox. The total number of cases since April 1721 came to 5,889, with 844 deaths—more than three-quarters of all the deaths in Boston during 1721. Blake 1952, p. 496 Meanwhile, Boylston had inoculated 287 people, with six resulting deaths.        Boylston and Mathers inoculation crusade raised a horrid Clamour  among the people of Boston. Both Boylston and Mather were Object of their Fury; their furious Obloquies and Invectives , which Mather acknowledges in his diary. Bostons Selectmen, consulting a doctor who claimed that the practice caused many deaths and only spread the infection, forbade Boylston from performing it again.      The New-England Courant  published writers who opposed the practice. The editorial stance was that the Boston populace feared that inoculation spread, rather than prevented, the disease; however, some historians, notably  |H_W_Brands|H_W_Brands| , have argued that this position was a result of the  |contrarian|Contrarian|  positions of editor-in-chief  |James_Franklin|James_Franklin|  .  Public discourse ranged in tone from organized arguments by John Williams from Boston, who posted that several arguments proving that inoculating the smallpox is not contained in the law of Physick, either natural or divine, and therefore unlawful , to those put forth in a pamphlet by Dr.  |William_Douglass|William_Douglass|  of Boston, entitled The Abuses and Scandals of Some Late Pamphlets in Favour of Inoculation of the Small Pox , on the qualifications of inoculations proponents. At the extreme, in November 1721, someone hurled a lighted grenade into Mathers home.        Several opponents of smallpox inoculation, among them  |Rev_John_Williams|John_Williams| , stated that there were only two laws of physick : sympathy and antipathy. In his estimation, inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease, or an antipathy toward one, but the creation of one. For this reason, its practice violated the natural laws of medicine, transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal.     As with most colonists,  |Williams|John_Williams|  Puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life, and he used the  |Bible|Bible|  to state his case. He quoted  |Matthew_9_12|Matthew_9_12| , when  |Jesus|Jesus|  said: It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.  |William_Douglass|William_Douglass|  proposed a more  |secular|Secular|  argument against inoculation, stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices. In addition, he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians, and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise. According to Douglass, smallpox inoculation was a medical experiment of consequence, one not to be undertaken lightly. He believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others, and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony, including that of caring for the sick, they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs. Douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented. The only reason Mather had had success in it, he said, was because Mather had used it on children, who are naturally more resilient. Douglass vowed to always speak out against the wickedness of spreading infection . Speak out he did: The battle between these two prestigious adversaries lasted far longer than the epidemic itself, and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous.        Generally, Puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments. Increase Mather, Cottons father, was joined by prominent pastors Benjamin Colman and William Cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations. Stout, The New England Soul, p. 102 One of the classic assumptions of the Puritan mind was that the will of God was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation. . Nevertheless, Williams questioned whether the smallpox is not one of the strange works of God; and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most High. He also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by God as punishment for sin, and warned that attempting to shield themselves from Gods fury , would only serve to provoke him more .     Puritans found meaning in affliction, and they did not yet know why God was showing them disfavor through smallpox. Not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their errand . Many Puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art. They grappled with adhering to the  |Ten_Commandments|Ten_Commandments| , with being proper church members and good caring neighbors. The apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the Sixth Commandment— thou shalt not kill —seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure. Williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the Bible, it was not the will of God, and therefore unlawful. Williams 1721, p. 2 He explained that inoculation violated  |The_Golden_Rule|The_Golden_Rule| , because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease, he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him. With the Bible as the Puritans source for all decision-making, lack of scriptural evidence concerned many, and Williams vocally scorned Mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the Bible. Williams 1721, p. 14       With the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll, a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day. The use of quarantine and various other efforts, such as balancing the bodys  |humors|Humors| , did not slow the spread of the disease. As news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas, reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people. By circa 1700, smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the Atlantic world.      Mather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of God and argued the procedure was not outside of Puritan principles. He wrote that whether a Christian may not employ this Medicine and humbly give Thanks to Gods good Providence in discovering of it to a miserable World; and humbly look up to His Good Providence It may seem strange, that any wise Christian cannot answer it. And how strangely do Men that call themselves Physicians betray their Anatomy, and their Philosophy, as well as their Divinity in their invectives against this Practice?  The Puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone, both the good and the wicked, yet God had provided them with the means to save themselves. Mather reported that, from his view, none that have used it ever died of the Small Pox, tho at the same time, it were so malignant, that at least half the People died, that were infected With it in the Common way.      While Mather was experimenting with the procedure, prominent Puritan pastors Benjamin Colman and William Cooper expressed public and theological support for them.  Apparently Cooper, also a minister, wrote this in cooperation with Colman because nearly the same response to the objections to inoculation is published under Colmans name as the last chapter to  The practice of smallpox inoculation was eventually accepted by the general population due to first-hand experiences and personal relationships. Although many were initially wary of the concept, it was because people were able to witness the procedures consistently positive results, within their own community of ordinary citizens, that it became widely utilized and supported. One important change in the practice after 1721 was regulated  |quarantine|Quarantine|  of innoculees.       Although Mather and Boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice, the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of 1721–22. After overcoming considerable difficulty and achieving notable success, Boylston traveled to  |London|London|  in 1725, where he published his results and was elected to the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  in 1726, with Mather formally receiving the honor two years prior. Coss 2016, p. 269, p. 277       Throughout his career Mather was also keen to minister to convicted  |pirates|Pirates| .  He produced a number of pamphlets and sermons concerning piracy, including “Faithful Warnings to prevent Fearful Judgments,” “Instructions to the Living, from the Condition of the Dead,” “The Converted Sinner ... A Sermon Preached in Boston, May 31, 1724, In the Hearing and at the Desire of certain Pirates,” “A Brief Discourse occasioned by a Tragical Spectacle of a Number of Miserables under Sentence of Death for Piracy,” “Useful Remarks. An Essay upon Remarkables in the Way of Wicked Men,” and “The Vial Poured Out Upon the Sea”. His father Increase had preached at the trial of Dutch pirate  |Peter_Roderigo|Peter_Roderigo| ;  Cotton Mather in turn preached at the trials and sometimes executions of pirate Captains  |William_Fly|William_Fly| ,  |John_Quelch|John_Quelch| ,  |Samuel_Bellamy|Samuel_Bellamy| ,  |William_Kidd|William_Kidd| ,  |Charles_Harris|Charles_Harris| , and  |John_Phillips|John_Phillips| . He also ministered to  |Thomas_Hawkins|Thomas_Hawkins| ,  |Thomas_Pound|Thomas_Pound| , and  |William_Coward|William_Coward| ; having been convicted of piracy, they were jailed alongside “Mary Glover the Irish Catholic witch,” daughter of witch “Goody”  |Ann_Glover|Ann_Glover|  at whose trial Mather had also preached.      In his conversations with William Fly and his crew Mather scolded them: “You have something within you, that will compell you to confess, That the Things which you have done, are most Unreasonable and Abominable. The Robberies and Piracies, you have committed, you can say nothing to Justify them. … It is a most hideous Article in the Heap of Guilt lying on you, that an Horrible Murder is charged upon you; There is a cry of Blood going up to Heaven against you.”        ;Major   Boston Ephermeris   Ornaments for the Daughters of Zion      The Biblia Americana   Decennium Luctuosom: a History of the Long War   Pillars of Salt         https://archive.org/details/corderiusameric00mathgoog Corderius Americanus: A Discourse on the Good Education of Children   Bonifacius         Manductio ad Ministerium     Boston Ephemeris |almanac|Almanac|  written by Mather in 1686. The content was similar to what is known today as the  Farmers Almanac . This was particularly important because it shows that Cotton Mather had influence in mathematics during the time of Puritan New England. This almanac contained a significant amount of astronomy, celestial within the text of the almanac the positions and motions of these celestial bodies, which he must have calculated by hand.      The Biblia AmericanaThe Biblia Americana. Mather believed that Biblia Americana was the best thing he had ever written; his masterwork. Biblia Americana contained Mathers thoughts and opinions on the Bible and how he interpreted it. Biblia Americana is incredibly large, and Mather worked on it from 1693 until 1728, when he died. Mather tried to convince others that philosophy and science could work together with religion instead of against it. People did not have to choose one or the other. In Biblia Americana, Mather looked at the Bible through a scientific perspective, completely opposite to his perspective in The Christian Philosopher, in which he approached science in a religious manner.     Pillars of SaltPillars of Salt.      Magnalia Christi Americana Magnalia Christi Americana , considered Mathers greatest work, was published in 1702, when he was 39. The book includes several biographies of saints and describes the process of the New England settlement. In this context saints does not refer to the canonized saints of the Catholic church, but to those Puritan divines about whom Mather is writing. It comprises seven total books, including Pietas in Patriam: The life of His Excellency Sir William Phips, originally published anonymously in London in 1697. Despite being one of Mathers best-known works, some have openly criticized it, labeling it as hard to follow and understand, and poorly paced and organized. However, other critics have praised Mathers work, citing it as one of the best efforts at properly documenting the establishment of America and growth of the people.     The Christian PhilosopherThe Christian Philosopher, the first systematic book on science published in America. Mather attempted to show how Newtonian science and religion were in harmony. It was in part based on  |Robert_Boyles|Robert_Boyle|   The Christian Virtuoso  . Mather reportedly took inspiration from  Hayy ibn Yaqdhan , by the 12th-century Islamic philosopher Abu Bakr  |Ibn_Tufail|Ibn_Tufail| .     Despite condemning the Mahometans as infidels, Mather viewed the novels protagonist, Hayy, as a model for his ideal Christian philosopher and monotheistic scientist. Mather viewed Hayy as a  |noble_savage|Noble_Savage|  and applied this in the context of attempting to understand the Native American Indians, in order to convert them to Puritan Christianity.
