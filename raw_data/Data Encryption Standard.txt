The Data Encryption Standard  is a  |symmetric_key_algorithm|Symmetric_Key_Algorithm|  for the  |encryption|Encryption|  of electronic data. Although its short key length is of 56 bits, criticized from the beginning, makes it too insecure for most current applications, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern  |cryptography|Cryptography| .     Developed in the early 1970s at  |IBM|Ibm|  and based on an earlier design by  |Horst_Feistel|Horst_Feistel| , the algorithm was submitted to the  |National_Bureau_of_Standards|National_Bureau_Of_Standards|  following the agencys invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the  |National_Security_Agency|National_Security_Agency|  , the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version , which was published as an official  |Federal_Information_Processing_Standard|Federal_Information_Processing_Standard|  for the United States in 1977.     The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose out of  |classified|Classified_Information|  design elements, a relatively short  |key_length|Key_Length|  of the  |symmetric_key|Symmetric_Key_Algorithm| |_block_cipher|Block_Cipher|  design, and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a  |backdoor|Backdoor| . Today it is known that the  |S_box|S_Box| es that had raised those suspicions were in fact designed by the NSA to actually remove a backdoor they secretly knew . However, the NSA also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced such that they could break it by brute force attack .  The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their  |cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysis| .     DES, as stated above, is insecure. This is mainly due to the  |56_bit_key_size|56_Bit_Encryption|  being too small. In January 1999,  |distributed_net|Distributed_Net|  and the  |Electronic_Frontier_Foundation|Electronic_Frontier_Foundation|  collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes . There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of  |Triple_DES|Triple_Des| , although there are theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the  |Advanced_Encryption_Standard|Advanced_Encryption_Standard|  . Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the  |National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology|National_Institute_Of_Standards_And_Technology| .     Some documentation makes a distinction between DES as a standard and as an algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the DEA .       The origins of DES go back to the early 1970s. In 1972, after concluding a study on the US governments  |computer_security|Computer_Security|  needs, the US standards body NBS —now named  |NIST|Nist|  —identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.
