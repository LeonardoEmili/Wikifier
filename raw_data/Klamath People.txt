         The Klamath people are a  |Native_American|Native_Americans_In_The_United_States|  tribe of the Plateau culture area in  |Southern_Oregon|Southern_Oregon|  and  |Northern_California|Northern_California| . Today Klamath people are enrolled in the  |federally_recognized_tribes|Federally_Recognized_Tribes| |Klamath_Tribes|Klamath_Tribes|  , Oregon    |Quartz_Valley_Indian_Community|Quartz_Valley_Indian_Community|  , California.         The Klamath people lived in the area around the  |Upper_Klamath_Lake|Upper_Klamath_Lake|  and the  |Klamath|Klamath_River| ,  |Williamson|Williamson_River| , and  |Sprague|Sprague_River|  rivers. They subsisted primarily on fish and gathered roots and seeds. While there was knowledge of their immediate neighbors, apparently the Klamath were unaware of the existence of the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| . Gatschet has described this position as leaving the Klamath living in a protracted isolation from outside cultures.     The Klamath were known to raid neighboring tribes, such as the  |Achomawi|Achomawi|  on the  |Pit_River|Pit_River| , and occasionally to take prisoners as slaves. They traded with the  |Wasco-Wishram|Wasco-Wishram|  at  |The_Dalles|The_Dalles,_Oregon| . However, scholars such as  |Alfred_L._Kroeber|Alfred_L._Kroeber|  and  |Leslie_Spier|Leslie_Spier|  consider these slaving raids by the Klamath to begin only with the acquisition of the horse.     These natives made southern  |Oregon|Oregon|  their home for long enough to witness the eruption of  |Mount_Mazama|Mount_Mazama| . It was a legendary volcanic mountain who is the creator of  |Crater_Lake|Crater_Lake| , now considered to be a beautiful natural formation.       In 1826,  |Peter_Skene_Ogden|Peter_Skene_Ogden| , an explorer for the  |Hudsons_Bay_Company|Hudsons_Bay_Company| , first encountered the Klamath people, and he was trading with them by 1829. The United States  |frontiersman|Frontiersman| |Kit_Carson|Kit_Carson|  admired their arrows, which were reported to be able to shoot through a house.       The Klamaths,  |Modocs|Modoc_People| , and the Yahooskin Band of  |Northern_Paiute|Northern_Paiute|  , which was erroneously called Upper Sprague River Snakes believed to be a Band of  Snake Indians , the collective name given to the Northern Paiute, Bannock, and Shoshone Native American tribes, signed a treaty with the  |United_States|United_States|  in 1864, establishing the  |Klamath_Reservation|Klamath_Reservation|  to the northeast of Upper Klamath Lake. This area was largely part of the traditional territory controlled by the ă′ukuckni Klamath band. The treaty required the tribes to cede the land in the  |Klamath_Basin|Klamath_Basin| , bounded on the north by the  |44th_parallel|44Th_Parallel_North| , to the United States. In return, the United States was to make a lump sum payment of $35,000, and annual payments totalling $80,000 over 15 years, as well as providing infrastructure and staff for the reservation. The treaty provided that, if the Indians drank or stored intoxicating liquor on the reservation, the payments could be withheld; the United States could also locate additional tribes on the reservation in the future. The tribes requested  |Lindsay_Applegate|Lindsay_Applegate|  as the agent to represent the United States to them. The Indian agent estimated the total population of the three tribes at about 2,000 when the treaty was signed.            Since termination of recognition of their tribal sovereignty in 1954 , the Klamath and neighboring tribes have reorganized their government and revived tribal identity. The Klamath, along with the Modoc and Yahooskin, have formed the federally recognized  |Klamath_Tribes|Klamath_Tribes|  confederation. Their tribal government is based in  |Chiloquin,_Oregon|Chiloquin,_Oregon| .     Some Klamath live on the  |Quartz_Valley_Indian_Community|Quartz_Valley_Indian_Community|  in  |Siskiyou_County,_California|Siskiyou_County,_California| .           Traditionally there were several cultural subdivisions among the Klamath, based on the location of their residency within the Klamath Basin. Despite this, the five recognized tribelets mutually considered each other the same ethnic group, about 1,200 people in total. Like many Indigenous cultures of the Pacific Northwest, the Klamath lived a semi-sedentary life. Winter settlements were in permanent locations that were reoccupied annually. Construction of the earth-lodges would begin in Autumn, with materials salvaged from abandoned, dilapidated buildings made in previous years.  |Leslie_Spier|Leslie_Spier|  has detailed some of the winter settlement patterns for Klamath as follows:     The towns are not isolated, compact groups of houses, but stretch along the banks for half a mile or more. In fact, the settlements on  |Williamson_river|Williamson_River|  below the  |Sprague_river|Sprague_River|  junction form a practically continuous string of houses for five or six miles, the house pits being, in many spots, crowded close together. Informants insisted that many of these were occupied at the same time. When we consider that these earth-lodges may have housed several families, there is strong suggestion of a considerable population.       Marriage was a unique practice for the Klamath, compared to neighboring cultures found in the borderlands of modern  |Oregon|Oregon| ,  |California|California| ,  |Nevada|Nevada|  and  |Idaho|Idaho| . For example, unlike the  |Hupa|Hupa| ,  |Karok|Karok| , and  |Yurok|Yurok| , the Klamath didnt hold formal talks between families for a bride price. Especially notable was the cultural norm that allowed wives to leave husbands, as they were in no sense chattel ... and certainly cannot be disposed of as a possession.        The Klamath use  |Apocynum_cannabinum|Apocynum_Cannabinum|  as a fiber and eat the roots of  |Lomatium_canbyi|Lomatium_Canbyi| . They use the rootstocks of  |Sagittaria_cuneata|Sagittaria_Cuneata|  as food. Coville, Frederick V., 1897, Notes On The Plants Used By The Klamath Indians Of Oregon., Contributions from the U.S. National Herbarium 5:87-110, page 90             |Dentalium_shells|Dentalium_Shell|  were common among the Klamath prior to colonization. Compared to other native cultures dentalium didnt hold as much financial use among the Klamath. However, longer shells were generally held to be more valuable. Nonetheless these shells were esteemed primarily for as jewelry and personal adornment. Septum piercings were commonly given to younger members of Klamath families to allow inserting dentalium. Some individuals wouldnt however use any shells in their septum. Spier gives the following account for their usage:     The septum of the nose is pierced and the ear lobes, the latter twice or even more frequently. Both sexes insert dentalium shells horizontally through the septum ... Ear pendants are a group of four dentalia hung in a bunch by their tips.     The use of dentalium in septum piercings, in addition to other means of ornamentation, was common among the  |Wasco-Wishram|Wasco-Wishram|  as well.       The Klamath people are grouped with the  |Plateau_Indians|Plateau_Indians|   the peoples who originally lived on the  |Columbia_River_Plateau|Columbia_River_Plateau| . They were most closely linked with the Modoc people.            The Klamath spoke one dialect of the  |Klamath–Modoc_language|Klamath_Language|  - the northern or fi-ukshikni dialect, the other - the southern dialect being spoken by the  |Modoc_people|Modoc_People| , who lived south of the Klamath. Once thought to be a language isolate, Klamath–Modoc is now considered a member of the  |Plateau_Penutian|Plateau_Penutian|  language family.     Both the Klamath and the Modoc called themselves maqlaqs, maqlags or Maklaks meaning people . When they wanted to distinguish between themselves they added knii , the Klamath were called ?ewksiknii, people of the Lake , and the Modoc were called moowatdalknii, people of the south .        |Natalie_Ball|Natalie_Ball|.
