              Radar is a detection system that uses  |radio_waves|Radio_Wave|  to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect  |aircraft|Aircraft| ,  |ships|Marine_Radar| ,  |spacecraft|Spacecraft| ,  |guided_missiles|Guided_Missiles| ,  |motor_vehicles|Motor_Vehicle| ,  |weather_formations|Weather_Radar| , and  |terrain|Terrain-Following_Radar| . A radar system consists of a  |transmitter|Transmitter|  producing  |electromagnetic_waves|Electromagnetic_Wave|  in the  |radio|Radio_Spectrum|  or  |microwaves|Microwave|  domain, a transmitting  |antenna|Antenna| , a receiving antenna and a  |receiver|Radio_Receiver|  and  |processor|Data_Processing_System|  to determine properties of the object. Radio waves from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the objects location and speed.     Radar was developed secretly for  |military|Military|  use by several nations in the period before and during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . A key development was the  |cavity_magnetron|Cavity_Magnetron|  in the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  as an  |acronym|Acronym_And_Initialism|  for RAdio Detection And Ranging.  McGraw-Hill dictionary of scientific and technical terms / Daniel N. Lapedes, editor in chief. Lapedes, Daniel N. New York ; Montreal : McGraw-Hill, 1976. 1634, A26 p. The term radar has since entered  |English|English_Language|  and other languages as a common noun,  |losing_all_capitalization|Acronymall-Caps_Style| .The following derivation was also suggested during RAF RADAR courses in 1954/5: at Yatesbury Training Camp: Radio Azimuth Direction And Ranging:.The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control,  |radar_astronomy|Radar_Astronomy| ,  |air-defense_systems|Antiaircraft_Warfare| ,  |antimissile_systems|Close-In_Weapon_System| ,  |marine_radars|Marine_Radar|  to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anticollision systems,  |ocean_surveillance|Research_Vessel|  systems, outer  |space_surveillance|Space_Surveillance|  and  |rendezvous|Space_Rendezvous|  systems,  |meteorological|Meteorology|  precipitation monitoring, altimetry and  |flight_control_systems|Flight_Control_System| ,  |guided_missile|Precision-Guided_Munition|  target locating systems, and  |ground-penetrating_radar|Ground-Penetrating_Radar|  for geological observations. High tech radar systems are associated with  |digital_signal_processing|Digital_Signal_Processing| ,  |machine_learning|Machine_Learning|  and are capable of extracting useful information from very high  |noise|Noise|  levels. Radar is a key technology that the self-driving systems are mainly designed to use, along with sonar and other sensors.      Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the  |electromagnetic_spectrum|Electromagnetic_Spectrum| . One example is  |LIDAR|Lidar| , which uses predominantly  |infrared_light|Infrared_Light|  from  |lasers|Laser|  rather than radio waves. With the emergence of driverless vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents.               As early as 1886, German physicist  |Heinrich_Hertz|Heinrich_Hertz|  showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. In 1895,  |Alexander_Popov|Alexander_Stepanovich_Popov| , a physics instructor at the  |Imperial_Russian_Navy|Imperial_Russian_Navy|  school in  |Kronstadt|Kronstadt| , developed an apparatus using a  |coherer|Coherer|  tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a  |spark-gap_transmitter|Spark-Gap_Transmitter| . In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| , he took note of an  |interference_beat|Interference_Beat|  caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation. Kostenko, A.A., A.I. Nosich, and I.A. Tishchenko, Radar Prehistory, Soviet Side, Proc. of IEEE APS International Symposium 2001, vol. 4. p. 44, 2003     The German inventor  |Christian_Hülsmeyer|Christian_Hülsmeyer|  was the first to use radio waves to detect the presence of distant metallic objects . In 1904, he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog, but not its distance from the transmitter.  He obtained a patent  for his detection device in April 1904 and later a patent  for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship. He also obtained a British patent on September 23, 1904  for a full radar system, that he called a telemobiloscope. It operated on a 50  cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark-gap. His system already used the classic antenna setup of horn antenna with parabolic reflector and was presented to German military officials in practical tests in  |Cologne|Cologne|  and  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam|  harbour but was rejected.      In 1915,  |Robert_Watson-Watt|Robert_Watson-Watt|  used radio technology to provide advance warning to airmen  and during the 1920s went on to lead the U.K. research establishment to make many advances using radio techniques, including the probing of the  |ionosphere|Ionosphere|  and the detection of  |lightning|Lightning|  at long distances. Through his lightning experiments, Watson-Watt became an expert on the use of  |radio_direction_finding|Radio_Direction_Finding|  before turning his inquiry to  |shortwave|Shortwave|  transmission. Requiring a suitable receiver for such studies, he told the new boy  |Arnold_Frederic_Wilkins|Arnold_Frederic_Wilkins|  to conduct an extensive review of available shortwave units. Wilkins would select a  |General_Post_Office|General_Post_Office|  model after noting its manuals description of a fading effect when aircraft flew overhead.     Across the Atlantic in 1922, after placing a transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the  |Potomac_River|Potomac_River| , U.S. Navy researchers  |A._Hoyt_Taylor|A._Hoyt_Taylor|  and  |Leo_C._Young|Leo_C._Young|  discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later,  |Lawrence_A._Hyland|Lawrence_A._Hyland|  at the  |Naval_Research_Laboratory|Naval_Research_Laboratory|  observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application Hyland, L.A, A.H. Taylor, and L.C. Young; System for detecting objects by radio, U.S. Patent No. 1981884, granted 27 Nov. 1934 as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio-echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL, where Taylor and Young were based at the time. Howeth, Linwood S.; Radar, Ch. XXXVIII in History of Communications -Electronics in the United States Navy, 1963;           Before the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , researchers in the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| ,  |France|French_Third_Republic| ,  |Germany|Nazi_Germany| ,  |Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy| ,  |Japan|Japanese_Empire| , the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , and the  |United_States|United_States| , independently and in great secrecy, developed technologies that led to the modern version of radar.  |Australia|Australia| ,  |Canada|Canada| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| , and  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  followed prewar Great Britains radar development, and  |Hungary|Regency_Of_Hungary|  generated its radar technology during the war.      In France in 1934, following systematic studies on the  |split-anode_magnetron|Cavity_Magnetronsplit-Anode_Magnetron| , the research branch of the  |Compagnie_Générale_de_Télégraphie_Sans_Fil|Thomson-Csf|  headed by Maurice Ponte with Henri Gutton, Sylvain Berline and M. Hugon, began developing an obstacle-locating radio apparatus, aspects of which were installed on the ocean liner  |Normandie|Ss_Normandie|  in 1935.  Frederick Seitz, Norman G. Einspruch, Electronic Genie: The Tangled History of Silicon - 1998 - page 104     During the same period, Soviet military engineer  |P.K._Oshchepkov|Pavel_K._Oshchepkov| , in collaboration with  |Leningrad_Electrophysical_Institute|Saint_Petersburg_State_Electrotechnical_University| , produced an experimental apparatus, RAPID, capable of detecting an aircraft within 3  km of a receiver. John Erickson. Radio-Location and the Air Defence Problem: The Design and Development of Soviet Radar. Science Studies, vol. 2, no. 3 , pp. 241–263 The Soviets produced their first mass production radars RUS-1 and RUS-2 Redut in 1939 but further development was slowed following the arrest of Oshchepkov and his subsequent  |gulag|Gulag|  sentence. In total, only 607 Redut stations were produced during the war. The first Russian airborne radar,  |Gneiss-2|Gneiss-2| , entered into service in June 1943 on  |Pe-2|Petlyakov_Pe-2|  dive bombers. More than 230 Gneiss-2 stations were produced by the end of 1944.  The French and Soviet systems, however, featured continuous-wave operation that did not provide the full performance ultimately synonymous with modern radar systems.     Full radar evolved as a pulsed system, and the first such elementary apparatus was demonstrated in December 1934 by the American  |Robert_M._Page|Robert_Morris_Page| , working at the  |Naval_Research_Laboratory|Naval_Research_Laboratory| . Page, Robert Morris, The Origin of Radar, Doubleday Anchor, New York, 1962, p. 66 The following year, the  |United_States_Army|United_States_Army|  successfully tested a primitive surface-to-surface radar to aim  |coastal_battery|Coastal_Artillery| |searchlights|Searchlight|  at night.  This design was followed by a pulsed system demonstrated in May 1935 by  |Rudolf_Kühnhold|Rudolf_Kühnhold|  and the firm  in Germany and then another in June 1935 by an  |Air_Ministry|Air_Ministry|  team led by  |Robert_Watson-Watt|Robert_Watson-Watt|  in Great Britain.              In 1935, Watson-Watt was asked to judge recent reports of a German radio-based  |death_ray|Death_Ray|  and turned the request over to Wilkins. Wilkins returned a set of calculations demonstrating the system was basically impossible. When Watson-Watt then asked what such a system might do, Wilkins recalled the earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference. This revelation led to the  |Daventry_Experiment|Daventry_Experiment|  of 26 February 1935, using a powerful  |BBC|Bbc|  shortwave transmitter as the source and their GPO receiver setup in a field while a bomber flew around the site. When the plane was clearly detected,  |Hugh_Dowding|Hugh_Dowding| , the  |Air_Member_for_Supply_and_Research|Air_Member_For_Supply_And_Research|  was very impressed with their systems potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development.  Watson-Watts team patented the device in GB593017.    on www.radar-france.fr  official site of the Patent Office       Development of radar greatly expanded on 1 September 1936 when Watson-Watt became Superintendent of a new establishment under the British  |Air_Ministry|Air_Ministry| , Bawdsey Research Station located in  |Bawdsey_Manor|Bawdsey_Manor| , near Felixstowe, Suffolk. Work there resulted in the design and installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called  |Chain_Home|Chain_Home|  along the East and South coasts of England in time for the outbreak of World War II in 1939. This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the  |Battle_of_Britain|Battle_Of_Britain| ; without it, significant numbers of fighter aircraft, which Great Britain did not have available, would always need to be in the air to respond quickly. If enemy aircraft detection relied solely on the observations of ground-based individuals, Great Britain may have lost the Battle of Britain. Also vital was the  |Dowding_system|Dowding_System|  of reporting and coordination to provide the best use of radar information during the tests of early radar  |deployment|Chain_Homedeployment|  during 1936 and 1937.     Given all required funding and development support, the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment. By 1936, the first five  |Chain_Home|Chain_Home|  systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland. Even by standards of the era, CH was crude; instead of broadcasting and receiving from an aimed antenna, CH broadcast a signal floodlighting the entire area in front of it, and then used one of Watson-Watts own radio direction finders to determine the direction of the returned echoes. This fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies.          A key development was the  |cavity_magnetron|Cavity_Magnetron|  in the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. Britain shared the technology with the U.S. during the 1940  |Tizard_Mission|Tizard_Mission| .       In April 1940,  Popular Science  showed an example of a radar unit using the Watson-Watt patent in an article on air defence.  Also, in late 1941 Popular Mechanics had an article in which a U.S. scientist speculated about the British early warning system on the English east coast and came close to what it was and how it worked.  Watson-Watt was sent to the U.S. in 1941 to advise on air defense after Japans  |attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor| .   |Alfred_Lee_Loomis|Alfred_Lee_Loomis|  organized the secret  |MIT_Radiation_Laboratory|Mit_Radiation_Laboratory|  at  |Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology| , Cambridge, Massachusetts which developed microwave radar technology in the years 1941–45. Later, in 1943, Page greatly improved radar with the  |monopulse_technique|Monopulse_Radar|  that was used for many years in most radar applications.      The war precipitated research to find better resolution, more portability, and more features for radar, including complementary navigation systems like  |Oboe|Oboe|  used by the  |RAFs_Pathfinder|Pathfinder| .            The information provided by radar includes the bearing and range of the object from the radar scanner. It is thus used in many different fields where the need for such positioning is crucial. The first use of radar was for military purposes: to locate air, ground and sea targets. This evolved in the civilian field into applications for aircraft, ships, and roads.       In  |aviation|Aviation| , aircraft can be equipped with radar devices that warn of aircraft or other obstacles in or approaching their path, display weather information, and give accurate altitude readings. The first commercial device fitted to aircraft was a 1938 Bell Lab unit on some  |United_Air_Lines|United_Air_Lines|  aircraft. Aircraft can land in fog at airports equipped with radar-assisted  |ground-controlled_approach|Ground-Controlled_Approach|  systems in which the planes position is observed on radar screens by operators who radio landing instructions to the pilot, maintaining the aircraft on a defined approach path to the runway. Military fighter aircraft are usually fitted with air-to-air targeting radars, to detect and target enemy aircraft. In addition, larger specialized military aircraft carry powerful airborne radars to observe air traffic over a wide region and direct fighter aircraft towards targets.      |Marine_radars|Marine_Radar|  are used to measure the bearing and distance of ships to prevent collision with other ships, to navigate, and to fix their position at sea when within range of shore or other fixed references such as islands, buoys, and lightships. In port or in harbour,  |vessel_traffic_service|Vessel_Traffic_Service|  radar systems are used to monitor and regulate ship movements in busy waters.      Meteorologists use radar to monitor  |precipitation|Precipitation|  and wind. It has become the primary tool for short-term  |weather_forecast|Weather_Forecast| ing and watching for  |severe_weather|Severe_Weather|  such as  |thunderstorms|Thunderstorm| ,  |tornado|Tornado| es,  |winter_storms|Winter_Storm| , precipitation types, etc.  |Geologists|Geologist|  use specialized  |ground-penetrating_radars|Ground-Penetrating_Radar|  to map the composition of  |Earths_crust|Crust| . Police forces use  |radar_guns|Radar_Gun|  to monitor vehicle speeds on the roads. Smaller radar systems are used to  |detect_human_movement|Motion_Detector| . Examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring  and hand and finger  |gesture_detection|Gesture_Recognition|  for computer interaction.  Automatic door opening, light activation and intruder sensing are also common.            A radar system has a  |transmitter|Transmitter|  that emits  |radio_waves|Radio_Wave|  called radar signals in predetermined directions. When these come into contact with an object they are usually  |reflected|Reflection|  or  |scattered|Scattering|  in many directions. But some of them absorb and penetrate into the target to some degree. Radar signals are reflected especially well by materials of considerable  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity| —especially by most metals, by  |seawater|Seawater|  and by wet ground. Some of these make the use of  |radar_altimeters|Radar_Altimeter|  possible. The radar signals that are reflected back towards the transmitter are the desirable ones that make radar work. If the object is moving either toward or away from the transmitter, there is a slight equivalent change in the  |frequency|Frequency|  of the radio waves, caused by the  |Doppler_effect|Doppler_Effect| .     Radar receivers are usually, but not always, in the same location as the transmitter. Although the reflected radar signals captured by the receiving antenna are usually very weak, they can be strengthened by  |electronic_amplifiers|Amplifier| . More sophisticated methods of  |signal_processing|Signal_Processing|  are also used in order to recover useful radar signals.     The weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which it passes is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges—ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as  |visible_light|Visible_Light| ,  |infrared_light|Infrared_Light| , and  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet_Light| , are too strongly attenuated. Such weather phenomena as fog, clouds, rain, falling snow, and sleet that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or atmospheric gases are avoided in designing radars, except when their detection is intended.         Radar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from the  |Sun|Sun|  or the  |Moon|Moon| , or from  |electromagnetic_waves|Electromagnetic_Wave|  emitted by the objects themselves, such as infrared wavelengths . This process of directing artificial radio waves towards objects is called illumination, although radio waves are invisible to the human eye or optical cameras.               If  |electromagnetic_waves|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  travelling through one material meet another material, having a different  |dielectric_constant|Dielectric_Constant|  or  |diamagnetic_constant|Diamagnetism|  from the first,   the waves will reflect or scatter from the boundary between the materials. This means that a solid object in  |air|Earths_Atmosphere|  or in a  |vacuum|Vacuum| , or a significant change in atomic density between the object and what is surrounding it, will usually scatter radar waves from its surface. This is particularly true for  |electrically_conductive|Electrical_Conduction|  materials such as metal and carbon fibre, making radar well-suited to the detection of aircraft and ships.  |Radar_absorbing_material|Radar_Absorbing_Material| , containing  |resistive|Electrical_Resistance|  and sometimes  |magnetic|Magnetism|  substances, is used on military vehicles to  |reduce_radar_reflection|Stealth_Technology| . This is the radio equivalent of painting something a dark colour so that it cannot be seen by the eye at night.     Radar waves scatter in a variety of ways depending on the size of the radio wave and the shape of the target. If the wavelength is much shorter than the targets size, the wave will bounce off in a way similar to the way light is reflected by a  |mirror|Mirror| . If the wavelength is much longer than the size of the target, the target may not be visible because of poor reflection. Low-frequency radar technology is dependent on resonances for detection, but not identification, of targets. This is described by  |Rayleigh_scattering|Rayleigh_Scattering| , an effect that creates Earths blue sky and red  |sunsets|Sunset| . When the two length scales are comparable, there may be  |resonances|Resonance| . Early radars used very long wavelengths that were larger than the targets and thus received a vague signal, whereas many modern systems use shorter wavelengths  that can image objects as small as a loaf of bread.     Short radio waves reflect from curves and corners in a way similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most reflective targets for short wavelengths have 90° angles between the  |reflective_surfaces|Reflection| . A  |corner_reflector|Corner_Reflector|  consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the inside corner of a box. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to odd looking  |stealth_aircraft|Stealth_Aircraft| . These precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of  |diffraction|Diffraction| , especially at longer wavelengths. Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as  |chaff|Chaff| , are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its  |radar_cross_section|Radar_Cross_Section| .       The power P r  returning to the receiving antenna is given by the equation:     : P      where   P t transmitter power   G t  |gain|Antenna_Gain|  of the transmitting antenna   A r  |effective_aperture|Effective_Aperture|  of the receiving antenna; this can also be expressed as   , where   :   transmitted wavelength   : G r gain of receiving antenna    σ  |radar_cross_section|Radar_Cross_Section| , or scattering coefficient, of the target   F pattern propagation factor   R t distance from the transmitter to the target   R r distance from the target to the receiver.     In the common case where the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location, R t R r and the term R t ² R r ² can be replaced by R 4 , where R is the range.   This yields:   : Pr .     This shows that the received power declines as the fourth power of the range, which means that the received power from distant targets is relatively very small.     Additional filtering and pulse integration modifies the radar equation slightly for  |pulse-Doppler_radar_performance|Pulse-Doppler_Radarperformance| , which can be used to increase detection range and reduce transmit power.     The equation above with F 1 is a simplification for transmission in a  |vacuum|Vacuum|  without interference. The propagation factor accounts for the effects of  |multipath|Multipath_Propagation|  and shadowing and depends on the details of the environment. In a real-world situation,  |pathloss|Pathloss|  effects should also be considered.          Frequency shift is caused by motion that changes the number of wavelengths between the reflector and the radar. This can degrade or enhance radar performance depending upon how it affects the detection process. As an example,  |Moving_Target_Indication|Moving_Target_Indication|  can interact with Doppler to produce signal cancellation at certain radial velocities, which degrades performance.     Sea-based radar systems,  |semi-active_radar_homing|Semi-Active_Radar_Homing| ,  |active_radar_homing|Active_Radar_Homing| ,  |weather_radar|Weather_Radar| , military aircraft, and  |radar_astronomy|Radar_Astronomy|  rely on the Doppler effect to enhance performance. This produces information about target velocity during the detection process. This also allows small objects to be detected in an environment containing much larger nearby slow moving objects.     Doppler shift depends upon whether the radar configuration is active or passive. Active radar transmits a signal that is reflected back to the receiver. Passive radar depends upon the object sending a signal to the receiver.     The Doppler frequency shift for active radar is as follows, where FD is Doppler frequency, FT is transmit frequency, VR is radial velocity, and C is the speed of light:      : FD 2   FT     .     Passive radar is applicable to  |electronic_countermeasures|Electronic_Countermeasures|  and  |radio_astronomy|Radio_Astronomy|  as follows:     : FD FT     .     Only the radial component of the velocity is relevant. When the reflector is moving at right angle to the radar beam, it has no relative velocity. Vehicles and weather moving parallel to the radar beam produce the maximum Doppler frequency shift.     When the transmit frequency is pulsed, using a pulse repeat frequency of FR , the resulting frequency spectrum will contain harmonic frequencies above and below FT with a distance of FR . As a result, the Doppler measurement is only non-ambiguous if the Doppler frequency shift is less than half of FR , called the  |Nyquist_frequency|Nyquist_Frequency| , since the returned frequency otherwise cannot be distinguished from shifting of a harmonic frequency above or below, thus requiring:     :  FD    .
