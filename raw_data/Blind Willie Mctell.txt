              Blind Willie McTell  was a  |Piedmont_blues|Piedmont_Blues|  and  |ragtime|Ragtime|  singer and guitarist. He played with a fluid, syncopated  |fingerstyle_guitar|Fingerstyle_Guitar|  technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues. Unlike his contemporaries, he came to use  |twelve-string_guitars|Twelve-String_Guitar|  exclusively. McTell was also an adept  |slide_guitarist|Slide| , unusual among ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back  |tenor|Tenor| , differed greatly from many of the harsher voices of  |Delta|Delta_Blues|  bluesmen such as  |Charley_Patton|Charley_Patton| . McTell performed in various musical styles, including  |blues|Blues| ,  |ragtime|Ragtime| ,  |religious_music|Gospel_Music|  and  |hokum|Hokum| .     McTell was born in  |Thomson,_Georgia|Thomson,_Georgia| . He learned to play the guitar in his early teens. He soon became a street performer in several Georgia cities, including  |Atlanta|Atlanta|  and  |Augusta|Augusta,_Georgia| , and first recorded in 1927 for  |Victor_Records|Victor_Records| . He never produced a major  |hit_record|Hit_Record| , but he had a prolific recording career with different labels and under different names in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1940, he was recorded by the folklorist  |John_A._Lomax|John_A._Lomax|  and  |Ruby_Terrill_Lomax|Ruby_Terrill_Lomax|  for the folk song archive of the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress| . He was active in the 1940s and 1950s, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime associate  |Curley_Weaver|Curley_Weaver| . Twice more he recorded professionally. His last recordings originated during an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner in 1956. McTell died three years later, having suffered for years from diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his lack of commercial success, he was one of the few blues musicians of his generation who continued to actively play and record during the 1940s and 1950s. He did not live to see the  |American_folk_music_revival|American_Folk_Music_Revival| , in which many other bluesmen were rediscovered .     McTells influence extended over a wide variety of artists, including the  |Allman_Brothers_Band|The_Allman_Brothers_Band| , who covered his  |Statesboro_Blues|Statesboro_Blues|  , and  |Bob_Dylan|Bob_Dylan| , who paid tribute to him in his 1983 song  |Blind_Willie_McTell|Blind_Willie_Mctell|  , the refrain of which is And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell . Other artists influenced by McTell include  |Taj_Mahal|Taj_Mahal| ,  |Alvin_Youngblood_Hart|Alvin_Youngblood_Hart| ,  |Ralph_McTell|Ralph_Mctell| ,  |Chris_Smither|Chris_Smither| ,  |Jack_White|Jack_White| , and the  |White_Stripes|The_White_Stripes| .       He was born William Samuel McTier Conner, Patrick.   . East Coast Piedmont Blues. University of North Carolina. Retrieved 2011-06-30. in  |Thomson,_Georgia|Thomson,_Georgia| . Most sources give the date of his birth as 1898, but researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1903, on the basis of his entry in the  |1910_census|1910_Census| .  McTell was born  |blind|Blindness|  in one eye and lost his remaining vision by late childhood. He attended schools for the blind in Georgia, New York and Michigan and showed proficiency in music from an early age, first playing the harmonica and accordion, learning to read and write music in  |Braille|Braille| , and turning to the six-string guitar in his early teens. Jacobs, Hal.  . The New Georgia Encyclopedia. 2009-11-03. Retrieved 2011-06-30. His family background was rich in music; both of his parents and an uncle played the guitar. He was related to the bluesman and gospel pioneer  |Thomas_A._Dorsey|Thomas_A._Dorsey| . McTells father left the family when Willie was young. After his mother died, in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became an itinerant musician, or  |songster|Songster|  . He began his recording career in 1927 for  |Victor_Records|Victor_Records|  in  |Atlanta|Atlanta| . Green, Justin. Musical Legends. .     McTell married Ruth Kate Williams, now better known as  |Kate_McTell|Kate_Mctell| , in 1934. She accompanied him on stage and on several recordings before becoming a nurse in 1939. For most of their marriage, from 1942 until his death, they lived apart, she in  |Fort_Gordon|Fort_Gordon| , near Augusta, and he working around Atlanta.     In the years before  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , McTell traveled and performed widely, recording for several labels under different names: Blind Willie McTell , Blind Sammie , Georgia Bill , Hot Shot Willie , Blind Willie , Barrelhouse Sammie , and Pig & Whistle Red .  The appellation Pig & Whistle was a reference to a chain of barbecue restaurants in Atlanta;  McTell often played for tips in the parking lot of a Pig n Whistle restaurant. He also played behind a nearby building that later became Ray Lees Blue Lantern Lounge. Like  |Lead_Belly|Lead_Belly| , another songster who began his career as a street artist, McTell favored the somewhat unwieldy and unusual  |twelve-string_guitar|Twelve-String_Guitar| , whose greater volume made it suitable for outdoor playing.     In 1940 John A. Lomax and his wife,  |Ruby_Terrill_Lomax|Ruby_Terrill_Lomax| , a professor of  |classics|Classics|  at the  |University_of_Texas_at_Austin|University_Of_Texas_At_Austin| , interviewed and recorded McTell for the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress in a two-hour session held in their hotel room in Atlanta.  These recordings document McTells distinctive musical style, which bridges the gap between the raw country blues of the early part of the 20th century and the more conventionally melodious,  |ragtime|Ragtime| -influenced East Coast Piedmont blues sound. The Lomaxes also elicited from the singer traditional songs  and spirituals ,  which were not part of his usual commercial repertoire. In the interview, John A. Lomax is heard asking if McTell knows any complaining songs , to which the singer replies somewhat uncomfortably and evasively that he does not. The Library of Congress paid McTell $10, the equivalent of $154.56 in 2011, for this two-hour session. The material from this 1940 session was issued in 1960 as an LP and later as a CD, under the somewhat misleading title The Complete Library of Congress Recordings, notwithstanding the fact that it was truncated, in that it omitted some of John A. Lomaxs interactions with the singer and entirely omitted the contributions of Ruby Terrill Lomax. McTells biographer  |Michael_Gray|Michael_Gray|  attributes these omissions to the folklore archivist Rae Korson, who was evidently hostile to his New Deal folklore predecessors at the library: The widely sold version of the McTell-Lomax sessions deletes conversations and information, removes Ruby Lomax from the room almost entirely—making John Lomax seem to monopolize things and keep her silent, which he doesn’t at all—and robs Lomax of several touches of warmth and humanity, including questions asked by Ruby Terrill and John Lomax. Gray, Michael . Hand Me My Travelin’ Shoes: In Search of Blind Willie McTell. Chicago Review Press. p. 273.     McTell recorded for  |Atlantic_Records|Atlantic_Records|  and  |Regal_Records|Regal_Records|  in 1949, but these recordings met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform around Atlanta, but his career was cut short by ill health, mostly due to  |diabetes|Diabetes|  and alcoholism. In 1956, an Atlanta record store manager, Edward Rhodes, discovered McTell playing in the street for quarters and enticed him with a bottle of corn liquor into his store, where he captured a few final performances on a tape recorder. These recordings were released posthumously by Prestige/ |Bluesville_Records|Bluesville_Records|  as Last Session.  Beginning in 1957, McTell was a preacher at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Atlanta.     McTell died of a stroke in  |Milledgeville,_Georgia|Milledgeville,_Georgia| , in 1959. He was buried at Jones Grove Church, near Thomson, Georgia, his birthplace. A fan paid to have a gravestone erected on his resting place. The name given on his gravestone is Willie Samuel McTier.

In his recordings of Lay Some Flowers on My Grave , Lord, Send Me an Angel and Statesboro Blues , he pronounces his surname MacTell, with the stress on the first syllable.          One of McTells most famous songs,  |Statesboro_Blues|Statesboro_Blues|  , was frequently covered by the  |Allman_Brothers_Band|The_Allman_Brothers_Band| ;  it also contributes to Canned Heats Goin Up the Country .
