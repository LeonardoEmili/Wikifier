           A kludge or kluge  is a  |workaround|Workaround|  or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend and hard to maintain. This term is used in diverse fields such as  |computer_science|Computer_Science| ,  |aerospace_engineering|Aerospace_Engineering| ,  |Internet_slang|Internet_Slang| ,  |evolutionary_neuroscience|Evolutionary_Neuroscience| , and government. A software kludge is frequently the result of hacking. See photo of A network kludge at right.       The word has alternate spellings , pronunciations  and several proposed  |etymologies|Etymologies| .       In the  Oxford English Dictionary  , the kludge entry cites one source for this words earliest recorded usage, definition and  |etymology|Etymology| |computer_magazine|Computer_Magazine|   Datamation .    kludge  Also kluge. J. W. Granholms jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also bodge v., fudge v. This OED2 defines these two kludge  |cognates|Cognate|  as bodge to patch or mend clumsily and fudge to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner . An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole ; esp. in Computing, a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or bodged together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or bug. ...     Although OED accepts Granholms definition and credits him with the invention, examples of its use before the 1960s exist.     A source of some confusion has been Granholms jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer, Phineas Burling, of the firm Fink and Wiggles  as confirming the Germanic origin of the word.     A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word kludge first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between Kings Lynn and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.     The word kludge is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German klug , originally meaning smart or witty . In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word Kludge eventually came to mean not so smart or pretty ridiculous . Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole.     It is in this latter sense that Kludge is used by computer hardware men. Today kludge forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that thats the way computers are .        Claims about derivation from the German adjective  are unlikely for the following reasons:   There is no equivalent usage in German   Both pronunciations of the word contain the  |soft_g|Soft_G|  , which is not present in German   The word emerges in English only in the 20th century   The alleged Swedish translation, klag, is incorrect and would properly be spelled klok.       American  |Yiddish|Yiddish|  speakers use   to mean too smart by half , the reflected meaning of German  . This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary, as well as the pronunciation variation from German.        It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge . Even if Burlings etymology were true, it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers, who began using the term in the 20th century, could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding 400 years.     This OED2 entry also includes the verb kludge and kludgemanship .       The  |Jargon_File|Jargon_File|  , which is a  |glossary|Glossary|  of computer programmer slang maintained by  |Eric_S._Raymond|Eric_S._Raymond| , differentiates kludge from kluge and cites usage examples predating 1962.   kludge   /kluhj/ n. Incorrect spelling of kluge . These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II.   A crock that works.    v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. Ive kludged around it for now, but Ill fix it up properly later.    This Jargon File entry notes kludge apparently derives via British military slang from  |Scots|Scots_Language|  cludge or cludgie   meaning a common toilet , and became confused with U.S. kluge during or after World War II.   kluge |Rube_Goldberg|Rube_Goldberg|   device, whether in hardware or software.   n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock.   n. Something that works for the wrong reason.   vt. To insert a kluge into a program. Ive kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but theres probably a better way.    |WPI|Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute|  n. A feature that is implemented in a rude manner.   This entry notes kluge, which is now often spelled kludge, was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges . The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from  |naval|Navy|  slang  or printing equipment.     Kluge was common Navy slang in the  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea . A 1947 article in the New York Folklore Quarterly recorded the classic  |shaggy_dog_story|Shaggy_Dog_Story|  Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker then current in the Armed Forces, in which a kluge was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function.      The term kluge as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to 1947, as evidenced by the article in the New York Folklore Quarterly, but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense. The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above:     On being drafted into the navy, Murgatroyd gave his profession as kluge maker . Not wanting to seem ignorant, the clerk simply wrote this down. Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing, he said he was making a kluge, and actually he was one of the worlds best kluge makers. Not wanting to seem ignorant, his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions, until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore.     One day the admiral came to inspect the ship. When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker, the admiral asked him what a kluge was  – the first person ever to do so. Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain, but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was. After a couple of days, he returned with a complex object.     Interesting, said the admiral, but what does it do? In reply, Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship. As the thing sank, it went kluge .      The Jargon File further includes kluge around to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge , kluge up to lash together a quick hack to perform a task . After Granholms 1962 How to Design a Kludge article popularized the kluge variant kludge, both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:   The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as kludge. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the words meaning.         Another hypothesis dates to 1907, when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from  |Oslo,_Norway|Oslo,_Norway|  named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm . In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair  — but oh, so clever! The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing claims that the term kluge was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for hardware kluges .  The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say,  |TMRC|Tmrc|  and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang . It seems likely that kluge came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war . This would explain the terms introduction to the software community.         Other suggested  |folk_etymologies|Folk_Etymologies|  or  |backronyms|Backronyms|  for kludge or kluge is from klumsy, lame, ugly, dumb, but good enough, or klutzy lashup, under-going engineering.      The term kludge would then seem to have independent origins, possibly in Britain. The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings. However, kluge seems to have the sense of overcomplicated, while kludge has only the sense of poorly done.     Cf. German  ,  |Low_Saxon|Low_German|  klut, klute, Dutch ,  perhaps related to Low German diminutive klütje , Danish  |Jutland_dial.|Jutlandic_Dialect|  klyt ,  and Standard  |Danish|Danish_Language|   .           In  |aerospace|Aerospace| , a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flightworthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.  Marooned , a 1969 film. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, Im in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV. The film was based on the  |1964_novel|Marooned|  of the same name.     Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first  |US|United_States| |space_station|Space_Station| ,  |Skylab|Skylab| . Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the  |Apollo_Telescope_Mount|Apollo_Telescope_Mount| , began development as separate projects . Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the  |Apollo_Applications_Program|Apollo_Applications_Program| , but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its  |Apollo_Command/Service_Module|Apollo_Command/Service_Module|  at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.     The Airlock Modules manufacturer,  |McDonnell_Douglas|Mcdonnell_Douglas| , even recycled the hatch design from its  |Gemini_spacecraft|Project_Gemini|  and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the  |National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administrations|National_Aeronautics_And_Space_Administration| |Marshall_Space_Flight_Center|Marshall_Space_Flight_Center| , was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center  as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight. Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it the kludge .       In modern  |computing|Computer_Science|  terminology, a kludge  is a solution to a problem, the performance of a task, or a fix to a system that is inefficient, inelegant , or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless works. To kludge around something is to avoid a  |bug|Computer_Bug|  or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a  |workaround|Workaround| , only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that hack could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.      A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of  |cruft|Cruft| .     Something might be a kludge if it fails in  |corner_cases|Corner_Case| , but this is a less common sense, as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working  |heuristic|Heuristic|  which was expected to work adequately. An intimate knowledge of the context is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.     An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.     A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a  |computer_program|Computer_Program| . Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.     In computer networking, use of  |NAT|Network_Address_Translation|  or  |PAT|Port_Address_Translation|  to cope with the shortage of  |IPv4|Internet_Protocol|  addresses is an example of a kludge.     In  |FidoNet|Fidonet|  terminology, kludge refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.          The kludge or kluge metaphor has been adapted in fields such as  |evolutionary_neuroscience|Evolutionary_Neuroscience| , particularly in reference to the  |human_brain|Human_Brain| .     The neuroscientist  |David_Linden|David_Linden|  discusses how  |intelligent_design|Intelligent_Design|  proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.   The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. Its not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings despite the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely because of that history.      The research psychologist  |Gary_Marcuss|Gary_Marcus|  book  Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind  compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like  |manifold_vacuum|Manifold_Vacuum| -powered  |windshield_wipers|Windshield_Wipers|   – when you accelerated or drove uphill, Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether.     For instance, the vertebrate eyes  |retina|Retina|  that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front. As a result, all kinds of stuff gets in its way, including a bunch of wiring that passes through the eye and leaves us with a pair of  |blind_spots|Blind_Spot| , one in each eye.        In the science fiction television series  Andromeda , genetically engineered human beings called  |Nietzscheans|Nietzschean|  use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans.     In  |John_Varleys|John_Varley|  1985 short story Press Enter , the antagonist, a reclusive hacker with unprecedented access to many databases, adopts the identity Charles Kluge.     In a 2012 article, the political scientist Steven Teles used the term kludgeocracy to criticize the complexity of social welfare policy in the United States. In the paper, Teles argues that institutional and political obstacles to passing legislation often drives policy makers to accept temporary, imperfect, fixes rather than carefully thought out reforms.
