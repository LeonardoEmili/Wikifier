According to the  |International_Organization_for_Migration|International_Organization_For_Migration| , the number of  |immigrants|Immigration|  in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the  |informal_economy|Informal_Economy|  in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.      Figures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within  |Africa|Africa|  and to a lesser extent in  |Europe|Europe| ; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. Most Congolese emigrants however, remain in Africa, with new destination countries including  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  and various points en route to Europe.     In addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of  |refugees|Refugees|  and  |asylum_seekers|Asylum_Seekers|  located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to  |UNHCR|Unhcr| , there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.       :Roman Catholic 50%, Protestant 20%, Kimbanguist 10%, Muslim 10%, other 10%      |Dependency_ratios|Dependency_Ratio| |_potential_support_ratio|Potential_Support_Ratio|  Retrieved January 13, 2016.       :urban population: 44.5% of total population   :rate of urbanization: 4.53% annual rate of change          :Adult prevalence rate: 0.7%   :People living with HIV/AIDS: 390,000   :Deaths: 17,000       :Degree of risk: very high   :Food or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea,  |hepatitis_A|Hepatitis_A| , and  |typhoid_fever|Typhoid_Fever|    :Vectorborne diseases: malaria, plague, and African trypanosomiasis are high risks in some locations   :Water contact disease: schistosomiasis       :Noun: Congolese   :Adjective: Congolese or Congo       :Definition: age 15 and over can read and write French, Lingala, Kingwana, or Tshiluba   :Total population: 77%   :Male: 88.5%   :Female: 66.5%       :total: 10 years   :male: 11 years   :female: 9 years       :total: 8.7% Country comparison to the world: 134th   :male: 11.3%   :female: 6.8%          The table below shows DRC born people who have emigrated abroad in selected Western countries .
