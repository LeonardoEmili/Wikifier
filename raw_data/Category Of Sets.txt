In the  |mathematical|Mathematics|  field of  |category_theory|Category_Theory| , the category of sets, denoted as Set, is the  |category|Category|  whose  |objects|Category_Theory|  are  |sets|Set| . The arrows or  |morphisms|Morphism|  between sets A and B are the  |total_functions|Total_Function|  from A to B, and the composition of morphisms is the  |composition_of_functions|Function_Composition| .     Many other categories  add structure to the objects of the category of sets and/or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind.       The axioms of a category are satisfied by Set because composition of functions is  |associative|Associative_Property| , and because every set X has an  |identity_function|Identity_Function|  id X : X → X which serves as identity element for function composition.     The  |epimorphisms|Epimorphism|  in Set are the  |surjective|Surjective|  maps, the  |monomorphisms|Monomorphism|  are the  |injective|Injective|  maps, and the  |isomorphisms|Isomorphism|  are the  |bijective|Bijective|  maps.     The  |empty_set|Empty_Set|  serves as the  |initial_object|Initial_Object|  in Set with  |empty_functions|Empty_Function|  as morphisms. Every  |singleton|Singleton|  is a  |terminal_object|Terminal_Object| , with the functions mapping all elements of the source sets to the single target element as morphisms. There are thus no  |zero_objects|Zero_Object|  in Set.     The category Set is  |complete_and_co_complete|Complete_Category| . The  |product|Product|  in this category is given by the  |cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|  of sets. The  |coproduct|Coproduct|  is given by the  |disjoint_union|Disjoint_Union| A i where i ranges over some index set I, we construct the coproduct as the union of A i × .     Set is the prototype of a  |concrete_category|Concrete_Category| ; other categories are concrete if they are built on Set in some well-defined way.     Every two-element set serves as a  |subobject_classifier|Subobject_Classifier|  in Set. The power object of a set A is given by its  |power_set|Power_Set| , and the  |exponential_object|Exponential_Object|  of the sets A and B is given by the set of all functions from A to B. Set is thus a  |topos|Topos|  .     Set is not  |abelian|Abelian_Category| ,  |additive|Additive_Category|  nor  |preadditive|Preadditive_Category| .     Every non-empty set is an  |injective_object|Injective_Object|  in Set. Every set is a  |projective_object|Projective_Module|  in Set .     The  |finitely_presentable_objects|Accessible_Category|  in Set are the finite sets. Since every set is a  |direct_limit|Direct_Limit|  of its finite subsets, the category Set is a  |locally_finitely_presentable_category|Accessible_Category| .     If C is an arbitrary category, the  |contravariant_functors|Contravariant_Functor|  from C to Set are often an important object of study. If A is an object of C, then the functor from C to Set that sends X to Hom C   is an example of such a functor. If C is a  |small_category|Categorysmallandlargecategories|  , then the contravariant functors from C to Set, together with natural transformations as morphisms, form a new category, a  |functor_category|Functor_Category|  known as the category of  |presheaves|Presheaves|  on C.         In  |Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel_Set_Theory|  the collection of all sets is not a set; this follows from the  |axiom_of_foundation|Axiom_Of_Foundation| . One refers to collections that are not sets as  |proper_class|Proper_Class| es. One cannot handle proper classes as one handles sets; in particular, one cannot write that those proper classes belong to a collection . This is a problem because it means that the category of sets cannot be formalized straightforwardly in this setting. Categories like Set whose collection of objects forms a proper class are known as  |large_categories|Large_Category| , to distinguish them from the small categories whose objects form a set.     One way to resolve the problem is to work in a system that gives formal status to proper classes, such as  |NBG_set_theory|Nbg_Set_Theory| . In this setting, categories formed from sets are said to be small and those  that are formed from proper classes are said to be large.     Another solution is to assume the existence of  |Grothendieck_universes|Grothendieck_Universe| . Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set which is itself a model of ZF . The existence of Grothendieck universes  is not implied by the usual ZF axioms; it is an additional, independent axiom, roughly equivalent to the existence of  |strongly_inaccessible_cardinals|Strongly_Inaccessible_Cardinal| . Assuming this extra axiom, one can limit the objects of Set to the elements of a particular universe.      In one variation of this scheme, the class of sets is the union of the entire tower of Grothendieck universes.  However, one does not work directly with the category of all sets . Instead, theorems are expressed in terms of the category Set U whose objects are the elements of a sufficiently large Grothendieck universe U, and are then shown not to depend on the particular choice of U. As a foundation for  |category_theory|Category_Theory| , this approach is well matched to a system like  |Tarski–Grothendieck_set_theory|Tarski–Grothendieck_Set_Theory|  in which one cannot reason directly about proper classes; its principal disadvantage is that a theorem can be true of all Set U but not of Set.     Various other solutions, and variations on the above, have been proposed. Mac Lane 1969 Feferman 1969 Blass 1984     The same issues arise with other concrete categories, such as the  |category_of_groups|Category_Of_Groups|  or the  |category_of_topological_spaces|Category_Of_Topological_Spaces| .
