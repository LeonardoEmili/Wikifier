              Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to  |convert|Energy_Transformation| |light_energy|Light_Energy|  into  |chemical_energy|Chemical_Energy|  that can later be  |released|Cellular_Respiration|  to fuel the organisms activities. This chemical energy is stored in  |carbohydrate|Carbohydrate|  molecules, such as  |sugars|Sugar| , which are synthesized from  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and  |water|Water|  – hence the name photosynthesis, from the  |Greek|Greek_Language| |φῶς|Wikt:Φῶς| , phōs, light , and  |σύνθεσις|Wikt:Σύνθεσις| , synthesis, putting together .    In most cases,  |oxygen|Oxygen|  is also released as a waste product. Most  |plants|Plant| , most  |algae|Algae| , and  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria|  perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called  |photoautotrophs|Photoautotroph| . Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the  |oxygen_content|Atmospheric_Oxygen|  of the Earths atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for  |life_on_Earth|Life| .      Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by  |proteins|Protein|  called  |reaction_centres|Photosynthetic_Reaction_Centre|  that contain green  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside  |organelles|Organelle|  called  |chloroplasts|Chloroplast| , which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the  |plasma_membrane|Plasma_Membrane| . In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip  |electrons|Electron|  from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced  |nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide_Phosphate|  and  |adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  , the energy currency of cells.     In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of  reactions called the  |Calvin_cycle|Calvin_Cycle| ; some bacteria use different mechanisms, such as the  |reverse_Krebs_cycle|Reverse_Krebs_Cycle| , to achieve the same end. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is  |incorporated|Carbon_Fixation|  into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as  |ribulose_bisphosphate|Ribulose_Bisphosphate|  .  Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then  |reduced|Biological_Reductant|  and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as  |glucose|Glucose| .     The first photosynthetic organisms probably  |evolved|Evolved|  early in the  |evolutionary_history_of_life|Evolutionary_History_Of_Life|  and most likely used  |reducing_agents|Reducing_Agent|  such as  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  or  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide| , rather than water, as sources of electrons.  Cyanobacteria appeared later; the  |excess_oxygen|Oxygen_Cycle|  they produced contributed directly to the  |oxygenation_of_the_Earth|Oxygenation_Of_The_Earth| ,  which rendered the  |evolution_of_complex_life|Evolution_Of_Complex_Life|  possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130   |terawatts|Terawatts| ,    which is about eight times the current  |power_consumption_of_human_civilization|Power_Consumption_Of_Human_Civilization| .    Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion  |tons|Ton|   of carbon into  |biomass|Biomass|  per year.            Photosynthetic organisms are  |photoautotrophs|Photoautotroph| , which means that they are able to  |synthesize|Chemical_Synthesis|  food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis;  |photoheterotrophs|Photoheterotroph|  use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called oxygenic photosynthesis and is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in  |plants|Plants| ,  |algae|Algae| , and  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria| , the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of  |anoxygenic_photosynthesis|Anoxygenic_Photosynthesis| , used mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.     Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called  |carbon_fixation|Carbon_Fixation| ; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into  |carbohydrate|Carbohydrate| . Carbon fixation is an  |endothermic|Endothermic| |redox|Redox|  reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of  |cellular_respiration|Cellular_Respiration| |nutrients|Nutrient|  to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organisms  |metabolism|Metabolism| . Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different  |cellular_compartments|Cellular_Compartment| .     The general  |equation|Chemical_Equation|  for photosynthesis as first proposed by  |Cornelis_van_Niel|C._B._Van_Niel|  is therefore:    :  +  +  →  +  +      Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:   :  +  +  →  +  +      This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the  |light-dependent_reaction|Light-Dependent_Reactions|  and a product of the  |light-independent_reaction|Light-Independent_Reactions| , but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation:     :  +  +  →  +      Other processes substitute other compounds  for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to  |arsenate|Arsenate| Anaerobic Photosynthesis,  |Chemical_&_Engineering_News|Chemical_&_Engineering_News| , 86, 33, August 18, 2008, p. 36 The equation for this reaction is:   :  +  +  →  +       Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  and  |NADPH|Nadph| . During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.     Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use  |visible_light|Visible_Spectrum|  for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave  |infrared|Infrared|  or, more specifically, far-red radiation.      Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some  |archaea|Archaea|  use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The  |bacteriorhodopsin|Bacteriorhodopsin|  changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.  , page 14, Martin Ingrouille, Bill Eddie              In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in  |cell_membranes|Cell_Membrane| . In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.  However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called  |thylakoids|Thylakoid| , or bunched up into round  |vesicles|Vesicle|  called intracytoplasmic membranes.  These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.      In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in  |organelles|Organelle|  called  |chloroplasts|Chloroplast| . A typical  |plant_cell|Plant_Cell|  contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids , which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and  |peripheral_membrane_protein|Peripheral_Membrane_Protein|  complexes of the photosynthetic system.     Plants absorb light primarily using the  |pigment|Pigment| |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll| . The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as  |carotenes|Carotene|  and  |xanthophylls|Xanthophyll| .  Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as  |phycocyanin|Phycocyanin| ,  |carotenes|Carotene| , and  |xanthophylls|Xanthophyll|  in  |green_algae|Green_Algae| ,  |phycoerythrin|Phycoerythrin|  in  |red_algae|Red_Algae|  and  |fucoxanthin|Fucoxanthin|  in  |brown_algae|Brown_Algae|  and  |diatoms|Diatoms|  resulting in a wide variety of colors.     These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a  |light-harvesting_complex|Light-Harvesting_Complex| .      Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called  |leaves|Leaf| . Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and  |arid|Arid| ity, such as many  Euphorbia  and  |cactus|Cactus|  species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the  |mesophyll|Mesophyll_Tissue| , can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant  |wax|Wax| y  |cuticle|Plant_Cuticle|  that protects the leaf from excessive  |evaporation|Evaporation|  of water and decreases the absorption of  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  or  |blue|Blue| |light|Light|  to reduce  |heat|Heat| ing. The transparent  |epidermis|Leafepidermis|  layer allows light to pass through to the  |palisade|Mesophyll_Tissue|  mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.             In the  |light-dependent_reactions|Light-Dependent_Reactions| , one molecule of the  |pigment|Pigment| |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  absorbs one  |photon|Photon|  and loses one  |electron|Electron| . This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called  |pheophytin|Pheophytin| , which passes the electron to a  |quinone|Quinone|  molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an  |electron_transport_chain|Electron_Transport_Chain|  that leads to the ultimate reduction of  |NADP|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide_Phosphate|  to  |NADPH|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide_Phosphate| . In addition, this creates a  |proton_gradient|Electrochemical_Gradient|  across the  |chloroplast_membrane|Chloroplast_Membrane| , which is used by  |ATP_synthase|Atp_Synthase|  in the synthesis of  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate| . The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called  |photolysis|Photodissociation| , which releases a  |dioxygen|Dioxygen|  molecule as a waste product.     The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:      :2 H 2 O + 2 NADP + + 3 ADP + 3 P i + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H + + 3 ATP + O 2     Not all  |wavelengths|Wavelength|  of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of  |accessory_pigments|Accessory_Pigment|  present. For example, in green plants, the  |action_spectrum|Action_Spectrum|  resembles the  |absorption_spectrum|Absorption_Spectrum|  for  |chlorophylls|Chlorophyll|  and  |carotenoids|Carotenoid|  with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths used by above ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the  |light_spectrum|Electromagnetic_Spectrum|  is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.          In plants,  |light-dependent_reactions|Light-Dependent_Reaction|  occur in the  |thylakoid_membranes|Thylakoid_Membrane|  of the  |chloroplasts|Chloroplast|  where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.     In the non-cyclic reaction, the  |photons|Photon|  are captured in the light-harvesting  |antenna_complex|Antenna_Complex| es of  |photosystem_II|Photosystem|  by  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  and other  |accessory_pigments|Accessory_Pigments|  . The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called  |photoinduced_charge_separation|Photoinduced_Charge_Separation| . The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an  |electron_transport_chain|Electron_Transfer_Chain|  , it initially functions to generate a  |chemiosmotic_potential|Chemiosmotic_Potential|  by pumping proton cations across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An  |ATP_synthase|Atp_Synthase|  enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during  |photophosphorylation|Photophosphorylation| , whereas  |NADPH|Nadph|  is a product of the terminal  |redox|Redox|  reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in  |Photosystem_I|Photosystem_I| . There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that  |photosystem|Photosystem| . The electron is then passed along a chain of  |electron_acceptors|Electron_Acceptor|  to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H + to NADPH ; at that point, the path of that electron ends.     The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction.          Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center of  |photosystem_I|Photosystem_I|  are replaced by transfer from  |plastocyanin|Plastocyanin| , whose electrons come from electron transport through  |photosystem_II|Photosystem_Ii| . Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center, called P680. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and four  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active  |tyrosine|Tyrosine|  residue that then reduces the oxidized P680. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is  |catalyzed|Catalysis|  in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four  |manganese|Manganese|  ions and a calcium ion; this  |oxygen-evolving_complex|Oxygen-Evolving_Complex|  binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction .  Photosystem II is the only known biological  |enzyme|Enzyme|  that carries out this oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for  |cellular_respiration|Cellular_Respiration| , including photosynthetic organisms.                In the  |light-independent|Light-Independent_Reactions|  reactions, the  |enzyme|Enzyme| |RuBisCO|Rubisco|  captures  |CO_2|Carbon_Dioxide|  from the  |atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere|  and, in a process called the  |Calvin_cycle|Calvin_Cycle| , it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is      :3 CO 2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H + → C 3 H 6 O 3 -phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 P i + 6 NADP + + 3 H 2 O         |Carbon_fixation|Carbon_Fixation|  produces the intermediate three-carbon sugar product, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds, such as the building material  |cellulose|Cellulose| , the precursors for  |lipid|Lipid|  and  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  biosynthesis, or as a fuel in  |cellular_respiration|Cellular_Respiration| . The latter occurs not only in plants but also in  |animals|Animal|  when the energy from plants is passed through a  |food_chain|Food_Chain| .     The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  combines with a five-carbon sugar,  |ribulose_1,5-bisphosphate|Ribulose_1,5-Bisphosphate| , to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound,  |glycerate_3-phosphate|Glycerate_3-Phosphate| , also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  and  |NADPH|Nadph|  produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to  |glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate|Glyceraldehyde_3-Phosphate| . This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde  or, more generically, as  |triose|Triose|  phosphate. Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus recycled often condense to form  |hexose|Hexose|  phosphates, which ultimately yield  |sucrose|Sucrose| ,  |starch|Starch|  and  |cellulose|Cellulose| . The sugars produced during carbon  |metabolism|Metabolism|  yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of  |amino_acids|Amino_Acids|  and  |lipids|Lipids| .              In hot and dry conditions, plants close their  |stomata|Stomata|  to prevent water loss. Under these conditions,  will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of  |photorespiration|Photorespiration|  by the  |oxygenase|Oxygenase|  activity of  |ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate_carboxylase/oxygenase|Rubisco|  and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have  |evolved|Evolution|  mechanisms to increase the  concentration in the leaves under these conditions.           Plants that use the  |C_4|C4_Carbon_Fixation|  carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule  |phosphoenolpyruvate|Phosphoenolpyruvate| , a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called  |PEP_carboxylase|Phosphoenolpyruvate_Carboxylase| , creating the four-carbon organic acid  |oxaloacetic_acid|Oxaloacetic_Acid| . Oxaloacetic acid or  |malate|Malate|  synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized  |bundle_sheath|Bundle_Sheath|  cells where the enzyme  |RuBisCO|Rubisco|  and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where  released by  |decarboxylation|Decarboxylation|  of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon  |3-phosphoglyceric_acids|3-Phosphoglyceric_Acid| . The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases  fixation and, thus, the  |photosynthetic_capacity|Photosynthetic_Capacity|  of the leaf.   plants can produce more sugar than  plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are  plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called  |C_3_plants|C3_Carbon_Fixation|  because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use  carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use  carbon fixation;  however, the evolution of  in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of  |convergent_evolution|Convergent_Evolution| .           |Xerophytes|Xerophytes| , such as  |cacti|Cacti|  and most  |succulents|Succulents| , also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called  |Crassulacean_acid_metabolism|Cam_Photosynthesis|  . In contrast to  metabolism, which spatially separates the  fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from  plants, and fix the  at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the  mostly in the form of  |malic_acid|Malic_Acid|  via carboxylation of  |phosphoenolpyruvate|Phosphoenolpyruvate|  to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases  inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM.         |Cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria|  possess  |carboxysomes|Carboxysome| , which increase the concentration of  around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme,  |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase| , located within the carboxysome releases CO 2 from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions . Before the CO 2 diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCO ions are made from CO 2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO 2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.   |Pyrenoids|Pyrenoid|  in  |algae|Algae|  and  |hornworts|Hornwort|  also act to concentrate  around RuBisCO.        The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:             Plants usually convert light into  |chemical_energy|Chemical_Energy|  with a  |photosynthetic_efficiency|Photosynthetic_Efficiency|  of 3–6%.    Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction  re-emitted as  |chlorophyll_fluorescence|Chlorophyll_Fluorescence|  at longer wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.      Actual plants photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.  By comparison,  |solar_panels|Photovoltaic_Module|  convert light into  |electric_energy|Electric_Energy|  at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.     The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the relationship between the two can be complex.  For example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C 3 plants. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks.    For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.        Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and Infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.  It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together.  Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO 2 , and of ΔH 2 O using reliable methods  CO 2 is commonly measured in μmols/m 2 /s −1 , parts per million or volume per million and H 2 0 is commonly measured in mmol/m 2 /s −1 or in mbars. By measuring CO 2 assimilation, ΔH 2 O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, “A” or carbon assimilation, “E” or transpiration, “gs” or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO 2 . However, it is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used measuring parameters FV/FM and Y or F/FM’ can be made in a few seconds, allowing the measurement of larger plant populations.     Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO 2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO 2 levels, to characterize a plants photosynthetic response.     Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms. While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO 2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of C C to replace Ci.  The estimation of CO 2 at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, or C C , becomes possible with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or g m using an integrated system.      Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO 2 assimilation rates. With some instruments even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.      A phenomenon known as  |quantum_walk|Quantum_Walk|  increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an algae, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called  |chromophores|Chromophore|  arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a  |quasiparticle|Quasiparticle|  referred to as an  |exciton|Exciton| , which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cells metabolism. The excitons wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously choose the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic hop . The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.                  Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in  |green|Green_Sulfur_Bacteria|  and  |purple_sulfur|Purple_Sulfur|  and  |green|Chloroflexi|  and  |purple_nonsulfur_bacteria|Purple_Nonsulfur_Bacteria| , are thought to have been  |anoxygenic|Anoxygenic_Photosynthesis| , and used various other molecules than water as  |electron_donors|Electron_Donor| . Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |sulfur|Sulfur|  as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various  |amino|Amino_Acid|  and other  |organic_acids|Organic_Acid|  as an electron donor. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earths early atmosphere was highly  |reducing|Reducing_Environment|  at  |that_time|History_Of_Earthhadean_And_Archaean| .      Fossils of what are thought to be  |filamentous|Protein_Filament|  photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.   More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago.       The main source of  |oxygen|Oxygen|  in the  |Earths_atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere|  derives from  |oxygenic_photosynthesis|Oxygen_Evolution| , and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the  |oxygen_catastrophe|Oxygen_Catastrophe| . Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria| , became important during the  |Paleoproterozoic|Paleoproterozoic|  era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is  |oxidized|Oxidized|  to molecular oxygen  in the  |photosynthetic_reaction_center|Photosynthetic_Reaction_Center| .            Several groups of animals have formed  |symbiotic|Symbiosis|  relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in  |corals|Coral| ,  |sponges|Sponge|  and  |sea_anemones|Sea_Anemone| . It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple  |body_plans|Body_Plan|  and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.  In addition, a few marine  |mollusks|Mollusks|   Elysia viridis  and  Elysia chlorotica  also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies . This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.   Some of the genes from the plant  |cell_nucleus|Cell_Nucleus|  have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive.      An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular  |chromosome|Chromosome| , prokaryotic-type  |ribosome|Ribosome| , and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.   The  |endosymbiotic_theory|Endosymbiotic_Theory|  suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired  by early  |eukaryotic|Eukaryotic|  cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like  |mitochondria|Mitochondria| , chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the  |nuclear_DNA|Nuclear_Dna|  of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria| .  DNA in chloroplasts codes for  |redox|Redox|  proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The  |CoRR_Hypothesis|Corr_Hypothesis|  proposes that this Co-location of genes with their gene products is required for Redox Regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.        Symbiotic and  |kleptoplastic|Kleptoplasty|  organisms excluded:     The  |glaucophytes|Glaucophyte|  and the  |red|Red_Algae|  and  |green_algae|Viridiplantae| —clade  |Archaeplastida|Archaeplastida|    The  |cryptophytes|Cryptophyceae| —clade  |Cryptista|Cryptista|    The  |haptophytes|Haptophyte| —clade  |Haptista|Haptista|    The  |dinoflagellates|Dinoflagellate|  and  |chromerids|Chromerida|  in the superphylum  |Myzozoa|Myzozoa| —clade  |Alveolata|Alveolata|    The  |ochrophytes|Ochrophyta| —clade  |Heterokont|Heterokont| a   The  |chlorarachniophytes|Chlorarachniophyte|  and three species of  |Paulinella|Paulinella|  in the phylum  |Cercozoa|Cercozoa| —clade  |Rhizaria|Rhizaria|    The  |euglenids|Euglenid| —clade  |Excavata|Excavata|      Except for the euglenids, all of them belongs to the  |Diaphoretickes|Plants+Hc+Sar_Megagroup| . Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids through primary  |endosymbiosis|Endosymbiont|  in two separate events by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the “red lineages” and the “green lineages”. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of them are  |mixotrophs|Mixotroph|  and practice  |heterotroph|Heterotroph| y to various degrees.       The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a  |common_ancestor|Common_Ancestor|  of extant  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria|  , which are the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earths history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago , and, it is speculated, much earlier.   Because the Earths atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.
