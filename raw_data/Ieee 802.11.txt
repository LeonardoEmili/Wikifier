           IEEE 802.11 is part of the  |IEEE_802|Ieee_802|  set of LAN protocols, and specifies the set of  |media_access_control|Medium_Access_Control|  and  |physical_layer|Physical_Layer|  protocols for implementing  |wireless_local_area_network|Wireless_Lan| |Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi|  computer communication in various frequencies, including but not limited to 2.4  GHz, 5  GHz, and 60  GHz frequency bands.     They are the worlds most widely used wireless computer networking standards, used in most home and office networks to allow  |laptops|Laptop| ,  |printers|Printer| , and  |smartphones|Smartphone|  to talk to each other and access the Internet without connecting wires. They are created and maintained by the  |Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers|Institute_Of_Electrical_And_Electronics_Engineers| |LAN|Local_Area_Network| / |MAN|Metropolitan_Area_Network|  Standards Committee . The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the  |Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi|  brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.     The protocols are typically used in conjunction with  |IEEE_802.2|Ieee_802.2| , and are designed to interwork seamlessly with  |Ethernet|Ethernet| , and are very often used to carry  |Internet_Protocol|Internet_Protocol|  traffic.     Although IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the  |radio_frequency|Radio_Frequency|  spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.       The 802.11 family consists of a series of  |half-duplex|Half-Duplex|  over-the-air  |modulation|Modulation|  techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employ  |carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance|Carrier-Sense_Multiple_Access_With_Collision_Avoidance|  whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users before transmitting each packet.     802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which may also include corrections to a previous specification.      802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4   |GHz|Hertz| |ISM_band|Ism_Band| , operating in the United States under  |Part_15|Part_15|  of the U.S.  |Federal_Communications_Commission|Federal_Communications_Commission|  Rules and Regulations; 802.11n can also use that band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer  |interference_in_the_2.4_GHz_band|Electromagnetic_Interference_At_2.4_Ghz|  from  |microwave_ovens|Microwave_Oven| ,  |cordless_telephones|Cordless_Telephone| , and  |Bluetooth|Bluetooth|  devices etc. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using  |direct-sequence_spread_spectrum|Direct-Sequence_Spread_Spectrum|  and  |orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing|Orthogonal_Frequency-Division_Multiplexing|  signaling methods, respectively.     802.11a uses the  |5_GHz_U-NII_band|U-Nii| , which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20  MHz-wide channels rather than the 2.4  GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping 20  MHz-wide channels, where other adjacent channels overlap—see  |list_of_WLAN_channels|List_Of_Wlan_Channels| . Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4  GHz or 5  GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5  GHz band.     The segment of the  |radio_frequency|Radio_Frequency|  spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4  GHz  |amateur_radio|Amateur_Radio|  band. Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under  |Part_97|Part_97|  of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption.      In 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance began using a consumer-friendly generation numbering scheme for the publicly used 802.11 protocols. Wi-Fi generations 1–6 refer to the 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax protocols, in that order.         802.11 technology has its origins in a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that released the  |ISM_band|Ism_Band|  for unlicensed use. Wolter Lemstra , Vic Hayes , John Groenewegen , The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road To Global Success, Cambridge University Press, 2010,      In 1991  |NCR_Corporation|Ncr_Corporation| / |AT_&_T|At_&_T_Corporation|   invented a precursor to 802.11 in  |Nieuwegein|Nieuwegein| , the Netherlands. The inventors initially intended to use the technology for cashier systems. The first wireless products were brought to the market under the name  |WaveLAN|Wavelan|  with raw data rates of 1  Mbit/s and 2  Mbit/s.      |Vic_Hayes|Vic_Hayes| , who held the chair of IEEE 802.11 for 10 years, and has been called the father of Wi-Fi , was involved in designing the initial 802.11b and 802.11a standards within the  |IEEE|Institute_Of_Electrical_And_Electronics_Engineers| .      In 1999, the  |Wi-Fi_Alliance|Wi-Fi_Alliance|  was formed as a trade association to hold the  |Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi|  trademark under which most products are sold.      The major commercial breakthrough came with  |Apple_Inc.|Apple_Inc.|  adopting Wi-Fi for their  |iBook|Ibook|  series of laptops in 1999. It was the first mass consumer product to offer  |Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi|  network connectivity, which was then branded by Apple as  |AirPort|Airport| .    One year later IBM followed with its  |ThinkPad|Thinkpad|  1300 series in 2000.                    The original version of the standard IEEE 802.11 was released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, but is now obsolete. It specified two  |net_bit_rates|Net_Bit_Rate|  of 1 or 2  |megabits_per_second|Megabit_Per_Second|  , plus  |forward_error_correction|Forward_Error_Correction|  code. It specified three alternative  |physical_layer|Physical_Layer|  technologies: diffuse  |infrared|Infrared|  operating at 1  Mbit/s;  |frequency-hopping|Frequency-Hopping|  spread spectrum operating at 1  Mbit/s or 2  Mbit/s; and  |direct-sequence|Direct-Sequence|  spread spectrum operating at 1  Mbit/s or 2  Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used  |microwave|Microwave|  transmission over the  |Industrial_Scientific_Medical_frequency_band|Ism_Band|  at 2.4  GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the  |U.S.|United_States|  900  MHz ISM band.     Legacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.            802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an  |OFDM|Ofdm|  based air interface . It operates in the 5  GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54  Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.  It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace.     Since the 2.4  GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5  GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high  |carrier_frequency|Center_Frequency|  also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds . 802.11a also suffers from interference,  but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.            The 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11  Mbit/s, and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.     Devices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4  GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4  GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. As unlicensed intentional radiators in this  |ISM_band|Ism_Band| , they must not interfere with and must tolerate interference from primary or secondary allocations of this band, such as amateur radio.            In June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4  GHz band , but uses the same  |OFDM|Orthogonal_Frequency-Division_Multiplexing|  based transmission scheme as 802.11a. It operates at a maximum physical layer bit rate of 54  Mbit/s exclusive of forward error correction codes, or about 22  Mbit/s average throughput.  page 14 802.11g hardware is fully backward compatible with 802.11b hardware, and therefore is encumbered with legacy issues that reduce throughput by ~21% when compared to 802.11a.     The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as reductions in manufacturing costs. By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile  |adapter_card|Adapter_Card|  or access point. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, activity of an 802.11b participant will reduce the data rate of the overall 802.11g network.     Like 802.11b, 802.11g devices also suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4  GHz band, for example wireless keyboards.       In 2003, task group TGma was authorized to roll up many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard. REVma or 802.11ma, as it was called, created a single document that merged 8 amendments  with the base standard. Upon approval on March 8, 2007, 802.11REVma was renamed to the then-current base standard IEEE 802.11-2007. IEEE 802.11-2007            802.11n is an amendment that improves upon the previous 802.11 standards by adding  |multiple-input_multiple-output|Multiple-Input_Multiple-Output|  antennas . 802.11n operates on both the 2.4  GHz and the 5  GHz bands. Support for 5  GHz bands is optional. Its net data rate ranges from 54  Mbit/s to 600  Mbit/s. The IEEE has approved the amendment, and it was published in October 2009.   Prior to the final ratification, enterprises were already migrating to 802.11n networks based on the  |Wi-Fi_Alliances|Wi-Fi_Alliance|  certification of products conforming to a 2007 draft of the 802.11n proposal.       In May 2007, task group TGmb was authorized to roll up many of the amendments to the 2007 version of the 802.11 standard.  REVmb or 802.11mb, as it was called, created a single document that merged ten amendments  with the 2007 base standard. In addition much cleanup was done, including a reordering of many of the clauses.  Upon publication on March 29, 2012, the new standard was referred to as IEEE 802.11-2012.             IEEE 802.11ac-2013 is an amendment to IEEE 802.11, published in December 2013, that builds on 802.11n.  Changes compared to 802.11n include wider channels in the 5  GHz band, more spatial streams , higher-order modulation , and the addition of  |Multi-user_MIMO|Multi-User_Mimo|  . As of October 2013, high-end implementations support 80  MHz channels, three spatial streams, and 256-QAM, yielding a data rate of up to 433.3  Mbit/s per spatial stream, 1300  Mbit/s total, in 80  MHz channels in the 5  GHz band.  Vendors have announced plans to release so-called Wave 2 devices with support for 160  MHz channels, four spatial streams, and MU-MIMO in 2014 and 2015.                IEEE 802.11ad is an amendment that defines a new  |physical_layer|Physical_Layer|  for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60  GHz  |millimeter_wave|Millimeter_Wave|  spectrum. This frequency band has significantly different propagation characteristics than the 2.4  GHz and 5  GHz bands where  |Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi|  networks operate. Products implementing the  |802.11ad|802.11Ad|  standard are being brought to market under the  |WiGig|Wigig|  brand name. The certification program is now being developed by the  |Wi-Fi_Alliance|Wi-Fi_Alliance|  instead of the now defunct  |Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance|Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance| .  The peak transmission rate of 802.11ad is 7  Gbit/s.      IEEE 802.11ad is a protocol used for very high data rates and for short range communication .      TP-Link announced the worlds first 802.11ad router in January 2016.      The WiGig standard is not too well known, although it was announced in 2009 and added to the IEEE 802.11 family in December 2012.            IEEE 802.11af, also referred to as White-Fi and Super Wi-Fi ,  is an amendment, approved in February 2014, that allows WLAN operation in TV  |white_space_spectrum|White_Spaces|  in the  |VHF|Vhf|  and  |UHF|Uhf|  bands between 54 and 790  MHz.  It uses  |cognitive_radio|Cognitive_Radio|  technology to transmit on unused TV channels, with the standard taking measures to limit interference for primary users, such as analog TV, digital TV, and wireless microphones. Access points and stations determine their position using a satellite positioning system such as  |GPS|Gps| , and use the Internet to query a  |geolocation_database|Tv_White_Space_Database|  provided by a regional regulatory agency to discover what frequency channels are available for use at a given time and position. The physical layer uses OFDM and is based on 802.11ac.  The propagation path loss as well as the attenuation by materials such as brick and concrete is lower in the UHF and VHF bands than in the 2.4  GHz and 5  GHz bands, which increases the possible range. The frequency channels are 6 to 8  MHz wide, depending on the regulatory domain. Up to four channels may be bonded in either one or two contiguous blocks. MIMO operation is possible with up to four streams used for either  |space–time_block_code|Space–Time_Block_Code|  or multi-user operation. The achievable data rate per spatial stream is 26.7  Mbit/s for 6 and 7  MHz channels, and 35.6  Mbit/s for 8  MHz channels. With four spatial streams and four bonded channels, the maximum data rate is 426.7  Mbit/s for 6 and 7  MHz channels and 568.9  Mbit/s for 8  MHz channels.       IEEE 802.11-2016 which was known as IEEE 802.11 REVmc,  is a revision based on IEEE 802.11-2012, incorporating 5 amendments . In addition, existing MAC and PHY functions have been enhanced and obsolete features were removed or marked for removal. Some clauses and annexes have been renumbered.             IEEE 802.11ah, published in 2017,  defines a WLAN system operating at sub-1  GHz license-exempt bands. Due to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating in the 2.4  GHz and 5  GHz  bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks,  extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. The protocol intends consumption to be competitive with low power  |Bluetooth|Bluetooth| , at a much wider range.             IEEE 802.11ai is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that added new mechanisms for a faster initial link setup time.        IEEE 802.11aj is a rebanding of 802.11ad for use in the 45  GHz unlicensed spectrum available in some regions of the world .     Alternatively known as China Milli-Meter Wave .       IEEE 802.11aq is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that will enable pre-association discovery of services. This extends some of the mechanisms in 802.11u that enabled device discovery to further discover the services running on a device, or provided by a network.          IEEE 802.11ax  is the successor to 802.11ac, and will increase the efficiency of WLAN networks. Currently in development, this project has the goal of providing 4x the throughput of 802.11ac at the user layer,  having just 37% higher nominal data rates at the PHY layer.  In the previous amendment of 802.11 , Multi-User MIMO has been introduced, which is a spatial multiplexing technique. MU-MIMO allows the Access Point to form beams towards each Client, while transmitting information simultaneously. By doing so, the interference between Clients is reduced, and the overall throughput is increased, since multiple Clients can receive data at the same time. With 802.11ax, a similar multiplexing is introduced in the frequency domain, namely  |OFDMA|Ofdma| . With this technique, multiple Clients are assigned with different Resource Units in the available spectrum. By doing so, an 80  MHz channel can be split into multiple Resource Units, so that multiple Clients receive different type of data over the same spectrum, simultaneously. In order to have enough amount of subcarriers to support the requirements of  |OFDMA|Ofdma| , the number of subcarriers are increased by a factor of 4 . In other words, for 20, 40, 80 and 160  MHz channels, there are 64, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers in 802.11ac standard; while there are 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 subcarriers in 802.11ax standard. Since the available bandwidths have not changed and the number of subcarriers are increased with a factor of 4, the subcarrier spacing is reduced by a factor of 4 as well. This introduces 4 times longer OFDM symbols. E.g., for 802.11ac and 802.11ax, the duration of an OFDM symbol is 3.2 micro seconds and 12.8 micro seconds , respectively.               IEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed. It is an amendment that defines a new  |physical_layer|Physical_Layer|  for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60  GHz  |millimeter_wave|Millimeter_Wave|  spectrum. It will be an extension of the existing 11ad, aimed to extend the throughput, range and use-cases. The main use-cases include: indoor operation, out-door  |back-haul|Backhaul|  and short range communications. The peak transmission rate of 802.11ay is 20  Gbit/s.  The main extensions include: channel bonding ,  |MIMO|Mimo|  and higher modulation schemes.            IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput is the potential next amendment of the 802.11 IEEE standard.  It will build upon 802.11ax, focusing on WLAN indoor and outdoor operation with stationary and pedestrian speeds in the 2.4  GHz, 5  GHz, and 6  GHz frequency bands. Being the potential successor of Wi-Fi 6, the Wi-Fi Alliance will most likely certify it as Wi-Fi 7.            Across all variations of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are given either based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer-2 data rates. However, this does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.          This means that, typically, data frames pass an 802.11 medium, and are being converted to  |802.3|Ieee_802.3|   or vice versa. Due to the difference in the frame lengths of these two media, the applications packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets create dataflows with high-overhead traffic . Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.       The same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of  |UDP|User_Datagram_Protocol|  throughput. Each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements. Each is with a specific packet size and with a specific data rate . Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. These figures assume there are no packet errors, which if occurring will lower transmission rate further.            802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n-2.4 utilize the  spectrum, one of the  |ISM_bands|Ism_Band| . 802.11a, 802.11n and 802.11ac use the more heavily regulated  band. These are commonly referred to as the 2.4  GHz and 5  GHz bands in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into channels with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to the way radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided.     The 2.4  GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5  MHz apart, beginning with channel  1, which is centered on 2.412  GHz. The latter channels have additional restrictions or are unavailable for use in some regulatory domains.          The channel numbering of the  spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the  |list_of_WLAN_channels|List_Of_Wlan_Channels5Ghz| .       In addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies a  |spectral_mask|Spectral_Mask|  defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal be  |attenuated|Attenuation|  a minimum of 20   |dB|Decibel|  from its peak amplitude at ±11  MHz from the centre frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22  MHz wide. One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.     Availability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country  |allocates_radio_spectrum|Frequency_Allocation|  to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and  for 802.11g/n-2.4. Other countries such as Spain initially allowed only channels 10 and 11, and France allowed only 10, 11, 12, and 13; however, Europe now allow channels 1 through 13.   North America and some Central and South American countries allow only           Since the spectral mask defines only power output restrictions up to ±11  MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by −50  dBr, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels, the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the  |near-far_problem|Near-Far_Problem|  a transmitter can impact a receiver on a non-overlapping channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.     Confusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on  |direct-sequence_spread_spectrum|Direct-Sequence_Spread_Spectrum|  modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22  MHz, resulting in three non-overlapping channels . 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20  MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that four non-overlapping channels exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 , which states In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25  MHz.    and section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.     This does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels. The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.            However, overlap between channels with more narrow spacing may cause unacceptable degradation of signal quality and throughput, particularly when users transmit near the boundaries of AP cells.        IEEE uses the phrase regdomain to refer to a legal regulatory region. Different countries define different levels of allowable transmitter power, time that a channel can be occupied, and different available channels. IEEE Standard 802.11-2007 page 531 Domain codes are specified for the United States,  |Canada|Canada| ,  |ETSI|European_Telecommunications_Standards_Institute| ,  |Spain|Spain| ,  |France|France| ,  |Japan|Japan| , and  |China|China| .     Most  |Wi-Fi_certified|Wi-Fi|  devices default to regdomain 0, which means  |least_common_denominator|Least_Common_Denominator|  settings, i.e., the device will not transmit at a power above the allowable power in any nation, nor will it use frequencies that are not permitted in any nation.      The regdomain setting is often made difficult or impossible to change so that the end users do not conflict with local regulatory agencies such as the  |United_States|United_States| |Federal_Communications_Commission|Federal_Communications_Commission| .       The  |datagrams|Datagram|  are called frames. Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.     Frames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a MAC header, payload, and  frame check sequence  . Some frames may not have a payload.          The first two bytes of the MAC header form a frame control field specifying the form and function of the frame. This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields:   Protocol Version: Two bits representing the protocol version. Currently used protocol version is zero. Other values are reserved for future use.   Type: Two bits identifying the type of WLAN frame. Control, Data, and Management are various frame types defined in IEEE 802.11.   Subtype: Four bits providing additional discrimination between frames. Type and Subtype are used together to identify the exact frame.   ToDS and FromDS: Each is one bit in size. They indicate whether a data frame is headed for a distribution system. Control and management frames set these values to zero. All the data frames will have one of these bits set. However communication within an  |independent_basic_service_set|Independent_Basic_Service_Set|  network always set these bits to zero.   More Fragments: The More Fragments bit is set when a packet is divided into multiple frames for transmission. Every frame except the last frame of a packet will have this bit set.   Retry: Sometimes frames require retransmission, and for this there is a Retry bit that is set to one when a frame is resent. This aids in the elimination of duplicate frames.   Power Management: This bit indicates the power management state of the sender after the completion of a frame exchange. Access points are required to manage the connection, and will never set the power-saver bit.   More Data: The More Data bit is used to buffer frames received in a distributed system. The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available, and addresses all stations connected.   Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as  |Wired_Equivalent_Privacy|Wired_Equivalent_Privacy|  ,  |Wi-Fi_Protected_Access|Wi-Fi_Protected_Accesswpa|  , or  |Wi-Fi_Protected_Access_II|Wi-Fi_Protected_Accesswpa2|  .   Order: This bit is set only when the strict ordering delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty.     The next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period , and Association ID .     An 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a  |MAC_address|Mac_Address| . Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver. Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an  |Extended_Service_Set|Extended_Service_Set|  or between intermediate nodes in a  |mesh_network|Mesh_Networking| .     The remaining fields of the header are:   The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used for identifying message order as well as eliminating duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number.   An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field, present in QoS Data frames; it was added with  |802.11e|802.11E| .     The payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.     The Frame Check Sequence is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check , it allows for integrity check of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.        Management frames are  |not_always_authenticated|Ieee_802.11W-2009| , and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:   Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the  |wireless_network_interface_card|Wireless_Network_Interface_Card|  sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial authentication request it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNICs authentication status.   Association request frame: Sent from a station it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the  |SSID|Ssid|  of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC.   Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such an association ID and supported data rates.    |Beacon_frame|Beacon_Frame| |SSID|Ssid| , and other parameters for WNICs within range.    |block_acknowledgement|Block_Acknowledgement|  by sending an ADDBA Request action frame. The other station would then respond with an ADDBA Response action frame.     The body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of  |information_elements|Information_Element|  .     The common structure of an IE is as follows:            Control frames facilitate in the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:   Acknowledgement frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station doesnt receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame.   Request to Send frame: The  |RTS_and_CTS_frames|Ieee_802.11_Rts/Cts|  provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends a RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames.   Clear to Send frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits.       Data frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.  The body begins with an  |IEEE_802.2|Ieee_802.2|  header, with the Destination  |Service_Access_Point|Service_Access_Point|  specifying the protocol, followed by a  |Subnetwork_Access_Protocol|Subnetwork_Access_Protocol|  header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the  |organizationally_unique_identifier|Organizationally_Unique_Identifier|  and protocol ID fields specifying the protocol. If the OUI is all zeroes, the protocol ID field is an  |EtherType|Ethertype|  value.  Almost all 802.11 data frames use 802.2 and SNAP headers, and most use an OUI of 00:00:00 and an EtherType value.     Similar to  |TCP_congestion_control|Tcp_Congestion_Control|  on the internet, frame loss is built into the operation of 802.11. To select the correct transmission speed or  |Modulation_and_Coding_Scheme|Modulation_And_Coding_Scheme| , a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.  It is important to be aware that the link layer should recover these lost frames. If the sender does not receive an Acknowledgement frame, then it will be resent.
