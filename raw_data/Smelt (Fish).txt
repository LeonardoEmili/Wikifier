     Smelts are a family of small  |fish|Fish| , the Osmeridae, found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, as well as rivers, streams and lakes in Europe, North America and Northeast Asia. They are also known as freshwater smelts or typical smelts to distinguish them from the related  |Argentinidae|Argentinidae|  ,  |Bathylagidae|Bathylagidae|  , and  |Retropinnidae|Retropinnidae|  .     Some smelt species are common in the  |North_American_Great_Lakes|North_American_Great_Lakes| , and in the lakes and seas of the northern part of Europe, where they run in large  |schools|Shoaling_And_Schooling|  along the saltwater coastline during spring migration to their spawning streams. In some western parts of the United States, smelt populations have greatly declined in recent decades, leading to their protection under the Endangered Species Act. The  |Delta_smelt|Delta_Smelt|   found in the  |Sacramento_Delta|Sacramento_Delta|  of California, and the  |eulachon|Eulachon|   found in the Northeast Pacific and adjacent rivers, are both protected from harvest.     Some species of smelts are among the few fish that sportsmen have been allowed to net, using hand-held  |dip_nets|Hand_Net| , either along the coastline or in streams. Some sportsmen also  |ice_fish|Ice_Fishing|  for smelt. They are often fried and eaten whole.       In size, smelts usually grow to about  long, although some species can reach .  Smelts are a food source for many fish, including salmon,  |striped_bass|Striped_Bass| , and  |lake_trout|Lake_Trout| .     Like salmon, many species are  |anadromous|Fish_Migration| , living most of their lives in the sea, but traveling into fresh water to breed. However, a few exceptions, such as the  |surf_smelt|Surf_Smelt| , spend their entire lives at sea.                In the Canadian provinces and U.S. states around the  |Great_Lakes|Great_Lakes| , smelt dipping is a common group sport in the early spring and when stream waters reach around 4  °C, . Fish are spotted using a flashlight or headlamp and scooped out of the water using a dip net made of nylon or metal mesh. The smelt are cleaned by removing the head and the entrails. Fins, scales, and bones of all but the largest of smelts are cooked without removal.     On the Maine coast, smelts were also a sign of spring, with the run of these small fish up tiny tidal estuaries. Many of these streams were narrow enough for a person to straddle and get a good catch of smelts by dipping a bucket.                 Smelts are an important winter catch in the saltwater mouths of rivers in  |New_England|New_England|  and the Maritime Provinces of  |Canada|Canada| . Fishermen would historically go to customary locations over the ice using horses and sleighs. Smelt taken out of the cold saltwater were preferred to those taken in warm water. The fish did not command a high price on the market, but provided a source of supplemental income due to their abundance. The smelts were flash frozen simply by leaving them on the ice and then sold to fish buyers who came down the rivers.     In the present day, smelts are fished both commercially using nets at sea, and for recreation by hand-netting them or spearing or angling them through holes in river ice. They are often the target fish of small fishing shack villages that spring up along frozen rivers. Typical ways of preparing them include pan-frying in flour and butter, or deep-frying in batter, and they are sometimes cooked directly out of the water over small stoves in the shacks.       Smelt is popular in Japan, as the species Sprinchus lanceolatus, and is generally served grilled, called  shishamo , especially when full of eggs.
