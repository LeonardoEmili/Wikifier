Geta was said to be the son of a god, yet not of the omnipotent God and our Lord Jesus Christ, but rather the offspring of one of their idols, and whom, blinded by some demon, they worshipped according to the custom of the heathen. In 447 AD, Vortigern received Hengist and Horsa as friends and gave to the brothers the Isle of Thanet. Gunn .     After the Saxons had lived on Thanet for some time Vortigern promised them supplies of clothing and other provisions on condition that they assist him in fighting the enemies of his country.

Hengist, having consulted with the Elders who attended him of the Angle race, demanded Kent. Without the knowledge of the then-ruler of Kent, Vortigern agreed. Gunn .     Hengists daughter was given to Vortigern, who slept with her and deeply loved her. Hengist told him that he would now be both his father and adviser and that he would know no defeat with his counsel, for the people of my country are strong, warlike, and robust.

He asked what country they had come from and why they had come to his kingdom. Hengist replied that they had left their homeland of Saxony to offer their services to Vortigern or some other prince, as part of a Saxon custom in which, when the country became overpopulated, able young men were chosen by lot to seek their fortunes in other lands.

Vortigern responded that it was not in his power to do this, reasoning that Hengist was a foreign pagan and would not be accepted by the British lords. Hengist asked instead for leave to build a fortress on a piece of land small enough that it could be encircled by a leather thong. Vortigern granted this and ordered Hengist to invite more Saxons.

All the while Hengist continued inviting over yet more ships, adding to his numbers daily. Witnessing this, the Britons tried to get Vortigern to banish the Saxons, but on account of his wife he would not. Consequently, his subjects turned against him and took his son Vortimer for their king. The Saxons and the Britons, led by Vortimer, met in four battles. In the second, Horsa and Vortimers brother, Catigern, slew one another. By the fourth battle, the Saxons had fled to Thanet, where Vortimer besieged them. When the Saxons could no longer bear the British onslaughts, they sent out Vortigern to ask his son to allow them safe passage back to Germany. While discussions were taking place, the Saxons boarded their ships and left, leaving their wives and children behind. Thompson .     The victorious Vortimer was poisoned by Rowena, and Vortigern returned to the throne. Thompson . At his wifes request he invited Hengist back to Britain, but instructed him to bring only a small retinue. Hengist, knowing Vortimer to be dead, instead raised an army of 300,000 men. When Vortigern caught word of the imminent arrival of the vast Saxon fleet, he resolved to fight them. Rowena alerted her father of this, who, after considering various strategies, resolved to make a show of peace and sent ambassadors to Vortigern. Thompson .     The ambassadors informed Vortigern that Hengist had only brought so many men because he did not know of Vortimers death and feared further attacks from him. Now that there was no threat, Vortigern could choose from among the men the ones he wished to return to Germany. Vortigern was greatly pleased by these tidings, and arranged to meet Hengist on the first of May at the monastery of Ambrius. Thompson .     Before the meeting, Hengist ordered his soldiers to carry long daggers beneath their clothing. At the signal Nemet oure Saxas , the Saxons fell upon the unsuspecting Britons and massacred them, while Hengist held Vortigern by his cloak. 460 British barons and consuls were killed, as well as some Saxons whom the Britons beat to death with clubs and stones.
