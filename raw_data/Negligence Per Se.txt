   Negligence per se is a doctrine in  |US_law|Us_Law|  whereby an act is considered negligent because it violates a statute . The doctrine is effectively a form of  |strict_liability|Strict_Liability| .       In order to prove  |negligence|Negligence|   per se , the plaintiff usually must show that:   the defendant violated the statute,   the act caused the kind of harm the statute was designed to prevent, and   the plaintiff was a member of the statutes protected class.     In some jurisdictions, negligence per se creates merely a rebuttable presumption of negligence.     A typical example is one in which a contractor violates a building code when constructing a house. The house then collapses, injuring somebody. The violation of the building code establishes negligence per se and the contractor will be found liable, so long as the contractors breach of the code was the  |cause|Cause|   of the injury.       A famous early case in negligence per se is  Gorris v. Scott  , a  |Court_of_Exchequer|Exchequer_Of_Pleas|  case that established that the harm in question must be of the kind that the statute was intended to prevent. Gorris involved a shipment of sheep that was washed overboard but would not have been washed overboard had the shipowner complied with the regulations established pursuant to the  |Contagious_Diseases_Act_1869|Contagious_Diseases_Act_1869| , which required that livestock be transported in pens to segregate potentially-infected animal populations from uninfected ones.  |Chief_Baron|Chief_Baron_Of_The_Exchequer| |Fitzroy_Kelly|Fitzroy_Kelly|  held that as the statute was intended to prevent the spread of disease, rather than the loss of livestock in transit, the plaintiff could not claim negligence per se.     A subsequent  |New_York_Court_of_Appeals|New_York_Court_Of_Appeals|  case,  Martin v. Herzog  , penned by Judge  |Benjamin_N._Cardozo|Benjamin_N._Cardozo| , first presented the notion that negligence per se could be absolute evidence of negligence in certain cases.       Negligence per se involves the concept of  |strict_liability|Strict_Liability| . Within the law of  |negligence|Negligence|  there has been a move away from strict liability  to a standard of reasonable care . This is true not just for breach of the common law, but also for breach of statutory duty. The criminal law case of  Sweet v Parsley   follows this trend. In this light, negligence per se.
