It is now known as  |Bunge_Limited|Bunge_Limited| .       Bunge & Born was founded in 1884 by Ernesto Bunge, a  |German_Argentine|German_Argentine|  whose uncle, Carl Bunge, had been Consul General in Argentina for both the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  and  |Prussia|Prussia| , and his brother-in-law, Jorge Born, who had recently arrived from  |Antwerp|Antwerp| . The company superseded the Bunge Company founded in  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  by Johann Bunge, in 1818. Following the purchase of  of prime  |pampas|Pampas|  wheat fields, Bunge & Born established Centenera, their first food processing plant, in 1899. They had one of the largest wheat mills in the country built on a  |Puerto_Madero|Puerto_Madero|  lot in 1902, and with it, established  Molinos Río de la Plata  .       The company started Argentinas first  |burlap|Burlap|  bag manufacturer, following which they successfully lobbied government policy makers for  |protective_tariffs|Protectionism|  on the then-critical commercial staple. They established a mortgage bank, the Banco Hipotecario Franco Argentino, and a subsidiary in  |Brazil|Brazil|  in 1905, and by 1910, they reportedly controlled 80% of Argentine cereal exports .

The company inaugurated its neo-gothic Buenos Aires headquarters on Leandro Alem Avenue , designed by local architect Pablo Naeff, in 1926.     Bunge & Borns near-monopoly on cereal and flour exports ended with populist President Juan Perón s 1946 establishment of the IAPI , a state agricultural purchasing and export agent. Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. The company responded by extending its reach into the country fast-growing retail processed foods market, and though its prominence as the nations chief exporter was partly restored by Peróns 1955 ousting and the IAPIs liquidation, its focus remained domestic over the next three decades. A privately held company, Bunge & Born did not release periodical financial statements, though it did report US$2bn in gross receipts in 1962; by then it had become a leader in commodity futures trading, operating 110 offices worldwide. Business Week. October 19, 1963.     The Bunge, Born, Hirsch, Engels and De La Tour families remained the companys chief stock-holders, and by extension, leaders in the domestic textile, paint, chemical, fertilizer, and food processing industries. On September 19, 1974, however, the consortium was shaken by the kidnapping of siblings Jorge and Juan Born by the far-left terrorist group, Montoneros . The Born brothers were kept in a known Argentine State Intelligence safehouse for nine months until their June 1975 release, something made possible without public suspicion of outside involvement by the agencys numerous contacts inside the Montoneros . Freed for a US$60 million ransom , the ordeal triggered the company headquarters relocation to São Paulo , Brazil, and contributed to the March 1976 coup . Andersen, Martin. Dossier Secreto. Westview Press, 1993.     Retaining their Argentine interests , the families continued to suffer from ongoing disputes, and in 1987, CEO Mario Hirsch died suddenly. The election of Carlos Menem to the Argentine Presidency in May 1989, however, resulted in an agreement between the President-elect and Jorge Born that gave the company partial control over national economic policy. Bunge & Born provided the Menem government with its first two economy ministers, and the combination of large rate increases on public services , a simplified exchange rate and a massive, mandatory wage hike led to a sharp economic turnaround between July and November 1989. This foray into government policy making, however, ended in a new currency crisis that December and the failure resulted in Borns 1991 ouster from the board; he was replaced by Chief Operations Officer Octavio Caraballo .     Beset by the rift between Jorge Born and his brother, Juan, the prior unity between the shareholders disintegrated as Caraballo struggled to modernize the company. Family frictions intensified when Jorge Born formed a business partnership with one of his former kidnappers, erstwhile Montonero strategist Rodolfo Galimberti .       The company was converted into the Bermuda -registered Bunge International in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international agribusiness and commodity markets; by then the companys gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion. Bunge ultimately went public on the NYSE in 2001, becoming Bunge Limited.
