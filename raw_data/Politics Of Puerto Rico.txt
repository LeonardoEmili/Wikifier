           The politics of Puerto Rico take place in the framework of a  |democratic|Democracy| |republic|Republic|  form of government that is under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States as an  |organized_unincorporated_territory|Territories_Of_The_United_States| .     As a republican form of government, the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judicial, as established by the  |Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico|Constitution_Of_Puerto_Rico| . The executive power is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the Governor, advised by a cabinet of  |secretaries|Minister|  that are independent of the legislature. Legislative power is vested upon the  |Legislature|Legislative_Assembly_Of_Puerto_Rico| . Judicial power is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the  |Tribunal_Supremo_de_Puerto_Rico|Supreme_Court_Of_Puerto_Rico| , the Tribunal de Apelaciones , and Tribunal de Primera Instancia . There is also a  |Federal_Court|United_States_District_Court_For_The_District_Of_Puerto_Rico|  to hear cases of a federal nature or with federal jurisdiction.     Puerto Ricos governor, who is the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and the members of the legislature are elected every four years by  |popular_vote|Direct_Election| . Puerto Ricos legislature is a  |bi-cameral|Bicameralism|  body consisting of a  |Senate|Senate_Of_Puerto_Rico|  and a  |Camara_de_Representantes|House_Of_Representatives_Of_Puerto_Rico| . The members of the judicial branch are appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate to serve until they reach age 70. Due to the status of Puerto Rico as a territory of the United States, its residents cannot vote in the  |U.S._presidential_elections|U.S._Presidential_Election| .     Politics in Puerto Rico revolve around a  |multi-party_political_system|Multi-Party_System| . The politics of Puerto Rico are dominated by three political parties: the  |Partido_Nuevo_Progresista|New_Progressive_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  , the  |Partido_Popular_Democratico|Popular_Democratic_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  , and the  |Partido_Independentista_Puertorriqueño|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|  .     Since the 1898 invasion of Puerto Rico by the Americans during the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| , politics in Puerto Rico have been significantly shaped by its status as territory of the United States. The nature of Puerto Ricos political relationship with the United States is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, in the United States, the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  and the  |International_Community|International_Community| .           One year after the United States invasion of the island, Dr.  |José_Celso_Barbosa|José_Celso_Barbosa|  embraced the idea of annexation as a U.S. state as a solution to the colonial situation and founded the  |Partido_Republicano_Puertorriqueño|Partido_Republicano_Puertorriqueño|  in 1899.     Dr. Barbosa had been the leader in the  |Autonomist_Party|Autonomist_Party|  that favored a republican government for Spain. For much of the 19th Century, the principal parties favored Puerto Rico becoming one of the Spanish provinces in equal footing with the rest of the provinces; such a standing was given twice, under liberal governments, but it was revoked as many times when the monarchs regained their power. In this context, Dr. Barbosa returned to the original idea of equal footing, but this time with the constituent members of the American Republic.     During the last twenty years under the Spanish flag, the local parties, with the exception of the  |Partido_Incondicional_Español|Partido_Incondicional_Español|  embraced the idea of autonomy. The Incondicionales accepted whatever Spain had for Puerto Rico and the Crown duly recognized their support by giving aristocratic titles to the leaders. The leader of the Canadian model developed by the British and supported a similar development for Puerto Rico under Spain. Before Baldorioty de Castro, other leaders had mentioned the possibility of autonomy, generally as an answer to the Spanish insistence in instituting special laws to govern the colonies.     At about the same time that the Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño was organized under the U.S. flag, Luis Muñoz-Rivera organized the  |Federal_Party|Federal_Party|  . Like the Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño, the Federal Party supported statehood for Puerto Rico. Muñoz-Rivera had been the leader of the monarchist faction of the autonomists, not truly out of conviction but because Spain was a monarchy. Through this support he was able to get Sagasta, whose party was not in power in the early 1890s, to support an autonomous government for Puerto Rico. At about this time, the U.S. was pressuring Spain to grant autonomy to Cuba, but the Spaniards dilly-dallied until a year before the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| . Sagasta was then Prime Minister and he had made a compact with the Islanders to give them autonomy. Autonomy was granted, not through an Act of the Cortes , but through an edict of the monarch. Bickering between Muñoz-Rivera and Barbosa did not allow the autonomous government to be established immediately. Sagasta demanded that they put their differences aside and both, with their respective groups, became part of the first autonomous government of Puerto Rico immediately before the War.     The Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño won the elections in 1900 and again in 1902. The new government of Puerto Rico, organized under the  |Foraker_Act|Foraker_Act|  of 1900, was a mixture of the British and the American system, somewhat similar to that established for the territory of Orleans after the Louisiana Purchase. The House of Delegates was elected directly by the voters and the equivalent to the Senate was the Cabinet appointed by the Governor and by the President of the United States. Muñoz-Rivera exiled himself to New York after the defeat, but returned once the Federal Party was no longer useful and joined  |Rosendo_Matienzo_Cintrón|Rosendo_Matienzo_Cintrón|  in organizing the  |Union_Party|Union_Of_Puerto_Rico| , also with them was  |José_de_Diego|José_De_Diego| .     Matienzo Cintrón had been a Republican, supporting statehood. But two years into the new government, he realized that statehood would not be granted and the desired equality as citizens was not feasible under the United States. He brought with him other former Republicans and practically all of Muñoz-Riveras Federalists into a party that was to bring about the union of all political groups. He was successful, they won the elections of 1904 and all subsequent elections until the 1920s, when another defection of Republicans allowed for the creation of yet another party bringing into it persons supporting a status change.     The Union Party, initially supported statehood or an autonomous government, it then later added independence. In fact, Matienzo-Cintrón went from statehood advocate to autonomist to independence advocate as a result of eight years of American civil government in Puerto Rico. The Union Party, from the very beginning, was against the colonial government established under the  Foraker Act . Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón,  |Manuel_Zeno_Gandía|Manuel_Zeno_Gandía| ,  |Luis_Lloréns_Torres|Luis_Lloréns_Torres| , Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi started to organize the  |Independence_Party|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|  in 1912, which paved the path for similar movements. The Union Party quickly gained the attention of the colonial governors, all Republicans, who were willing to work closely with them because of their control of the House of Delegates. The local Republicans protested bitterly and, at one point, they took statehood out of their platform – not reinstating it until the early 1920s. Many in the Union Party leadership were lawyers who had contracts with the sugar operations recently bought out and enlarged by the new American owners, thus establishing a close relationship between the nascent middle classes and the American corporate interests.     A coalition between the pro-independence Union Party presided by  |Antonio_R._Barceló|Antonio_R._Barceló|  and the pro-statehood  |Partido_Republicano_Puertorriqueño|Partido_Republicano_Puertorriqueño|  presided by  |José_Tous_Soto|José_Tous_Soto|  called the  |Alianza_Puertorriqueña|Alianza_Puertorriqueña|  was formed. Differences between Barceló and Tous Soto and  |Félix_Córdova_Dávila|Félix_Córdova_Dávila| , the  |resident_commissioner_of_Puerto_Rico|Resident_Commissioner_Of_Puerto_Rico|  in Washington, as to the goals of the alliance became apparent. The Unionist sector of the alliance, decided to disaffiliate themselves from the Alliance. Because of legal reasons Barceló was unable to use the name Union Party and in 1932, founded the  |Liberal_Party_of_Puerto_Rico|Liberal_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  . The Liberal Partys political agenda was the same as the original Union Partys agenda and urged independence as a final political solution for Puerto Rico.  After the Liberal Party was defeated in 1936 elections, an assembly was held in Naranjales on May 31, 1937, in which Luis Muñoz Marín presented his ideas as to how the party should be run, however the majority of the party members objected and blamed him for their defeat. Muñoz Marín considered this action the same as having been expelled from the party. Muñoz Marín and his followers, among which were included Felisa Rincon de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini, held an assembly in the town of Arecibo founded the Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo , claiming to be the true Liberal Party. The Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo, an independence political party, later became the  |Popular_Democratic_Party|Popular_Democratic_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  which would ironically end up promoting the Estado Libre Associado status that Barceló, as president of Union Party, had asked for in 1923 under Campbell Bill and which Muñoz Marín had always opposed, instead of independence.     The  |Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party|Nationalist_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  was founded in 1922. It strongly criticized the American colonial regime for its menace to the Spanish and Latin American roots of the Puerto Rican culture. It also advocated for complete independence. The PNP began to grow with the leadership of  |Dr._Pedro_Albizu_Campos|Pedro_Albizu_Campos| , who was later jailed by the colonial regime under charges as a subversive leader. On March 21, 1937, a peaceful march was organized in the southern city of  |Ponce|Ponce,_Puerto_Rico|  by the nationalists after receiving authorization from the pertinent authorities. American Gunfight: The Plot to Kill Harry Truman: And the Shoot-Out That Stopped It. Simon and Schuster. 2005. . Accessed 2009-10-09. The march was organized to commemorate the abolition of slavery and to demand the release of Albizu Campos from federal prison. The permit, however, was revoked by the U.S.-appointed governor of the Island  |Blanton_Winship|Blanton_Winship|  minutes before the march was to start. The march turned into a bloody event when the Insular Police   opened fire upon, what a U.S. Congressman and others reported were unarmed  and defenseless   cadets and bystanders alike   killing 19 and badly wounding over 200 more,  many in their backs while running away.    The entire speech is contained in the Congressional Record of August 14, 1939. It is reported in the Cong. Rec., and various other publications elsewhere, that among those shot in their backs was a 7-year-old girl, Georgina Maldonado, who was killed through the back while running to a nearby church It came to be known as the  |Ponce_massacre|Ponce_Massacre| .         |Luis_Muñoz_Marín|Luis_Muñoz_Marín|  founded the  |Popular_Democratic_Party|Partido_Popular_Democratico|  in 1940. Their slogan was Pan, Tierra y Libertad . The party favored independence from the United States in its initial stages but social and economic reform were priorities in their political agenda.     The  |Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|  was formed six years later by dissidents who saw the PPD moving away from the ideal of independence. During that period, the colonial regime appointed the first Puerto Rican governor,  |Jesús_T._Piñero|Jesús_T._Piñero| , until 1948 when the people elected Luis Muñoz Marín, the first elected  |governor|Governor_Of_Puerto_Rico| .     The years or 1944–1948 were crucial ones in the direction of the country. Luis Muñoz Marín shifted his goals from independence to state-like autonomy to accommodate better economic circumstances. This led to the U.S. Congress to enact the Public Law 81-600 which led to the Congressional approval of a local constitution drafted by a constitutional assembly elected by Puerto Rico and the renaming of the United States unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, using the same official name as the commonwealths of the U.S. states of  |Kentucky|Kentucky| ,  |Massachusetts|Massachusetts| ,  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania|  and  |Virginia|Virginia| , as well as that of other sovereign nation countries such as Australia. The alternative pro-independence Tydings bill had languished in Congress.     In the 1950s, the  |Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party|Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party|  denounced the  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Puerto_Rico|  and  |Muñoz_Marín|Luis_Muñoz_Marín|  support as a sham, and staged a series of uprisings in 1950, known as the  |Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party_Revolts_of_the_1950s|Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party_Revolts_Of_The_1950S| , of which the most notable were the ones in  |Jayuya|Jayuya_Uprising| ,  |Utuado|Utuado_Uprising|  and  |San_Juan|San_Juan_Nationalist_Revolt| , plus the attack on  |Blair_House|Blair_House| , and the  |United_States_House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives|  in 1954. Twenty-three people were killed and more than 50 were injured.      |Governor|Governor_Of_Puerto_Rico|  Muñoz Marín inaugurated the new status called Estado Libre Asociado—or  Free Associated State in English—and raised the  |Puerto_Rican_flag|Puerto_Rican_Flag|  along with  |La_Borinqueña|La_Borinqueña| , the official anthem of Puerto Rico, for the first time on July 25, 1952—date in which Puerto Ricans celebrate the Constitution of Puerto Rico .       The  |New_Progressive_Party|New_Progressive_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  was founded in August, 1967 by  |Luis_A._Ferré|Luis_A._Ferré| , a month after the July 23, 1967 local plebiscite and the year before the PNP won the 1968 elections. The party saw the ideology of annexation as a U.S. state as a  |civil_rights|Civil_Rights|  issue. The creation of the New Progressive Party polarized the political arena to a great degree as radical independence groups were formed in the 1970s and the  |Puerto_Rican_Socialist_Party|Puerto_Rican_Socialist_Party|  , a  |Marxist|Marxist|  and  |Cuba|Cuba| -friendly party, was created. Two of the radical groups were labeled as terrorist groups by the U.S. Government,  |Los_Macheteros|Los_Macheteros|  and the  |Armed_Forces_of_National_Liberation|Fuerzas_Armadas_De_Liberación_Nacional|  . These groups were viewed by many pro-independence followers as freedom fighters.     In 1972 the NPP lost to a reunified Popular Democratic Party .  |Rafael_Hernández_Colón|Rafael_Hernández_Colón|  became the undisputed leader of the PPD at age 36. He was, as the fourth elected  |governor|Governor_Of_Puerto_Rico| , in favor of adding more powers to the commonwealth status. One of his projects was the Puerto Rican owned marine transportation. In order to control the costs of marine transport in Puerto Rico, the marine company Sea Land was bought to form  Navieras of Puerto Rico  in 1974.     The fifth governor was  |Carlos_Romero_Barceló|Carlos_Romero_Barceló| , a fierce supporter of annexation as the U.S. state of Puerto Rico. Under his administration, Section 936 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Tax Code  was implemented as an economic incentive. This allowed American companies to profit in the island without paying taxes. His administration was shadowed by the  |Cerro_Maravilla|Maravilla_Hill_Case|  affair, where two independence activists were killed by police agents. This created a  |Watergate|Watergate_Scandal| -like scandal that was later investigated by the Senate.     In 1980, Romero Barcelo was reelected Governor by a controversial 0.2% margin, but lost control of the Senate and, a year later, the House of Representatives to the PDP. Independence radical groups placed bombs on 11 jet fighters in 1981 in the Muñiz Base , and the U.S. removed all of its fighter aircraft from Puerto Rico.  |Rafael_Hernández_Colón|Rafael_Hernández_Colón|  became the head of government for the second time in 1984, was reelected in 1988 and remained in power until 1992.      |Pedro_Rosselló|Pedro_Rosselló|  became the sixth elected Governor in 1992. He pushed the political status dilemma in  |Washington,_D.C.|Washington,_D.C.|  and sponsored two local non-binding referendums, one in 1993 and another in 1998. While he was elected to a second term, his last four years were met with mounting allegations of corruption. After Rossellós second term ended, former Speaker of the House Edison Misla Aldarondo was jailed as well as many members of Rossellós party. Most of the corruption allegations were based on extortion and appropriation of public funds. This led his party to lose the 2000 election and the Governorship when he ran again in 2004.     In 2000  |Sila_María_Calderón|Sila_María_Calderón|  was elected, becoming the first female governor of Puerto Rico, also gaining control of the Senate, presided over by  |Antonio_Fas_Alzamora|Antonio_Fas_Alzamora|  and the House of Representatives, headed by Speaker  |Carlos_Vizcarrondo|Carlos_Vizcarrondo| . The PDP also elected  |Aníbal_Acevedo_Vilá|Aníbal_Acevedo_Vilá|  as the islands non-voting delegate in Congress.     In 2004  |Aníbal_Acevedo_Vilá|Aníbal_Acevedo_Vilá|  was declared the winner by the  |Supreme_Court_of_Puerto_Rico|Supreme_Court_Of_Puerto_Rico|  as  |governor|Governor_Of_Puerto_Rico|  by about 3,000 votes, but his party lost control of the Senate, which elected NPP Senator  |Kenneth_McClintock|Kenneth_Mcclintock|  as its president, and the House of Representatives, which chose the NPPs  |José_Aponte|José_Aponte_Hernández|  as Speaker, and Puerto Ricos seat in Congress, due to the election of  |Luis_Fortuño|Luis_Fortuño| .     During the 2005–2008 term, former Gov. Rossellós unsuccessful attempt to unseat Senate President McClintock split the New Progressive Party, a split that continued as Rosselló initiated a fourth bid for the governorship against Resident Commissioner Fortuño in an internal primary that was held March 9, 2008, and which he lost. On the PDP side, Acevedos rocky relationship with the NPP-controlled Legislature was compounded with Federal investigations and unsuccessful indictments of his past political fundraising by grand juries in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  and  |San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico|San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico| .     In 2008  |Luis_Fortuño|Luis_Fortuño|  was elected  |governor|Governor_Of_Puerto_Rico| , giving the  |New_Progressive_Party|New_Progressive_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  its largest victory in history and beating incumbent Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá of the  |Popular_Democratic_Party|Popular_Democratic_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  by more than 223,000 votes. Also the NPP won supermajorities in the Commonwealths  |House_of_Representatives|Puerto_Rico_House_Of_Representatives|  and  |Senate|Senate_Of_Puerto_Rico| . Additionally, the NPP won the seat for  |Puerto_Ricos_sole_delegate|Resident_Commissioner_Of_Puerto_Rico|  to  |Congress|U.S._Congress| , because of the election of  |Pedro_Pierluisi|Pedro_Pierluisi| .  |Alejandro_García_Padilla|Alejandro_García_Padilla|  was elected as the eleventh  |Governor_of_Puerto_Rico|Governor_Of_Puerto_Rico| , by a narrow margin, defeating Fortuño 47.73% to 47.13% in the  |2012_gubernatorial_elections|Puerto_Rico_Gubernatorial_Election,_2012| .    On November 8, 2016,  |Ricardo_Rosselló|Ricardo_Rosselló| , the son of former governor Pedro Rosselló and an advocate of Puerto Rican statehood, received 41% of the vote defeating five other gubernatorial candidates and was elected the twelfth Governor of Puerto Rico. He was sworn in on January 2, 2017.             In 1950, the  |U.S._Congress|U.S._Congress|  gave Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention, contingent on the results of a referendum, where the electorate would determine if they wished to organize their own government pursuant to a constitution of their own choosing. Puerto Ricans expressed their support for this measure in a 1951 referendum, which gave voters a yes-or-no choice for the commonwealth status, defined as a permanent association with a federal union but not choice for independence or statehood. A second referendum was held to ratify the constitution, which was adopted in 1952.     Before approving the new constitution, the Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the  |body_politic|Body_Politic|  would be known. On February 4, 1952, the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth|  , meaning a politically organized community  or state , which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system. The convention adopted a translation into Spanish of the term, inspired by the Irish saorstát  of Estado Libre Asociado to represent the agreement adopted in the nature of a compact between the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. literally translated into English, the phrase means Associated Free State.     In 1967, the Legislative Assembly tested the political interests of the Puerto Rican people by passing a  |plebiscite|Plebiscite|  Act that allowed a vote on the status of Puerto Rico. This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice on three political status options. Puerto Rican leaders had lobbied for such an opportunity repeatedly, in 1898, 1912, 1914, 1919, 1923, 1929, 1932, 1939, 1943, 1944, 1948, 1956, and 1960. The Commonwealth option, represented by the PDP, won with an overwhelming majority of 60.4% of the votes. The  |Partido_Republicano_Puertorriqueño|Partido_Republicano_Puertorriqueño|  and the  |Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|  boycotted the plebiscite.     After the plebiscite, efforts in the 1970s to enact legislation to address the status issue died in Congressional committees. In the 1993 plebiscite, in which Congress played a more substantial role, Commonwealth status was again upheld. For complete statistics of these plebiscites, see . In the 1998 plebiscite, all the options were rejected when 50.3% of voters chose the none of the above option, favoring the commonwealth status quo by default.        On November 27, 1953, shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly of the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  approved  |Resolution_748|Un_General_Assembly_Resolution| , removing Puerto Ricos classification as a  |non-self-governing_territory|United_Nations_List_Of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories|  under article 73 of the Charter from UN. But the General Assembly did not apply its full list of criteria to Puerto Rico to determine if it has achieved self-governing status.     In August 1977, the Chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, Franklin Delano López, testified before the  |UN_Decolonization_Committee|Special_Committee_On_Decolonization|  denouncing the colonial nature of the Commonwealth Status. As a result of his statement, many other statehooders and commonwealth supporters went to the United Nations requesting the end of the colonial status. President  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  subsequently signed the Alternative Futures and Self Determination Executive Order on July 25, 1978, guaranteeing the right of self-determination to the People of Puerto Rico.       Under the  |Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico|Constitution_Of_Puerto_Rico| , Puerto Rico is described as a Commonwealth and Puerto Ricans have a degree of  |administrative_autonomy|Autonomous_Entity|  similar to that of a  |U.S._state|U.S._State| .   Puerto Ricans were collectively made  |U.S._citizens|American_Citizenshipbirth_Within_The_United_States|  in 1917 as a result of the  |Jones–Shafroth_Act|Jones–Shafroth_Act| . U.S. citizenship was extended to residents of Puerto Rico by virtue of the Jones Act, chap. 190, 39 Stat. 951 The act was signed into law by President  |Woodrow_Wilson|Woodrow_Wilson|  on March 2, 1917. U.S. Federal law  approved by the President  |Harry_S._Truman|Harry_S._Truman|  on June 27, 1952 declared all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941 to be  |citizens_of_the_U.S._at_birth|Citizens_Of_The_U.S._At_Birth|  and all persons born in Puerto Rico between April 11, 1899, and January 12, 1941, and meeting certain other technical requirements, and not citizens of the United States under any other Act, were declared to be citizens of the U.S. as of January 13, 1941.      Only the  |fundamental_rights|Fundamental_Right|  under the federal constitution apply to Puerto Rico like the  |Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause|Privileges_And_Immunities_Clause|   that prevents a  |state|U.S._State|  from treating citizens of other states in a discriminatory manner, with regard to basic civil rights. The clause also embraces a right to travel, so that a citizen of one state can go and enjoy privileges and immunities in any other state; this constitutional clause was expressly extended to Puerto Rico by the  |U.S._Congress|U.S._Congress|  through the federal law  and signed by the President  |Harry_S._Truman|Harry_S._Truman|  in 1947.    |Torres_v._Puerto_Rico|Torres_V._Puerto_Rico|  Other fundamental rights like the  |Due_Process|Due_Process|  Clause and the  |equal_protection|Equal_Protection|  guarantee of the  |Fourteenth_Amendment|Fourteenth_Amendment_To_The_United_States_Constitution|  was expressly extended to Puerto Rico by the  |U.S._Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States| . In a brief concurrence in the judgment of  Torres v. Puerto Rico , U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |Brennan|William_J._Brennan_Jr.| , argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution  were anachronistic in the 1970s.       President  |George_H._W._Bush|George_H._W._Bush|  issued a memorandum on November 30, 1992 to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations.      Puerto Rico does participate in the internal political process of both the  |Democratic|Democratic_Party|  and  |Republican|Republican_Party|  parties in the U.S., accorded equal-proportional representation in both parties, and delegates from the islands vote in each partys national presidential convention.     Puerto Ricans may enlist in the U.S. military. Since 1917, Puerto Ricans have been included in the compulsory draft whenever it has been in effect and more than 400,000 Puerto Ricans have served in the United States Armed Forces. Puerto Ricans have participated in all U.S. wars since 1898, most notably  |World_War_I|Puerto_Ricans_In_World_War_I| ,  |World_War_II|Puerto_Ricans_In_World_War_Ii| , the  |Korean|65Th_Infantry_Regiment|  and  |Vietnam|Vietnam_War|  wars, as well as the current  |Middle_Eastern_conflicts|Middle_Eastern_Conflicts| . Several Puerto Ricans became notable commanders, five have been awarded the  |Medal_of_Honor|Medal_Of_Honor| , the highest military decoration in the United States, also several Puerto Ricans have attained the rank of  |General|General|  or  |Admiral|Admiral| , which requires a Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation.

Retrieved November 19, 2006. the Korean War  and the Vietnam War  Puerto Ricans were the most decorated Hispanic soldiers and in some cases they were the first to die in combat.  Nieves, New York Times, 1993.               Puerto Rico is an organized unincorporated U.S. territory which has been given internal self-governing powers which are referred to as  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth|  status. Puerto Rico has more latitude over its internal affairs than the U.S. territories of  |Guam|Guam| , the  |U.S._Virgin_Islands|U.S._Virgin_Islands| , or  |American_Samoa|American_Samoa| .     Puerto Rico has approximately the same degree of authority over its internal affairs as an American  |state|U.S._State| . However, it does not have the sovereignty that a state of the Union has, given that Puerto Rico is a possession of the United States and it is, thus, not protected by the US Constitution to the same degree that states are.       Some differences between Puerto Rico and a state of the American Union are:   Unlike  |states|Us_States| ,  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico|  does not have a zone of reserved sovereignty that is beyond the reach of Congress in the latters exercise of its territorial powers.  That is, Puerto Rico has no recourse to challenge unilateral actions by the United States government that affect citizens of Puerto Rico.   Puerto Rico does not have the rights of a state as granted by the US constitution, because it is not a state. These include:   Lack of voting representation in either House of the  |U.S._Congress|Congress_Of_The_United_States| .   Puerto Rico residents cannot vote in  |presidential_elections|President_Of_The_United_States| |Internal_Revenue_Code|Internal_Revenue_Code|  See also: Puerto Rico Tax and Customs Laws   |United_States_Congress|United_States_Congress| , nor is it represented in the  |United_States_Electoral_College|United_States_Electoral_College| . Puerto Ricans do, however, play an indirect role in electing the  |President_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States| , since both the  |Republican_Party|Republican_Party|  and the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  hold primaries in Puerto Rico, giving Puerto Ricans a voice selecting each partys presidential nominee.     Both the  |Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|  and the  |New_Progressive_Party|New_Progressive_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  outright reject the status quo that permits disfranchisement. The remaining political organization, the  |Popular_Democratic_Party|Popular_Democratic_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico| , is less active in its opposition of this case of disfranchisement but has officially stated that it favors fixing the remaining deficits of democracy that the  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  and  |George_W._Bush|George_W._Bush|  Administrations have publicly recognized in writing through Presidential Task Force Reports.       Although the  |Republican_Party|Republican_Party|  and  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  chapters in Puerto Rico have selected voting delegates to the national nominating conventions since the early 1900s, public interest in these processes heightened as a result of the efforts of a group of Democratic statehooders led by  |Franklin_Delano_López|Franklin_Delano_López|  in 1976 to elect delegates supporting former Georgia Gov.  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  to that years Democratic National Convention.On October 23, 1979, the first primary of a party affiliated to the Democratic National Committee was held in Puerto Rico. Franklin Delano López was elected Chairman of the New Democratic Party of Puerto Rico by the direct votes of 374,000 American citizens residing on the Island. Lopez then moved the Puerto Rican Legislature to adopt a Presidential Primary Law. During the discussion of the Presidential primary Law, Lopez managed to persuade Presidential Chief of Staff,  |Hamilton_Jordan|Hamilton_Jordan|  and  |Timothy_Kraft|Timothy_Kraft|  to grant Puerto Rico the right for a more robust delegation, the inclusion of Puerto Rico after Pennsylvania in the roll call of the state in exchange of eliminating from the bill that Puerto Rico was going to be the first Presidential Primary in the Nation. As a result of that effort, the Puerto Rico Legislature approved a law regulating presidential primaries in 1979, the first of which was held in 1980, with  |George_H._W._Bush|George_H._W._Bush|  winning the Republican primary and President Carter beating Senator  |Edward_Ted_Kennedy|Ted_Kennedy|  in a hard-fought Democratic primary. More than 1.2 million American citizens residing in Puerto Rico participated in the primaries.     In the first internal primary of a National political party, the new slate of statehooders, headed by Franklin Delano López took control of the local Democratic party chapter. In January 1980 after clashing with Governor Carlos Romero Barceló, Lopez was forced to resign the chairmanship of the New Democratic Party in exchange of the Governor becoming the President of Carters campaign in Puerto Rico and throwing the New Progressive Party behind the presidents re-election efforts. Lopez fight with Governor Romero, on behalf of President Carter, paid off and was appointed Deputy Campaign Manager of President Carter national campaign. Lopez efforts moved to Puerto Rico and the status issue at the forefront of the National political discussion. Subsequently, both the statehood faction and the commonwealth shared control on a 50-50 basis from 1984 to 1988 and lost control that year as a result of their defeat in an internal primary that year between PDP forces led by then Senate president  |Miguel_Hernández_Agosto|Miguel_Hernández_Agosto|  and NPP forces led by former Gov.  |Carlos_Romero_Barceló|Carlos_Romero_Barceló| . While the PDP Democratic faction controls the Democratic party chapter under the state chairmanship of former senator  |Roberto_Prats|Roberto_Prats| , two of the five DNC members residing in Puerto Rico, Senate president  |Kenneth_McClintock|Kenneth_Mcclintock|  and  |Francisco_Domenech|Francisco_Domenech|  are statehooders.     On the Republican side NPP-affiliated statehood Republicans control the GOP local chapter , headed by state chair and  |Aguadilla|Aguadilla|  mayor Carlos Méndez, Republican National Committeeman and Governor  |Luis_Fortuño|Luis_Fortuño|  and Republican National Committeewoman Zoraida Fonalledas.     The 2008 Republican presidential primary was slated to be held in February, while Democrats held their primary in June. Then Senate President and Democratic National Committeeman  |Kenneth_McClintock|Kenneth_Mcclintock| , former Sen.  |Roberto_Prats|Roberto_Prats| , Puerto Ricos Democratic State Chair and former PDP gubernatorial candidate  |José_Alfredo_Hernández_Mayoral|José_Alfredo_Hernández_Mayoral|  were appointed co-chairs of Sen.  |Hillary_Clintons|Hillary_Clinton|  National Hispanic Leadership Council while Young Democrats of America Democratic National Committeeman  |Francisco_Domenech|Francisco_Domenech|  co-chaired Clintons young professionals organization. Prats and McClintock subsequently co-chaired Clintons Puerto Rico campaign, while  |Francisco_Domenech|Francisco_Domenech|  became the Deputy Campaign Manager. Senator Clinton won the Puerto Rico Primary by a 68% to 32% margin.   Being the last big primary before the last two states voted on June 3, Puerto Ricos Democratic presidential primary attracted historic levels of national media coverage.     Several local politicians have expressed concern that Puerto Rico has become a piggy bank for presidential campaigns. . Recent examples include Vice President  |Dick_Cheneys|Dick_Cheney|  whirlwind two-hour visit to collect $300,000 in 2006 and Senator  |Barack_Obamas|Barack_Obama|  somewhat longer three-hour trip in November, 2007 to collect $200,000 . Both refused to meet with the news media, press the flesh or meet with local politicians, inconceivable in Iowa or New Hampshire.     Speculation, which began in late 2009 by a national media blog  and by Grover Norquist, a well-known Republican commentator, mentioned Gov. Fortuño as a long-shot inclusion in a national political ticket.     President Obama was scheduled to briefly visit Puerto Rico on June 14, 2011.        According to a December 2005, report by the  |Presidents_Task_Force_on_Puerto_Ricos_Status|Presidents_Task_Force_On_Puerto_Ricos_Status| , it is not possible to bind future Congresses to any particular arrangement for Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth . This determination was based on articles in the  |U.S._Constitution|U.S._Constitution|  regarding territories. Prominent leaders in the pro-statehood and pro-independence political movements agree with this assessment. In 2005 and 2007, two reports were issued by the U.S. Presidents Task Force on Puerto Ricos Status.   Both reports conclude that Puerto Rico continues to be a territory of U.S. under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress. Reactions from Puerto Ricos two major political parties were mixed. The Popular Democratic Party challenged the task forces report and committed to validating the current status in all international forums, including the United Nations. It also rejects any colonial or territorial status as a status option, and vows to keep working for the enhanced Commonwealth status that was approved by the PPD in 1998 which included sovereignty, an association based on respect and dignity between both nations , and common citizenship.  by the Puerto Rico Herald. The New Progressive Party supported the White House Reports conclusions and supported bills to provide for a democratic referendum process among Puerto Rico voters. It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause Art. IV, Sec. 3, clause 2, U.S. Constitution of the U.S. Constitution. In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the  |U.S._House_Committee_on_Resources|United_States_House_Committee_On_Natural_Resources|  stated that PRs current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government . It concluded that Puerto Rico is still an unincorporated territory of the U.S. under the territorial clause, that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress, and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time, for a legitimate Federal purpose.  The application of the Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the  |Insular_Cases|Insular_Cases| .     On December 21, 2007, the Bush Administrations Task Force on Puerto Ricos Status reiterated and confirmed that Puerto Rico continues to be a territory of the U.S. under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress,   a position shared by the remaining two-major parties:  |New_Progressive_Party|New_Progressive_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  and the  |Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party| .     Following the reports recommendations the 2009 bill , was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on May 19, 2009 by  |Pedro_Pierluisi|Pedro_Pierluisi|  .  The bill would provide for a referendum giving Puerto Ricans the choice between the options of retaining their present political status, or choosing a new status.  If the former option were to win, the referendum would have been held again every 8 years. If the latter option were to win, a separate referendum would be held where Puerto Ricans would have been given the option of being admitted as a US State on equal footing with the other states , or becoming a sovereign nation, either fully independent from or in free association with the United States. The bill enjoys bi-partisan support in the House of Representatives, with 182 co-sponsors and was reported out of the House Resources Committee on a 30–8 vote. The measure was passed by the House on April 29, 2010.      On March 16, 2011, the Presidents Task Force on Puerto Ricos Status issued a third report  that reaffirned the legal position adopted by the three previous presidents over nearly a quarter century that Puerto Rico remains today subject to the Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution , that the territorys long-term economic well-being would be enhanced by an early resolution of the political status problem and devotes most of the report to extensive economic analysis and recommendations.     On December 11th, 2012, the  |Legislative_Assembly_of_Puerto_Rico|Legislative_Assembly_Of_Puerto_Rico|  has enacted a  |concurrent_resolution|Concurrent_Resolution|  to request the  |President|U.S._President|  and the  |Congress_of_the_United_States|Congress_Of_The_United_States|  to respond diligently and effectively, and to act on the demand of the people of Puerto Rico, as freely and democratically expressed in the plebiscite held on November 6, 2012, to end, once and for all, its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico to the Union as a State.      On May 15, 2013, headed by non-voting Resident Commissioner  |Pedro_Pierluisi|Pedro_Pierluisi| , a group of 119 Democratic and 12 Republican members of Congress cosponsored H.R. 2000, the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act to Congress, requesting a process for voting to admit Puerto Rico as a State to be approved and a vote to ratify Puerto Rico as a state. , Puerto Rico Report, 15 May 2013.

The  |Popular_Democratic_Party|Popular_Democratic_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  has challenged the Bush Administrations Task Force Reports stating that in 1953 Puerto Rico achieved a compact of association between both nations that was recognized by the United Nations. Nonetheless, the aforementioned U.S. Presidential and Congressional Reports state that the current prerogatives assumed by the Puerto Rico government are delegated by the U.S. Congress and may be amended or eliminated at its sole behest.     In a letter sent by the former governor of Puerto Rico to the former U.S. Secretary of State,  |Condoleezza_Rice|Condoleezza_Rice|  and the Co-Chairs of the White Houses Presidential Task Force on Puerto Ricos Status on the Bush administration, former governor Acevedo Vilá stated:  .
