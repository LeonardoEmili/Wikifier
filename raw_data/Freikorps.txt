              Freikorps  were  |irregular|Irregular_Military|  German  |military_volunteer|Military_Volunteer|  units that existed from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, which effectively fought as  |mercenary|Mercenary|  or  |private_armies|Private_Army| , regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries, the first so-called Freikorps were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades and deserters. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry , sometimes in just  |company|Company|  strength, sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong; there were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian von Kleist Freikorps included infantry,  |jäger|Jäger| ,  |dragoons|Dragoons|  and  |hussars|Hussars| . The French  |Volontaires_de_Saxe|Volontaires_De_Saxe|  combined  |uhlans|Uhlan|  and dragoons.     In the aftermath of  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and during the  |German_Revolution_of_1918–19|German_Revolution_Of_1918–19| , Freikorps consisting largely of World War I veterans were raised as right-wing  |paramilitary|Paramilitary|  militias, ostensibly to fight on behalf of the government  against the  |Soviet|Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic| -backed German Communists attempting to overthrow the  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| . William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, New York, NY, Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 55  However, the Freikorps also largely despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters.              The very first Freikorps were recruited by  |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_The_Great|  during the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War| . On 15 July 1759, Frederick ordered the creation of a squadron of volunteer  |hussars|Hussar|  to be attached to the 1st Regiment of Hussars . He entrusted the creation and command of this new unit to Colonel Friedrich Wilhelm von Kleist. This first squadron was raised in Dresden and consisted mainly of Hungarian deserters. This squadron was placed under the command of Lieutenant Johann Michael von Kovacs. At the end of 1759, the first four squadrons of  |dragoons|Dragoon|  of the Freikorps were organised. They initially consisted of Prussian volunteers from Berlin, Magdeburg, Mecklenburg and Leipzig, but later recruited deserters. The Freikorps were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they mainly were used as sentries and for minor duties.     These early Freikorps appeared during the  |War_of_the_Austrian_Succession|War_Of_The_Austrian_Succession|  and especially the Seven Years War, when France, Prussia and the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  embarked on an escalation of  |petty_warfare|Petty_Warfare|  while conserving their regular regiments. Even during the last  |Kabinettskrieg|Kabinettskriege| , the  |War_of_the_Bavarian_Succession|War_Of_The_Bavarian_Succession| , Freikorp formations were formed in 1778. Germans, Hungarians, Poles, Lithuanians and  |South_Slavs|South_Slavs| , as well as Turks,  |Tatars|Tatars|  and  |Cossacks|Cossacks| , were believed by all warring parties to be inherently good fighters. The nationality of many soldiers can no longer be ascertained as the ethnic origin was often described imprecisely in the regimental lists. Slavs were often referred to as Hungarians or just Croats , and Muslim recruits as Turks .     For Prussia, the  |Pandurs|Pandur| , who were made up of Croats and Serbs, were a clear model for the organization of such free troops. Frederick the Great created 14  |free_infantry|Free_Infantry|   units, mainly between 1756 and 1758, which were intended to be attractive to those soldiers who wanted military adventure , but did not want to have to do military drill. A distinction should be made between the Freikorps formed up to 1759 for the final years of the war, which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with surprise attacks, and the free infantry which consisted of various military branches  and were used in combination. They were often used to ward off  |Maria_Theresas|Maria_Theresa|  Pandurs. In the era of  |linear_tactics|Linear_Tactics| , light troops had been seen necessary for outpost, reinforcement and reconnaissance duties. During the war, eight such volunteer corps were set up:      |Trümbachs|Friedrich_Adolf_Rudolf_Von_Trümbach|  Freikorps    |Kleists|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_Arnd_Von_Kleist|  Freikorps    |Glasenapps|Joachim_Reinhold_Von_Glasenapp|  Free Dragoons   Schonys Freikorps   Gschrays Freikorps    |Bauers|Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bauer|  Free Hussars    |Légion_Britannique|Légion_Britannique|     Volontaires Auxiliaires . Background, formation and numbering according to Bleckwenn Vol. IV, pp. 82ff     Because, with some exceptions, they were seen as undisciplined and less battleworthy, they were used for less onerous guard and  |garrison|Garrison|  duties. In the so-called petty wars , the Freikorps interdicted enemy supply lines with  |guerrilla_warfare|Guerrilla_Warfare| . In the case of capture, their members were at risk of being executed as irregular fighters. In Prussia the Freikorps, which Frederick the Great had despised as vermin , were disbanded. Their soldiers were given no entitlement to pensions or invalidity payments.     In France, many corps continued to exist until 1776. They were attached to regular dragoon regiments as jäger  |squadrons|Squadron| . During the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , Austria recruited various Freikorps of Slavic origin. The  |Slavonic|Slavonia|  Wurmser Freikorps fought in Alsace. The combat effectiveness of the six Viennese Freikorps , however, was low. An exception were the border regiments of Croats and Serbs who served permanently on the Austro- |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  border.          Freikorps in the modern sense emerged in Germany during the course of the Napoleonic Wars. They fought not so much for money but rather out of patriotic motives, seeking to shake off the French  |Confederation_of_the_Rhine|Confederation_Of_The_Rhine| . After the French under Emperor  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  had either conquered the German states or forced them to collaborate, remnants of the defeated armies continued to fight on in this fashion. Famous formations included the  |Kings_German_Legion|Kings_German_Legion| , who had fought for Britain in  |French-occupied_Spain|Kingdom_Of_Spain_Under_Joseph_Bonaparte|  and mainly were recruited from Hanoverians, the  |Lützow_Free_Corps|Lützow_Free_Corps|  and the  |Black_Brunswickers|Black_Brunswickers| .     The Freikorps attracted many nationally disposed citizens and students. Freikorps commanders such as  |Ferdinand_von_Schill|Ferdinand_Von_Schill| ,  |Ludwig_Adolf_Wilhelm_von_Lützow|Ludwig_Adolf_Wilhelm_Von_Lützow|  or  |Frederick_William,_Duke_of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Frederick_William,_Duke_Of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel| , known as the Black Duke , led their own attacks on Napoleonic occupation forces in Germany. Those led by Schill were decimated in the  |Battle_of_Stralsund|Battle_Of_Stralsund| ; many were killed in battle or executed at Napoleons command in the aftermath. The Freikorps were very popular during the period of the  |German_War_of_Liberation|German_War_Of_Liberation|  , during which von Lützow, a survivor of Schills Freikorps, formed his Lützow Free Corps. The anti-Napoleonic Freikorps often operated behind French lines as a kind of commando or guerrilla force.     Throughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic Freikorps were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. This myth was invoked, in considerably different circumstances, in the aftermath of Germanys defeat in  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .       Even in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era, Freikorps were set up with varying degrees of success.     During the March 1848 riots, student Freikorps were set up in Munich.     In  |First_Schleswig_War|First_Schleswig_War|  of 1848 the Freikorps of  |von_der_Tann|Ludwig_Freiherr_Von_Und_Zu_Der_Tann-Rathsamhausen| ,  |Zastrow|Heinrich_Von_Zastrow|  and others distinguished themselves.     In 1864 in Mexico, the French formed the so-called Contreguerrillas under former Prussian hussar officer, Milson. In  |Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy| ,  |Garibaldi|Giuseppe_Garibaldi|  formed his famous  Freischar s, notably the Thousand of Marsala , which landed in Sicily in 1860.     Even before the  |Franco-Prussian_War|Franco-Prussian_War|  of 1870/71, Freikorps were developed in France that were known as  |franc-tireurs|Franc-Tireur| .          The meaning of the word Freikorps changed over time. After 1918, the term was used for the paramilitary organizations that sprang up around Germany as soldiers returned in defeat from World War I. They were the key  |Weimar_paramilitary_groups|Weimar_Paramilitary_Groups|  active during that time. Many German veterans felt disconnected from civilian life, and joined a Freikorps in search of stability within a military structure. Others, angry at their sudden, apparently inexplicable defeat, joined up in an effort to put down communist uprisings, such as the  |Spartacist_uprising|Spartacist_Uprising| , or exact some form of revenge on those they considered  |responsible_for_the_armistice|Stab-In-The-Back_Myth| . They received considerable support from Minister of Defence  |Gustav_Noske|Gustav_Noske| , a member of the  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany| . Noske used them to crush the  |German_Revolution_of_1918–19|German_Revolution_Of_1918–19|  and the  |Marxist|Marxist| |Spartacist_League|Spartacist_League| , including arresting and murdering  |Karl_Liebknecht|Karl_Liebknecht|  and  |Rosa_Luxemburg|Rosa_Luxemburg|  on 15 January 1919. They were used to defeat the  |Bavarian_Soviet_Republic|Bavarian_Soviet_Republic|  in May 1919.      On 5 May 1919, members of Freikorps Lützow in  |Perlach|Ramersdorf-Perlach|  near Munich, acted on a tip from a local cleric and arrested and killed twelve alleged communist workers . A memorial on Pfanzeltplatz in Munich today commemorates the incident.  Morris, Justice Imperiled: The Anti-Nazi Lawyer Max Hirschberg in Weimar Germany  in the Axis History Factbook        Freikorps also fought against the communists in  |the_Baltics|Freikorps_In_The_Baltic| ,  |Silesia|Silesian_Uprisings| , Poland and  |East_Prussia|East_Prussia|  after the end of World War I, including aviation combat, often with significant success.  |Anti-Slavic_racism|Anti-Slavic_Racism|  was sometimes present, although the  |ethnic_cleansing|Ethnic_Cleansing|  ideology and  |anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitism|  expressed in later years had not yet developed. Michael Mann, Fascists, Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University, 2004, , p. 153. In the Baltics they fought against communists as well as against the newborn independent democratic countries Estonia and Latvia. In Latvia, Freikorps murdered 300 civilians in Mitau who were suspected of having  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik|  sympathies . After the capture of Riga, another 3000 alleged communists were killed, A Brief History of the Birth of the Nazis: How the Freikorps Blazed a Trail for Hitler   Nigel Jones, Carroll & Graf, 2004 including summary executions of 50–60 prisoners daily.

Their attack was halted when German citizens loyal to the government went on strike, cutting off many services and making daily life so problematic that the coup was called off.        In 1920,  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  had just begun his political career as the leader of the tiny and as-yet-unknown Deutsche Arbeiterpartei/DAP  |German_Workers_Party|German_Workers_Party| , which was soon renamed the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei/NSDAP or  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party|  in Munich. Numerous future members and leaders of the Nazi Party had served in the Freikorps, including  |Ernst_Röhm|Ernst_Röhm| , future head of the  |Sturmabteilung|Sturmabteilung| , or SA,  |Heinrich_Himmler|Heinrich_Himmler| , future head of the  |Schutzstaffel|Schutzstaffel| , or SS, and  |Rudolf_Höß|Rudolf_Höß| , the future Kommandant of the  |Auschwitz_concentration_camp|Auschwitz_Concentration_Camp| .  |Hermann_Ehrhardt|Hermann_Ehrhardt| , founder and leader of  |Marinebrigade_Ehrhardt|Marinebrigade_Ehrhardt| , and his deputy Commander Eberhard Kautter, leaders of the  |Viking_League|Viking_League| , refused to help Hitler and  |Erich_Ludendorff|Erich_Ludendorff|  in their  |Beer_Hall_Putsch|Beer_Hall_Putsch|  and conspired against them.     Hitler eventually viewed some of them as threats. A huge ceremony was arranged on 9 November 1933 in which the Freikorps leaders symbolically presented their old battle flags to Hitlers SA and SS. It was a sign of allegiance to their new authority, the Nazi state.  |Waite|Waite1969| , p.  197. When Hitlers internal purge of the party, the  |Night_of_the_Long_Knives|Night_Of_The_Long_Knives| , came in 1934, a large number of Freikorps leaders were targeted for killing or arrest, including Ehrhardt and Röhm. Historian Robert GL Waite claims that in Hitlers Röhm Purge speech to the Reichstag on 13 July 1934, he implied that the Freikorps were one of the groups of pathological enemies of the state .  |Waite|Waite1969| , pp.  280–1.
