           Albert  was the  |King|Monarch|  of  |Saxony|Kingdom_Of_Saxony|  and a member of the  |House_of_Wettin|House_Of_Wettin| .     He was the eldest son of Prince  |John|John_Of_Saxony|   by his wife  |Amalie_Auguste_of_Bavaria|Amalie_Auguste_Of_Bavaria| .     Albert had a successful military career leading Saxon troops which participated in the  |First_Schleswig_War|First_Schleswig_War| , the  |Austro-Prussian_War|Austro-Prussian_War| , and the  |Franco-Prussian_War|Franco-Prussian_War| . Otherwise, his reign as king was largely uneventful.           Alberts education, as usual with German princes, concentrated to a great extent on  |military|Military|  matters, but he attended lectures at the  |University_of_Bonn|University_Of_Bonn| . His first experience of warfare came in 1849, when he served as a captain in the  |First_War_of_Schleswig|First_War_Of_Schleswig|  against  |Denmark|Denmark| .     When the  |Austro-Prussian_War|Austro-Prussian_War|  broke out in 1866, Albert then  |Crown_Prince|Crown_Prince|  , took up the command of the Saxon forces opposing the  |Prussian_Army|Prussian_Army|  of  |Prince_Friedrich_Karl_of_Prussia|Prince_Friedrich_Karl_Of_Prussia| . No attempt was made to defend Saxony; the Saxons fell back into  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  and effected a junction with the  |Austrians|Austrian_Empire| . They took a prominent part in the battles by which the Prussians forced the line of the  |Jizera|Jizera_River|  and in the  |Battle_of_Jičín|Battle_Of_Jičín| . The Crown Prince, however, succeeded in effecting the retreat in good order, and in the decisive  |Battle_of_Königgrätz|Battle_Of_Königgrätz|  he held the extreme left of the Austrian position. The Saxons maintained their post with great tenacity, but were involved in the disastrous defeat of their allies.     During these operations the Crown Prince won the reputation of a thorough soldier; after peace was made and Saxony had entered the  |North_German_Confederation|North_German_Confederation| , he gained the command of the Saxon army, which had now become the XII army corps of the North German army, and in this position carried out the necessary re-organisation. He proved a firm adherent of the Prussian alliance. On the outbreak of the  |Franco-Prussian_War|Franco-Prussian_War|  in 1870 he again commanded the Saxons, who were included in the 2nd army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, his old opponent. At the  |Battle_of_Gravelotte|Battle_Of_Gravelotte| , they formed the extreme left of the German army, and with the Prussian Guard carried out the attack on  |St_Privat|Saint-Privat-La-Montagne| , the final and decisive action in the battle.     In the re-organisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army consisting of the Saxons, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV  corps. He was succeeded in command of the XII corps by his brother  |Prince_George|George_Of_Saxony| , who had served under him in Bohemia.     Albert took a leading part in the operations which preceded the battle of  |Sedan|Sedan,_France| , the 4th army being the pivot on which the whole army wheeled round in pursuit of  |Mac-Mahon|Patrice_De_Macmahon,_Duke_Of_Magenta| ; and the actions of Buzancy and  |Beaumont|Battle_Of_Beaumont|  on 29 and 30 August 1870 were fought under his direction; in the  |Battle_of_Sedan|Battle_Of_Sedan|  itself , with the troops under his orders, Albert carried out the envelopment of the French on the east and north.     Alberts conduct in these engagements won for him the complete confidence of the army, and during the  |Siege_of_Paris|Siege_Of_Paris|  his troops formed the north-east section of the investing force. During the siege he blocked French attempts to break out of the encirclement at  |Le_Bourget|Battle_Of_Le_Bourget|  and  |Villiers|Battle_Of_Villiers| . After the conclusion of the  |Treaty_of_Frankfurt|Treaty_Of_Frankfurt| , he was left in command of the German army of occupation, a position which he held till the fall of the  |Paris_Commune|Paris_Commune| . On the conclusion of peace he was made an inspector-general of the army and a  |field_marshal|Field_Marshal| .             On the death of his father King John on 29 October 1873, the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as King Albert. His reign proved uneventful, and he took little public part in politics, devoting himself to military affairs, in which his advice and experience were of the greatest value, not only to the Saxon corps but to the German army in general. During his reign, the Saxon monarchy became constitutional.     In the 1870s, Albert initiated the construction of a Dresden suburb, the  |Albertstadt|Albertstadt| . At that time it was the largest garrison in Germany. Near the former suburb other buildings and places still bear his name: the  |Albertbrücke|Albertbrücke| , the  |Alberthafen|Alberthafen| , the  |Albertplatz|Albertplatz|  and the  |Albertinum|Albertinum| .     In 1879, he initiated the re-construction of the  |Saint_Afra_School|Sächsisches_Landesgymnasium_Sankt_Afra_Zu_Meißen|  in  |Meissen|Meissen| . In 1897, he was appointed arbitrator between the claimants for the  |Principality_of_Lippe|Principality_Of_Lippe| .       In  |Dresden|Dresden|  on 18 June 1853, Albert married Princess  |Carola|Carola_Of_Vasa| , daughter of  |Gustav,_Prince_of_Vasa|Gustav,_Prince_Of_Vasa|  and granddaughter of  |Gustav_IV_Adolf|Gustav_Iv_Adolf_Of_Sweden| , the second to last king of  |Sweden|Sweden|  of the  |House_of_Holstein-Gottorp|House_Of_Holstein-Gottorp| . The marriage was childless, although Carola miscarried many times. These included:   A miscarriage of a daughter in the 4th month of pregnancy .   A miscarriage of a daughter in the 6th month of pregnancy .   A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy .   A miscarriage of a son in the 4th and a half month of pregnancy .

Albert died at  |Sibyllenort|Sibyllenort|  on 19 June 1902, and was succeeded by his brother, who became King  |George|George,_King_Of_Saxony| . He was buried in Dresden on 23 June, among the mourners present were both the German Emperor  |Wilhelm_II|Wilhelm_Ii,_German_Emperor|  and the Austrian Emperor  |Franz_Joseph_I|Franz_Joseph_I_Of_Austria| .
