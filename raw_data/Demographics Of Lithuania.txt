This article is about the  |demographic|Demographics|  features of the  |population|Population|  of  |Lithuania|Lithuania| , including  |population_density|Population_Density| ,  |ethnicity|Ethnic_Group| , level of education, health, economic status, and religious affiliations.            The earliest evidence of inhabitants in present-day  |Lithuania|Lithuania|  dates back to 10,000 BC. Between 3000 and 2000 BC, the people of the  |Corded_Ware_culture|Corded_Ware_Culture|  spread over a vast region of eastern Europe, between the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  and the  |Vistula_River|Vistula_River|  in the West and the  |Moscow|Moscow| – |Kursk|Kursk|  line in the East. Merging with the  |indigenous_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples| , they gave rise to the  |Balts|Balts| , a distinct  |Indo-European|Proto-Indo-Europeans|  ethnic group whose descendants are the present-day  |Lithuanian|Lithuanian_People|  and  |Latvian|Latvian_People|  nations and the former  |Old_Prussians|Old_Prussians| .           :See also: Demographics and Languages of Grand Duchy of Lithuania , Demographics of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth       The  |name_of_Lithuania|Name_Of_Lithuania|  – Lithuanians – was first mentioned in 1009. Among its etymologies there are a derivation from the word Lietava, for a small river, a possible derivation from a word  |leičiai|Leičiai| , but most probable is the name for union of Lithuanian ethnic tribes .     The primary Lithuanian state, the Duchy of Lithuania, emerged in the territory of  |Lietuva|Duchy_Of_Lithuania| , the ethnic homeland of Lithuanians. At the birth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , ethnic Lithuanians made up about 70% of the population.  Statistical numbers, probably accepted in historiography are given, according which in 1260 there were about 0.27 million Lithuanians of 0.4 million of a whole population; in percentage: 67,5%. With the acquisition of new  |Ruthenia|Ruthenia| n territories, this proportion decreased to 50% and later to 30%. By the time of the largest expansion towards  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus|  lands, at the end of the 13th and during the 14th century, the territory of the GDL was about 800,000  km 2 , of which 10% was ethnically Lithuanian. Bjorn Wiemer, Dialect and language contacts on the territory of the Grand Duchy from the 15th century until 1939, Kurt Braunmüller, Gisella Ferraresi, Aspects of multilingualism in European language history, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, ,  The ethnic Lithuanian population is estimated to have been 420,000 out of 1.4 million in 1375 , and 550,000 out of 3.8 million in 1490 Letukienė, N., Istorija. Politologija: kurso santrauka istorijos egzaminui, 2003, p. 182. There can be found also different numbers, for example: Kevin OConnor, The history of the Baltic States, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, , . Here author estimates that there were 9 million inhabitants in GDL, and 1 million of them were ethnic Lithuanians by 1387. Ruthenians were only nowadays Ukrainians and the whole Belarus including Smolensk and Mozhaisk Galindians were of Lithuanian ethnicity . In addition to the Ruthenians and Lithuanians, other significant ethnic groups throughout GDL were  |Jews|Lithuanian_Jews|  and  |Tatars|Tatars| . The combined population of Poland and GDL in 1493 is estimated as 7.5 million, of whom 3.25 million were Poles, 3.75 million Ruthenians and 0.5 million Lithuanians. Based on 1493 population map from  |Iwo_Cyprian_Pogonowski|Iwo_Cyprian_Pogonowski| , Poland a Historical Atlas, Hippocrene Books, 1987,  With the  |Union_of_Lublin|Union_Of_Lublin|  Lithuanian Grand Duchy lost large part of lands to the Polish Crown . An ethnic Lithuanian proportion being about 1/4 in GDL after the Union of Lublin was held till the  |partitions|Partitions_Of_Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth| . There was much devastation and population loss throughout the GDL in the mid and late 17th century, Jarmo Kotilaine, Russias foreign trade and economic expansion in the seventeenth century: windows on the world, BRILL, 2005, ,  including the ethnic Lithuanian population in  |Vilnius_voivodeship|Vilnius_Voivodeship| . Besides devastation, the Ruthenian population declined proportionally after the territorial losses to the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| . In 1770 there were about 4.84 million inhabitants in GDL, of which the largest ethnic group were Ruthenians, about 1.39 million – Lithuanians. The  |voivodeships|Voivodeship|  with a majority ethnic Lithuanian population were  |Vilnius|Vilnius_Voivodeship| ,  |Trakai|Trakai_Voivodeship|  and  |Samogitian|Eldership_Of_Samogitia|  voivodeships, and these three voivodeships comprised the political center of the state. In the southern angle of Trakai voivodeship and south-eastern part of Vilnius voivodeship there were also many Belarusians; in some of the south-eastern areas they were the major linguistic group.     The Ruthenian population formed a majority in GDL from the time of the GDLs expansion in the mid 14th century; and the adjective Lithuanian , besides denoting ethnic Lithuanians, from early times denoted any inhabitant of GDL, including Slavs and Jews.     The  |Ruthenian_language|Ruthenian_Language| , corresponding to todays  |Belarusian|Belarusian_Language|  and  |Ukrainian|Ukrainian_Language| , was then called  |Russian|Kievan_Rus| , and was used as one of the chancellery languages by Lithuanian monarchs. However, there are fewer extant documents written in this language than those written in Latin and German from the time of  |Vytautas|Vytautas| . Later, Ruthenian became the main language of documentation and writing. In the years that followed, it was the main language of government until the introduction of  |Polish|Polish_Language|  as the chancellery language of the Lithuanian–Polish Commonwealth in 1697; however there are also examples of documents written in Ruthenian from the second half of the 18th century.   Z. Zinkevičius The Lithuanian language was used orally in Vilnius, Trakai and Samogitian voivodeships, and by small numbers of people elsewhere. At the court of  |Zygmunt_August|Zygmunt_August| , the last king of the Duchy, both Polish and Lithuanian were spoken. Daniel.

After the  |abolition_of_serfdom|Emancipation_Reform_Of_1861|  in 1861, the use of the Polish language noticeably increased in eastern Lithuania and western Belarus. Many Lithuanians, living further east, were unable to receive the Lithuanian printed books smuggled into Lithuania by  |knygnešiai|Knygnešiai|  during the time of  |the_ban_on_printing_books|Lithuanian_Press_Ban|  in the Latin alphabet, and they switched to Polish. Although this also used the Latin alphabet, it was much less affected by the ban, because Polish was still used by the politically important class of the nobility, and also used predominantly in the biggest towns of Lithuania, and supported by the church.       The  |Lithuanian_National_Revival|Lithuanian_National_Revival|  had begun to intensify by the end of the 19th century, and the number of Lithuanian speakers and people identifying themselves as ethnic Lithuanians started to increase; but at the same time many Polish speaking Lithuanians, especially former  szlachta , cut themselves adrift from the Lithuanian nation. There were population losses due to several border changes,  |Soviet_deportations|Soviet_Deportations_From_Lithuania| ,  |the_Holocaust_of_the_Lithuanian_Jews|The_Holocaust_In_Lithuania| , and  |German|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans|  and  |Polish_repatriations|Repatriation_Of_Poles|  during and after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . After World War II, the ethnic Lithuanian population remained stable: 79.3% in 1959 to 83.5% in 2002. Lithuanias citizenship law and the  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Lithuania|  meet international and  |OSCE|Organization_For_Security_And_Co-Operation_In_Europe|  standards, guaranteeing universal human and civil rights.             |Lithuanians|Lithuanians|  are neither  |Slavic|Slavic_Peoples|  nor  |Germanic|Germanic_Peoples| , although the union with  |Poland|Poland| ,  |German|Germanic_Peoples|  and  |Russia|Russia| n colonization and settlement left cultural and religious influences.            1 Source: . The Klaipėda Region was annexed from Germany in 1923, but was not included in the 1923 census. A separate census in the Klaipėda region was held in 1925.         Among the  |Baltic_states|Baltic_States| , Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.4% of the population identified themselves as  |Lithuanians|Lithuanian_People| , 6.7% as  |Poles|Poles| , 6.3% as  |Russians|Russians| , 1.2% as  |Belarusians|Belarusians| , and 2.3% as members of other ethnic groups.         Poles are concentrated in the  |Vilnius_Region|Vilnius_Region| , the area controlled by Poland in the interwar period. There are especially large  |Polish_communities|Poles_In_Lithuania|  in  |Vilnius_district_municipality|Vilnius_District_Municipality|  and  |Šalčininkai_district_municipality|Šalčininkai_District_Municipality|  . The  |Electoral_Action_of_Poles_in_Lithuania|Electoral_Action_Of_Poles_In_Lithuania| , an ethnic minority political party, has strong influence in these areas and has representation in the  |Seimas|Seimas| . The party is most active in local politics and controls several municipal councils.          Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and lack strong political cohesion. The most prominent community lives in  |Visaginas|Visaginas|  . Most of them are engineers who moved with their families from the  |Russian_SFSR|Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic|  to work at the  |Ignalina_Nuclear_Power_Plant|Ignalina_Nuclear_Power_Plant| . A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.     Another major change in the ethnic composition of Lithuania was the extermination of the  |Jew|Jew| ish population during  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust| . Before  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  about 7.5% of the population was Jewish; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called  |Litvaks|Lithuanian_Jews|  and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, sometimes nicknamed Northern  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| , was about 30% Jewish. Almost all of these Jews were killed during the  |Nazi_German|Nazi_Germany|  occupation, or later emigrated to the  |United_States|United_States|  and  |Israel|Israel| . Now there are only about 4,000 Jews living in Lithuania.       Lithuanias membership of the  |European_Union|European_Union|  has made Lithuanian citizenship all the more appealing. Lithuanian  |citizenship|Citizenship|  is theoretically easier to obtain than that of many other European countries—only one great-grandparent is necessary to become a Lithuanian citizen. Persons who held citizenship in the Republic of Lithuania prior to June 15, 1940, and their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren are eligible for Lithuanian citizenship .     Lithuanian citizens are allowed to travel and work throughout the  |European_Union|European_Union|  without a visa or other restrictions.         The Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled in November 2006 that a number of provisions of the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on citizenship are in conflict with the Lithuanian Constitution. In particular, the court ruled that a number of current provisions of the Citizenship Law implicitly or explicitly allowing dual citizenship are in conflict with the Constitution; such provisions amounted to the unconstitutional practice of making dual citizenship a common phenomenon rather than a rare exception. The provisions of the Citizenship Law announced to be unconstitutional are no longer valid and applicable to the extent stated by the Constitutional Court.     The Lithuanian Parliament amended the Citizenship Law substantially as a result of this court ruling, allowing dual citizenship for children of at least one Lithuanian parent who are born abroad, but preventing Lithuanians from retaining their Lithuanian citizenship after obtaining the citizenship of another country.     There are some special cases still permitting dual citizenship. See  |Lithuanian_nationality_law|Lithuanian_Nationality_Law| .          The  |Lithuanian_language|Lithuanian_Language|  is the countrys sole official language countrywide. It is the first language of almost 85% of population and is also spoken by 286,742 out of 443,514 non-Lithuanians.  The Soviet era had imposed the official use of Russian, so most adult Lithuanians speak Russian as a second language, while the Polish population generally speaks Polish. Russians who immigrated after World War II speak Russian as their first language. The younger generation usually speaks English as their second language, while a substantial portion of the total population speak at least two foreign languages. According to census of 2011, 30% of the population can speak English.

Some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime .     In the first half of the 20th century, the  |Lutheran|Lutheranism|  Protestant church had around 200,000 members, 9% of the total population, mostly Protestant Lithuanians from the former Memel Territory and Germans, but it has declined since 1945. Small Protestant communities are dispersed throughout the northern and western parts of the country. Believers and clergy suffered greatly during the Soviet occupation, with many killed, tortured or deported to Siberia. Various Protestant churches have established missions in Lithuania since 1990.  4.1% are  |Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| , 0.8% are  |Old_Believers|Old_Believers|  , 0.8% are Protestant and 6.1% have  |no_religion|Irreligion| .
