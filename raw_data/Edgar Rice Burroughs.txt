Among the most notable of his creations are the jungle hero  |Tarzan|Tarzan| , the heroic  |Mars|Mars|  adventurer  |John_Carter|John_Carter_Of_Mars|  and the fictional landmass within Earth known as  |Pellucidar|Pellucidar| . Burroughs California ranch is now the center of the  |Tarzana|Tarzana,_Los_Angeles|  neighborhood in Los Angeles.           Burroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in  |Chicago|Chicago|  , the fourth son of Major George Tyler Burroughs , a businessman and  |Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  veteran, and his wife, Mary Evaline Burroughs . His middle name is from his paternal grandmother, Mary Coleman Rice Burroughs . .   He was of almost entirely English ancestry, with a family line that had been in  |North_America|North_America|  since the  |Colonial|Colonialist|  era.      Through his Rice grandmother, Burroughs was descended from  |settler|Settler| |Edmund_Rice|Edmund_Rice| , one of the English  |Puritans|Puritan|  who moved to  |Massachusetts_Bay_Colony|Massachusetts_Bay_Colony|  in the early 17th Century. He once remarked, I can trace my ancestry back to  |Deacon|Deacon|  Edmund Rice. The Burroughs side of the family was also of English origin and also emigrated to Massachusetts around the same time. Many of his ancestors fought in the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolutionary_War| . Some of his ancestors settled in Virginia during the colonial period, and Burroughs often emphasized his connection with that side of his family, seeing it as romantic and warlike, Taliaferro, John.

Burroughs was educated at a number of local schools. He then attended  |Phillips_Academy|Phillips_Academy| , in  |Andover,_Massachusetts|Andover,_Massachusetts| , and then the  |Michigan_Military_Academy|Michigan_Military_Academy| . Graduating in 1895, and failing the entrance exam for the  |United_States_Military_Academy|United_States_Military_Academy|  at West Point, he became an enlisted soldier with the  |7th_U.S._Cavalry|7Th_U.S._Cavalry|  in  |Fort_Grant|Fort_Grant,_Arizona| ,  |Arizona_Territory|Arizona_Territory| . After being diagnosed with a heart problem and thus ineligible to serve, he was discharged in 1897.              After his discharge Burroughs worked a number of different jobs. During the Chicago  |influenza|Influenza|  epidemic of 1891, he spent half a year at his brothers ranch on the  |Raft_River|Raft_River|  in  |Idaho|Idaho| , as a  |cowboy|Cowboy| , drifted somewhat afterward, then worked at his fathers Chicago battery factory in 1899, marrying his childhood sweetheart, Emma Hulbert , in January 1900.     In 1903, Burroughs joined his brothers,  |Yale|Yale|  graduates George and Harry, who were, by then, prominent Pocatello area ranchers in southern Idaho, and partners in the Sweetser-Burroughs Mining Company, where he took on managing their ill-fated  |Snake_River|Snake_River| |gold_dredge|Gold_Dredge| , a classic bucket-line dredge. The Burroughs brothers were also the sixth cousins, once removed, of famed miner  |Kate_Rice|Kate_Rice| , a brilliant and statuesque Maths professor who, in 1914, became the first female prospector in the Canadian North. Journalist and publisher  |C._Allen_Thorndike_Rice|C._Allen_Thorndike_Rice|  was also his third cousin.

Offbeat Oregon       By 1911, after seven years of low wages as a pencil-sharpener wholesaler; Burroughs began to write fiction. By this time, Emma and he had two children, Joan , and Hulbert . During this period, he had copious spare time and began reading  |pulp-fiction_magazines|Pulp_Magazine| . In 1929, he recalled thinking that          In 1913, Burroughs and Emma had their third and last child, John Coleman Burroughs , later known for his illustrations of his fathers books.     In the 1920s, Burroughs became a pilot, purchased a Security Airster S-1 , and encouraged his family to learn to fly.     Daughter Joan married Tarzan film actor, James Pierce , starring with her husband, as the voice of Jane, during 1932-34 for the  |Tarzan|Tarzan|  radio series. The pair were wed for more than forty years, until her death, in 1972.     Burroughs divorced Emma in 1934 and, in 1935, married the former actress Florence Gilbert Dearholt , who was the former wife of his friend , Ashton Dearholt , with whom he had co-founded Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises while filming The New Adventures of Tarzan. Burroughs adopted the Dearholts two children. He and Florence divorced in 1942.     Burroughs was in his late 60s and was in Honolulu at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Despite his age, he applied for and received permission to become a war correspondent , becoming one of the oldest U.S. war correspondents during World War II . This period of his life is mentioned in William Brinkley s bestselling novel  |Dont_Go_Near_the_Water|Dont_Go_Near_The_Water| .       After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to Encino, California , where after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost 80 novels. He is buried at Tarzana, California, US.     When he died, he was believed to have been the writer who had made the most from films, earning over $2 million in royalties from 27 Tarzan pictures.     The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Burroughs in 2003.       Aiming his work at the pulps, Burroughs had his first story,  |Under_the_Moons_of_Mars|Under_The_Moons_Of_Mars| , serialized by Frank Munsey in the February to July 1912 issues of  |The_All-Story|The_All-Story|  , with photographs. . – under the name Norman Bean to protect his reputation. Under the Moons of Mars inaugurated the Barsoom series and earned Burroughs US $400 . It was first published as a book by A. C. McClurg of Chicago in 1917, entitled  |A_Princess_of_Mars|A_Princess_Of_Mars| , after three Barsoom sequels had appeared as serials and McClurg had published the first four serial Tarzan novels as books.     Burroughs soon took up writing full-time, and by the time the run of Under the Moons of Mars had finished, he had completed two novels, including  |Tarzan_of_the_Apes|Tarzan_Of_The_Apes| , published from October 1912 and one of his most successful series.     Burroughs also wrote popular science fiction and fantasy stories involving adventurers from Earth transported to various planets , lost islands, and into the interior of the hollow earth in his  |Pellucidar|Pellucidar|  stories. He also wrote Westerns and historical romances. Besides those published in All-Story, many of his stories were published in  |The_Argosy|Argosy|  magazine.     Tarzan was a cultural sensation when introduced. Burroughs was determined to capitalize on Tarzans popularity in every way possible. He planned to exploit Tarzan through several different media including a syndicated Tarzan comic strip , movies , and merchandise. Experts in the field advised against this course of action, stating that the different media would just end up competing against each other. Burroughs went ahead, however, and proved the experts wrong – the public wanted Tarzan in whatever fashion he was offered. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a cultural icon .     In either 1915 or 1919, Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of Los Angeles , California, which he named Tarzana . The citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch voted to adopt that name when their community, Tarzana, California , was formed in 1927. . Also, the unincorporated community of Tarzan, Texas , was formally named in 1927 when the US Postal Service accepted the name, . reputedly coming from the popularity of the first  |Tarzan_of_the_Apes|Tarzan_Of_The_Apes|  film, starring Elmo Lincoln , and an early Tarzan comic strip.     In 1923, Burroughs set up his own company, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. , and began printing his own books through the 1930s.       Because of the part Burroughss science fiction played in inspiring real exploration of Mars, an impact crater on Mars was named in his honor after his death. In a  |Paris_Review|Paris_Review|  interview, Ray Bradbury said of Burroughs that Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out – and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly – Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world. Bradbury continued that By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special.     In  |Something_of_Myself|Something_Of_Myself|  Rudyard Kipling wrote: My Jungle Books begat Zoos of . But the genius of all the genii was one who wrote a series called Tarzan of the Apes. I read it, but regret I never saw it on the films, where it rages most successfully. He had jazzed the motif of the Jungle Books and, I imagine, had thoroughly enjoyed himself. He was reported to have said that he wanted to find out how bad a book he could write and get away with, which is a legitimate ambition.     By 1963, Floyd C. Gale of  |Galaxy_Science_Fiction|Galaxy_Science_Fiction|  wrote when discussing reprints of several Burroughs novels by Ace Books , an entire generation has grown up inexplicably Burroughs-less . He stated that most of the authors books had been out of print for years and that only the occasional laughable Tarzan film reminded public of his fiction. Gale reported his surprise that after two decades his books were again available, with Canaveral Press , Dover Publications , and Ballantine Books also reprinting them.
