The Caretaker script stated Kes was a dazzling, ethereal beauty, waifish and fragile , with a dignity – her bearing, an alertness in her look, that suggests a being of powerful intelligence .  |Ruditis_|Kes_Ruditis2003| Star Trek official website, the character is identified as a tough survivor and a bit of a rebel .

She saw the characters lack of cynicism or precociousness or pretentiousness or sarcasm as different from typical young female roles.  Although she found this kind of diversity in a character difficult to play, Lien enjoyed the process and said: Its a joy to pretend to be this extraordinary creature, so open and everything so new.     Lien was not given information about her characters future storylines prior to receiving the final copies of the scripts. Unlike the shows other actors, she did not campaign for changes to her character, explaining I felt my contribution was more in the acting, and not in the writing .  She viewed Kes developing mental abilities as representing her confidence in being able to choose a path for her life , and identified temptation as a key part in her  |character_arc|Character_Arc| .  Author  |Paul_Ruditis|Paul_Ruditis|  summed up Kes through the paradoxical phrase fragile power .          Kolbe said Kes and  |Neelix|Neelix|  brought romance and comedy to the series. Lien and Neelixs actor  |Ethan_Phillips|Ethan_Phillips|  said they enjoyed filming their scenes together.  Writer  |Kenneth_Biller|Kenneth_Biller|  wanted to establish the pair as living together and sexually active, but Taylor and Berman thought Kes looked too young for those storylines. Biller proposed scenes in which the characters talk about sex for the first time as a way to explore the weirdness of alien sexuality . This discussion led to dialogue being included in the episode  |Elogium|Elogium|  .  Despite this, the sexual relationship between Kes and Neelix is never clearly defined.  |Greven_|Kes_Greven2003| |Warlord|Warlord|  , Phillips asked writers to provide closure for the couple in a subsequent episode. He believed the end of their relationship was too muddy , since Kes was possessed by an alien, and thus unable to control her actions, during the break-up scene.  The writers denied his request, saying: No, lets just drop it, lets move on.  |Ruditis_|Kes_Ruditis2003| |Fair_Trade|Fair_Trade|  in which Kes and Neelix discuss the end of their romantic relationship, but it was removed due to time constraints.

Ruditis identified Kes trust in Janeway as representing her desire to explore the universe. Picardo viewed Kes as the Doctors sounding board and emotional confessor as she mentored him on being human.

He suggested producers invert the Doctors relationship with Kes to show him teaching former  |Borg|Borg|  drone  |Seven_of_Nine|Seven_Of_Nine|  about humanity.  A darker relationship between the Doctor and Kes was planned for the episode  |Darkling|Darkling|  . According to writer  |Joe_Menosky|Joe_Menosky| , the Doctors evil alter ego was going to be perversely sexual and sadistic and have a psychosexual attraction to Kes. Menosky drafted a scene in which the Doctor interacts with holograms of Kes on the  |holodeck|Holodeck| , including performing surgery on one, but this was cut from the final episode.  Unlike Neelix, Janeway, and the Doctor, Kes has few scenes with  |BElanna_Torres|Belanna_Torres| .  |Roxann_Dawson|Roxann_Dawson| , who plays Torres, requested for further interaction between the two.

There was speculation in the media that  |Harry_Kims|Harry_Kim|  actor  |Garrett_Wang|Garrett_Wang|  was going to be replaced instead, but that he was kept due to his appeal to a certain demographic and placement on  |Peoples|People|  50 Most Beautiful People in the World list. Wang said: The timing of that, right during our hiatus, certainly couldnt have hurt me in terms of them keeping me on the show.      Berman and Taylor chose to remove Kes since they felt the character was not properly developed over the course of the show. Executive producer  |Brannon_Braga|Brannon_Braga|  regarded this decision as a failure of imagination on the writers part .  Braga requested freelance writer  |Bryan_Fuller|Bryan_Fuller|  develop the concept for Kes departure.   Receiving a positive response during a pitch meeting, Fuller helped to rewrite the characters final episode  |The_Gift|The_Gift|  .  He said he had really bonded with Kes during the episodes production.     Some of the series writing staff were sorry that Kes was removed; Kenneth Biller stated:     I was a little bit regretful when Kes left the show, because I thought she was an interesting character to write for—from a science fiction standpoint—because she had certain... she had telepathic abilities, she had this very compressed lifespan, she had things about her character that often lent themselves to interesting storytelling We lost something in losing the Kes character.      Mulgrew was also disappointed by Liens departure, describing it as a great sorrow to me on many levels , describing the departure as the fracturing of an ensemble cast that was extremely special to me .   |Tim_Russ|Tim_Russ| , who portrays Tuvok, referred to the characters exit as gracious and poignant .      After leaving Voyager, Lien stopped acting to pursue an  |associate_degree|Associate_Degree|  in health.  Despite this, producers invited her back for an episode because they wanted to use Kes to advance the story.  The concept for this episode,  |Fury|Fury|  , was developed by Braga and written by Fuller and  |Michael_Taylor|Michael_Taylor| .  Cinefantastique  s Anna L. Kaplan considered Fullers involvement ironic due to his participation in The Gift . Lien was uncomfortable with the original script, and requested that it be rewritten. She said it was difficult to play a different version of Kes and interact with the other characters who had changed since her last appearance. Lien did not have the same allergic response to the ear prosthetics since she did not have to wear them for the same length of time. During a 2010 interview with  |StarTrek_com|Startrek_Com| , Lien said she preferred her performance in The Gift to that for Fury , saying she made a lot of poor acting choices in the latter.

Prior the shows pilot episode, Kes lived with her people in an underground city constructed by a  |Nacene|Nacene|  alien known as the Caretaker. He had cared for the Ocampa since inadvertently destroying their planets ecosystem and atmosphere thousands of years ago; the Ocampa became completely insular and dependent upon him. The Caretaker had sealed the city away from the planets surface to protect the Ocampa; however, Kes dreamed of leaving the Ocampa enclave to explore the galaxy and develop her psionic powers, with which her ancestors were rumored to have far more proficiency. Finding a way to Ocampas surface, she was captured and tortured by the  |Kazon|Kazon|  who hope to gain access to the Ocampa city and its resources; Neelix, a Talaxian, rescued her, and they became a couple.      When the Caretaker realizes he is dying, he abducts beings from the  |Alpha_Quadrant|Alpha_Quadrant|  in the hopes of finding a compatible mate with whom to produce offspring to ensure someone can continue protecting and caring for the Ocampa. In the shows pilot episode, the Caretaker kidnaps members of a  |Maquis|Maquis|  crew and the  |Starfleet|Starfleet|  crew of the starship USS Voyager. Kes helps the ships captains, Kathryn Janeway and Chakotay, recover their missing crew members.

When the Kazon attack and attempt to steal the Caretakers technology, Janeway orders the destruction of his vessel. Stranded in the Delta Quadrant, the Maquis and Starfleet crew merge on their journey back to the Alpha Quadrant. Kes and Neelix decide to serve as guides to the stranded crews.

She also develops a friendship with  |the_Doctor|The_Doctor|  while studying to become his medical assistant.  She encourages him to develop a better set of social skills and pushes the crew to recognize him as more than just a  |hologram|Hologram| .  In  |Phage|Phage|  , the  |Vidiians|Vidiians|  harvest Neelixs lungs, and Kes donates one of her own to save his life.  During Elogium , emanations from space-dwelling lifeforms cause Kes to prematurely enter the elogium, the Ocampa female reproductive state. This condition can only occur once during an Ocampa life cycle. Kes and Neelix disagree over the idea of having children. Neelix eventually agrees to being a father, but Kes decides against conceiving a child. After the ship moves away from the life forms, the Doctor determines that Kes has gone through a false alarm; she will be able to go through a true elogium in the future.
