Therefore, differences in the spectrum can be interpreted as luminosity effects and a luminosity class can be assigned purely from examination of the spectrum.     A number of different luminosity classes are distinguished, as listed in the table below.           Marginal cases are allowed; for example, a star may be either a supergiant or a bright giant, or may be in between the subgiant and main-sequence classifications.   In these cases, two special symbols are used:   A slash  means that a star is either one class or the other.   A dash  means that the star is in between the two classes.     For example, a star classified as A3-4III/IV would be in between spectral types A3 and A4, while being either a giant star or a subgiant.     Sub-dwarf classes have also been used: VI for sub-dwarfs .     Nominal luminosity class  VII is now rarely used for white dwarf or hot sub-dwarf classes, since the temperature-letters of the main sequence and giant stars no longer apply to white dwarfs.
