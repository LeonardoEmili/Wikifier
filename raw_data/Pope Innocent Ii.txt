              Pope Innocent II , born Gregorio Papareschi, was head of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  and ruler of the  |Papal_States|Papal_States|  from 14 February 1130 to his death in 1143. His election was controversial and the first eight years of his reign were marked by a struggle for recognition against the supporters of  |Antipope_Anacletus_II|Antipope_Anacletus_Ii| . He reached an understanding with  |Lothair_II_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Lothair_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  who supported him against Anacletus and whom he crowned  |King_of_the_Romans|King_Of_The_Romans| . Innocent went on to preside over the  |Second_Lateran_council|Second_Council_Of_The_Lateran| .       Papareschi came from a Roman family, probably of the  |rione_Trastevere|Trastevere| . He was probably one of the clergy in personal attendance on the  |Antipope_Clement_III|Antipope_Clement_Iii|  .      |Pope_Urban_II|Pope_Urban_Ii|  made him a  |cardinal_deacon|Cardinal_Deacon|  in  |1088|1088| . In this capacity, he accompanied  |Pope_Gelasius_II|Pope_Gelasius_Ii|  when he was driven into France. New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, vol. 5, s.v. Onnocent II . He was selected by  |Pope_Callixtus_II|Pope_Callixtus_Ii|  for various important and difficult missions, such as the one to  |Worms|Worms_Germany|  for the conclusion of the  |Concordat_of_Worms|Concordat_Of_Worms| , the peace accord made with  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| |_Henry_V|Henry_V_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 1122, and also the one to France in 1123 that made peace with King  |Louis_VI|Louis_Vi_Of_France| .            In 1130, as  |Pope_Honorius_II|Pope_Honorius_Ii|  lay dying, the cardinals decided to entrust the election to a commission of eight men led by papal chancellor Haimeric, who had his candidate Cardinal Gregory Papareschi hastily elected as Pope Innocent II. The  Historia Compostelana , composed in Galicia for the bishop of Santiago de Compostela, provides information on the details of the disputed election of 1130. He was consecrated on 14 February, the day after Honorius death. The other cardinals announced that Innocent had not been canonically elected and chose Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni, a Roman whose family were the enemy of Haimerics supporters, the Frangipani; Pierleoni took the name  |Pope_Anacletus_II|Pope_Anacletus_Ii| . Anacletus mixed group of supporters were powerful enough to take control of Rome while Innocent was forced to flee north. Based on a simple majority of the entire college of cardinals, Anacletus was the canonically elected pope, and Innocent was the anti-Pope. However, the  |legislation_of_Pope_Nicholas_II|In_Nomine_Domini|  pre-empted the choice of the majority of the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons. This rule was changed by the  |Second_Lateran_council|Second_Council_Of_The_Lateran|  of 1139.       Anacletus had control of Rome, so Innocent II took ship for  |Pisa|Pisa| , and thence sailed by way of  |Genoa|Genoa|  to France, where the influence of  |Bernard_of_Clairvaux|Bernard_Of_Clairvaux|  readily secured his cordial recognition by the clergy and the court. In October of the same year he was duly acknowledged by Holy Roman Emperor  |Lothair_III|Lothair_Iii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and his bishops at the synod of  |Würzburg|Würzburg| . In January 1131, he had also a favourable interview with  |Henry_I_of_England|Henry_I_Of_England| , and in August 1132 Lothar III undertook an expedition to Italy for the double purpose of setting aside Anacletus as  |antipope|Antipope|  and of being crowned by Innocent. Anacletus and his supporters being in secure control of  |St_Peters_Basilica|St_Peters_Basilica| , the coronation ultimately took place in the Lateran Church , but otherwise the expedition proved abortive. At the investiture of Lothair as Emperor he gained the territories belonging to  |Matilda_of_Tuscany|Matilda_Of_Tuscany|  in return for an annuity to be paid to the pope, in consequence of which the curial party based the contention that the Emperor was a  |vassal|Vassal|  of the Papal see. Schaff-Herzog, ibid.     A second expedition by Lothar III in 1136 was not more decisive in its results, and the protracted struggle between the rival pontiffs was terminated only by the death of Anacletus II on 25 January 1138.          Innocent took as  |cardinal_nephew|Cardinal_Nephew|  first his nephew,  |Gregorio_Papareschi|Gregorio_Papareschi| , whom he elevated to cardinal in 1134, and then his brother  |Pietro_Papareschi|Pietro_Papareschi| , whom he elevated to cardinal in 1142. Miranda, Salvator. 1998. . Another nephew, Cinzio Papareschi , was also a cardinal, raised to the cardinalate in 1158, after Innocents death. Miranda, Salvator. 1998. .       By the  |Second_Lateran_council|Second_Council_Of_The_Lateran|  of 1139, at which King  |Roger_II_of_Sicily|Roger_Ii_Of_Sicily| , Innocent IIs most uncompromising foe, was  |excommunicated|Excommunication| , peace was at last restored to the Church. Aside from the complete rebuilding of the ancient church of  |Santa_Maria_in_Trastevere|Santa_Maria_In_Trastevere| , which boldly features Ionic capitals from former colonnades in the  |Baths_of_Caracalla|Baths_Of_Caracalla|  and other richly detailed spolia from Roman monuments, Dale Kinney, Spolia from the Baths of Caracalla in Sta. Maria in Trastevere , The Art Bulletin 68.3 . the remaining years of this Popes life were almost as barren of permanent political results as the first had been. His efforts to undo the mischief wrought in Rome by the long schism were almost entirely neutralized by a quarrel with his erstwhile supporter,  |Louis_VII_of_France|Louis_Vii_Of_France|  over the candidate for  |archbishop_of_Bourges|Archbishop_Of_Bourges| , in the course of which that kingdom was laid under an  |interdict|Interdict|  to press for the papal candidate, and by a struggle with the town of  |Tivoli|Tivoli_Italy|  in which he became involved. As a result, Roman factions that wished Tivoli annihilated took up arms against Innocent.     It was also in 1139 that, in the  Omne Datum Optimum , Innocent II declared that the  |Knights_Templar|Knights_Templar| —a religious and military organization then twenty-one years old—should in the future be answerable only to the papacy. This was a keystone in the Templars ever increasing power and wealth, and ironically helped to bring about their violent suppression in October 1307.     Can. 29 of the  |Second_Lateran_Council|Second_Lateran_Council|  under Pope Innocent II in 1139 banned the use of crossbows, as well as slings and bows, against Christians.

On 25 July 1139, Innocent was forced to acknowledge the kingship and possessions of Roger with the  |Treaty_of_Mignano|Treaty_Of_Mignano| . In 1143, Innocent refused to recognise the  |Treaty_of_Mignano|Treaty_Of_Mignano|  with Roger of Sicily, who sent  |Robert_of_Selby|Robert_Of_Selby|  to march on papal  |Benevento|Benevento| . The terms agreed upon at Mignano were then recognised. Innocent II died on 24 September 1143 and was succeeded by  |Pope_Celestine_II|Pope_Celestine_Ii| .     The doctrinal questions which he was called on to decide were those that condemned the opinions of  |Pierre_Abélard|Pierre_Abélard|  and of  |Arnold_of_Brescia|Arnold_Of_Brescia| .     In 1143, as the Pope lay dying, the  |Commune_of_Rome|Commune_Of_Rome| , to resist papal power, began deliberations that officially reinstated the  |Roman_Senate|Roman_Senate|  the following year.
