           Big Audio Dynamite  are an English band formed in  |London|London|  in 1984 by  |Mick_Jones|Mick_Jones| , the former lead guitarist of  |the_Clash|The_Clash| , who has been their only constant member. The band mixed various musical styles, incorporating elements of  |punk_rock|Punk_Rock| ,  |dance_music|Dance_Music| ,  |hip_hop|Hip_Hop| ,  |reggae|Reggae| , and  |funk|Funk| . After releasing a number of well-received albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Big Audio Dynamite broke up in 1997. In 2011, the band embarked on a reunion tour.           After being fired from the Clash in 1983 and following a brief stint with the band  |General_Public|General_Public| , Mick Jones formed a new band called Top Risk Action Company . He recruited bassist  |Leo_E-Zee_Kill_Williams|Leo_Williams| , saxophonist John Boy Lennard , and former Clash drummer  |Nicky_Topper_Headon|Topper_Headon| . Headon was quickly sacked for his  |heroin|Heroin|  addiction and Lennard either left or was fired and the band folded.  Although the band released no material , T.R.A.C. can be seen as a forerunner to Big Audio Dynamite in much the same way  |London_SS|London_Ss|  can be seen as an early incarnation of the Clash.       Jones then formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director  |Don_Letts|Don_Letts|  , bassist Leo Williams , drummer  |Greg_Roberts|Greg_Roberts| , and keyboardist  |Dan_Donovan|Dan_Donovan| . In 1985 the bands debut,  This Is Big Audio Dynamite , was released. The albums cover shows the band as a four piece, minus Donovan who took and designed the photo. In 2016 This is Big Audio Dynamite was reissued on  |vinyl|Phonograph_Record| , with the album being mastered using analog tapes and pressed on 180-gram vinyl.     1986s  No. 10, Upping St.  reunited Jones for one last album with former Clash lyricist and lead vocalist  |Joe_Strummer|Joe_Strummer| , who was credited with co-producing the album and co-writing of 5 of its 9 tracks. The cover painting, based on a still taken from the  |Brian_De_Palma|Brian_De_Palma|  film  Scarface , was painted by Tim Jones. BAD supported  |U2|U2|  on their 1987 world tour, then released 1988s  Tighten Up Vol. 88  and 1989s  Megatop Phoenix .  Tighten Up, Vol. 88  contained  |Just_Play_Music!|Just_Play_Music!|  , which was the second No.  1 single on Billboards  |Modern_Rock_Tracks|Alternative_Songs|  chart. The band also recorded an unreleased track called Keep off the Grass which was a rock-style instrumental of the theme to the classic western film,  The Magnificent Seven . A promo video can be seen on  |YouTube|Youtube| .      In 1990, the original line-up wrote and recorded the song Free for the soundtrack to the adventure comedy film  Flashback . This would be the final song written with the original line-up, as the band would break-up shortly after. The Bottom Line from the bands first album was remixed and used as the title track for Flashback. However, this track was not included on the soundtrack. It can be found on the 12 or by download. Later in 1990, Mick Jones debuted Big Audio Dynamite II and release the UK only album  Kool-Aid . Dan Donovan remained in BAD II for one song, a re-working of the final BAD track Free renamed Kickin In .       For 1991s  The Globe , only Jones remained from the original incarnation of Big Audio Dynamite, and the band was now called Big Audio Dynamite II . This new line-up featured two guitarists. The Globe featured the bands most commercially successful single,  |Rush|Rush| , which hit No.  1 on both the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the Australian National  |ARIA|Aria_Charts|  Chart. Innocent Child and  |The_Globe|The_Globe|  were also released as singles.     BAD supported U2 on their  |Zoo_TV_Tour|Zoo_Tv_Tour| , headlined the  |MTV|Mtv| |120_Minutes|120_Minutes|  tour which also featured  |Public_Image_Ltd|Public_Image_Ltd| ,  |Live|Live| , and  |Blind_Melon|Blind_Melon| ,  and released the live EP On the Road Live 92 .     In 1991, while Mick Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite II, the rest of the original lineup briefly formed a band called Screaming Target. They released one album Hometown Hi Fi and two singles Who Killed King Tubby? and Knowledge N Numbers before disbanding. The title and album cover were purposely meant as a tribute to Big Youths reggae album Screaming Target.     In 1993, Greg Roberts formed the electronic band  |Dreadzone|Dreadzone|  with Tim Bran, with the name suggested to them by Don Letts. Leo Williams and Dan Donovan joined the band before their second album  Second Light  and the single Little Britain in 1995. Dreadzone is still active, with Roberts and Williams remaining members.          The band later recruited keyboardist Andre Shapps  and Michael DJ Zonka Custance as  |DJ|Disc_Jockey|  and vocalist. Both appeared on the bands 1994 album  Higher Power , which was released under the shortened name Big Audio .       After signing a recording contract with  |Gary_Kurfirsts|Gary_Kurfirst| |Radioactive_Records|Radioactive_Records|  in 1995, the band reverted to the original Big Audio Dynamite moniker and released their least successful album to date,  F-Punk .     Radioactive Records refused to release the next proposed BAD album,  Entering a New Ride .   The line-up contained MC vocals by Joe Attard of Punks Jump Up,  |Ranking_Roger|Ranking_Roger|  of  |the_Beat|The_Beat|  and  |General_Public|General_Public|  and drummer Bob Wond of Under Two Flags. In 1998, the band launched a new website, primarily intended as a means to distribute songs from the Entering a New Ride album. In 2001, after having only released 6 songs from the album, the website went down and Big Audio Dynamite disbanded. Their final album was never properly released in its entirety, but it has been heavily leaked online for fans who wished to hear it.     Since 2005, Jones has been working on a project with  |Tony_James|Tony_James|   called  |Carbon/Silicon|Carbon/Silicon| .     In early 2007, a BAD II live 8 song DVD was released, titled Big Audio Dynamite Live: EMC².     Since BADs official end, several DJs have continued to make mixtapes under the moniker BAD Soundsystem . However, Mick Jones was never involved in any way with this iteration.       In 2010,  |Don_Letts|Don_Letts|  revealed to  |Billboard.com|Billboard|  that he and  |Mick_Jones|Mick_Jones|  broached the idea of a Big Audio Dynamite reunion in 2011. He explained, I could lie to you and say Not in a million years, but... if Mick wasnt tied up with  |Gorillaz|Gorillaz|  it might happen this year. has looked at me and said, Maybe next year, but who knows. Ive got to admit that in the past Im not a great one for reformations; I always think if youre lucky in life, you get a window of opportunity, use it to the best of your ability and then fuck off and let someone else have their turn. But here I am 25 years down the line considering the thing. Besides a Big Audio Dynamite reunion, Letts said he was also hopeful for more Legacy Editions of the bands albums after finding more unreleased material—including live recordings—in the vaults. Theres definitely more stuff; whether Sony thinks its worthwhile, thats another matter. But there seems to be a lot of respect for Big Audio Dynamite. Time has shown that a lot of the things we were dabbling in back then have come to manifest themselves today...so hopefully well get to do some more.      The reformation of the original line-up of BAD was confirmed on 25 January 2011 with the announcement of a UK tour.  The 9-date tour was a commercial and critical success. The first of their two sold out  |Shepherds_Bush_Empire|Shepherds_Bush_Empire|  shows received a 4 star review in  The Times  ,  The Observer  welcomed BADs return with a glowing review declaring, they remain a joy.   News of the World  awarded their  |Manchester_Academy|Manchester_Academy|  show a 5 star review and proclaimed, Easily the reformation of the year.   Their headline slot at  |Beautiful_Days|Beautiful_Days|  festival was favourably reviewed on the  |Louder_Than_War|Louder_Than_War|  music website.      Big Audio Dynamite played sets at the 2011  |Outside_Lands_Music_and_Arts_Festival|Outside_Lands_Music_And_Arts_Festival| ,  |Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival|Coachella_Valley_Music_And_Arts_Festival| ,   |Glastonbury_Festival_2011|Glastonbury_Festival_2011| ,  and  |Lollapalooza|Lollapalooza| .
