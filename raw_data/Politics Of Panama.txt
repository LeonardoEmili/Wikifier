The Judicial Organ administers justice in a permanent, free and expeditious manner.

An autonomous Electoral Tribunal supervises voter registration, the election process, and the activities of political parties. Everyone over the age of 18 are required to vote, although those who fail to do so are not penalized.                    The dominant political parties in Panamanian history have been the PRD and the Panameñista . These parties were founded by charismatic and strong political enemies,  |Omar_Torrijos|Omar_Torrijos|  —the deceased father of the previous president,  |Martín_Torrijos|Martín_Torrijos| —and  |Arnulfo_Arias|Arnulfo_Arias|  , late husband of the ex-president, Mireya Moscoso. Even though these leaders died years ago, their aura is revived by their followers, and they are present in every election.     Panamanian politics have historically been corrupt.
