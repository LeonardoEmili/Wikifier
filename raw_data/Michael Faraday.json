Faraday instead proposed that only a single electricity exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity would produce different groups of phenomena.     Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor.  This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community. Faradays concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields; that conceptual model was crucial for the successful development of the electromechanical devices that dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 19th century.
