        " mentioned by the Areopagite as a literary device to give the impression to his sixth-century readers of engaging with the surviving fragments of a much larger first-century corpus of writings. In support of this view, there is no trace at all of these lost treatises: despite the interest in Dionysius from as early as the sixth century, no mention of them is to be found. See Louth, Dionysius the Areopagite, , p20. These seven other works are:   Theological Outlines ,   Symbolic Theology ,   On Angelic Properties and Orders ,   On the Just and Divine Judgement ,   On the Soul ,   On Intelligible and Sensible Beings, On the Divine Hymns.       In attempts to identify a date after which the corpus must have been composed, a number of features have been identified in Dionysius writing, though the latter two are subject to scholarly debate.   Firstly, and fairly certainly, it is clear that Dionysius adopted many of his ideas—including at times passages almost word for word—from ": null

However, it is also possible that Dionysius eschewed traditional Christological formulae in order to preserve an overall apostolic ambience for his works, rather than because of the influence of the Henoticon. Also, given that the Henoticon was rescinded in 518, if Dionysius was writing after this date, he may have been untroubled by this policy.   In terms of the latest date for the composition of the Corpus, the earliest datable reference to Dionysius writing comes in 528, the year in which the treatise of ": null

Andrew Louth, Dionysius the Areopagite , reissued by Continuum Press, London & New York, 2001, under the title Denys the Areopagite. It is possible that pseudo-Dionysius was himself a member of this group, though debate continues over whether his writings do in fact reveal a monophysite understanding of Christ. See Louth, Dionysius the Areopagite , p14, who suggests that, although ambiguous, Dionysius is not monophysite .     Paul Rorem and John C Lamoreaux, John of Scythopolis and the Dionysian Corpus: Annotating the Areopagite, , esp p11, make an extensive study of the early evidence, arguing that Hypatiuss apparent rejection in 532 of the works of Dionysite as monophysite is not as straightforward as often suggested, and that Dionysiuss writing was appealed to by just about all parties in the sixth-century Christian east, and at no point was it considered the exclusive preserve of the Monophysites.   It seems likely that the writer was located in Syria, as revealed, for example, by the accounts of the sacramental rites he gives in The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, which seem only to bear resemblance to Syriac rites. Dionysius description in the Ecclesastical Hierarchy corresponds well with what is known of Syriac worship from other sources, for example: his account of baptism and the Eucharist is similar to the Homilies on Baptism and the Eucharist of Theodore of Mopsuetsia, which depict worship in the Church of West Syria at the beginning of the fifth century. See Louth, Dionysius the Areopagite , p55; Dionysius account of the sacrament of oil in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy is not found in most other patristic sources, except for those in the Syrian tradition. See Louth, Dionysius the Areopagite , p64; his understanding of monasticism. See Louth, Dionysius the Areopagite , p70. Louth is certain that Dionysius/Denys was writing in Syria.
