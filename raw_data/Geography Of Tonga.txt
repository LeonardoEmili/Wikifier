     Located in  |Oceania|Oceania| ,  |Tonga|Tonga|  is a small archipelago in the South  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| , directly south of  |Samoa|Samoa|  and about two-thirds of the way from  |Hawaii|Hawaii|  to  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| . It has 169 islands, 36 of them inhabited, are divided into three main groups –  |Vavau|Vavau| ,  |Haapai|Haapai| , and  |Tongatapu|Tongatapu|  – and cover an -long north-south line. The total size is just . Due to the spread out islands it has the 40th largest  |Exclusive_Economic_Zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|  of .     The largest island, Tongatapu, on which the capital city of  |Nukualofa|NukuʻAlofa|  is located, covers . Geologically the Tongan islands are of two types: most have a limestone base formed from uplifted coral formations; others consist of limestone overlaying a  |volcanic|Volcanic|  base.       The climate is tropical with a distinct warm period , during which the temperatures rise above , and a cooler period , with temperatures rarely rising above . The temperature increases from , and the annual rainfall is from  as one moves from Tongatapu in the south to the more northerly islands closer to the Equator. The average wettest period is around March with on average .  The average daily humidity is 80%. Cyclones can occur from October to April.       Though administratively divided into the three main island groups of Tongatapu, Haapai, and Vavau , the Tonga archipelago is actually made of two geologically different parallel chains of islands.     The western islands, such as  |ʻAta|ʻAta|  , Fonuafoou,  |Tofua|Tofua| ,  |Kao|Kao| ,  |Lataiki|Lataiki| ,  |Late|Late| ,  |Fonualei|Fonualei| ,  |Toku|Tokū_Tonga| ,  |Niuatoputapu|Niuatoputapu| , and  |Tafahi|Tafahi| , make up the Tongan Volcanic Arc and are all of volcanic origin.

Burley, Tongan Archaeology and the Tongan Past, 2850-150 B.P, Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 12, No. 3 They were created from the  |subduction|Subduction|  of the western-moving  |Pacific_plate|Pacific_Plate|  under the Australia-India plate at the Tonga Trench. The Tongan Islands sit on the Australia-India plate just west of the  |Tonga_Trench|Tonga_Trench| . These volcanoes are formed when materials in the descending Pacific plate heat and rise to the surface. There is only limited coral reef development on these islands, except for Niuatoputapu.     The eastern islands are not volcanic and sit above the mostly submerged Tonga ridge that runs parallel to the Tongan Volcanic Arch and the Tongan Trench. Of these islands, only  |Eua|Eua|  has risen high enough to expose its underlying  |Eocene|Eocene|  volcanic bedrock, the rest are either low coral limestone islands  or sand cay islands . These islands are surrounded by a protective and resource-rich labyrinth of fringing, apron and off-shore barrier reefs that have supported most of the human settlement in Tonga ever since the first Lapita People arrived circa 900 BCE.     The Tongan Volcanic Arc has been important in supplying the islands on the Tonga ridge with an  |andesite|Andesite| |_tephra|Tephra|  soil that has resulted in an extremely rich soil capable of supporting a high-yield, short-fallow agricultural system. Also, the andesite/basalt from the volcanoes were initially used as hammerstones, weaving weights, cooking stones, and decorative pebbles for grave decoration. Tafahi island in the far north provided volcanic glass to initial human settlers.     In December 2014 and January 2015, a volcanic island 1  km wide by 2  km long was created adjacent to the island of  |Hunga_Haapai|Hunga_Tonga|  65 kilometers northwest of Nukualofa. The volcanic eruption has built the new island to a height of 100 m composed of ash and large rock fragments.  In regards to volcanism, Tonga has moderate volcanic activity.  |Fonualei|Fonualei|  has shown frequent activity in recent years, while  |Niuafoou|Niuafoou|  , which last erupted in 1985, has forced evacuations; other historically active volcanoes include Late and Tofua. Natural hazards include earthquakes and volcanic activity at Fonuafoou and Lateiki .
