Pressure from the private sector and the unions forced the government to resign in 1982. New elections were then called and were won resoundingly by Comptons UWP, which took 14 of 17 seats.     The UWP was elected for a second time on April 16, 1987, but with only nine of 17 seats. Seeking to increase his slim margin, Prime Minister Compton suspended parliament and called new elections on April 30. This unprecedented snap election, however, gave the same results as beforeâ€”the UWP retained nine seats and the SLP eight. In April 1992, Prime Minister Comptons government again defeated the SLP, but this time increased its majority in parliament to 11 of 17 seats.
