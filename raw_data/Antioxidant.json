It has been claimed that the Î±-tocopherol form is the most important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction.  This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised Î±-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol.  This is in line with findings showing that Î±-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 -deficient cells from cell death.
