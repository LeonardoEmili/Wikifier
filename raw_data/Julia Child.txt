     Julia Carolyn Child  was an American chef, author and television personality. She is recognized for bringing  |French_cuisine|French_Cuisine|  to the American public with her debut  |cookbook|Cookbook| ,  Mastering the Art of French Cooking , and her subsequent television programs, the most notable of which was  The French Chef , which premiered in 1963.       Julia Child was born Julia Carolyn McWilliams in 1912, in  |Pasadena,_California|Pasadena,_California| , the daughter of John McWilliams, Jr. , a  |Princeton_University|Princeton_University|  graduate and prominent land manager, and his wife, the former Julia Carolyn Weston , a paper-company heiress whose father,  |Byron_Curtis_Weston|Byron_Weston| , served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Child was the eldest of three, followed by a brother, John McWilliams III, and sister, Dorothy Cousins.     In high school, Child was sent to the  |Katherine_Branson_School|The_Branson_School|  in  |Ross,_California|Ross,_California| , which was at the time a boarding school.  At six feet, two inches tall, Child played tennis, golf, and basketball as a youth and continued to play sports while attending  |Smith_College|Smith_College| , from which she graduated in 1934 with a major in history.       Child grew up with a cook who served her family. She did not observe or learn how to cook from the familys cook. Child did not learn to cook until she met her would-be husband, Paul, who grew up in a family very interested in food.      Following her graduation from college, Child moved to New York City, where she worked as a  |copywriter|Copywriter|  for the advertising department of W. & J. Sloane.       Child joined the  |Office_of_Strategic_Services|Office_Of_Strategic_Services|  after finding that she was too tall to enlist in the  |Womens_Army_Corps|Womens_Army_Corps|  or in the U.S. Navys  |WAVES|Waves| .  She began her OSS career as a typist at its headquarters in Washington but, because of her education and experience, soon was given a more responsible position as a top-secret researcher working directly for the head of OSS, General  |William_J._Donovan|William_J._Donovan| .        As a research assistant in the Secret Intelligence division, she typed 10,000 names on white note cards to keep track of officers. For a year, she worked at the OSS Emergency Rescue Equipment Section in Washington, D.C. as a file clerk and then as an assistant to developers of a  |shark_repellent|Shark_Repellent|  needed to ensure that sharks would not explode  |ordnance|Weapon|  targeting German  |U-boats|U-Boat| . In 1944, she was posted to  |Kandy|Kandy| , Ceylon , where her responsibilities included registering, cataloging and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications for the OSSs clandestine stations in Asia.  She was later posted to Kunming, China, where she received the Emblem of Meritorious Civilian Service as head of the Registry of the OSS Secretariat.  When Child was asked to solve the problem of too many OSS underwater explosives being set off by curious sharks, Childs solution was to experiment with cooking various concoctions as a shark repellent, which were sprinkled in the water near the explosives and repelled sharks.  Still in use today, the experimental shark repellent marked Childs first foray into the world of cooking ... For her service, Child received an award that cited her many virtues, including her drive and inherent cheerfulness. As with other OSS records, her file was declassified in 2008; however, unlike other files, her complete file is available online.  ,      While in Kunming, she met  |Paul_Cushing_Child|Paul_Cushing_Child| , also an OSS employee, and the two were married September 1, 1946, in  |Lumberville,_Pennsylvania|Lumberville,_Pennsylvania| ,  later moving to Washington, D.C. A  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey|  native  who had lived in Paris as an artist and poet, Paul was known for his sophisticated palate,  and introduced his wife to fine cuisine. He joined the  |United_States_Foreign_Service|United_States_Foreign_Service| , and in 1948 the couple moved to Paris when the  |US_State_Department|United_States_Department_Of_State|  assigned Paul there as an exhibits officer with the  |United_States_Information_Agency|United_States_Information_Agency| . The couple had no children.       Child repeatedly recalled her first meal in  |Rouen|Rouen|  as a culinary revelation; once, she described the meal of  |oysters|Oyster| ,  |sole_meunière|Sole_Meunière| , and fine wine to  The New York Times  as an opening up of the soul and spirit for me. In Paris, she attended the famous  |Cordon_Bleu|Le_Cordon_Bleu|  cooking school and later studied privately with Max Bugnard and other master chefs.  She joined the womens cooking club  Le Cercle des Gourmettes , through which she met  |Simone_Beck|Simone_Beck| , who was writing a French cookbook for Americans with her friend  |Louisette_Bertholle|Louisette_Bertholle| . Beck proposed that Child work with them to make the book appeal to Americans. In 1951, Child, Beck, and Bertholle began to teach cooking to American women in Childs Paris kitchen, calling their informal school  Lécole des trois gourmandes  . For the next decade, as the Childs moved around Europe and finally to  |Cambridge,_Massachusetts|Cambridge,_Massachusetts| , the three researched and repeatedly tested recipes. Child translated the French into English, making the recipes detailed, interesting, and practical.     In 1963, the Childs built a home near the  |Provence|Provence|  town of  |Plascassier|Plascassier|  in the hills above  |Cannes|Cannes|  on property belonging to co-author Simone Beck and her husband, Jean Fischbacher. The Childs named it  |La_Pitchoune|La_Pitchoune|  , a  |Provençal|Provençal_Dialect|  word meaning the little one but over time the property was often affectionately referred to simply as La Peetch .             The three would-be authors initially signed a contract with publisher  |Houghton_Mifflin|Houghton_Mifflin| , which later rejected the manuscript for seeming too much like an encyclopedia. Finally, when it was first published in 1961 by  |Alfred_A._Knopf|Alfred_A._Knopf| , the 726-page  Mastering the Art of French Cooking   was a best-seller and received critical acclaim that derived in part from the American interest in French culture in the early 1960s. Lauded for its helpful illustrations and precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for  The Boston Globe  newspaper. She would go on to publish nearly twenty titles under her name and with others. Many, though not all, were related to her television shows. Her last book was the autobiographical  My Life in France , published posthumously in 2006 and written with her grandnephew,  |Alex_Prudhomme|Alex_Prudhomme| . The book recounts Childs life with her husband,  |Paul_Cushing_Child|Paul_Cushing_Child| , in post-World War II France.     The French Chef and related books   A 1962 appearance on a book review show on what was then the  |National_Educational_Television|National_Educational_Television|  station of Boston,  |WGBH-TV|Wgbh-Tv|  , led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette.  The French Chef  had its debut on February 11, 1963, on  |WGBH|Wgbh-Tv|  and was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won  |Peabody|Peabody_Award|  and  |Emmy|Emmy_Award|  Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing, unaffected manner. In 1972, The French Chef became the first television program to be  |captioned|Close_Captioningterminology|  for the  |deaf|Deaf| , even though this was done using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.     Childs second book, The French Chef Cookbook, was a collection of the recipes she had demonstrated on the show. It was soon followed in 1971 by Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two, again in collaboration with Simone Beck, but not with Louisette Bertholle, with whom the professional relationship had ended. Childs fourth book, From Julia Childs Kitchen, was illustrated with her husbands photographs and documented the color series of The French Chef, as well as provided an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.        Julia Child had a large impact on American households and housewives. Because of the technology in the 1960s, the show was unedited, causing her blunders to appear in the final version and ultimately lend authenticity and approachability to television. Toby Miller.

P. 224 According to Toby Miller in Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate, one mother he spoke to said that sometimes all that stood between me and insanity was hearty Julia Child because of Childs ability to soothe and transport her. In addition, Miller notes that Childs show began before the feminist movement of the 1960s, which meant that the issues housewives and women faced were somewhat ignored on television. Toby Miller.

This resulted in the initiative known as .     Child starred in four more series in the 1990s that featured guest chefs: Cooking with Master Chefs, In Julias Kitchen with Master Chefs,  Baking with Julia , and Julia Child & Jacques Pépin Cooking at Home. She collaborated with  |Jacques_Pépin|Jacques_Pépin|  many times for television programs and cookbooks. All of Childs books during this time stemmed from the television series of the same names.     Childs use of ingredients like butter and cream has been questioned by food critics and modern-day nutritionists. She addressed these criticisms throughout her career, predicting that a fanatical fear of food would take over the countrys dining habits, and that focusing too much on nutrition takes the pleasure from enjoying food.   In a 1990 interview, Child said, Everybody is overreacting. If fear of food continues, it will be the death of gastronomy in the United States. Fortunately, the French dont suffer from the same hysteria we do. We should enjoy food and have fun. It is one of the simplest and nicest pleasures in life.        |Julia_Childs_kitchen|Julia_Childs_Kitchen| , designed by her husband, was the setting for three of her television shows.
