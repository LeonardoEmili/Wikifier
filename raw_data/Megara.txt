     Megara  is a historic town and a municipality in  |West_Attica|West_Attica| ,  |Greece|Greece| . It lies in the northern section of the  |Isthmus_of_Corinth|Isthmus_Of_Corinth|  opposite the island of  |Salamis|Salamis_Island| , which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by  |Athens|Athens| . Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King  |Pandion_II|Pandion_Ii| , of whom  |Nisos|Nisos|  was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pegae, to the west on the  |Corinthian_Gulf|Corinthian_Gulf|  and  |Nisaea|Nisaea| , to the east on the  |Saronic_Gulf|Saronic_Gulf|  of the Aegean Sea.          According to  |Pausanias|Pausanias| , the Megarians said that their town owed its origin to  |Car|Car| , the son of  |Phoroneus|Phoroneus| , who built the citadel called Caria and the temples of  |Demeter|Demeter|  called Megara, from which the place derived its name. Paus. i. 39. § 5, i. 40. § 6     In historical times, Megara was an early dependency of  |Corinth|Ancient_Corinth| , in which capacity colonists from Megara founded  |Megara_Hyblaea|Megara_Hyblaea| , a small polis north of  |Syracuse|Syracuse,_Italy|  in Sicily. Megara then fought a war of independence with Corinth, and afterwards founded  |Chalcedon|Chalcedon|  in 685  BC, as well as  |Byzantium|Byzantium|  .     Megara is known to have early ties with  |Miletos|Miletos| , in the region of  |Caria|Caria|  in Asia Minor. According to some scholars, they had built up a colonisation alliance . In the 7th/6th century BCE these two cities acted in concordance with each other. Alexander Herda ,      Both cities acted under the leadership and sanction of an  |Apollo|Apollo|  oracle. Megara cooperated with that of Delphi. Miletos had her own oracle of Apollo Didymeus Milesios in  |Didyma|Didyma| . Also, there are many parallels in the political organisation of both cities.     In the late 7th century BC  |Theagenes|Theagenes_Of_Megara|  established himself as tyrant of Megara by slaughtering the cattle of the rich to win over the poor. Aristotle, Politics V 4,5 During the second Persian invasion of Greece Megara fought alongside the Spartans and Athenians at crucial battles such as  |Salamis|Battle_Of_Salamis|  and  |Plataea|Battle_Of_Plataea| .     Megara defected from the Spartan-dominated  |Peloponnesian_League|Peloponnesian_League|  to the Delian league due to border disputes with its neighbour Corinth and it became one of the causes of the  |First_Peloponnesian_War|First_Peloponnesian_War|  . By the terms of the  |Thirty_Years_Peace|Thirty_Years_Peace|  of 446–445  BC Megara was returned to the Peloponnesian League after successfully revolting from the Delian league.     In the  |Peloponnesian_War|Peloponnesian_War|  , Megara was an ally of  |Sparta|Sparta| . The  |Megarian_decree|Megarian_Decree|  is considered to be one of several contributing causes of the Peloponnesian War. Sarah B. Pomeroy, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts, Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History . Athens issued the Megarian decree with the aim of choking out the Megarian economy. The decree banned Megarian merchants from territory controlled by Athens. The Athenians claimed that they were responding to the Megarians desecration of the  Hiera Orgas , a sacred precinct in the border region between the two states.     Arguably the most famous citizen of Megara in antiquity was  |Byzas|Byzas| , the legendary founder of  |Byzantium|Byzantium|  in the 7th century BC. The 6th century BC poet  |Theognis|Theognis_Of_Megara|  also came from Megara. In the early 4th century BC,  |Euclid_of_Megara|Euclid_Of_Megara|  founded the  |Megarian_school_of_philosophy|Megarian_School_Of_Philosophy|  which flourished for about a century, and which became famous for the use of  |logic|Logic|  and  |dialectic|Dialectic| .     During the Celtic invasion in 279 BC, Megara sent a force of 400 peltasts to  |Thermopylae|Battle_Of_Thermopylae| . During the  |Chremonidean_War|Chremonidean_War| , in 266 BC, the Megarians were besieged by the Macedonian king  |Antigonus_Gonatas|Antigonus_Gonatas|  and managed to defeat his elephants employing  |burning_pigs|War_Pig| . Despite this success, the Megarians had to submit to the Macedonians.     In 243  BC, exhorted by  |Aratus_of_Sicyon|Aratus_Of_Sicyon| , Megara expelled its  |Macedon|Macedon| ian garrison and joined the  |Achaean_League|Achaean_League| , but when the Achaeans lost control of the Isthmus in 223  BC the Megarians left them and joined the  |Boeotian_League|Boeotian_League| . Not more than thirty years later, however, the Megarians grew tired of the Boeotian decline and returned their allegiance to Achaea. The Achaean strategos  |Philopoemen|Philopoemen|  fought off the Boeotian intervention force and secured Megaras return, either in 203 or in 193 BC.        The Megarians were proverbial for their generosity in building and endowing temples.  |Saint_Jerome|Saint_Jerome|  reports There is a common saying about the Megarians They build as if they are to live forever; they live as if they are to die tomorrow.  |Jerome|Jerome| , To Ageruchia,          Megara seems to have experienced democracy on two occasions. The first was between 427, when there was a democratic uprising, and 424, when a narrow oligarchy was installed . The second was in the 370s, when we hear that the people of Megara expelled some anti-democratic conspirators . By the 350s, though,  |Isocrates|Isocrates|  is referring to Megara in terms that suggests that it was an oligarchy again .     One of the first actions of the new oligarchy in 424 was to compel the people to vote openly, which suggests that the democracy had made use of the  |secret_ballot|Secret_Ballot| . Megarian democracy also made use of  |ostracism|Ostracism| . Other key institutions of the democracy included a popular Assembly and Council, and a board of five generals. E. Robinson, Democracy Beyond Athens, Cambridge 2011, 46-47.
