The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors.

        " programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.     The first handheld calculator was a prototype called Cal Tech , whose development was led by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1967. It could add, multiply, subtract, and divide, and its output device was a paper tape. Texas Instruments press release, 15 August 2002. All Things Considered, NPR, 30 September 2007. Audio interview with one of the inventors.         The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistor s on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuit s and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: Canon Inc. with Texas Instruments , Hayakawa Electric with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics , Busicom with Mostek and Intel , and General Instrument with Sanyo .           By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the Sanyo ICC-0081 Mini Calculator , the Canon Pocketronic, and the Sharp QT-8B micro Compet . The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the Cal-Tech project which had been started at Texas Instruments in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the Cal-Tech project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.     Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the Sharp EL-8 , also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds , had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable NiCad batteries, and initially sold for US $395.     However, integrated circuit development efforts culminated in early 1971 with the introduction of the first calculator on a chip , the MK6010 by Mostek , Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line , Electronics, February 1, 1971, p19 followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology , led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.     In 1971 Pico Electronics . and General Instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.     The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the Busicom LE-120A HANDY , which was marketed early in 1971. The one-chip calculator is here, and its only the beginning , Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34. Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit , the Mostek MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures .     The first European-made pocket-sized calculator, DB 800 is made in May 1971 by Digitron in Buje , Croatia with four functions and an eight-digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display.     The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B , measuring , came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red LED display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function Sinclair Executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring and weighing . It retailed for around £79 . By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 .     The first Soviet Union made pocket-sized calculator, the Elektronika B3-04 was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974.     One of the first low-cost calculators was the Sinclair Cambridge , launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 , or £5 less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental function s. Ken Shirriff, 2013. See in particular the section Limited performance and accuracy . For more coverage of Shirriffs results, see     Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule . The $395 HP-35 , along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used reverse Polish notation , also called postfix notation. A calculation like 8 plus 5 is, using RPN, performed by pressing , , , and ; instead of the algebraic infix notation : , , , . It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.     The first Soviet scientific pocket-sized calculator the B3-18 was completed by the end of 1975.     In 1973, Texas Instruments introduced the SR-10 ,  an algebraic entry programmable calculators were produced in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio . These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65 , in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader.

The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasnt backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation . Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities , people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure game s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator was used in Soviet spacecraft program as a backup of the board computer.     This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to synthetic programming of the American HP-41 , which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine ": null
    },
    {
        "Nauka i Zhizn": "Nauka I Zhizn"
    },
    {
        " , featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named yeggogology . The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word YEGGOG which, unsurprisingly, is translated to Error .     A similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the HP-41 , which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than B3-34 .       thu   Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent display s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal display s were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A HANDY  calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 , Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.     A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL-805, which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharps Calculator On Substrate technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.     thu   In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, twisted nematic LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.     There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first calculator on a chip integrated circuit s in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.     The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of CMOS technology. Appearing in the Sharp EL-801 in 1972, the transistor s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The LED and VFD displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.     With this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cell s as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal Solar 1, Sharp EL-8026, and Teal Photon ": null
