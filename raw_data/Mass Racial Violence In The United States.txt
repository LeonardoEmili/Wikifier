The latter were sometimes contemptuously referred to as Diggers , for their practice of digging up roots to eat. Many of the same policies of violence were used here against the indigenous population as the United States had done throughout its territory.  Norton, Jack. Genocide in Northwestern California: When our worlds cried. Indian Historian Press, 1979.        California statehood, private militias, Federal reservations, and sections of the US Army all participated in a deliberate campaign to wipe out California Indians with the state and federal governments paying millions of dollar to militias who hunted and murdered Indians, Federal Reservations deliberately starving Indians to death by reducing caloric distribution to them from 480–910 to 160–390 and the U.S. Army killed 1,680 to 3,741 California Indians themselves. California governor Peter Burnett even predicted: That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert. The Governors Message , Sacramento Transcript, January 10, 1851, 2. On January 6, 1851 at his State of the State address to the California Senate, 1st Governor Peter Burnett used the following words: That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert. Between 1850 and 1852 the state appropriated almost one million dollars for the activities of these militias, and between 1854 and 1859 the state appropriated another $500,000, almost half of which was reimbursed by the federal government.  Numerous books have been written on the subject of the California Indian genocide such as Genocide and Vendetta: The Round Valley Wars in Northern California by Lynwood Carranco and Estle Beard, Murder State: Californias Native American Genocide, 1846–1873 by Brendan C. Lindsay, and An American Genocide: The United States and the California Indian Catastrophe, 1846–1873 by Benjamin Madley among others. That last book by Madley caused California governor  |Jerry_Brown|Jerry_Brown|  to recognize the genocide. Even  |Guenter_Lewy|Guenter_Lewy|  famous for the phrase: In the end, the sad fate of Americas Indians represents not a crime but a tragedy, involving an irreconcilable collision of cultures and values concedes that what happened in California may constitute genocide: some of the massacres in California, where both the perpetrators and their supporters openly acknowledged a desire to destroy the Indians as an ethnic entity, might indeed be regarded under the terms of the convention as exhibiting genocidal intent. In a speech before representatives of Native American peoples in June, 2019, California governor  |Gavin_Newsom|Gavin_Newsom|  apologized for the genocide. Newsom said, That’s what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that’s the way it needs to be described in the history books.      By one estimate, at least 4,500 California Indians were killed between 1849 and 1870.  Contemporary historian  |Benjamin_Madley|Benjamin_Madley|  has documented the numbers of California Indians killed between 1846 and 1873; he estimates that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians. Most of the deaths took place in what he defined as more than 370  |massacres|List_Of_Indian_Massacres|  .  Professor  |Ed_Castillo|Ed_Castillo| , of  |Sonoma_State_University|Sonoma_State_University| , estimates that more were killed: The handiwork of these well armed death squads combined with the widespread random killing of Indians by individual miners resulted in the death of 100,000 Indians in the first two years of the gold rush.             Riots defined by race have taken place between ethnic groups in the United States since at least the 18th century and they may have also occurred before it. During the early-to-mid- 19th centuries, violent rioting occurred between  |Protestant|Protestantism| |Nativists|Nativism|  and recently arrived  |Irish_Catholic|Irish_Catholic|  immigrants. These riots reached their heights during the peak of immigration in the 1840s and 1850s in cities such as  |New_York|New_York_City,_New_York| ,  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia_Nativist_Riots| , and  |Boston|Boston| . During the early 20th century, riots were common against Irish and French-Canadian immigrants in  |Providence,_Rhode_Island|Providence,_Rhode_Island| .     The  |San_Francisco_Vigilance_Movements_of_1851_and_1856|San_Francisco_Vigilance_Movement|  have been described as responses to rampant crime and government corruption. But, since the late 20th century, historians have noted that the vigilantes had a nativist bias; they systematically attacked Irish immigrants, and later they attacked  |Mexicans|Mexicans|  and  |Chileans|Chileans|  who came as miners during the  |California_Gold_Rush|California_Gold_Rush| , and  |Chinese|Chinese_People|  immigrants. During the early 20th century, racial or ethnic violence was directed by whites against  |Filipinos|Filipino_Americans| ,  |Japanese|Japanese_People|  and  |Armenians|Armenians|  in California, who had arrived in waves of immigration.       During the late 19th and early 20th centuries,  |Italian|Italians|  immigrants were subject to racial violence. In 1891,  |eleven_Italians_were_lynched|March_14,_1891_Lynchings|  by a mob of thousands in New Orleans.  In the 1890s a total of twenty Italians were lynched in the  |South|Southern_United_States| . Anti- |Polish|Poles|  violence also occurred in the same time period.       Immediately following the Civil War, political pressure from the North called for a full abolition of slavery. The Souths lack of voting power led to the passing of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which in theory gave African-Americans and other minorities equality and voting rights, along with abolishing slavery. Although the federal government originally kept troops in the South to protect these new freedoms, this time of progress was cut short.      By 1877 the North had lost its political will in the South and while slavery remained abolished, the Black Codes and segregation laws helped erase most of the freedoms passed by the 14th and 15th amendments. Through violent economic tactics and legal technicalities, African-Americans were forced into sharecropping and were gradually removed from the voting process.     African-Americans were not alone in experiencing racial violence, as by 1866, General  |William_Sherman|William_Sherman|   called for     At least 10 Indians are to be killed for each white life lost. You should not allow the troops to settle down on the defensive but carry the war to the Indian camps, where the women and children ... should not delay the punishment of the Indians as a people.           |Lynching|Lynching| , defined as the killing of an individual or small group of individuals by a mob of people was a particular form of ritualistic murder, often involving the majority of the local white community. Lynching was sometimes announced in advance and became a spectacle for an audience to witness. Lynchings in the United States dropped in number from the 1880s to the 1920s, but there were still an average of about 30 lynchings per year during the 1920s. A study done of 100 lynchings from 1929 to 1940 discovered that at least one third of the victims were innocent of the crimes they were accused of.      Racial and ethnic cleansing took place on a large scale in this time period, particularly towards Native Americans, who were forced off their land and relocated to reservations. Along with Native Americans, Chinese Americans in the Pacific Northwest and African Americans throughout the United States were rounded up and expunged from towns under threat of mob rule, often intending to harm their targets.       Though the Roosevelt administration, under tremendous pressure, engaged in anti-racist propaganda and in some cases helped push for African-American employment, African Americans were still experiencing immense violence, particularly in the South. In March 1956, United States Senator  |Sam_Ervin|Sam_Ervin|  of North Carolina created the  |Southern_Manifesto|Southern_Manifesto| ,  which promised to fight to keep Jim Crow alive by all legal means.      This continuation of support for  |Jim_Crow|Jim_Crow_Laws|  and segregation laws led to protests in which many African-Americans were violently injured out in the open at lunchroom counters, buses, polling places and local public areas. These protests did not eviscerate racism, but it forced racism to become used in more coded or metaphorical language instead of being used out in the open.       Today racial violence has changed dramatically, as open violent acts of racism are rare, but acts of police brutality and the mass incarceration of racial minorities continues to be a major issue facing the United States.  |The_War_on_Drugs|War_On_Drugs|   has been noted as a direct cause for the dramatic increase in incarceration, which has risen from 300,000 to more than 2,000,000 from 1980 to 2000 in the nations prison system.     While the rates of drug use for African-Americans, Latinos and Caucasians are almost equal, there is a massive inequality in African-American and Latinos sent to prison for drug related crimes. Drug crimes aside, Latinos and African-Americans are being incarcerated at a  than Caucasians. This has led to an alarming fact that in 2006, 1 out of every 14 African-American men were in prison, compared to only 1 out of every 106 white men. With  forecasting that 1 in 3 black men in the United States will go to prison or jail, focus on fixing criminal issues with minorities has been placed to the forefront of pressing problems in the United States.       Like lynchings, race riots often had their roots in economic tensions or in white defense of the color line. In 1887, for example, ten thousand workers at sugar plantations in Louisiana, organized by the  |Knights_of_Labor|Knights_Of_Labor| , went on strike for an increase in their pay to $1.25 a day. Most of the workers were black, but some were white, infuriating Governor  |Samuel_Douglas_McEnery|Samuel_Douglas_Mcenery| , who declared that God Almighty has himself drawn the color line. The militia was called in, but withdrawn to give free rein to  |a_lynch_mob_in_Thibodaux|Thibodaux_Massacre| . The mob killed between 20 and 300 blacks. A black newspaper described the scene:     Six killed and five wounded is what the daily papers here say, but from an eye witness to the whole transaction we learn that no less than thirty-five Negroes were killed outright. Lame men and blind women shot; children and hoary-headed grandsires ruthlessly swept down! The Negroes offered no resistance; they could not, as the killing was unexpected. Those of them not killed took to the woods, a majority of them finding refuge in this city. Zinn, 2004;, retrieved March 27, 2009.     In 1891, a mob lynched  |Joe_Coe|Joe_Coe| , a black worker in  |Omaha,_Nebraska|Omaha,_Nebraska|  suspected of attacking a young white woman from South Omaha. Approximately 10,000 white people, mostly ethnic immigrants from  |South_Omaha|South_Omaha| , reportedly swarmed the  |courthouse|Douglas_County_Courthouse| , setting it on fire. They took Coe from his jail cell, beating and then lynching him. Reportedly 6,000 people visited Coes corpse during a public exhibition, at which pieces of the lynching rope were sold as souvenirs. This was a period when even officially sanctioned executions, such as hangings, were regularly conducted in public. Bristow, D.L. A Dirty, Wicked Town. Caxton Press. p 253.                         Labor and immigrant conflict was a source of tensions that catalyzed as the  |East_St._Louis_riot|East_St._Louis_Riot|  of 1917. White rioters, many of them ethnic immigrants, killed an estimated 100 black residents of East St. Louis, after black residents had killed two white policemen, mistaking the car they were riding in for a previous car of white occupants who drove through a black neighborhood and fired randomly into a crowd of black people .  White-on-Black race riots include the  |Atlanta_riots|Atlanta_Riots|  , the  |Omaha|Omaha_Riot|  and  |Chicago_riots|Chicago_Race_Riot|  , part of a series of riots in the volatile post-World War I environment, and the  |Tulsa_riots|Tulsa_Race_Riot|  .     The  |Chicago_race_riot_of_1919|Chicago_Race_Riot_Of_1919|  grew out of tensions on the Southside, where Irish descendants and African Americans competed for jobs at the stockyards, and where both were crowded into substandard housing. The Irish descendants had been in the city longer, and were organized around athletic and political clubs.          A young black Chicagoan, Eugene Williams, paddled a raft near a Southside Lake Michigan beach into white territory , and drowned after being hit by a rock thrown by a young white man. Witnesses pointed out the killer to a policeman, who refused to make an arrest. An indignant black mob attacked the officer. , History Matters, George Mason University  |Violence_broke_out_across_the_city|Chicago_Race_Riot_Of_1919| . White mobs, many of them organized around Irish athletic clubs, began pulling black people off trolley cars, attacking black businesses, and beating victims. Having learned from the East St. Louis riot, the city closed down the street car system, but the rioting continued. A total of 23 black people and 15 white people were killed. Dray, 2002.     The 1921  |Tulsa_race_riot|Tulsa_Race_Riot|  was the result of economic competition, and white resentment of black successes in  |Greenwood|Greenwood,_Tulsa| , which was compared to Wall Street and filled with independent businesses. In the immediate event, black people resisted white people who tried to lynch 19-year-old  |Dick_Rowland|Dick_Rowland| , who worked at shoeshines. Thirty-nine people were confirmed killed. An early 21st century investigation of these events has suggested that the number of casualties could be much higher. White mobs set fire to the black Greenwood district, destroying 1,256 homes and as many as 200 businesses. Fires leveled 35 blocks of residential and commercial neighborhood. Black people were rounded up by the  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma| |National_Guard|United_States_National_Guard|  and put into several internment centers, including a baseball stadium. White rioters in airplanes shot at black refugees and dropped improvised kerosene bombs and  |dynamite|Dynamite|  on them. Ellsworth, Scott. , retrieved July 23, 2005.     By the 1960s, decades of racial, economic, and political forces, which generated inner city poverty, resulted in race riots within minority areas in cities across the United States. The beating and rumored death of cab driver John Smith by police, sparked the  |1967_Newark_riots|1967_Newark_Riots| . This event became, per capita, one of the deadliest civil disturbances of the 1960s. The long and short term causes of the Newark riots are explored in depth in the documentary film  Revolution 67  and many news reports of the times. The riots in Newark spread across the United States in most major cities and over 100 deaths were reported. Many inner city neighborhoods in these cities were destroyed. The assassinations of Rev.  |Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|  in  |Memphis,_Tennessee|Memphis,_Tennessee|  and later of  |Robert_Kennedy|Robert_Kennedy|  in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles|  in 1968 also led to nationwide rioting across the country with similar mass deaths. During the same time period, and since then,  |violent_acts_committed_against_African-American_churches|List_Of_Attacks_Against_African-American_Churches|  and their members have been commonplace.     During the 1980s and 90s a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities. The  |1980_Miami_riots|1980_Miami_Riots|  were catalyzed by the killing of an African-American motorist by four white  |Miami-Dade_Police|Miami-Dade_Police|  officers. They were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering. Similarly, the six-day  |1992_Los_Angeles_riots|1992_Los_Angeles_Riots|  erupted after the acquittal of four white  |LAPD|Los_Angeles_Police_Department|  officers who had been filmed beating  |Rodney_King|Rodney_King| , an African-American motorist.  |Khalil_Gibran_Muhammad|Khalil_Gibran_Muhammad| , the Director of the Harlem-based  |Schomburg_Center_for_Research_in_Black_Culture|Schomburg_Center_For_Research_In_Black_Culture|  has identified more than 100 instances of mass racial violence in the United States since 1935 and has noted that almost every instance was precipitated by a police incident.        The  |Cincinnati_riots_of_2001|Cincinnati_Riots_Of_2001|  were caused by the killing of 19-year-old African-American Timothy Thomas by white police officer Stephen Roach, who was subsequently acquitted on charges of negligent homicide.

According to the  |Associated_Press|Associated_Press|  annual poll of United States news directors and editors, the top news story of 2014 was police killings of unarmed black people, including Brown, as well as the investigations and the protests afterward.
