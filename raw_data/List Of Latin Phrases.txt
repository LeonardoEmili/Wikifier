NOTOC   This page lists direct  |English|English_Language| |translations|Translation|  of common  |Latin|Latin| |phrases|Phrase| , such as  vēnī, vīdī, vīcī  and  et cetera . Some of the phrases are themselves translations of  |Greek_phrases|List_Of_Greek_Phrases| , because  |Greek|Ancient_Greek| |rhetoric|Rhetoric|  and  |literature|Ancient_Greek_Literature|  were greatly esteemed in  |Ancient_Rome|Ancient_Rome|  when Latin rhetoric and  |literature|Latin_Literature|  were maturing.     The Latin letter  |i|I|  may be used either as a  |vowel|Vowel|  or a  |consonant|Consonant| . In  |Medieval_Latin|Medieval_Latin| , when i was used as a consonant, the letter j , which originally was simply an orthographic long i that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels, replaced it. This convention is preserved mostly in  |Latin_legal_terminology|List_Of_Latin_Legal_Terms| ; thus phrases such as  de iure  often are spelled  de jure . In this page, phrases that in Medieval Latin had the letter j replace their consonantal i s are enumerated as if beginning with i .
