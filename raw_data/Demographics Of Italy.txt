          This article is about the  |demographic|Demographics|  features of the  |population|Population|  of  |Italy|Italy| , including  |population_density|Population_Density| ,  |ethnicity|Ethnic_Group| , education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.     At the beginning of year 2017,  |Italy|Italy|  had an estimated population of 60.4 million. Its population density, at , is higher than that of most Western  |Europe|Europe| an countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the  |Po_Valley|Po_Valley|  in  |northern_Italy|Northern_Italy|  and the metropolitan areas of  |Rome|Rome|  and  |Naples|Naples|  in  |central|Central_Italy|  and  |southern_Italy|Southern_Italy| , while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of  |Basilicata|Basilicata| , the  |Alps|Alps|  and  |Apennines|Apennines|  highlands, and the island of  |Sardinia|Sardinia| .     The population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the  |Italian_economic_miracle|Italian_Economic_Miracle|  of the 1950-60s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. According to the Italian government, there were an estimated 5,000,073 foreign nationals resident in Italy. .     High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, one in five Italians was over 65 years old.  However, as a result of the massive immigration of the last two decades, Italy has, in recent years, experienced a significant growth in birth rates.  The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008.      Since the 1984  |Lateran_Treaty|Lateran_Treaty|  agreement, Italy has no official  |religion|Religion| . However, it recognizes the role the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  plays in Italian society. 87.8% of the population identify as Catholic, 5.8% as non-believers or atheists, 2.6% as Muslims, and 3.8% adhere to other religions.               70.4% of Italian population is classified as  |urban|Urban_Population| ,  a relatively low figure among developed countries. During the last two decades, Italy underwent a  |devolution|Devolution|  process, that eventually led to the creation of administrative  |metropolitan_areas|Metropolitan_Area| , in order to give major cities and their metropolitan areas a  |provincial|Provinces_Of_Italy|  status .     According to  |OECD|Oecd| ,  the largest conurbations are:    |Milan|Milan|  – 7.4  million    |Rome|Rome|  – 3.7  million    |Naples|Naples|  – 3.1  million    |Turin|Turin|  – 2.2  million                          Italy used to be a country of mass emigration from the late 19th century until the 1970s. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of  |Italian_diaspora|Italian_Diaspora| , approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.  Italian communities once thrived in the former African colonies of Eritrea ,  Somalia and Libya . . Britannica Online Encyclopedia.

In addition, after the annexation of  |Istria|Istria|  in 1945, up to 350,000 ethnic Italians left  |Titoist_Yugoslavia|Istrian_Exodus| . . The New York Times. 6 June 1987.

As a result of the profound economic and social changes induced by postwar industrialization, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, during the 1980s Italy became to attract rising flows of foreign immigrants. The present-day figure of about 5 million foreign residents, that make up some 8% of the total population, include 97,000 children born in Italy to foreign nationals in 2014, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian nationality; this applied to 106,000 people in 2014.   The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, the so-called clandestini, whose numbers are very difficult to determine. In May 2008  The Boston Globe  quoted an estimate of 670,000 for this group. Elisabeth Rosenthal,  .  |The_Boston_Globe|The_Boston_Globe| . 16 May 2008. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and more recently, the  |2004|2004_Enlargement_Of_The_European_Union|  and  |2007|2004_Enlargement_Of_The_European_Union|  enlargements of the European Union, the main waves of migration came from the former socialist countries of  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe|  . The second most important area of immigration to Italy has always been the neighbouring  |North_Africa|North_Africa|  , with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the  |Arab_Spring|Arab_Spring| . Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from the  |Far_East|Far_East|   and  |Latin_America|Latin_America|   have been recorded. Currently, circa one million  |Romanians|Romanians|   are officially registered as living in Italy, representing thus the most important individual country of origin, followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500,000 people each. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested that in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.   Overall, at the end of the 2000s the foreign born population of Italy was from: Europe , Africa , Asia , the Americas and Oceania . The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 84.9% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country , while only 15.1% live in the southern half of the peninsula.     There is significant cultural,  |linguistic|Languages_Of_Italy| ,  |genetic|Genetic_History_Of_Italy| ,  |historical_political|History_Of_Italyunification|  diversity within the Italian ethnicity, enough to constitute several distinct ethnicities by some standards. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,  even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.  Groups like  |Friulians|Friulians| ,  |Ladins|Ladin_People| ,  |Sardinians|Sardinian_People| ,  |South_Tyrol|South_Tyrol| eans, and  |Sicilians|Sicilians|  are examples of distinct peoples native to Italy.                       |Life_expectancy_at_birth|Life_Expectancy|  from 1871 to 2015  |Our_World_In_Data|Our_World_In_Data|  and the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| .     1871-1950                           1950-2015      Source: UN World Population Prospects       |Total_Fertility_Rate|Total_Fertility_Rate|  from 1850 to 1899 |total_fertility_rate|Total_Fertility_Rate|  is the number of children born per woman.

Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version Italian, adopted by the central state after the  |unification_of_Italy|Unification_Of_Italy| , is based on the  |Florentine|Florentine_Dialect|  variety of  |Tuscan|Tuscan_Language|  and is somewhat intermediate between the  |Italo_Dalmatian_languages|Italo_Dalmatian_Languages|  and the  |Gallo_Romance_languages|Gallo_Romance_Languages| . Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the  |post_Roman_invaders|Migration_Period| .     However, Italy is linguistically diverse, as there are  |varieties_of_Italian|Regional_Italian|  specific to each cultural region, as well as distinct  |regional_and_minority_languages|Languages_Of_Italy| . The establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in the use of the latter, and the emergence of the former. The spread of Italian was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the economic growth and the rise of  |mass_media|Mass_Media|  and  |television|Television| , with the state broadcaster  setting a colloquial variety of Italian to which the population would be exposed.     As a way to distance itself from the  |Italianization|Italianization|  policies promoted because of  |nationalism|Italian_Nationalism| , Italy recognized twelve languages as the Countrys  |historical_linguistic_minorities|Languages_Of_Italyhistorical_Linguistic_Minorities|  ,  which are promoted alongside Italian in their respective territories. French is co-official in the  |Aosta_Valley|Aosta_Valley|  as the provinces  |prestige_variety|Prestige| , under which the more commonly spoken  |Franco_Provencal|Franco_Provencal|  dialects have been historically roofed. L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, Statuto speciale per la Valle dAosta German has the same status in the province of  |South_Tyrol|South_Tyrol|  as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring  |Trentino|Trentino| , does  |Ladin|Ladin_Language| . L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 5, Statuto speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige  |Slovene|Slovene_Language|  L.cost. 31 gennaio 1963, n. 1, Statuto speciale della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia and  |Friulian|Friulian_Language|  are officially recognised in the provinces of  |Trieste|Province_Of_Trieste| ,  |Gorizia|Province_Of_Gorizia|  and  |Udine|Province_Of_Udine|  in  |Venezia_Giulia|Friuli_Venezia_Giulia| . In  |Sardinia|Sardinia| , the  |Sardinian_language|Sardinian_Language|  is recognized as having equal dignity with Italian,  the introduction of which to the island officially started under the rule of the  |House_of_Savoy|House_Of_Savoy|  in the 18th century.     In these regions, official documents are either bilingual in the co-official language by default, or available as such upon request. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d’Aosta where French toponyms are generally used, with the exception of  |Aosta|Aosta|  itself, which has retained its Latin form in Italian as well as English. Attempts to Italianize them, especially during the Fascist period, have been formally abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.      |UNESCO|Unesco|  and other authories recognize a number of other languages which are not legally protected by Italian government:  |Piedmontese|Piedmontese_Language| ,  |Venetian|Venetian_Language| ,  |Ligurian|Ligurian| ,  |Lombard|Lombard_Language| ,  |Emilian_Romagnolo|Emiliano_Romagnolo_Language| ,  |Neapolitan|Neapolitan_Language|  and  |Sicilian|Sicilian_Language| .              |Roman_Catholicism|Roman_Catholicism|  is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the  |state_religion|State_Religion| . In 2006, 87.8% of Italys population self-identified as Roman Catholic,  although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members . In 2016, 71.1% of italian citizens self-identified as Roman Catholic,.      Most Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to the most recent  |Eurobarometer_Poll|Eurobarometer|  2005:   74% of Italian citizens responded that they believe there is a God, 16% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 6% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force.   There are no data collected through census.            The Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the  |Pope|Pope| ,  |curia|Curia|  in Rome, and the  |Conference_of_Italian_Bishops|Conference_Of_Italian_Bishops| . In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses,  |San_Marino|San_Marino|  and  |Vatican_City|Vatican_City| . There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article  |List_of_the_Roman_Catholic_dioceses_in_Italy|List_Of_The_Roman_Catholic_Dioceses_In_Italy| . Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with  |Latin|Latin| , Italian is the most spoken and second language of the  |Roman_Curia|Roman_Curia| .      Italy has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic  |saints|Saint| ,  |martyrs|Martyr|  and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| ,  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  and  |Baroque|Baroque|  periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as  |Michelangelo|Michelangelo| ,  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci| ,  |Raphael|Raphael| ,  |Caravaggio|Caravaggio| ,  |Fra_Angelico|Fra_Angelico| ,  |Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini|Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini| ,  |Sandro_Botticelli|Sandro_Botticelli| ,  |Tintoretto|Tintoretto| ,  |Titian|Titian| ,  |Raphael|Raphael|  and  |Giotto|Giotto| . Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as  |St_Peters_Basilica|St_Peters_Basilica| ,  |Florence_Cathedral|Florence_Cathedral|  and  |St_Marks_Basilica|St_Marks_Basilica| . Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of  |cardinals|Cardinal|  in the world,  and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.      Even though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of  |Protestant|Protestant| ,  |Waldensian|Waldensian| ,  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox|  and other Christian churches.     In the 20th century,  |Jehovahs_Witnesses|Jehovahs_Witnesses| ,  |Pentecostalism|Pentecostalism| , non-denominational  |Evangelicalism|Evangelicalism| , and  |Mormonism|Mormonism|  were the fastest-growing Protestant churches. Immigration from  |Western|Western_Africa| ,  |Central|Central_Africa| , and  |Eastern_Africa|Eastern_Africa|  at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of  |Baptist|Baptist| ,  |Anglican|Anglicanism| , Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe|  has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.     In 2006, Protestants made up 2.1% of Italys population, and members of Eastern Orthodox churches comprised 1.2% or more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians including 180,000  |Greek_Orthodox|Greek_Orthodox_Church| ,   550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists , of whom 400,000 are members of the  |Assemblies_of_God|Assemblies_Of_God| , about 250,000 are  |Jehovahs_Witnesses|Jehovahs_Witnesses|  ,  30,000  |Waldensians|Waldensians| ,    25,000  |Seventh_day_Adventists|Seventh_Day_Adventists| , 22,000 Mormons, 15,000 Baptists , 7,000  |Lutherans|Lutherans| , 4,000  |Methodists|Methodists|  .         The longest-established religious faith in Italy is  |Judaism|Judaism| , Jews having been present in  |Ancient_Rome|Ancient_Rome|  before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as  |Luigi_Luzzatti|Luigi_Luzzatti| , who took office in 1910,  |Ernesto_Nathan|Ernesto_Nathan|  served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and  |Shabbethai_Donnolo|Shabbethai_Donnolo|  . During the  |Holocaust|The_Holocaust| , Italy took in many Jewish refugees from  |Nazi|Nazism|  Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet  |Italian_Social_Republic|Italian_Social_Republic| , about 15% of 48,000 Italian Jews were killed. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.     Due to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian religions. As of 2009, there were 1.0 million  |Muslims|Muslims|  in Italy  forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million  to 1.5 million.  Only 50,000 Italian Muslims hold  |Italian_citizenship|Italian_Citizenship| .     There are more than 200,000 followers of faith originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000  |Sikhs|Sikhs|  with 22  |gurdwaras|Gurdwaras|  across the country,  70,000  |Hindus|Hindus| , and 50,000  |Buddhists|Buddhists| .   There are an estimated some 4,900 Baháís in Italy in 2005.
