            The number   is a  |mathematical_constant|Mathematical_Constant| . Originally defined as the  |ratio|Ratio|  of a  |circles|Circle| |_circumference|Circumference|  to its  |diameter|Diameter| , it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of  |mathematics|Mathematics|  and  |physics|Physics| . It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter  since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as pi . It is also called Archimedes constant.     Being an  |irrational_number|Irrational_Number| ,  cannot be expressed as a  |common_fraction|Common_Fraction|  . Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to  |approximate|Approximations_Of_Π|  . The digits appear to be  |randomly_distributed|Random_Sequence| . In particular, the digit sequence of  is conjectured to satisfy a  |specific_kind_of_statistical_randomness|Normal_Number| , but to date, no proof of this has been discovered. Also,  is a  |transcendental_number|Transcendental_Number| ; that is, it is not the  |root|Root_Of_A_Polynomial|  of any  |polynomial|Polynomial|  having  |rational|Rational_Number| |coefficients|Coefficient| . This transcendence of  implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of  |squaring_the_circle|Squaring_The_Circle|  with a  |compass_and_straightedge|Compass_And_Straightedge_Construction| .      |Ancient_civilizations|History_Of_Mathematics|  required fairly accurate computed values to approximate  for practical reasons, including the  |Egyptians|Egyptian_Mathematics|  and  |Babylonians|Babylonian_Mathematics| . Around 250 BC the  |Greek_mathematician|Greek_Mathematics| |_Archimedes|Archimedes|  created an algorithm for calculating it. In the 5th century AD  |Chinese_mathematics|Chinese_Mathematics|  approximated  to seven digits, while  |Indian_mathematics|Indian_Mathematics|  made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The historically first exact formula for , based on  |infinite_series|Series| , was not available until a millennium later, when in the 14th century the  |Madhava–Leibniz_series|Leibniz_Formula_For_Pi|  was discovered in Indian mathematics.   In the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and  |computer_scientists|Computer_Science|  discovered new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of  to many trillions of digits after the decimal point.     Practically all scientific applications require no more than a few hundred digits of , and many substantially fewer, so the primary motivation for these computations is the quest to find more efficient algorithms for calculating lengthy numeric series, as well as the desire to break records.   The extensive calculations involved have also been used to test  |supercomputers|Supercomputer|  and high-precision multiplication  |algorithms|Algorithms| .     Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle,  is found in many formulae in  |trigonometry|Trigonometry|  and  |geometry|Geometry| , especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres. In more modern  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| , the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the  |real_number|Real_Number|  system, as an  |eigenvalue|Eigenvalue|  or a  |period|Periodic_Function| , without any reference to geometry. It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as  |number_theory|Number_Theory|  and  |statistics|Statistics| , as well as in almost all areas of  |physics|Physics| . The ubiquity of  makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community. Several books devoted to  have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of  often result in news headlines. Attempts to  |memorize_the_value_of_|Piphilology|  with increasing precision have led to records of over 70,000 digits.                The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter is the lowercase  |Greek_letter_|Pi| , sometimes spelled out as pi, and derived from the first letter of the Greek word perimetros, meaning circumference.  In English,  is  |pronounced_as_pie_|English_Pronunciation_Of_Greek_Letters|  .  In mathematical use, the lowercase letter   is distinguished from its capitalized and enlarged counterpart , which denotes a  |product_of_a_sequence|Product_Of_A_Sequence| , analogous to how  denotes  |summation|Summation| .     The choice of the symbol  is discussed in the section  |Adoption_of_the_symbol_|Adoption_Of_The_Symbol_Π| .           is commonly defined as the  |ratio|Ratio|  of a  |circles|Circle| |_circumference|Circumference|   to its  |diameter|Diameter|     :       The ratio  is constant, regardless of the circles size. For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio . This definition of  implicitly makes use of  |flat_geometry|Euclidean_Geometry| ; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any  |curved_geometry|Non_Euclidean_Geometry| , these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula .     Here, the circumference of a circle is the  |arc_length|Arc_Length|  around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using  |limits|Limit| , a concept in  |calculus|Calculus| . . p. 102: From a logical point of view, this is unsatisfactory at the present stage because we have not yet discussed the concept of arc length. Arc length is introduced on p. 529. For example, one may directly compute the arc length of the top half of the unit circle, given in  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinates|  by the equation , as the  |integral|Integral|    :         An integral such as this was adopted as the definition of  by  |Karl_Weierstrass|Karl_Weierstrass| , who defined it directly as an integral in 1841. . The precise integral that Weierstrass used was       Definitions of  such as these that rely on a notion of circumference, and hence implicitly on concepts of the  |integral_calculus|Integral_Calculus| , are no longer common in the literature.  explains that this is because in many modern treatments of calculus,  |differential_calculus|Differential_Calculus|  typically precedes integral calculus in the university curriculum, so it is desirable to have a definition of  that does not rely on the latter. One such definition, due to  |Richard_Baltzer|Richard_Baltzer| ,  and popularized by  |Edmund_Landau|Edmund_Landau| ,  is the following:  is twice the smallest positive number at which the  |cosine_function|Cosine|  equals 0. , p. 183. The cosine can be defined independently of geometry as a  |power_series|Power_Series| , , p. 2. or as the solution of a  |differential_equation|Differential_Equation| .     In a similar spirit,  can be defined instead using properties of the  |complex_exponential|Complex_Exponential| , , of a  |complex|Complex_Number|  variable . Like the cosine, the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways. The set of complex numbers at which  is equal to one is then an arithmetic progression of the form:   :       and there is a unique positive real number  with this property.    A more abstract variation on the same idea, making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of  |topology|Topology|  and  |algebra|Algebra| , is the following theorem: , §VIII.2. there is a unique   |continuous|Continuous_Function| |_isomorphism|Isomorphism|  from the  |group|Group|  R/Z of real numbers under addition  |modulo|Quotient_Group|  integers  onto the multiplicative group of  |complex_numbers|Complex_Numbers|  of  |absolute_value|Absolute_Value|  one. The number  is then defined as half the magnitude of the derivative of this homomorphism. , §II.3.     A circle encloses the largest area that can be attained within a given perimeter. Thus the number  is also characterized as the best constant in the  |isoperimetric_inequality|Isoperimetric_Inequality|  . There are many other, closely related, ways in which  appears as an  |eigenvalue|Eigenvalue|  of some geometrical or physical process; see  |below|Eigenvalues| .        is an  |irrational_number|Irrational_Number| , meaning that it cannot be written as the  |ratio_of_two_integers|Rational_Number|  .  Because  is irrational, it has an infinite number of digits in its  |decimal_representation|Decimal_Representation| , and it does not settle into an infinitely  |repeating_pattern|Repeating_Decimal|  of digits. There are several  |proofs_that_is_irrational|Proof_That_Π_Is_Irrational| ; they generally require calculus and rely on the  reductio ad absurdum  technique. The degree to which  can be approximated by  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number|   is not precisely known; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of  or  but smaller than the measure of  |Liouville_numbers|Liouville_Number| .      The digits of  have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for  |statistical_randomness|Statistical_Randomness| , including tests for  |normality|Normal_Number| ; a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits appear equally often. The conjecture that  is  |normal|Normal_Number|  has not been proven or disproven.       Since the advent of computers, a large number of digits of  have been available on which to perform statistical analysis.  |Yasumasa_Kanada|Yasumasa_Kanada|  has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of  and found them consistent with normality; for example, the frequencies of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to  |statistical_significance_tests|Statistical_Significance_Test| , and no evidence of a pattern was found.  Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the  |infinite_monkey_theorem|Infinite_Monkey_Theorem| . Thus, because the sequence of s digits passes statistical tests for randomness, it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non-random, such as a  |sequence_of_six_consecutive_9s|Six_Nines_In_Pi|  that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of .  This is also called the Feynman point in  |mathematical_folklore|Mathematical_Folklore| , after  |Richard_Feynman|Richard_Feynman| , although no connection to Feynman is known.          In addition to being irrational, more strongly  is a  |transcendental_number|Transcendental_Number| , which means that it is not the  |solution|Solution|  of any non-constant  |polynomial_equation|Polynomial_Equation|  with  |rational|Rational_Number|  coefficients, such as .  The polynomial shown is the first few terms of the  |Taylor_series|Taylor_Series|  expansion of the  |sine|Sine|  function.     The transcendence of  has two important consequences: First,  cannot be expressed using any finite combination of rational numbers and square roots or  |n_th_roots|Nth_Root|  such as  or . Second, since no transcendental number can be  |constructed|Constructible_Number|  with  |compass_and_straightedge|Compass_And_Straightedge_Construction| , it is not possible to  |square_the_circle|Squaring_The_Circle|  . In other words, it is impossible to construct, using compass and straightedge alone, a square whose area is exactly equal to the area of a given circle.  Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity| .  Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle and sometimes claim success despite the fact that it is mathematically impossible.  , p. 185.          Like all irrational numbers,  cannot be represented as a  |common_fraction|Common_Fraction|  , by the very definition of irrational number . But every irrational number, including , can be represented by an infinite series of nested fractions, called a  |continued_fraction|Continued_Fraction| ; the first four of these are 3, 22/7, 333/106, and 355/113. These numbers are among the most well-known and widely used historical approximations of the constant. Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation; that is, each is closer to  than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator.  Because  is known to be transcendental, it is by definition not  |algebraic|Algebraic_Number|  and so cannot be a  |quadratic_irrational|Quadratic_Irrational| . Therefore,  cannot have a  |periodic_continued_fraction|Periodic_Continued_Fraction| . Although the simple continued fraction for  also does not exhibit any other obvious pattern,  Retrieved 12 April 2012. mathematicians have discovered several  |generalized_continued_fractions|Generalized_Continued_Fraction|  that do, such as:      :         &       3+        &                 Some  |approximations_of_pi|Approximations_Of_Π|  include:   Integers |3|3|  Fractions, , , , , , and .    Digits       Digits in other number systems  |binary|Binary_Numberrepresenting_Real_Numbers|   digits  are     The first 20 digits in  |hexadecimal|Hexadecimal|  are      The first five  |sexagesimal|Sexagesimal|  digits are 3;8,29,44,0,47 .  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  used a three-sexagesimal-digit approximation, and  |Jamshīd_al_Kāshī|Jamshīd_Al_Kāshī|  expanded this to nine digits; see              Any  |complex_number|Complex_Number| , say , can be expressed using a pair of  |real_numbers|Real_Number| . In the  |polar_coordinate_system|Polar_Coordinate_Systemcomplex_Numbers| , one number  is used to represent s distance from the  |origin|Origin|  of the  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane|  and the other  to represent a counter-clockwise  |rotation|Rotation|  from the positive real line as follows:    : z r    where  is the  |imaginary_unit|Imaginary_Unit|  satisfying  −1. The frequent appearance of  in  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis|  can be related to the behavior of the  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function|  of a complex variable, described by  |Eulers_formula|Eulers_Formula|      : e     + i        where  |the_constant_|E|  is the base of the  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm| . This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of  and points on the  |unit_circle|Unit_Circle|  centered at the origin of the complex plane. Setting   in Eulers formula results in  |Eulers_identity|Eulers_Identity| , celebrated by mathematicians because it contains the five most important mathematical constants: Maor, Eli, E: The Story of a Number, Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 160,  .   : e + 1 0.     There are  different  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number|   satisfying , and these are called the -th  |roots_of_unity|Root_Of_Unity|  .  They are given by this formula:   : e   .                  The best-known approximations to  dating  |before_the_Common_Era|1St_Millennium_Bc|  were accurate to two decimal places; this was improved upon in  |Chinese_mathematics|Chinese_Mathematics|  in particular by the mid-first millennium, to an accuracy of seven decimal places.   After this, no further progress was made until the late medieval period.     Based on the measurements of the  |Great_Pyramid_of_Giza|Great_Pyramid_Of_Giza|   , some Egyptologists have claimed that the  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ians used an approximation of  as  from as early as the  |Old_Kingdom|Old_Kingdom| .

For a list of explanations for the shape that do not involve , see    The earliest written approximations of  are found in  |Babylon|Babylon|  and Egypt, both within one percent of the true value. In Babylon, a  |clay_tablet|Clay_Tablet|  dated 1900–1600  BC has a geometrical statement that, by implication, treats  as     3.125.  In Egypt, the  |Rhind_Papyrus|Rhind_Papyrus| , dated around 1650  BC but copied from a document dated to 1850  BC, has a formula for the area of a circle that treats  as  3.16.     Astronomical calculations in the  Shatapatha Brahmana  use a fractional approximation of   ≈  3.139 . Chaitanya, Krishna.  Indian Book Company . p. 133. Other Indian sources by about 150  BC treat  as   ≈  3.1622.           The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of  was a geometrical approach using polygons, devised around 250  BC by the Greek mathematician  |Archimedes|Archimedes| .  This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1,000 years, and as a result  is sometimes referred to as Archimedes constant .  Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of  by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle, and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96-sided regular polygon. By calculating the perimeters of these polygons, he proved that  .
