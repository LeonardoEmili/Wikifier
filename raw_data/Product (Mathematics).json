Another approach to multiplication that applies also to real numbers is continuously stretching the number line from , so that the  is stretched to the one factor, and looking up the product, where the other factor is stretched to.       Integers allow positive and negative numbers. Their product is determined by the product of their positive amounts, combined with the sign derived from the following rule, which is a necessary consequence of demanding distributivity of the multiplication over addition, but is no additional rule.     :       & - & +       - & + & -     + & - & +               In words, we have:   Minus times Minus gives Plus   Minus times Plus gives Minus   Plus times Minus gives Minus   Plus times Plus gives Plus       Two fractions can be multiplied by multiplying their numerators and denominators:     :               For a rigorous definition of the product of two real numbers see ": null
