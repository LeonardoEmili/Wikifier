                       The North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is defined as the point in the  |Northern_Hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere|  where the  |Earths_axis_of_rotation|Earths_Rotation|  meets its surface.     The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the  |South_Pole|South_Pole| . It defines geodetic  |latitude|Latitude|  90° North, as well as the direction of  |true_north|True_North| . At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of  |longitude|Longitude|  converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere. The nearest land is usually said to be  |Kaffeklubben_Island|Kaffeklubben_Island| , off the northern coast of  |Greenland|Greenland|  about  away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is  |Alert|Alert_Nunavut|  in the  |Qikiqtaaluk_Region|Qikiqtaaluk_Region| , Nunavut, Canada, which is located  from the Pole.     While the South Pole lies on a continental  |land_mass|Antarctica| , the North Pole is located in the middle of the  |Arctic_Ocean|Arctic_Ocean|  amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting  |sea_ice|Sea_Ice| . The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at  by the Russian  |Mir_submersible|Mir|  in  |2007|Arktika_2007|  , Reuters, 2 August 2007 and at  by  |USS_Nautilus|Uss_Nautilus|  in 1958.   This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole . However, the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , and later  |Russia|Russia| , constructed a number of  |manned_drifting_stations|Drifting_Ice_Station|  on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base,  |Barneo|Barneo| , close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of  |Arctic_ice_shrinkage|Climate_Change_In_The_Arctic| , with timescales varying from 2016 Black, Richard . . BBC Ljunggren, David . . Reuters to the late 21st century or later.     Attempts to reach the North Pole began in the late 19th century, with the record for  |Farthest_North|Farthest_North|  being surpassed on numerous occasions. The first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole was that of the airship  Norge , which overflew the area in 1926 with 16 men on board, including expedition leader  |Roald_Amundsen|Roald_Amundsen| . Three prior expeditions – led by  |Frederick_Cook|Frederick_Cook|  ,  |Robert_Peary|Robert_Peary|  and  |Richard_E_Byrd|Richard_E_Byrd|  – were once also accepted as having reached the Pole. However, in each case later analysis of expedition data has cast doubt upon the accuracy of their claims.          The Earths axis of rotation  – and hence the position of the North Pole  – was commonly believed to be fixed until, in the 18th century, the mathematician  |Leonhard_Euler|Leonhard_Euler|  predicted that the axis might wobble slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent variation of latitude, as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earths surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the  |Chandler_wobble|Chandler_Wobble|  after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earths axis and the Earths surface, at any given moment, is called the instantaneous pole , but because of the wobble this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole when metre-scale precision is required.     It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates  to fixed landforms. Of course, given  |plate_tectonics|Plate_Tectonics|  and  |isostasy|Isostasy| , there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the  |International_Earth_Rotation_and_Reference_Systems_Service|International_Earth_Rotation_And_Reference_Systems_Service|  and the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  have defined a framework called the  |International_Terrestrial_Reference_System|International_Terrestrial_Reference_System| .                    As early as the 16th century, many prominent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the  |Polynya|Polynya|  or  |Open_Polar_Sea|Open_Polar_Sea| .  It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.     One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer  |William_Edward_Parry|William_Parry| , who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871 the  |Polaris_expedition|Polaris_Expedition| , a US attempt on the Pole led by  |Charles_Francis_Hall|Charles_Francis_Hall| , ended in disaster. Another British  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  attempt on the pole, part of the  |British_Arctic_Expedition|British_Arctic_Expedition| , by Commander  |Albert_H_Markham|Albert_Hastings_Markham|  reached a then-record 83°2026 North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by  |US_naval|United_States_Navy|  officer  |George_W_DeLong|George_W_Delong|  ended tragically when their ship, the  |USS_Jeanette|Uss_Jeannette| , was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost.        In April 1895 the Norwegian explorers  |Fridtjof_Nansen|Fridtjof_Nansen|  and  |Hjalmar_Johansen|Hjalmar_Johansen|  struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansens icebound ship  Fram . The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching  |Franz_Josef_Land|Franz_Josef_Land| .     In 1897 Swedish engineer  |Salomon_August_Andrée|Salomon_August_Andrée|  and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon Örnen , but came down  north of  |Kvitøya|Kvitøya| , the northeasternmost part of the  |Svalbard|Svalbard|  archipelago. They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months later. In 1930 the remains of  |this_expedition|S_A_Andrées_Arctic_Balloon_Expedition_Of_1897|  were found by the Norwegian  |Bratvaag_Expedition|Bratvaag_Expedition| .     The Italian explorer  |Luigi_Amedeo_Duke_of_the_Abruzzi|Prince_Luigi_Amedeo_Duke_Of_The_Abruzzi|  and Captain  |Umberto_Cagni|Umberto_Cagni|  of the  |Italian_Royal_Navy|Regia_Marina|  sailed the converted whaler  Stella Polare  from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900 Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansens result of 1895 by . Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August the Stella Polare left  |Rudolf_Island|Rudolf_Island|  heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.          The US explorer  |Frederick_Cook|Frederick_Cook|  claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two  |Inuit|Inuit|  men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted. Robert Bryce Cook and Peary: the Polar Controversy Resolved Stackpole 1997; Henderson, B. True North W W Norton & Company      The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer  |Robert_Peary|Robert_Peary| , who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by  |Matthew_Henson|Matthew_Henson|  and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Pearys claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.     The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Pearys account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line  – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing  – is contradicted by Hensons account of tortuous detours to avoid  |pressure_ridges|Pressure_Ridge|  and  |open_leads|Lead| .     The British explorer  |Wally_Herbert|Wally_Herbert| , initially a supporter of Peary, researched Pearys records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorers navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole.  Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer  |Tom_Avery|Tom_Avery|  and four companions recreated the outward portion of Pearys journey with replica wooden sleds and  |Canadian_Eskimo_Dog|Canadian_Eskimo_Dog|  teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours  – nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Averys fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from  |Cape_Columbia|Cape_Columbia| . Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole. .

The  |twilight|Twilight|  period which occurs before sunrise and after sunset has three different definitions :   a  |civil_twilight|Twilightcivil_Twilight|  period of about two weeks ;   a  |nautical_twilight|Twilightnautical_Twilight|  period of about five weeks ;   an  |astronomical_twilight|Twilightastronomical_Twilight|  period of about seven weeks.     These effects are caused by a combination of the Earths  |axial_tilt|Axial_Tilt|  and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earths axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earths orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year . At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.       In most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky . This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as  |Greenwich_Mean_Time|Greenwich_Mean_Time| , or the time zone of the country from which they departed.                The North Pole is substantially warmer than the  |South_Pole|South_Pole|  because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean , rather than at altitude on a continental land mass. Despite being an ice cap, it shares some characteristics with a tundra climate  due to the July and August temperatures peaking just above freezing.     Winter temperatures at the northernmost weather station in Greenland can range from about , averaging around , with the North Pole being slightly colder. However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach  for a time at a  |World_Meteorological_Organization|World_Meteorological_Organization|  buoy, located at 87.45°N, on December 30, 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between  during the storm.  Summer temperatures average around the freezing point . The highest temperature yet recorded is , much warmer than the South Poles record high of only . , US Antarctic Program A similar spike in temperatures occurred on November 15, 2016 when temperatures hit freezing.  Yet again, February 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the worlds northernmost weather station in Greenland, reached  and spent 24 straight hours above freezing.  Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of . This same temperature of  was also recorded at the  |Hollywood_Burbank_Airport|Hollywood_Burbank_Airport|  in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles|  at the very same time.      The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around  thick, , National Geographic News although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate.  Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years. , The Daily Telegraph . It is likely that  |global_warming|Global_Warming|  has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic.  Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer. Jonathan Amos . , BBC. This may have significant commercial implications; see Territorial Claims, below.     The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation.            |Polar_bears|Polar_Bear|  are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82° North owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just  from the Pole. , WWF, January 2007  , Greenpeace Project Thin Ice . The  |ringed_seal|Ringed_Seal|  has also been seen at the Pole, and  |Arctic_fox|Arctic_Fox| es have been observed less than  away at 89°40′  N. Halkka, Antti . . suomenluonto.fi Tannerfeldt, Magnus. . zoologi.su.se     Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the  |snow_bunting|Snow_Bunting| ,  |northern_fulmar|Northern_Fulmar|  and  |black_legged_kittiwake|Black_Legged_Kittiwake| , though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions.      Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number. A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there. However, it was later reported that a  |sea_anemone|Sea_Anemone|  had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified  |shrimps|Shrimp|  and  |amphipods|Amphipoda| . , Observer, 2 August 2009               Currently, under  |international_law|International_Law| , no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russian Federation, Canada, Norway, Denmark , and the United States, are limited to a   |exclusive_economic_zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|  off their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the  |International_Seabed_Authority|International_Seabed_Authority| .     Upon ratification of the  |United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea|United_Nations_Convention_On_The_Law_Of_The_Sea| , a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. If validated, such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone.  Norway , Russia , Canada and Denmark have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation.  , by Shamil Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek,  |Oxford_Institute_for_Energy_Studies|Oxford_Institute_For_Energy_Studies| , August 2007     In 1907 Canada invoked a sector principle to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole. This claim has not been relinquished, but was not consistently pressed until 2013.         In some childrens  |Western_cultures|Western_Culture| , the geographic North Pole is described as the location of  |Santa_Claus_workshop_and_residence|Santas_Workshop| ,   although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole.  |Canada_Post|Canada_Post|  has assigned postal code  |H0H_0H0|H0H_0H0|  to the North Pole .      This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of  |Hyperborea|Hyperborea|  that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings.      As  |Henry_Corbin|Henry_Corbin|  has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of  |Sufism|Sufism|  and Iranian mysticism. The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north.      Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient  |Iranian|Culture_Of_Iran|  tradition called  |Mount_Qaf|Mount_Qaf|  , the farthest point of the earth .   According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of  |Muslim_cosmology|Cosmology_In_Medieval_Islam|  is a version of  |Rupes_Nigra|Rupes_Nigra| , a mountain whose ascent, like  |Dantes|Dante_Alighieri|  climbing of the  |Mountain_of_Purgatory|Purgatorio| , represents the pilgrims progress through spiritual states.  In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its palaces ablaze with immaterial matter.
