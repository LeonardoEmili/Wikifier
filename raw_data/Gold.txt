                  Gold is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Au  and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  79, making it one of the higher  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  elements that occur naturally. In its purest form, it is a  |bright|Brightness| , slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft,  |malleable|Malleable| , and  |ductile|Ductile| |metal|Metal| . Chemically, gold is a  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal|  and a  |group_11_element|Group_11_Element| . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under  |standard_conditions|Standard_Conditions_For_Temperature_And_Pressure| . Gold often occurs in free elemental form, as  |nuggets|Gold_Nugget|  or grains, in  |rocks|Rock| , in  |veins|Vein| , and in  |alluvial_deposits|Alluvial_Deposit| . It occurs in a  |solid_solution|Solid_Solution|  series with the native element  |silver|Silver|   and also naturally  |alloy|Alloy| ed with  |copper|Copper|  and  |palladium|Palladium| . Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with  |tellurium|Tellurium|  .     Gold is resistant to most  |acids|Acid| , though it does dissolve in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| , a mixture of  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  and  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| , which forms a soluble  |tetrachloroaurate|Chloroauric_Acid| |anion|Anion| . Gold is insoluble in  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| , which dissolves silver and  |base_metals|Base_Metal| , a property that has long been used to  |refine|Refining|  gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term  acid test . Gold also dissolves in  |alkaline|Alkaline|  solutions of  |cyanide|Cyanide| , which are used in  |mining|Gold_Cyanidation|  and  |electroplating|Electroplating| . Gold dissolves in  |mercury|Mercury| , forming  |amalgam|Amalgam|  alloys, but this is not a  |chemical_reaction|Chemical_Reaction| .     A relatively rare element,   gold is a  |precious_metal|Precious_Metal|  that has been used for  |coin|Coin| age,  |jewelry|Jewelry| , and other  |arts|Work_Of_Art|  throughout  |recorded_history|Recorded_History| . In the past, a  |gold_standard|Gold_Standard|  was often implemented as a  |monetary_policy|Monetary_Policy| , but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a  |fiat_currency|Fiat_Currency|  system after  |1971|Nixon_Shock| .     A total of 186,700  |tonnes|Tonne|  of gold exists above ground, .  The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in  |investments|Investment| , and 10% in  |industry|Industry| .  Golds high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant  |electrical_connectors|Electrical_Connector|  in all types of computerized devices . Gold is also used in  |infrared|Infrared|  shielding,  |colored-glass|Colored_Glass|  production,  |gold_leaf|Gold_Leaf| ing, and  |tooth_restoration|Restorative_Dentistry| . Certain  |gold_salts|Gold_Salts|  are still used as  |anti-inflammatories|Anti-Inflammatories|  in medicine. , the  |worlds_largest|List_Of_Countries_By_Gold_Production|  gold producer by far was  |China|Gold_Mining_In_China|  with 440 tonnes per year.             Gold is the most  |malleable|Malleable|  of all metals. It can be drawn into a monoatomic wire, and then stretched about twice before it breaks.  Such nanowires distort via formation, reorientation and migration of  |dislocations|Dislocation|  and  |crystal_twins|Crystal_Twinning|  without noticeable hardening.  A single gram of gold can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter, and an  |avoirdupois_ounce|Avoirdupois_Ounce|  into 300 square feet. Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become semi-transparent. The transmitted light appears greenish blue, because gold strongly reflects yellow and red.  Such semi-transparent sheets also strongly reflect  |infrared_light|Infrared_Radiation| , making them useful as infrared shields in visors of heat-resistant suits, and in sun-visors for  |spacesuits|Spacesuit| .  Gold is a good  |conductor_of_heat|Conduction|  and  |electricity|Electrical_Conductor| .     Gold has a density of 19.3  g/cm 3 , almost identical to that of  |tungsten|Tungsten|  at 19.25  g/cm 3 ; as such, tungsten has been used in  |counterfeiting|Counterfeiting|  of  |gold_bars|Gold_Bar| , such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold,  Willie, Jim  . Kitco   or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods. , ABC Bullion, Thursday, 22 March 2012 By comparison, the density of  |lead|Lead|  is 11.34  g/cm 3 , and that of the densest element,  |osmium|Osmium| , is .              Whereas most metals are gray or silvery white, gold is slightly reddish-yellow.  This color is determined by the frequency of  |plasma_oscillations|Plasma_Oscillation|  among the metals valence electrons, in the ultraviolet range for most metals but in the visible range for gold due to  |relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Quantum_Chemistry|  affecting the  |orbitals|Atomic_Orbital|  around gold atoms.   Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic  |caesium|Caesium| .     Common colored gold alloys include the distinctive eighteen-karat  |rose_gold|Rose_Gold|  created by the addition of copper. Alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys. Fourteen-karat gold-copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain  |bronze|Bronze|  alloys, and both may be used to produce police and other  |badges|Badge| . White gold alloys can be made with  |palladium|Palladium|  or  |nickel|Nickel| . Fourteen- and eighteen-karat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish-yellow and are referred to as  |green_gold|Green_Gold| . Blue gold can be made by alloying with  |iron|Iron| , and purple gold can be made by alloying with  |aluminium|Aluminium| . Less commonly, addition of  |manganese|Manganese| ,  |aluminium|Aluminium| ,  |indium|Indium|  and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications.      |Colloidal_gold|Colloidal_Gold| , used by electron-microscopists, is red if the particles are small; larger particles of colloidal gold are blue.           Gold has only one stable  |isotope|Isotope| , , which is also its only naturally occurring isotope, so gold is both a  |mononuclidic|Mononuclidic_Element|  and  |monoisotopic_element|Monoisotopic_Element| . Thirty-six  |radioisotopes|Radioisotopes|  have been synthesized, ranging in  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass|  from 169 to 205. The most stable of these is  with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 186.1 days. The least stable is , which decays by  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission|  with a half-life of 30 µs. Most of golds radioisotopes with atomic masses below 197 decay by some combination of  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| ,  |α_decay|Alpha_Decay| , and  |β_+_decay|Beta_Decayβ+_Decay| . The exceptions are , which decays by electron capture, and , which decays most often by electron capture with a minor  |β_−_decay|Beta_Decayβ−_Decay|  path .  All of golds radioisotopes with atomic masses above 197 decay by β − decay.      At least 32  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  have also been characterized, ranging in atomic mass from 170 to 200. Within that range, only , , , , and  do not have isomers. Golds most stable isomer is  with a half-life of 2.27 days. Golds least stable isomer is  with a half-life of only 7  ns.  has three decay paths: β + decay,  |isomeric_transition|Isomeric_Transition| , and alpha decay. No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths.       The production of gold from a more common element, such as  |lead|Lead| , has long been a subject of human inquiry, and the ancient and medieval discipline of  |alchemy|Alchemy|  often focused on it; however, the transmutation of the chemical elements did not become possible until the understanding of nuclear physics in the 20th century. The first synthesis of gold was conducted by Japanese physicist  |Hantaro_Nagaoka|Hantaro_Nagaoka| , who synthesized gold from  |mercury|Mercury|  in 1924 by neutron bombardment.  An American team, working without knowledge of Nagaokas prior study, conducted the same experiment in 1941, achieving the same result and showing that the  |isotopes_of_gold|Isotopes_Of_Gold|  produced by it were all  |radioactive|Radioactive| .      Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by  |irradiation|Irradiation|  either of  |platinum|Platinum|  or mercury.     Only the mercury isotope 196 Hg, which occurs with a frequency of 0.15% in natural mercury, can be converted to gold by  |neutron_capture|Neutron_Capture| , and following  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture| -decay into 197 Au with  |slow_neutrons|Slow_Neutron| . Other mercury isotopes are converted when irradiated with slow neutrons into one another, or formed mercury isotopes which  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  into  |thallium|Thallium| .     Using  |fast_neutrons|Fast_Neutron| , the mercury isotope 198 Hg, which composes 9.97% of natural mercury, can be converted by splitting off a neutron and becoming 197 Hg, which then disintegrates to stable gold. This reaction, however, possesses a smaller activation cross-section and is feasible only with un-moderated reactors.     It is also possible to eject several neutrons with very high energy into the other mercury isotopes in order to form 197 Hg. However, such high-energy neutrons can be produced only by  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator| .             Although gold is the most noble of the  |noble_metals|Noble_Metal| ,   it still forms many diverse compounds. The  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au and Au dominate its chemistry. Au, referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft  |ligands|Ligand|  such as  |thioethers|Thioether| ,  |thiolates|Thiolate| , and tertiary  |phosphines|Phosphine| . Au compounds are typically linear. A good example is  |Au_2_−|Gold_Cyanidation| , which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining. The binary  |gold_halides|Gold_Halide| , such as  |AuCl|Gold_Chloride| , form zigzag polymeric chains, again featuring linear coordination at Au. Most drugs based on gold are Au derivatives.      Au is a common oxidation state, and is illustrated by  |gold_chloride|Gold_Chloride| , Au 2 Cl 6 . The gold atom centers in Au complexes, like other d 8 compounds, are typically  |square_planar|Square_Planar| , with  |chemical_bonds|Chemical_Bond|  that have both  |covalent|Covalent|  and  |ion|Ion| ic character.     Gold does not react with oxygen at any temperature  and, up to 100  °C, is resistant to attack from ozone.      Some free  |halogens|Halogen|  react with gold.  Gold is strongly attacked by fluorine at dull-red heat  to form  |gold_fluoride|Gold_Fluoride| . Powdered gold reacts with chlorine at 180  °C to form  |AuCl_3|Gold_Chloride| .  Gold reacts with bromine at 140  °C to form  |gold_bromide|Gold_Bromide| , but reacts only very slowly with iodine to form  |the_monoiodide|Gold_Iodide| .     Gold does not react with sulfur directly,  but  |gold_sulfide|Gold_Sulfide|  can be made by passing  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  through a dilute solution of gold chloride or  |chlorauric_acid|Chlorauric_Acid| .     Gold readily dissolves in  |mercury|Mercury|  at room temperature to form an  |amalgam|Amalgam| , and forms  |alloys|Alloy|  with many other metals at higher temperatures. These alloys can be produced to modify the hardness and other metallurgical properties, to control  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  or to create exotic colors.     Gold is unaffected by most acids. It does not react with  |hydrofluoric|Hydrofluoric_Acid| ,  |hydrochloric|Hydrochloric_Acid| ,  |hydrobromic|Hydrobromic_Acid| ,  |hydriodic|Hydriodic_Acid| ,  |sulfuric|Sulfuric_Acid| , or  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| . It does react with  |selenic_acid|Selenic_Acid| , and is dissolved by  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| , a 1:3 mixture of  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  and  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| . Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to +3 ions, but only in minute amounts, typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. However, the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid, forming AuCl 4 − ions, or  |chloroauric_acid|Chloroauric_Acid| , thereby enabling further oxidation.     Gold is similarly unaffected by most bases. It does not react with  |aqueous|Aqueous_Solution| ,  |solid|Solid| , or  |molten|Molten| |sodium|Sodium_Hydroxide|  or  |potassium_hydroxide|Potassium_Hydroxide| . It does however, react with  |sodium|Sodium_Cyanide|  or  |potassium_cyanide|Potassium_Cyanide|  under alkaline conditions when  |oxygen|Oxygen|  is present to form soluble complexes.     Common  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  of gold include +1 and +3 . Gold ions in solution are readily  |reduced|Reduction|  and  |precipitated|Precipitation|  as metal by adding any other metal as the  |reducing_agent|Reducing_Agent| . The added metal is  |oxidized|Oxidation|  and dissolves, allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate.       Less common oxidation states of gold include −1, +2, and +5.     The −1 oxidation state occurs in aurides, compounds containing the Au −  |anion|Anion| .  |Caesium_auride|Caesium_Auride|  , for example, crystallizes in the  |caesium_chloride|Caesium_Chloride|  motif;  rubidium, potassium, and  |tetramethylammonium|Tetramethylammonium|  aurides are also known.  Gold has the highest  |electron_affinity|Electron_Affinity|  of any metal, at 222.8  kJ/mol, making Au − a stable species.      Gold compounds are usually  |diamagnetic|Diamagnetic|  with Au–Au bonds such as 2 Cl 2 . The evaporation of a solution of  in concentrated  produces red crystals of gold sulfate, Au 2 2 . Originally thought to be a mixed-valence compound, it has been shown to contain  cations, analogous to the better-known  |mercury|Mercury|  ion,  .   A gold complex, the  |tetraxenonogold|Tetraxenonogold|  cation, which contains  |xenon|Xenon|  as a ligand, occurs in 2 .       |Gold_pentafluoride|Gold_Pentafluoride| , along with its derivative anion, , and its  |difluorine_complex|Difluorine_Complex| ,  |gold_heptafluoride|Gold_Heptafluoride| , is the sole example of gold, the highest verified oxidation state.      Some gold compounds exhibit  aurophilic bonding , which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional Au–Au bond but shorter than  |van_der_Waals_bonding|Van_Der_Waals_Force| . The interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a  |hydrogen_bond|Hydrogen_Bond| .     Well-defined cluster compounds are numerous. In such cases, gold has a fractional oxidation state. A representative example is the octahedral species  6 2+ .  |Gold_chalcogenides|Gold_Chalcogenides| , such as gold sulfide, feature equal amounts of Au and Au.       Medicinal applications of gold and its complexes have a long history dating back thousands of years.  Several gold complexes have been applied to treat  |rheumatoid_arthritis|Rheumatoid_Arthritis| , the most frequently used being  |aurothiomalate|Aurothiomalate| ,  |aurothioglucose|Aurothioglucose| , and  |auranofin|Auranofin| . Both gold and gold compounds have been investigated as possible anti-cancer drugs. For gold complexes, reduction to gold under physiological conditions has to be considered. Stable complexes can be generated using different types of bi-, tri-, and tetradentate ligand systems, and their efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.           Gold is thought to have been produced in  |supernova_nucleosynthesis|Supernova_Nucleosynthesis| , and from the  |collision_of_neutron_stars|Neutron_Star_Merger| ,  and to have been present in the  |dust|Solar_Nebula|  from which the  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  formed.  Because the Earth was molten  |when_it_was_formed|History_Of_Earth| , almost all of the gold present in the  |early_Earth|Early_Earth|  probably sank into the  |planetary_core|Core| . Therefore, most of the gold that is in the Earths  |crust|Crust|  and  |mantle|Mantle|  is thought to have been delivered to Earth later, by  |asteroid_impacts|Asteroid_Impact|  during the  |Late_Heavy_Bombardment|Late_Heavy_Bombardment| , about 4 billion years ago.       In 2017, an international group of scientists, established that gold came to the Earths surface from the deepest regions of our planet,   |Earths_mantle|Mantle| , evidenced by their findings at  |Deseado_Massif|Deseado_Massif|  in the  |Argentinian_Patagonia|Argentinian_Patagonia| .       Traditionally, gold is thought to have formed by the  |r-process|R-Process|  in  |supernova_nucleosynthesis|Supernova_Nucleosynthesis| ,  but more recently it has been suggested that gold and other elements heavier than  |iron|Iron|  may also be produced in quantity by the r-process in the collision of  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star| .  In both cases, satellite spectrometers only indirectly detected the resulting gold: we have no spectroscopic evidence that elements have truly been produced, wrote author Stephan Rosswog.  However, in August 2017, the signatures of heavy elements, including gold, were observed by  |gravitational_wave|Gravitational_Wave|  detectors and other electromagnetic observatories in the  |GW170817|Gw170817| |neutron_star_merger|Neutron_Star_Merger|  event.  Current astrophysical models suggest that a single neutron star merger event generated between 3 and 13  |Earth_mass|Earth_Mass| es of gold.      The asteroid that formed  |Vredefort_crater|Vredefort_Crater|  2.020  billion years ago is often credited with seeding the  |Witwatersrand_basin|Witwatersrand_Basin|  in  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  with the richest gold deposits on earth.   . Cosmos Magazine . Retrieved on 12 September 2013.  However, the gold-bearing  |Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand|  rocks were laid down between 700 and 950  million years before the Vredefort impact. McCarthy, T., Rubridge, B. . The Story of Earth and Life. Struik Publishers, Cape Town. pp. 89–90, 102–107, 134–136.  Norman, N., Whitfield, G. Geological Journeys. Struik Publishers, Cape Town. pp. 38–49, 60–61.  These gold-bearing rocks had furthermore been covered by a thick layer of Ventersdorp lavas and the  |Transvaal_Supergroup|Transvaal_Basin|  of rocks before the meteor struck. What the Vredefort impact achieved, however, was to distort the  |Witwatersrand_basin|Witwatersrand_Basin|  in such a way that the gold-bearing rocks were brought to the present  |erosion_surface|Erosion_Surface|  in  |Johannesburg|Johannesburg| , on the  |Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand| , just inside the rim of the original 300  km diameter crater caused by the meteor strike. The discovery of the deposit in 1886 launched the  |Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush|Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush| . Some 22% of all the gold that is ascertained to exist today on Earth has been extracted from these Witwatersrand rocks.       On Earth, gold is found in  |ores|Ore|  in rock formed from the  |Precambrian|Precambrian|  time onward. It most often occurs as a  |native_metal|Native_Metal| , typically in a metal  |solid_solution|Solid_Solution|  with silver . Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8–10%.  |Electrum|Electrum|  is elemental gold with more than 20% silver. Electrums color runs from golden-silvery to silvery, dependent upon the silver content. The more silver, the lower the  |specific_gravity|Specific_Gravity| .     Native gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock, often together with  |quartz|Quartz|  or  |sulfide_minerals|Sulfide_Mineral|  such as Fools Gold , which is a  |pyrite|Pyrite| .  These are called  |lode|Lode|  deposits. The metal in a native state is also found in the form of free flakes, grains or larger  |nuggets|Gold_Nugget|  that have been eroded from rocks and end up in  |alluvial|Alluvial|  deposits called  |placer_deposits|Placer_Deposit| . Such free gold is always richer at the surface of gold-bearing veins owing to the  |oxidation|Oxidation|  of accompanying minerals followed by weathering, and washing of the dust into streams and rivers, where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets.     Gold sometimes occurs combined with  |tellurium|Tellurium|  as the  |minerals|Mineral| |calaverite|Calaverite| ,  |krennerite|Krennerite| ,  |nagyagite|Nagyagite| ,  |petzite|Petzite|  and  |sylvanite|Sylvanite|  , and as the rare bismuthide maldonite and antimonide  |aurostibite|Aurostibite|  . Gold also occurs in rare alloys with  |copper|Copper| ,  |lead|Lead| , and  |mercury|Mercury| |auricupride|Auricupride|  , novodneprite and weishanite .     Recent research suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits, transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits.  This is doctoral research undertaken by Frank Reith at the Australian National University, published 2004.     Another recent study has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, depositing gold. When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a  |fault|Fault| . Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs. About 6 miles below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide, silica, and gold. During an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider. The water inside the void instantly vaporizes, flashing to steam and forcing silica, which forms the mineral quartz, and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces.        The worlds  |oceans|Ocean|  contain gold. Measured concentrations of gold in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific are 50–150  |femtomol|Femtomolar| /L or 10–30 parts per  |quadrillion|Quadrillion|  . In general, gold concentrations for south Atlantic and central Pacific samples are the same but less certain. Mediterranean deep waters contain slightly higher concentrations of gold attributed to wind-blown dust and/or rivers. At 10 parts per quadrillion the Earths  |oceans|Oceans|  would hold 15,000 tonnes of gold.  These figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to 1988, indicating contamination problems with the earlier data.     A number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from  |sea_water|Sea_Water| , but they were either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception. Prescott Jernegan ran a gold-from-seawater swindle in the  |United_States|United_States|  in the 1890s, as did an English fraudster in the early 1900s. Plazak, Dan A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top   |Fritz_Haber|Fritz_Haber|  did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay  |Germanys|Germany|  reparations following  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .  Based on the published values of 2 to 64 ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible. After analysis of 4,000 water samples yielding an average of 0.004 ppb it became clear that extraction would not be possible and he stopped the project.                  The earliest recorded metal employed by humans appears to be gold, which can be found  |free|Native_Metal|  or  |native|Native_Metal|  . Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves used during the late  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  period, c. 40,000 BC.  Gold artifacts made their first appearance at the very beginning of the pre-dynastic period in Egypt, at the end of the fifth millennium BC and the start of the fourth, and smelting was developed during the course of the 4th millennium; gold artifacts appear in the archeology of Lower Mesopotamia during the early 4th millennium. Sutherland, C.H.V, Gold p 27 ff. Gold artifacts in the  |Balkans|Balkans|  appear from the 4th millennium BC, such as those found in the  |Varna_Necropolis|Varna_Necropolis|  near Lake Varna in  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| , thought by one source to be the earliest well-dated find of gold artifacts.  As of 1990, gold artifacts found at the  |Nahal_Qana|Nahal_Qana|  cave cemetery of the  |4th_millennium_BC|4Th_Millennium_Bc|  in West Bank were the earliest from the Levant.  Gold artifacts such as the  |golden_hats|Golden_Hats|  and the  |Nebra_disk|Nebra_Disk|  appeared in Central Europe from the 2nd millennium BC  |Bronze_Age|European_Bronze_Age| .     The oldest known map of a gold mine was drawn in the 19th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt , whereas the first written reference to gold was recorded in the 12th Dynasty around 1900 BC. Pohl, Walter L. Economic Geology Principles and Practice. Wiley. p. 208. .   |Egyptian_hieroglyphs|Egyptian_Hieroglyph|  from as early as 2600 BC describe gold, which King  |Tushratta|Tushratta|  of the  |Mitanni|Mitanni|  claimed was more plentiful than dirt in Egypt.  Egypt and especially  |Nubia|Nubia|  had the resources to make them major gold-producing areas for much of history. One of the earliest known maps, known as the  |Turin_Papyrus_Map|Turin_Papyrus_Map| , shows the plan of a  |gold_mine|Gold_Mine|  in Nubia together with indications of the local  |geology|Geology| . The primitive working methods are described by both  |Strabo|Strabo|  and  |Diodorus_Siculus|Diodorus_Siculus| , and included  |fire-setting|Fire-Setting| . Large mines were also present across the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  in what is now  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| .        Gold is mentioned in the  |Amarna_letters|Amarna_Letters|  numbered  |19|Amarna_Letter_Ea_19| |Moran,_William_L.|William_L._Moran| , 1987, 1992.

The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson.      Gold is mentioned frequently in the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament| , starting with  |Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis|  2:11 , the story of the  |golden_calf|Golden_Calf| , and many parts of the temple including the  |Menorah|Menorah|  and the golden altar. In the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| , it is included with the gifts of the  |magi|Magi|  in the first chapters of Matthew. The  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation|  21:21 describes the city of  |New_Jerusalem|New_Jerusalem|  as having streets made of pure gold, clear as crystal . Exploitation of gold in the south-east corner of the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  is said to date from the time of  |Midas|Midas| , and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the worlds earliest coinage in  |Lydia|Lydia|  around 610 BC. The legend of the  |golden_fleece|Golden_Fleece|  dating from eighth century BCE may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from  |placer_deposits|Placer_Deposit|  in the ancient world. From the 6th or 5th century BC, the  |Chu|Chu|  circulated the  |Ying_Yuan|Ying_Yuan| , one kind of square gold coin.     In  |Roman_metallurgy|Roman_Metallurgy| , new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing  |hydraulic_mining|Hydraulic_Mining|  methods, especially in  |Hispania|Hispania|  from 25 BC onwards and in  |Dacia|Dacia|  from 106 AD onwards. One of their largest mines was at  |Las_Medulas|Las_Medulas|  in  |León|León| , where seven long  |aqueducts|Aqueduct|  enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit. The mines at  |Roşia_Montană|Roşia_Montană|  in  |Transylvania|Transylvania|  were also very large, and until very recently, still mined by opencast methods. They also exploited smaller deposits in  |Britain|Roman_Britain| , such as placer and hard-rock deposits at  |Dolaucothi|Dolaucothi| . The various methods they used are well described by  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder|  in his  |encyclopedia|Encyclopedia|   Naturalis Historia  written towards the end of the first century AD.     During  |Mansa_Musas|Mansa_Musa| |hajj|Hajj|  to  |Mecca|Mecca|  in 1324, he passed through  |Cairo|Cairo|  in July 1324, and was reportedly accompanied by a  |camel_train|Camel_Train|  that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in Egypt for over a decade, causing high  |inflation|Inflation| . . Black History Pages A contemporary Arab historian remarked:             The European exploration of the Americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by  |Native_American|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  peoples, especially in  |Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica| ,  |Peru|Peru| ,  |Ecuador|Ecuador|  and  |Colombia|Colombia| . The  |Aztecs|Aztec|  regarded gold as the product of the gods, calling it literally god excrement , and after  |Moctezuma_II|Moctezuma_Ii|  was killed, most of this gold was shipped to Spain.  However, for the  |indigenous_peoples_of_North_America|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_North_America|  gold was considered useless and they saw much greater value in other  |minerals|Minerals|  which were directly related to their utility, such as  |obsidian|Obsidian| ,  |flint|Flint| , and  |slate|Slate| . .

The concept of El Dorado underwent several transformations, and eventually accounts of the previous myth were also combined with those of a legendary lost city. El Dorado, was the term used by the Spanish Empire to describe a mythical tribal chief of the Muisca native people in  |Colombia|Colombia| , who, as an initiation rite, covered himself with gold dust and submerged in  |Lake_Guatavita|Lake_Guatavita| . The legends surrounding El Dorado changed over time, as it went from being a man, to a city, to a kingdom, and then finally to an empire.     Gold played a role in western culture, as a cause for desire and of corruption, as told in childrens  |fables|Fable|  such as  |Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstiltskin| —where Rumpelstiltskin turns hay into gold for the peasants daughter in return for her child when she becomes a princess—and the stealing of the hen that lays golden eggs in  |Jack_and_the_Beanstalk|Jack_And_The_Beanstalk| .     The top prize at the  |Olympic_Games|Olympic_Games|  and many other sports competitions is the  |gold_medal|Gold_Medal| .     75% of the presently accounted for gold has been extracted since 1910. It has been estimated that the currently known amount of gold internationally would form a single cube 20  m on a side .      One main goal of the  |alchemists|Alchemy|  was to produce gold from other substances, such as  |lead|Lead|   — presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the  |philosophers_stone|Philosophers_Stone| . Although they never succeeded in this attempt, the alchemists did promote an interest in systematically finding out what can be done with substances, and this laid the foundation for todays  |chemistry|Chemistry| . Their symbol for gold was the  |circle_with_a_point_at_its_center|Circled_Dot|  , which was also the  |astrological|Astrology|  symbol and the ancient  |Chinese_character|Chinese_Character|  for the  |Sun|Sun| .

Christie, A and Brathwaite, R. , Institute of geological and Nuclear sciences Ltd  – Retrieved 7 June 2012          Outside chemistry, gold is mentioned in a variety of expressions, most often associated with intrinsic worth. Great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold, in the form of  |gold_medals|Gold_Medal| , gold  |trophies|Trophy|  and other decorations. Winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal. Many awards such as the  |Nobel_Prize|Nobel_Prize|  are made from gold as well. Other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are  |gold_plated|Gold_Plated|  .      |Aristotle|Aristotle|  in his  |ethics|Aristotelian_Ethics|  used gold symbolism when referring to what is now known as the  |golden_mean|Golden_Mean| . Similarly, gold is associated with perfect or divine principles, such as in the case of the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio|  and the  |golden_rule|Golden_Rule| .     Gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition. The fiftieth  |wedding_anniversary|Wedding_Anniversary|  is golden. A persons most valued or most successful latter years are sometimes considered golden years . The height of a civilization is referred to as a  |golden_age|Golden_Age| .     In some forms of  |Christianity|Christianity|  and  |Judaism|Judaism| , gold has been associated both with  |holiness|Sacred|  and  |evil|Evil| .

It is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before God and the perfection the marriage signifies. In  |Orthodox_Christian|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  wedding ceremonies, the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown during the ceremony, an amalgamation of symbolic rites.             The World Gold Council states that as of the end of 2017, there were 187,200 tonnes of stocks in existence above ground . This can be represented by a cube with an edge length of about 21 meters.  At $1,349 per  |troy_ounce|Troy_Ounce| , 187,200 metric tonnes of gold would have a value of $8.9 trillion. According to the  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey|  in 2016, about  of gold has been produced since the  |beginning_of_civilization|Civilizationhistory| , of which 85% remains in use.      In 2017, the  |worlds_largest|List_Of_Countries_By_Gold_Production|  gold producer by far was  |China|Gold_Mining_In_China|  with 440  |tonnes|Metric_Ton| . The second-largest producer,  |Australia|List_Of_Gold_Mines_In_Australia| , mined 300 tonnes in the same year, followed by  |Russia|Russia|  with 255 tonnes.             Since the 1880s, South Africa has been the source of a large proportion of the worlds gold supply, and about 22% of the gold presently accounted is from  |South_Africa|South_Africa| . Production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world supply, about 1,480 tonnes. In 2007  |China|China|  overtook South Africa as the worlds largest gold producer, the first time since 1905 that South Africa has not been the largest.      ,  |China|Gold_Mining_In_China|  was the worlds leading gold-mining country, followed in order by Australia, Russia, the United States, Canada, and Peru. South Africa, which had dominated world gold production for most of the 20th century, had declined to sixth place.  Other major producers are the  |Ghana|Ghana| ,  |Burkina_Faso|Burkina_Faso| ,  |Mali|Mali| , Indonesia and Uzbekistan.        In South America, the controversial project  |Pascua_Lama|Pascua_Lama|  aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of  |Atacama_Desert|Atacama_Desert| , at the border between  |Chile|Chile|  and  |Argentina|Argentina| .     Today about one-quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining.      The city of  |Johannesburg|Johannesburg|  located in South Africa was founded as a result of the  |Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush|Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush|  which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest natural gold deposits in recorded history. The gold fields are confined to the northern and north-western edges of the  |Witwatersrand_basin|Witwatersrand_Basin| , which is a 5–7  km thick layer of  |archean|Archean|  rocks located, in most places, deep under the  |Free_State|Free_State| ,  |Gauteng|Gauteng|  and surrounding provinces. Truswell, J.F. . The Geological Evolution of South Africa. pp. 21–28. Purnell, Cape Town.  These Witwatersrand rocks are exposed at the surface on the  |Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand| , in and around Johannesburg, but also in isolated patches to the south-east and south-west of Johannesburg, as well as in an arc around the  |Vredefort_Dome|Vredefort_Crater|  which lies close to the center of the Witwatersrand basin. From these surface exposures the basin  |dips|Strike_And_Dip|  extensively, requiring some of the mining to occur at depths of nearly 4000  m, making them, especially the  |Savuka|Miningrecords|  and  |TauTona|Tautona|  mines to the south-west of Johannesburg, the deepest mines on earth. The gold is found only in six areas where  |archean|Archean|  rivers from the north and north-west formed extensive pebbly  |Braided_river|Braided_River|  deltas before draining into the Witwatersrand sea where the rest of the Witwatersrand sediments were deposited.     The  |Second_Boer_War|Second_Boer_War|  of 1899–1901 between the  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  and the  |Afrikaner|Afrikaner| |Boers|Boer|  was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in South Africa.     During the 19th century,  |gold_rush|Gold_Rush| es occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered. The first documented discovery of gold in the United States was at the  |Reed_Gold_Mine|Reed_Gold_Mine|  near Georgeville, North Carolina in 1803.  The first major gold strike in the United States occurred in a small north Georgia town called  |Dahlonega|Dahlonega,_Georgia| .  Further gold rushes occurred in  |California|California_Gold_Rush| ,  |Colorado|Pikes_Peak_Gold_Rush| , the  |Black_Hills|Black_Hills_Gold_Rush| ,  |Otago|Central_Otago_Gold_Rush|  in New Zealand,  |Australia|Australian_Gold_Rushes| ,  |Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush|  in South Africa, and the  |Klondike|Klondike_Gold_Rush|  in Canada.              |Gold_extraction|Gold_Extraction|  is most economical in large, easily mined deposits. Ore grades as little as 0.5  parts per million can be economical. Typical ore grades in  |open-pit|Open-Pit_Mining|  mines are 1–5  ppm; ore grades in underground or  |hard_rock|Underground_Mining|  mines are usually at least 3  ppm. Because ore grades of 30  ppm are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, in most gold mines the gold is invisible.     The average gold mining and extraction costs were about $317 per troy ounce in 2007, but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality; global mine production amounted to 2,471.1 tonnes.      After initial production, gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the  |Wohlwill_process|Wohlwill_Process|  which is based on  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  or by the  |Miller_process|Miller_Process| , that is chlorination in the melt. The Wohlwill process results in higher purity, but is more complex and is only applied in small-scale installations.   Other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as  |cupellation|Cupellation| , or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia.        The consumption of gold produced in the world is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry.      According to  |World_Gold_Council|World_Gold_Council| , China is the worlds largest single consumer of gold in 2013 and toppled India for the first time with Chinese consumption increasing by 32 percent in a year, while that of India only rose by 13 percent and world consumption rose by 21 percent. Unlike India where gold is mainly used for jewelry, China uses gold for manufacturing and retail.           Gold production is associated with contribution to hazardous pollution.  . Scribd.com .

Thirty tons of used ore is dumped as waste for producing one troy ounce of gold. , New York Times, 24 October 2005 Gold ore dumps are the source of many heavy elements such as cadmium, lead, zinc, copper,  |arsenic|Arsenic| ,  |selenium|Selenium|  and mercury. When sulfide-bearing minerals in these ore dumps are exposed to air and water, the sulfide transforms into  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  which in turn dissolves these heavy metals facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water. This process is called  |acid_mine_drainage|Acid_Mine_Drainage| . These gold ore dumps are long term, highly hazardous wastes second only to  |nuclear_waste|Nuclear_Waste|  dumps.     It was once common to use mercury to recover gold from ore, but today the use of mercury is largely limited to small-scale individual miners.  Minute quantities of mercury compounds can reach water bodies, causing heavy metal contamination. Mercury can then enter into the human food chain in the form of  |methylmercury|Methylmercury| .  |Mercury_poisoning|Mercury_Poisoning|  in humans causes incurable brain function damage and severe retardation.     Gold extraction is also a highly energy intensive industry, extracting ore from deep mines and grinding the large quantity of ore for further chemical extraction requires nearly 25  |kWh|Kilowatt-Hour|  of electricity per gram of gold produced.           Gold has been  |widely_used|History_Of_Money|  throughout the world as  |money|Money| ,  for efficient indirect exchange , and to store wealth in  |hoards|Hoard| . For exchange purposes,  |mints|Mint|  produce standardized  |gold_bullion|Bullion| |coins|Coins| ,  |bars|Gold_Bar|  and  |other_units|Good_Delivery|  of fixed weight and purity.     The first known coins containing gold were struck in Lydia, Asia Minor, around 600 BC.  The  talent  coin of gold in use during the periods of Grecian history both before and during the time of the life of Homer weighed between 8.42 and 8.75  grams.  From an earlier preference in using silver, European economies re-established the minting of gold as coinage during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.       |Bills|Real_Bills_Doctrine|  and  |gold_certificates|Gold_Certificates|  added to the circulating stock of  |gold_standard|Gold_Standard|  money in most 19th century industrial economies.   In preparation for  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  the warring nations moved to fractional gold standards, inflating their currencies to finance the war effort.   Post-war, the victorious countries, most notably Britain, gradually restored gold-convertibility, but international flows of gold via bills of exchange remained embargoed; international shipments were made exclusively for bilateral trades or to pay war reparations.     After  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  gold was replaced by a system of nominally  |convertible_currencies|Convertible_Currency|  related by fixed exchange rates following the  |Bretton_Woods_system|Bretton_Woods_System| .  |Gold_standards|Gold_Standard|  and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments, led in 1971 by the United States refusal to redeem its dollars in gold.  |Fiat_currency|Fiat_Currency|  now fills most monetary roles.  |Switzerland|Switzerland|  was the last country to tie its currency to gold; it backed 40% of its value until the Swiss joined the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  in 1999.      Central banks continue to keep a portion of their liquid reserves as gold in some form, and metals exchanges such as the  |London_Bullion_Market_Association|London_Bullion_Market_Association|  still clear transactions denominated in gold, including future delivery contracts.   Today,  |gold_mining|Gold_Mining|  output is declining.    With the sharp growth of economies in the 20th century, and increasing foreign exchange, the worlds  |gold_reserves|Gold_Reserve|  and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold have been replaced by floating prices for gold and gold  |future_contract|Futures_Contract| .   Though the gold stock grows by only 1 or 2% per year, very little metal is irretrievably consumed. Inventory above ground would satisfy many decades of industrial and even artisan uses at current prices.     The gold proportion of alloys is measured by  |karat|Finenesskarat|  . Pure gold  is designated as 24 karat, abbreviated 24k. English gold coins intended for circulation from 1526 into the 1930s were typically a standard 22k alloy called  |crown_gold|Crown_Gold| ,  for hardness .      Although the prices of some  |platinum|Platinum|  group metals can be much higher, gold has long been considered the most desirable of  |precious_metals|Precious_Metal| , and its value has been used as the standard for many  |currencies|Currency| . Gold has been used as a symbol for purity, value, royalty, and particularly roles that combine these properties. Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by  |Thomas_More|Thomas_More|  in his treatise  Utopia . On that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware, and lavatory seats. When ambassadors from other countries arrive, dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges, the Utopians mistake them for menial servants, paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party.     The  |ISO_4217|Iso_4217|  currency code of gold is XAU.  Many holders of gold store it in form of  |bullion|Bullion|  coins or  |bars|Gold_Bar|  as a hedge against  |inflation|Inflation|  or other economic disruptions, though its efficacy as such has been questioned; historically, it has not proven itself reliable as a hedging instrument.  Modern  |bullion_coins|Bullion_Coin|  for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties; they are typically fine gold at 24k, although the  |American_Gold_Eagle|American_Gold_Eagle|  and the British  |gold_sovereign|Sovereign|  continue to be minted in 22k metal in historical tradition, and the South African  |Krugerrand|Krugerrand| , first released in 1967, is also 22k .      The special issue  |Canadian_Gold_Maple_Leaf|Canadian_Gold_Maple_Leaf|  coin contains the highest purity gold of any  |bullion_coin|Bullion_Coin| , at 99.999% or 0.99999, while the popular issue Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin has a purity of 99.99%.

Like other precious metals, gold is measured by  |troy_weight|Troy_Weight|  and by grams. The proportion of gold in the alloy is measured by  karat  , with 24 karat being pure gold, and lower karat numbers proportionally less. The purity of a  |gold_bar|Gold_Bar|  or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1, known as the  |millesimal|Millesimal_Fineness| |fineness|Fineness| , such as 0.995 being nearly pure.     The price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and  |derivatives|Derivative|  markets, but a procedure known as the  |Gold_Fixing|Gold_Fixing|  in  |London|London| , originating in September 1919, provides a daily benchmark price to the industry. The afternoon fixing was introduced in 1968 to provide a price when US markets are open.          Historically gold  |coinage|Mint|  was widely used as currency; when  |paper_money|Paper_Money|  was introduced, it typically was a  |receipt|Receipt|  redeemable for gold coin or  |bullion|Bullion| . In a  |monetary|Monetary|  system known as the  |gold_standard|Gold_Standard| , a certain  |weight|Weight|  of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one  |troy_ounce|Troy_Ounce|  was equal to $20.67 , but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to $35.00 per troy ounce . By 1961, it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further  |currency_devaluation|Devaluation|  against increased gold demand.      On 17 March 1968, economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool, and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate; this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level.  |Central_banks|Central_Bank|  still hold historical  |gold_reserves|Official_Gold_Reserves|  as a  |store_of_value|Store_Of_Value|  although the level has generally been declining. The largest gold depository in the world is that of the  |U.S._Federal_Reserve_Bank|Federal_Reserve_System|  in  |New_York|New_York_City| , which holds about 3%  of the gold known to exist and accounted for today, as does the similarly laden  |U.S._Bullion_Depository|United_States_Bullion_Depository|  at  |Fort_Knox|Fort_Knox| .   In 2005 the  |World_Gold_Council|World_Gold_Council|  estimated total global gold supply to be 3,859 tonnes and demand to be 3,754 tonnes, giving a surplus of 105 tonnes.
