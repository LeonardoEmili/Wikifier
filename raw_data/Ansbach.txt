According to folklore, towards the end of the 7th century a group of Franconian peasants and their families went up into the wilderness to found a new settlement. Their leader Onold led them to an area called the Rezattal . This is where they founded the Urhöfe . Gradually more settlers, such as the Winden-Tribe came, and the farms grew into a small village. Many villages around Ansbach were founded by the Winden during that period .   A  |Benedictine_monastery|Benedictine_Order|  was established there around 748 by the  |Frankish|Franks|  noble  |St_Gumbertus|Gumbertus| . The adjoining village of Onoltesbach is first noticed as a proper town in 1221.

The  |Markgrafenschloß|Markgrafenschloß|  was built between 1704–1738.  Its gardens continued to be a notable attraction into the 19th century. In 1791, the last margrave sold his realm to the  |Kingdom_of_Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia| . In 1796, the Duke of  |Zweibrücken|Duchy_Of_Zweibrücken| ,  |Maximilian_Joseph|Maximilian_I_Joseph_Of_Bavaria|  — the future Bavarian king Max I Joseph — was exiled to Ansbach after Zweibrücken had been taken by the French.

Jewish families were resident in Ansbach from at least the end of the 18th century. They set up a Jewish Cemetery in the Ruglaender Strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the Nazi regime in the  |Kristallnacht|Kristallnacht| . It was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. A plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. The Jewish Congregation built its synagogue at No 3 Rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the SA, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. It serves today as a Symbolic House of God . A plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to Jewish residents who were murdered during the Holocaust. In 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach Ansbach Medical and Nursing Clinic to the extermination facilities Sonnenstein and Hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the  |Action_T4|Action_T4|  euthanasia action. They were gassed there. At the clinic in Ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at No. 38 Feuchtwangerstrasse.     During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , a subcamp of  |Flossenbürg_concentration_camp|Flossenbürg_Concentration_Camp|  was located here.

At the end of the war, 19-year-old student Robert Limpert tried to get the town to surrender to the US Forces without a fight. He was betrayed by  |Hitler_Youth|Hitler_Youth|  and was hung from the portal of the City Hall by the citys military commander, Col.  Ernst Meyer. Several memorials to his heroic deed have been erected over the years, despite opposition from some residents — in the Ludwigskirche, in the Gymnasium Carolinum and at No 6 Kronenstrasse.
