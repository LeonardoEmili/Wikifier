It is surrounded by the  |Carpathian_Mountains|Carpathian_Mountains| , and also borders  |Symkaria|Symkaria|   to the south. Its  |capital|Capital|  is Doomstadt.       Latveria first appeared in Fantastic Four Annual 2, published in 1964.  |Victor_von_Doom|Doctor_Doom|  is the ruler of Latveria. Though he has been dethroned a number of times, Victor has invariably managed to return to the throne of his country within a matter of months.     Victor also has a council who obey him entirely. In Fantastic Four 536 in 2006, he killed his own  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister|  for claiming control of Latveria in his absence and threatened to kill two other ministers if they failed to find the landing spot of  |Thors|Thor| |_hammer|Mjolnir| .     Doctor Dooms style of rule can best be described as an  |absolute_monarchy|Absolute_Monarchy| , as it was revealed that there is no  |legislature|Legislature| , and one minister boasted Doctor Doom decides everything. His slightest whim is Latverian law! It is shown Doom has devices throughout the Kingdom to watch his people and even has hidden weapons to prevent them leaving without his consent. In one story he is able to activate a force field around Latveria which prevents anybody leaving, though apparently it can be a defense against nuclear attack. Avengers 21       Latveria was formed out of land annexed from southern  |Hungary|Hungary|  centuries before, and possibly land from  |Serbia|Serbia|  as well Fantastic Four 504 as  |Romania|Romania| .       At some point, Doctor Doom had his army of Servo Guards invade Rotruvia where he was successful at annexing it. All-New, All-Different Avengers 15       Due to Dooms undertakings that drive him away from Latveria, the monarch is often absent. After Dooms descent into  |Hell|Hell| , the nation became a target for conquest by the neighboring countries. This forces  |Reed_Richards|Mister_Fantastic|  to seize control of the country, attempting to pry the populace out from under the thumb of Doom, while at the same time disarming all of Dooms weaponry and technology, so if he ever returned, he would come back to absolutely nothing. In the process, Richards relocated Doom from Hell into a pocket dimension of his own design, and although Doom used his consciousness-switching abilities to escape, the death of his host body seemingly caused him to die as well, and the  |Fantastic_Four|Fantastic_Four|  pulled out of the country.     However Doom survives this and rules Latveria for a time with a puppet Prime Minister and robotic enforcers.       After the Fantastic Four left, the United States attempted to fill the void left by Doom by establishing a democracy for the nation. The Countess  |Lucia_von_Bardas|Lucia_Von_Bardas|  was elected as Prime Minister.

During  Secret War , Fury and a number of superheroes invaded Latveria without permission of the US Government and attempted to assassinate von Bardas. While von Bardas survived, she was horribly disfigured and sought to destroy Fury and the heroes responsible. She was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent  |Daisy_Johnson|Daisy_Johnson|  while trying to blow up New York with the armor of the various villains she employed.       Much of Latveria was destroyed and the population severely reduced by an attack executed by the Marquis of Death .     S.H.I.E.L.D., under the leadership of  |Iron_Man|Iron_Man|  and his team of  |U_S_sanctioned_Avengers|The_Mighty_Avengers|  invaded Latveria after discovering Dooms involvement in the release of a  |symbiote|Symbiote|  virus on New York. The country was yet again devastated and Doom was taken into custody for crimes against humanity.
