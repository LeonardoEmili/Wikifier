        " , this time aboard Resolutions companion ship, , and was present during the first European sighting and exploration of the Hawaiian Islands . Upon his return to Britain in October 1780, Vancouver was commissioned as a lieutenant and posted aboard the sloop initially on escort and patrol duty in the English Channel and North Sea. He accompanied the ship when it left Plymouth on 11 February 1782 for the West Indies. On 7 May 1782 he was appointed fourth lieutenant of the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Fame , which was at the time part of the British West Indies Fleet and assigned to patrolling the French-held Leeward Islands . Vancouver returned to England in June 1783.     In the late 1780s the Spanish Empire commissioned an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. The 1789 the Nootka Crisis developed, and Spain and Britain came close to war over ownership of the Nootka Sound on contemporary Vancouver Island , and of greater importance, the right to colonise and settle the Pacific Northwest coast . Henry Roberts had recently taken command of the survey ship , which was to be used on another round-the-world voyage, and Roberts selected Vancouver as his first lieutenant, but they were then diverted to other warships due to the crisis. Vancouver went with Joseph Whidbey to the 74-gun ship of the line . When the first Nootka Convention ended the crisis in 1790, Vancouver was given command of Discovery to take possession of Nootka Sound and to survey the coasts.       rig statue of George Vancouver on the British Columbia Legislative Buildings in Victoria, British Columbia         Departing England with two ships, HMS Discovery and , on 1 April 1791, Vancouver commanded an expedition charged with exploring the Pacific region. In its first year the expedition travelled to Cape Town, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Hawaii, collecting botanical samples and surveying coastlines along the way. He formally claimed at Possession Point, King George Sound Western Australia, now the town of Albany, Western Australia for the British. Proceeding to North America, Vancouver followed the coasts of present-day Oregon and Washington northward. In April 1792 he encountered American Captain Robert Gray off the coast of Oregon just prior to Grays sailing up the Columbia River .     Vancouver entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca , between Vancouver Island and the Washington state mainland on 29 April 1792. His orders included a survey of every inlet and outlet on the west coast of the mainland, all the way north to Alaska. Most of this work was in small craft propelled by both sail and oar; manoeuvring larger sail-powered vessels in uncharted waters was generally impractical and dangerous.     Vancouver named many features for his officers, friends, associates, and his ship Discovery, including:   Mount Baker – after Discoverys 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker , the first on the expedition to spot it   Mount St. Helens – after his friend, Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens   Puget Sound – after Discoverys 2nd lieutenant Peter Puget , who explored its southern reaches.   Mount Rainier – after his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier .   Port Gardner and Port Susan , Washington – after his former commander Vice Admiral Sir Alan Gardner and his wife Susannah, Lady Gardner.   Whidbey Island – after naval engineer Joseph Whidbey .   Discovery Passage , Discovery Island , Discovery Bay and Port Discovery .     Vancouver was the second European to enter Burrard Inlet on 13 June 1792, naming it for his friend Sir Harry Burrard . It is the present day main harbour area of the City of Vancouver beyond Stanley Park . He surveyed Howe Sound and Jervis Inlet over the next nine days. Little, Gary. Then, on his 35th birthday on 22 June 1792, he returned to Point Grey , the present-day location of the University of British Columbia . Here he unexpectedly met a Spanish expedition led by Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores . Vancouver was mortified to learn they already had a crude chart of the Strait of Georgia based on the 1791 exploratory voyage of José María Narváez the year before, under command of Francisco de Eliza . For three weeks they cooperatively explored the Georgia Strait and the Discovery Islands area before sailing separately towards Nootka Sound .     After the summer surveying season ended, in August 1792, Vancouver went to Nootka , then the regions most important harbour, on contemporary Vancouver Island. Here he was to receive any British buildings and lands returned by the Spanish from claims by Francisco de Eliza for the Spanish crown . The Spanish commander, Juan Francisco Bodega y Quadra , was very cordial and he and Vancouver exchanged the maps they had made, but no agreement was reached; they decided to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was now proven to be located as Quadra and Vancouver Island. Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply Vancouver Island . The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791–1795, Volume 1. W. Kaye Lamb . Hakluyt Society. 1984. . p. 247     While at Nootka Sound Vancouver acquired Robert Grays chart of the lower Columbia River. Gray had entered the river during the summer before sailing to Nootka Sound for repairs. Vancouver realised the importance of verifying Grays information and conducting a more thorough survey. In October 1792, he sent Lieutenant William Robert Broughton with several boats up the Columbia River . Broughton got as far as the Columbia River Gorge , sighting and naming Mount Hood .     Vancouver sailed south along the coast of Spanish Alta California , visiting Chumash villages at Point Conception and near Mission San Buenaventura . McLendon, Sally and Johnson, John R. . Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History pp. 139–40 Accessed 18 June 2010 Vancouver spent the winter in continuing exploration of the Sandwich Islands , the contemporary islands of Hawaii.       The next year, 1793, he returned to British Columbia and proceeded further north, unknowingly missing the overland explorer Alexander Mackenzie by only 48 days. He got to 56°30N, having explored north from Point Menzies in Burke Channel to the northwest coast of Prince of Wales Island . He sailed around the latter island, as well as circumnavigating Revillagigedo Island and charting parts of the coasts of Mitkof , Zarembo , Etolin , Wrangell , Kuiu and Kupreanof Island s. With worsening weather, he sailed south to Alta California, hoping to find Bodega y Quadra and fulfil his territorial mission, but the Spaniard was not there. He again spent the winter in the Sandwich Islands.     In 1794, he first went to Cook Inlet , the northernmost point of his exploration, and from there followed the coast south. Boat parties charted the east coasts of Chichagof and Baranof Island s, circumnavigated Admiralty Island , explored to the head of Lynn Canal , and charted the rest of Kuiu Island and nearly all of Kupreanof Island. He then set sail for Great Britain by way of Cape Horn , returning in September 1795, thus completing a circumnavigation of South America.       thu caricatured Pitts street corner assault on Vancouver     Impressed by the view from Richmond Hill , Vancouver retired to Petersham , London.     Vancouver faced difficulties when he returned home to England. The accomplished and politically well-connected naturalist Archibald Menzies complained that his servant had been pressed into service during a shipboard emergency; sailing master Joseph Whidbey had a competing claim for pay as expedition astronomer ; and Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford , whom Vancouver had disciplined for numerous infractions and eventually sent home in disgrace, proceeded to harass him publicly and privately.     Pitts allies, including his cousin, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger , attacked Vancouver in the press. Thomas Pitt took a more direct approach; on 29 August 1796 he sent Vancouver a letter heaping many insults on the head of his former captain, and challenging him to a duel. Vancouver gravely replied that he was unable in a private capacity to answer for his public conduct in his official duty, and offered instead to submit to formal examination by flag officer s. Pitt chose instead to stalk Vancouver, ultimately assaulting him on a London street corner. The terms of their subsequent legal dispute required both parties to keep the peace, but nothing stopped Vancouvers civilian brother Charles from interposing and giving Pitt blow after blow until onlookers restrained the attacker. Charges and counter-charges flew in the press, with the wealthy Camelford faction having the greater firepower until Vancouver, ailing from his long naval service, died.       Vancouver, at one time amongst Britains greatest explorers and navigators, died in obscurity on 10 May 1798 at the age of 40, less than three years after completing his voyages and expeditions. No official cause of death was stated, as the medical records pertaining to Vancouver were destroyed; one doctor named John Naish claimed Vancouver died from kidney failure, while others believed it was a hyperthyroid condition. His grave is in the churchyard of St Peters Church, Petersham , in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames , England. The Hudsons Bay Company placed a memorial plaque in the church in 1841. His grave in Portland stone , renovated in the 1960s, is now Grade II listed in view of its historical associations.           Vancouver determined that the Northwest Passage did not exist at the latitudes that had long been suggested. His charts of the North American northwest coast were so extremely accurate that they served as the key reference for coastal navigation for generations. Robin Fisher, the academic Vice-President of Mount Royal University in Calgary and author of two books on Vancouver, states:       However, Vancouver failed to discover two of the largest and most important rivers on the Pacific coast , the Fraser River and the Columbia River . He also missed the Skeena River near Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia. Vancouver did eventually learn of the river before he finished his survey—from Robert Gray , captain of the American merchant ship that conducted the first Euroamerican sailing of the Columbia River on 11 May 1792, after first sighting it on an earlier voyage in 1788. However it and the Fraser River never made it onto Vancouvers charts.   Stephen R. Bown, noted in Mercators World magazine that:         While it is difficult to comprehend how Vancouver missed the Fraser River, much of this rivers delta was subject to flooding and summer freshet which prevented the captain from spotting any of its great channels as he sailed the entire shoreline from Point Roberts, Washington , to Point Grey in 1792. Hume, Stephen The Birth of Modern British Columbia Part 7 , The Vancouver Sun, p. D9 The Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest , with the 1791 Francisco de Eliza expedition preceding Vancouver by a year, had also missed the Fraser River although they knew from its muddy plume that there was a major river located nearby.       Vancouver generally established a good rapport with both Indigenous peoples and European trappers. Historical records show Vancouver enjoyed good relations with native leaders both in Hawaii – where King Kamehameha I ceded Hawaii to Vancouver in 1794 – as well as the Pacific Northwest and California. Pynn, Larry Peaceful Encounters , The Vancouver Sun , p. B3 Vancouvers journals exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to natives. He wrote of meeting the Chumash people , and of his exploration of a small island on the Californian coast on which an important burial site was marked by a sepulchre of peculiar character lined with boards and fragments of military instruments lying near a square box covered with mats. Vancouver states:         Vancouver also displayed contempt in his journals towards unscrupulous western traders who provided guns to natives by writing:         Robin Fisher notes that Vancouvers relationships with aboriginal groups were generally peaceful; indeed, his detailed survey would not have been possible if they had been hostile. While there were hostile incidents at the end of Vancouvers last season – the most serious of which involved a clash with Tlingit s at Behm Canal in southeast Alaska in 1794 – these were the exceptions to Vancouvers exploration of the US and Canadian Northwest coast.     Despite a long history of warfare between Britain and Spain, Vancouver maintained excellent relations with his Spanish counterparts and even fêted a Spanish sea captain aboard his ship during his 1792 trip to the Vancouver region.

However, it is not the exact name of the noble family mentioned in the history books that claim Vancouvers noble lineage: that name was Coeverden not Coevorden.     In the 1970s, Adrien Mansvelt, a former consul general of the Netherlands based in Vancouver, published a collation of information in both historical and genealogical journals and in the Vancouver Sun newspaper. Mansvelt, Adrien The Vancouver – Van Coeverden Controversy .

Robinson     W. Kaye Lamb, in summarising Mansvelts 1973 research, observes evidence of close family ties between the Vancouver family of Britain and the Van Coeverden family of the Netherlands as well as George Vancouvers own words from his diaries in referring to his Dutch ancestry:         In 2006 John Robson, a librarian at the University of Waikato , conducted his own research into George Vancouvers ancestry, which he published in an article in the British Columbia History journal. Robson theorises that Vancouvers forebears may have been Flemish rather than Dutch; he believes that Vancouver is descended from the Vangover family of Ipswich and Colchester in Essex. Those towns had a significant Flemish population in the 16th and 17th centuries. Baecklandt, David, Was George Vancouver Flemish? , The Brussels Journal, 21 February 2010.
