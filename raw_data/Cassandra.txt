            Cassandra or Kassandra , , was a woman in  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology|  cursed to utter true  |prophecies|Prophecy| , but never to be believed. In modern usage her name is employed as a rhetorical device to indicate someone whose accurate prophecies are not believed.     Cassandra was reputed to be  |a_daughter|List_Of_Children_Of_Priam|  of King  |Priam|Priam|  and Queen  |Hecuba|Hecuba|  of  |Troy|Troy| . The older and most common versions state that she was admired by the god  |Apollo|Apollo| , who sought to win her with the gift to see the future. According to  |Aeschylus|Aeschylus| , she promised him her favors, but after receiving the gift, she went back on her word and refused the god. The enraged Apollo could not revoke a divine power, so he added to it the curse that though she would see the future, nobody would believe her prophecies. In other sources, such as  |Hyginus|Hyginus|  and  |Pseudo_Apollodorus|Bibliotheke| , Cassandra broke no promise; the powers were given to her as an enticement. When these failed to make her love him, Apollo cursed Cassandra to always be disbelieved, in spite of the truth of her words.     Some later versions have her falling asleep in a temple, where the snakes licked her ears so that she could hear the future.     Cassandra became a figure of  |epic_tradition|Epic_Cycle|  and of  |tragedy|Greek_Tragedy| .        |Hjalmar_Frisk|Hjalmar_Frisk|   notes unexplained etymology , citing various hypotheses found in Wilhelm Schulze, Wilhelm Schulze, Kleine Schriften , 698, J.

Cassandra was a princess of Troy, the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba and the  |fraternal_twin|Twindizygotic_Twins|  sister of  |Helenus|Helenus| . According to legend, Cassandra had dark brown curly hair and dark brown eyes, and though beautiful and clever, was considered insane.        Cassandra was given the gift of prophecy, but was also cursed by the god Apollo so that her true prophecies would not be believed. Many versions of the myth relate that she incurred the gods wrath by refusing him sex, after promising herself to him in exchange for the power of prophecy. In Aeschylus Agamemnon, she bemoans her relationship with Apollo:   Apollo, Apollo!   God of all ways, but only Deaths to me,   Once and again, O thou, Destroyer named,   Thou hast destroyed me, thou, my love of old!     And she acknowledges her fault   I promised that to Loxias but I broke my word. And ever since that fault I could persuade no one.      Latin author  |Hyginus|Hyginus|  in  |Fabulae|Fabulae|  says:         In some versions of the myth, Apollo curses her by spitting into her mouth.     Cassandra had served as a priestess of Apollo and taken a sacred vow of chastity to remain a virgin for life.           Her cursed gift from Apollo became an endless pain and frustration to her. She was seen as a liar and a madwoman by her family and by the Trojan people. In some versions, she was often locked up in a pyramidal building on the citadel on the orders of her father, King Priam. She was accompanied there by the wardress, who cared for her under orders to inform the King of all of his daughters prophetic utterances .      According to legend, Cassandra had instructed her twin brother Helenus in the art of prophecy. Like her, Helenus was always correct whenever he had made his predictions, but he was believed.     Cassandra made many predictions, all disbelieved except one, when she foresaw who  |Paris|Paris|  was and proclaimed that he was her abandoned brother.  Cassandra foresaw that Paris’ abduction of Helen for his wife would bring about the Trojan War and warned Paris not to go to Sparta. Helenus echoed her prophecy, but his warnings were ignored. Cassandra saw Helen coming into Troy when Paris returned home from Sparta. Though the people rejoiced, Cassandra furiously snatched away Helens golden veil and tore at her hair, for she foresaw that Helens arrival would bring the citys destruction in the Trojan War.          Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy. In various accounts of the war, she warned the Trojans about the Greeks hiding inside the Trojan Horse,  |Agamemnons|Agamemnon|  death, her own demise at the hands of  |Aegisthus|Aegisthus|  and  |Clytemnestra|Clytemnestra| , her mother Hecubas fate,  |Odysseuss|Odysseus|  ten-year wanderings before returning to his home, and the murder of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra by the latters children  |Electra|Electra|  and  |Orestes|Orestes| . Cassandra predicted that her cousin  |Aeneas|Aeneas|  would escape during the fall of Troy and found a new nation in Rome.  However, her warnings were all disregarded.       |Coroebus|Coroebus|  and  |Othronus|Othronus|  came to the aid of Troy during the Trojan War out of love for Cassandra and in exchange for her hand in marriage, but both were killed. According to one account, Priam offered Cassandra to  |Telephus|Telephus| ’s son  |Eurypylus|Eurypylus| , in order to induce Eurypylus to fight on the side of the Trojans.  |Dictys_Cretensis|Dictys_Cretensis|  4.14 . Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother  |Hector|Hector|  being brought back to the city.     In The Fall of Troy, told by  |Quintus_Smyrnaeus|Quintus_Smyrnaeus| , Cassandra had attempted to warn the Trojan people that Greek warriors were hiding in the Trojan Horse while they were celebrating their victory over the Greeks with feasting. They disbelieved her, calling her names and degrading her with insults.  She grabbed an axe in one hand and a burning torch in her other, and ran towards the Trojan Horse, intent on destroying the Greeks herself, but the Trojans stopped her. The Greeks hiding inside the Horse were relieved, but alarmed by how clearly she had divined their plan.     At the fall of Troy, Cassandra sought shelter in the temple of  |Athena|Athena| . There she embraced the wooden statue of Athena in supplication for her protection, but was abducted and brutally raped by  |Ajax_the_Lesser|Ajax_The_Lesser| . Cassandra clung so tightly to the statue of the goddess that Ajax knocked it from its stand as he dragged her away. One account claimed that even Athena, who had worked hard to help the Greeks destroy Troy, was not able to restrain her tears and her cheeks burned with anger. In one account, this caused her image to give forth a sound that shook the floor of the temple at the sight of Cassandras rape, and her image turned its eyes away as Cassandra was violated, although others found this account too bold. Ajaxs actions were a sacrilege because Cassandra was a supplicant at the sanctuary, and thus under the protection of the goddess. He further defiled the temple with sexual intercourse by raping her.       Odysseus insisted to the other Greek leaders that Ajax should be stoned to death for his sacrilege, which had enraged Athena and the other gods. Ajax avoided their wrath, because none of them dared to punish him after he clung, as a supplicant, to Athenas altar and swore an oath proclaiming his innocence. Athena was furious at the Greeks failure to punish Ajax, and she revenged herself with the help of  |Poseidon|Poseidon|  and  |Zeus|Zeus| . Poseidon sent storms and strong winds to destroy much of the Greek fleet on their way home from Troy. Athena herself inflicted a terrible death on Ajax, although the sources differ as to  |the_manner_of_his_death|Ajax_The_Lesserdeath| . The  |Locrians|Locrians|  had to atone for Ajaxs crimes by sending two maidens to Troy every year for a thousand years to serve as slaves in Athenas temple. However, if they were caught by the inhabitants before they reached the temple, they were executed.     In some versions, Cassandra intentionally left a chest behind in Troy, with a curse on whichever Greek opened it first. Inside the chest was an image of  |Dionysus|Dionysus| , made by  |Hephaestus|Hephaestus|  and presented to the Trojans by Zeus. It was given to the Greek leader  |Eurypylus|Eurypylus|  as a part of his share of the victory spoils of Troy. When he opened the chest and saw the image of the god, he went mad.       Cassandra was then taken as a  pallake  by  |King_Agamemnon|King_Agamemnon|  of  |Mycenae|Mycenae| . Unbeknown to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife,  |Clytemnestra|Clytemnestra| , had betrayed him by taking  |Aegisthus|Aegisthus|  as her lover.  Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.     Cassandra was sent to the  |Elysian_Fields|Elysium|  after her death, because her soul was judged worthy due to her dedication to the gods, and her piety during her life.      Cassandra was buried either at Amyclae or Mycenae. The two towns disputed the possession of her grave.  |Heinrich_Schliemann|Heinrich_Schliemann|  was certain that he had discovered Cassandra’s tomb when he had excavated Mycenae, because he found the remains of a woman and two infants in one of the circle graves at Mycenae.     Agamemnon by Aeschylus     The play  Agamemnon  from Aeschyluss trilogy  Oresteia  depicts the king treading the scarlet cloth laid down for him, and walking offstage to his death.  After the choruss ode of foreboding, time is suspended in Cassandras  |mad_scene|Mad_Scene|  .   She has been onstage, silent and ignored. Her madness that is unleashed now is not the physical torment of other characters in  |Greek_tragedy|Greek_Tragedy| , such as in  |Euripides|Euripides|  Heracles or  |Sophocles|Sophocles|  Ajax.     According to author Seth Schein, two further familiar descriptions of her madness are that of Heracles in  The Women of Trachis  or  |Io|Io|  in Prometheus Bound.  She speaks, disconnectedly and transcendent, in the grip of her psychic possession by Apollo,   witnessing past and future events. Schein says, She evokes the same awe, horror and pity as do  |schizophrenics|Schizophrenics|  .  Cassandra is one of those who often combine deep, true insight with utter helplessness, and who retreat into madness.      |Eduard_Fraenkel|Eduard_Fraenkel|  remarked   on the powerful contrasts between declaimed and sung dialogue in this scene. The frightened and respectful chorus are unable to comprehend her. She goes to her inevitable offstage murder by  |Clytemnestra|Clytemnestra|  with full knowledge of what is to befall her. Analyses of the Cassandra scene are in  |Bernard_Knox|Bernard_Knox|  Word and Action: Essays on the Ancient theatre 1979  Anne Lebeck, The Oresteia: A study in language and structure 1971        Cassandra is an enduring archetype. Modern invocations of Cassandra are most frequently an example of a  |Cassandra_complex|Cassandra_Complex| . To emphasize such a situation, Cassandras name is frequently used in fiction when prophecy comes up, especially true prophecy that is not believed. This can include the names of people, objects, or places.     Cassandra has been used as metaphor and allegory in psychological and philosophical tracts. For example,  |Florence_Nightingales|Florence_Nightingale|  book Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth has a section named for Cassandra, using her as a  |metaphor|Metaphor|  for the helplessness of women that she attributes to over-feminization .     The Cassandra myth itself has also been retold several times by modern authors of novels and dramatizations, including works by  |Eric_Shanower|Eric_Shanower| ,  |Lindsay_Clarke|Lindsay_Clarke| ,  |Christa_Wolf|Christa_Wolf| ,  |Lesya_Ukrainka|Lesya_Ukrainka| ,  |Woody_Allen|Woody_Allen| ,  |Marion_Zimmer_Bradley|Marion_Zimmer_Bradley| ,  |David_Gemmell|David_Gemmell| , and  |Hector_Berlioz|Hector_Berlioz| . A number of songs have also referred to her, such as  |Cassandra|Cassandra|  , by Swedish pop band  |ABBA|Abba| .
