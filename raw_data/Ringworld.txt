Ringworld is a 1970  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  novel by  |Larry_Niven|Larry_Niven| , set in his  |Known_Space|Known_Space|  universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Ringworld tells the story of Louis Wu and his companions on a mission to the Ringworld, a massive alien construct in space 186 million miles in diameter. Niven later added three sequel novels and then cowrote, with  |Edward_M._Lerner|Edward_M._Lerner| , four prequels and a final sequel; the five latter novels constitute the  |Fleet_of_Worlds|Fleet_Of_Worlds|  series. All the Ringworld novels tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. Ringworld won the  |Nebula_Award|Nebula_Award|  in 1970,  as well as both the  |Hugo_Award|Hugo_Award|  and  |Locus_Award|Locus_Award|  in 1971.        On planet  |Earth|Earth|  in 2850  |AD|Ad| ,  |Louis_Gridley_Wu|Louis_Wu|  is celebrating his 200th birthday. Despite his age, Louis is in perfect physical condition . He has once again become bored with human society and is thinking about taking one of his periodic sabbaticals, alone in a spaceship far away from other people. He meets  |Nessus|Nessus| , a  |Piersons_puppeteer|Piersons_Puppeteers| , who offers him a mysterious job. Intrigued, Louis eventually accepts.  |Speaker-to-Animals|Speaker-To-Animals|  , who is a  |Kzin|Kzin| , and  |Teela_Brown|Teela_Brown| , a young human woman who becomes Louis lover, also join the crew.     They first go to the puppeteer home world, where they learn that the expeditions goal is to investigate the Ringworld,  a gigantic artificial ring, to see if it poses any threat. The Ringworld is about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of Earths orbit , encircling a sunlike star. It rotates to provide artificial gravity 99.2% as strong as Earths from  |centrifugal_force|Centrifugal_Force| . The Ringworld has a habitable, flat inner surface , a breathable atmosphere and a temperature optimal for humans. Night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong wire. When the crew completes their mission, they will be given the  |starship|Starship|  in which they travelled to the puppeteer home world; it is orders of magnitude faster than any possessed by humans or Kzinti.     When they reach the vicinity of the Ringworld, they are unable to contact anyone, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the Ringworlds automated meteoroid-defense system. The severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands near a huge mountain, Fist-of-God . Although many of the ships systems survive intact the normal drive is destroyed leaving them unable to launch back into space where they could use the undamaged faster-than-light hyperdrive to return home. They set out to find a way to get the Lying Bastard off of the Ringworld.     Using their flycycles , they try to reach the rim of the ring, where they hope to find some technology that will help them. It will take them months to cross the vast distance. When Teela develops Plateau trance , they are forced to land. On the ground, they encounter apparently primitive human natives who live in the crumbling ruins of a once-advanced city and think that the crew are the engineers who created the ring, and whom they revere as gods. The crew is attacked when they commit what the natives consider blasphemy .     They continue their journey, during which Nessus reveals some Puppeteer secrets: they have conducted experiments on both humans and Kzinti . Speakers outrage forces Nessus to flee and follow them from a safe distance.     In a floating building over the ruins of a city, they find a map of the Ringworld and videos of its past civilization.     While flying through a giant storm, caused by air escaping through a hole in the Ring floor due to a meteoroid impact, Teela becomes separated from the others. While Louis and Speaker search for her, their flycycles are caught by an automatic police trap designed to catch traffic offenders. They are trapped in the basement of a floating police station. Nessus enters the station to try to help them.     In the station, they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan , a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the Ringworld and other inhabited worlds. When her ship returned to the Ringworld the last time, they found that civilization had collapsed. The crew managed to enter the Ringworld, but some of them were killed and others suffered brain damage when the device that let them pass through the Ringworld floor failed. From her account, Louis surmises that a mold was brought back from one of the other planets by a spaceship like Prills; it broke down the superconductors vital to the Ringworld civilization, dooming it.     Teela reaches the police station, accompanied by her new lover, a native hero called Seeker who helped her survive. Based on an insight gained from studying an ancient Ringworld map, Louis comes up with a plan to get home. Teela, however, chooses to remain on the Ringworld with Seeker. Louis, formerly skeptical about breeding for luck, now wonders if the entire mission was caused by Teelas luck, to unite her with her true love and help her mature.     The party collects one end of the shadow-square wire that was snapped when the ship crashed. They travel back to their crashed ship in the floating police station, dragging the wire behind them. Louis threads it through the ship to tether it to the police station. He then takes the police station up to the summit of Fist-of-God , the enormous mountain near their crash site. The mountain had not appeared on the Ringworld map, leading Louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the mountain up from the rings floor and broke through. The top of the mountain, above the atmosphere, is therefore just a hole in the Ringworld floor. Louis drives the police station over the edge, dragging the Lying Bastard along with it. The Ringworld spins very quickly, so once the ship drops through the hole and clears the ring, they can use the ships hyperdrive to get home. The book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.        |Algis_Budrys|Algis_Budrys|  found Ringworld to be excellent and entertaining . & thinsp;. & thinsp;. woven together very skillfully and proceed at a pretty smooth pace. While praising the novel generally, he faulted Niven for relying on inconsistencies regarding evolution in his extrapolations to support his fictional premises. Galaxy Bookshelf ,  Galaxy , March 1971, pp.112-13       In addition to the two aliens, Niven includes a number of concepts from his other Known Space stories:     The puppeteers  |General_Products_hulls|General_Products| , which are impervious to any known force except  |visible_light|Visible_Light|  and  |gravity|Gravity| , and for a long time thought indestructible by anything except  |antimatter|Antimatter| . The Fleet of Worlds prequels reveal two other ways that the hulls can be destroyed.   The  |Slaver_stasis_field|Slaver_Stasis_Field| , which causes time in the enclosed volume to stand still; since time has for all intents and purposes ceased for an object in  |stasis|Stasis| , no harm can come to anything within the field.   The idea that  |luck|Luck|  is a  |genetic|Genetics|  trait that can be strengthened by  |selective_breeding|Selective_Breeding| .   The tasp, a device that remotely stimulates the  |pleasure_center|Pleasure_Center|  of the  |brain|Brain| ; it temporarily incapacitates its target and is extremely psychologically addictive. If the subject cannot, for whatever reason, get access to the device, intense depression can result, often to the point of madness or suicide. To use a tasp on someone from hiding, relieving them of their anger or depression, is called making their day .    |Boosterspice|Boosterspice| , a drug that restores or indefinitely preserves youth.   Scrith, the metal-like substance of which the Ringworld is built , that has a  |tensile_strength|Tensile_Strength|  nearly equal in magnitude to the  |strong_nuclear_force|Strong_Interaction| . This makes it an example of  |unobtainium|Unobtainiumscience_Fiction| . This is similar to the Pak Protectors twing used in other Larry Niven stories.   Impact armor, a flexible form of clothing that hardens instantly into a rigid form stronger than steel when rapidly deformed, similar to  |certain_types_of_bulletproof_vests|Ballistic_Vestnanomaterials_In_Ballistics| .   The hyperspace shunt, an engine for faster-than-light travel, but slow enough  to keep the galaxy vast and unknown; the new quantum  II hyperspace shunt , developed by the Puppeteers but not yet released to humans, can cross a light-year in just 1.25  minutes .   Point-to-point teleportation at the speed of light is possible with  |transfer_booths|Transfer_Booth|  and  |stepping_disks|Stepping_Disk|  ; on Earth, peoples sense of place and global position has been lost due to instantaneous travel; cities and cultures have blended together.   A theme well covered in the novel is that of cultures suffering technological breakdowns who then proceed to revert to belief systems along  |religious|Religion|  lines. Most Ringworld societies have forgotten that they live on an artificial structure, and now attribute the phenomena and origin of their world to divine power.          The opening chapter of the original paperback edition of Ringworld featured Louis Wu teleporting eastward around the Earth in order to extend his birthday. Moving in this direction would, in fact, make local time later rather than earlier, so that Wu would soon arrive in the early morning of the next calendar day. Niven was endlessly teased about this error, which he corrected in subsequent printings to show Wu teleporting westward.  In his dedication to The Ringworld Engineers, Niven wrote, If you own a first paperback edition of Ringworld, its the one with the mistakes in it. Its worth money.      After the publication of Ringworld, many fans identified numerous engineering problems in the Ringworld as described in the novel. One major one was that the Ringworld, being a rigid structure, was not actually in orbit around the star it encircled and would eventually drift, ultimately colliding with its sun and disintegrating. This led  |MIT|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology|  students attending the 1971  |Worldcon|World_Science_Fiction_Convention|  to chant, The Ringworld is unstable! Niven wrote the 1980 sequel  The Ringworld Engineers  in part to address these engineering issues. In it, the ring is found to have a system of  |attitude_jets|Vernier_Thruster|  atop the rim walls, but the Ringworld has become gravely endangered because most of the jets have been removed by the natives, to power their interstellar ships.     The second chapter refers to standard Earth gravity as , while  |standard_Earth_gravity|Standard_Gravity|  is . In chapter 8, The Liar is referred to as thrusting at .992 gee, and later Ringworld gravity is referred to as .     The fifth chapter refers to Nereid as Neptunes largest moon; the planets largest moon is Triton.            Ringworld , or more formally, Niven ring , has become a generic term for such a structure, which is an example of what science fiction fans call a  |Big_Dumb_Object|Big_Dumb_Object|  , or more formally a  |megastructure|Megastructure| . Other science fiction authors have devised their own variants of Nivens Ringworld, notably  |Iain_M._Banks|Iain_M._Banks| |Culture_Orbitals|Orbital| , best described as miniature Ringworlds, and the ring-shaped  |Halo|Halo|  structure of the video game  Halo . Ringworlds are featured in several video games, such as  |Paradox_Interactives|Paradox_Interactive| |4X_grand_strategy_game|4X|   Stellaris , Blind Mind Studios  Star Ruler  2, and Malfador Machinations  Space Empires  series.             In 1984, a  |role-playing_game|Role-Playing_Game|  based on this setting was produced by  |Chaosium|Chaosium|  named  The Ringworld Roleplaying Game . Information from the RPG, along with notes composed by RPG author John Hewitt with Niven, was later used to form the Bible given to authors writing in the  Man-Kzin Wars  series. Niven himself recommended that Hewitt write one of the stories for the original two MKW books, although this never came to pass.  Scatterbrain , pp. 293-301      |Tsunami_Games|Tsunami_Games|  released two  |adventure_games|Adventure_Game|  based on Ringworld.  Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch  was released in 1992 and Return to Ringworld in 1994. A third game, Ringworld: Within ARMs Reach, was also planned, but never completed.     The videogame franchise Halo, created by Bungie and now handled by 343 Industries, took inspiration from the book in the creation and development of its story around the Halos .     In 2017 Paradox Interactive added a  |DLC|Dlc|  called Utopia to their game,  |Stellaris|Stellaris| ,  , allowing the player to build a Ringworld or other megastructures such as  |dyson_spheres|Dyson_Sphere|  and Habitat Stations or restore an Ancient Precursor species.       There have been many aborted attempts to adapt the novel to the screen.     In 2001, Larry Niven reported that a movie deal had been signed and was in the early planning stages.       In 2004, the  |Sci-Fi_Channel|Syfy|  reported that it was developing a Ringworld miniseries.  The series never came to fruition.     In 2013, it was again announced by the channel, now rebranded as Syfy, that a miniseries of the novel was in development. This proposed 4-hour miniseries was being written by  |Michael_R._Perry|Michael_R._Perry|  and would have been a co-production between  |MGM_Television|Mgm_Television|  and  |Universal_Cable_Productions|Universal_Cable_Productions| .      In 2017,  |Amazon|Amazon_Studios|  announced that Ringworld was one of three science fiction series it was developing for its streaming service. MGM were again listed as a co-producer.           |Tor_Books|Tor_Books|  and  |Seven_Seas_Entertainment|Seven_Seas_Entertainment|  published a two-part  |original_English-language_manga|Original_English-Language_Manga|  adaptation of Ringworld, with the script written by  |Robert_Mandell|Robert_Mandell|  and the artwork by Sean Lam.  Ringworld: The Graphic Novel, Part One, covering the events of the novel up to the sunflower attack on Speaker, was released on July 8, 2014. Part Two was released on November 10, 2015.       In the  |D_&_D|D_&_D| |Planescape|Planescape| , the city  |Sigil|Sigil|  sits atop a gigantic spire that the Outlands rotates around; which is portrayed as a Niven Ringworld that all the other planes have representative cities upon.    |Terry_Pratchett|Terry_Pratchett|  intended his 1981 novel  Strata  to be a piss-take/homage/satire of Ringworld. Niven took it in good humor and enjoyed the work.    The plot of the  |first-person_shooter|First-Person_Shooter|   Halo: Combat Evolved  for the  |Xbox|Xbox| ,  |Windows|Microsoft_Windows| , and  |Mac_OS_X|Mac_Os_X|  also takes place on an artificial ring structure. Similarities to Ringworld have been noted in the game,  and Niven was asked to write the  |first_novel|Halo:_The_Fall_Of_Reach|  based on the series.  — Condensed version of information found at Nivens own site:     All in Fun by Jerry Oltion, in  Fantasy & Science Fiction , January 2009, mentions a faithful big-budget movie adaptation of Ringworld.   In  |Ernest_Clines|Ernest_Cline|  2011 novel  Ready Player One , one of the sectors of the OASIS, the worldwide  |virtual_reality|Virtual_Reality|  network that is the novels primary setting, is mentioned as being an adaptation of Ringworld.
