His works include the comic book series  The Sandman  and novels  Stardust ,  American Gods ,  Coraline , and  The Graveyard Book . He has won numerous awards, including the  |Hugo|Hugo_Award| ,  |Nebula|Nebula_Award| , and  |Bram_Stoker|Bram_Stoker_Award|  awards, as well as the  |Newbery|Newbery_Medal|  and  |Carnegie|Carnegie_Medal|  medals. He is the first author to win both the Newbery and the Carnegie medals for the same work, The Graveyard Book . In 2013,  The Ocean at the End of the Lane  was voted Book of the Year in the British  |National_Book_Awards|Specsavers_National_Book_Awards| .        Gaimans family is of Polish Jewish and other Eastern European Jewish origins.  His great-grandfather emigrated from  |Antwerp|Antwerp| , Belgium, to the UK before 1914  and his grandfather eventually settled in the south of England in the  |Hampshire|Hampshire|  city of  |Portsmouth|Portsmouth|  and established a chain of grocery stores. Gaimans grandfather changed his original family name of Chaiman to Gaiman.  His father,  |David_Bernard_Gaiman|David_Gaiman| , worked in the same chain of stores;  his mother, Sheila Gaiman , was a pharmacist. He has two younger sisters, Claire and Lizzy.      After living for a period in the nearby town of  |Portchester|Portchester| , Hampshire, where Neil was born in 1960, the Gaimans moved in 1965 to the  |West_Sussex|West_Sussex|  town of  |East_Grinstead|East_Grinstead| , where his parents studied  |Dianetics|Dianetics|  at the  |Scientology_centre|Saint_Hill_Manor|  in the town; one of Gaimans sisters works for the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles. His other sister, Lizzy Calcioli, has said, Most of our social activities were involved with Scientology or our Jewish family. It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid. Id say, Im a Jewish Scientologist. Gaiman says that he is not a Scientologist, and that like Judaism, Scientology is his familys religion.  About his personal views, Gaiman has stated, I think we can say that God exists in the DC Universe. I would not stand up and beat the drum for the existence of God in this universe. I dont know, I think theres probably a 50/50 chance. It doesnt really matter to me.      Gaiman was able to read at the age of four. He said, I was a reader. I loved reading. Reading things gave me pleasure. I was very good at most subjects in school, not because I had any particular aptitude in them, but because normally on the first day of school theyd hand out schoolbooks, and Id read them—which would mean that Id know what was coming up, because Id read it.  When he was about ten years old, he read his way through the works of  |Dennis_Wheatley|Dennis_Wheatley| , where especially The Ka of Gifford Hillary and The Haunting of Toby Jugg made an impact on him.  One work that made a particular impression on him was  |J._R._R._Tolkiens|J._R._R._Tolkien|   The Lord of the Rings  from his school library, although it only had the first two volumes of the novel. He consistently took them out and read them. He would later win the school English prize and the school reading prize, enabling him to finally acquire the third volume.     For his seventh birthday, Gaiman received  |C._S._Lewiss|C._S._Lewis|   The Chronicles of Narnia  series. He later recalled that I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader, where he would just talk to you ... Id think, Oh, my gosh, that is so cool! I want to do that! When I become an author, I want to be able to do things in parentheses. I liked the power of putting things in brackets. Narnia also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the 1956  |Carnegie_Medal|Carnegie_Medal|  won by the concluding volume. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, the press reported him recalling, it had to be the most important literary award there ever was and observing, if you can make yourself aged seven happy, youre really doing well – its like writing a letter to yourself aged seven.       |Lewis_Carrolls|Lewis_Carroll|   Alices Adventures in Wonderland  was another childhood favourite, and a favourite forever. Alice was default reading to the point where I knew it by heart. He also enjoyed  |Batman|Batman|  comics as a child.     Gaiman was educated at several  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England|  schools, including Fonthill School in East Grinstead,  |Ardingly_College|Ardingly_College|  , and  |Whitgift_School|Whitgift_School|  in  |Croydon|Croydon|  .  His fathers position as a public relations official of the  |Church_of_Scientology|Church_Of_Scientology|  was the cause of the seven-year-old Gaiman being forced to withdraw from Fonthill School and remain at the school that he had previously been attending.  He lived in East Grinstead for many years, from 1965 to 1980 and again from 1984 to 1987.  He met his first wife, Mary McGrath, while she was studying Scientology and living in a house in East Grinstead that was owned by his father. The couple were married in 1985 after having their first child, Michael.              As a child and a teenager, Gaiman read the works of  |C._S._Lewis|C._S._Lewis| ,  |J._R._R._Tolkien|J._R._R._Tolkien| ,  |Lewis_Carroll|Lewis_Carroll| ,  |Mary_Shelley|Mary_Shelley| ,  |Rudyard_Kipling|Rudyard_Kipling| ,  |Edgar_Allan_Poe|Edgar_Allan_Poe| ,  |Michael_Moorcock|Michael_Moorcock| ,  |Alan_Moore|Alan_Moore| ,  |Steve_Ditko|Steve_Ditko| ,   |Will_Eisner|Will_Eisner| ,   |Ursula_K._Le_Guin|Ursula_K._Le_Guin| ,  |Harlan_Ellison|Harlan_Ellison| ,  |Lord_Dunsany|Lord_Dunsany|  and  |G._K._Chesterton|G._K._Chesterton| . Abbey p. 68  A lifetime fan of the  |Monty_Python|Monty_Python|  comedy troupe, as a teenager he owned a copy of  Monty Pythons Big Red Book .  When he was 19–20 years old, he contacted his favourite science fiction writer,  |R._A._Lafferty|R._A._Lafferty| , whom he discovered when he was nine, and asked for advice on becoming an author along with a Lafferty  |pastiche|Pastiche|  he had written. The writer sent Gaiman an encouraging and informative letter back, along with literary advice.       Gaiman has said  |Roger_Zelazny|Roger_Zelazny|  was the author who influenced him the most, Of Meetings and Partings by Neil Gaiman, introduction to This Mortal Mountain: Volume 3 of The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, NESFA Press, edited by David G. Grubbs, Christopher S. Kovacs, and Ann Crimmins, 2009, page 12. with this influence particularly seen in Gaimans literary style and the topics he writes about.  by Jo Walton,  |Tor.com|Tor.Com| , November 11, 2012. Other authors Gaiman says furnished the inside of my mind and set me to writing include Moorcock, Ellison,  |Samuel_R._Delany|Samuel_R._Delany| ,  |Angela_Carter|Angela_Carter| , Lafferty and Le Guin. Neil Gaiman has also taken inspiration from the folk tales tradition, citing  |Otta_F_Swires|Otta_F_Swire|  book on the legends of the Isle of Skye as his inspiration for The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains.      In the early 1980s, Gaiman pursued journalism, conducting interviews and writing book reviews, as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published. He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society.  His first professional short story publication was Featherquest , a fantasy story, in  Imagine Magazine  in May 1984.     When waiting for a train at Londons  |Victoria_Station|London_Victoria_Station|  in 1984, Gaiman noticed a copy of  Swamp Thing  written by  |Alan_Moore|Alan_Moore| , and carefully read it. Moores fresh and vigorous approach to comics had such an impact on Gaiman that he would later write that was the final straw, what was left of my resistance crumbled. I proceeded to make regular and frequent visits to Londons  |Forbidden_Planet|Forbidden_Planet|  shop to buy comics .     In 1984, he wrote his first book, a biography of the band  |Duran_Duran|Duran_Duran| , as well as Ghastly Beyond Belief, a book of quotations, with  |Kim_Newman|Kim_Newman| . Even though Gaiman thought he had done a terrible job, the books first edition sold out very quickly. When he went to relinquish his rights to the book, he discovered the publisher had gone bankrupt.  After this, he was offered a job by  Penthouse . He refused the offer.     He also wrote interviews and articles for many British magazines, including  Knave . During this he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms, including Gerry Musgrave, Richard Grey, and a couple of house names .  Gaiman has said he ended his journalism career in 1987 because British newspapers regularly publish untruths as fact.     In the late 1980s, he wrote  Dont Panic: The Official Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Companion  in what he calls a classic English humour style.  Following this he wrote the opening of what would become his collaboration with fellow English author  |Terry_Pratchett|Terry_Pratchett|  on the  |comic_novel|Comic_Novel|   Good Omens , about the impending apocalypse.           After forming a friendship with comic-book writer  |Alan_Moore|Alan_Moore| ,  Gaiman started writing comic books, picking up  Miracleman  after Moore finished his run on the series. Gaiman and artist  |Mark_Buckingham|Mark_Buckingham|  collaborated on several issues of the series before its publisher,  |Eclipse_Comics|Eclipse_Comics| , collapsed, leaving the series unfinished. His first published comic strips were four short  Future Shocks  for  2000 AD  in 1986–87. He wrote three graphic novels with his favourite collaborator and long-time friend  |Dave_McKean|Dave_Mckean|  Violent Cases ,  Signal to Noise , and  The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch . Impressed with his work,  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics|  hired him in February 1987,  and he wrote the limited series  Black Orchid .    |Karen_Berger|Karen_Berger| , who later became head of  |DC_Comicss|Dc_Comics| |Vertigo|Vertigo| , read Black Orchid and offered Gaiman a job: to re-write an old character, The Sandman, but to put his own spin on him.      The Sandman  tells the tale of the  |ageless|Endless| ,  |anthropomorphic|Anthropomorphic|  personification of  |Dream|Dream|  that is known by many names, including  |Morpheus|Dream| . The series began in January 1989 and concluded in March 1996. Manning 1980s in Dolan, p. 238: In arguably one of the greatest achievements in serialized modern comic books, writer Neil Gaiman crafted the seventy-five-issue ongoing series The Sandman, introducing its readers to a complex world of horror and fantasy.

The series became one of DCs top selling titles, eclipsing even Batman and Superman.  Comics historian  |Les_Daniels|Les_Daniels|  called Gaimans work astonishing and noted that The Sandman was a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before .   DC Comics writer and executive  |Paul_Levitz|Paul_Levitz|  observed that The Sandman became the first extraordinary success as a series of graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure.      Gaiman and  |Jamie_Delano|Jamie_Delano|  were to become co-writers of the  Swamp Thing  series following  |Rick_Veitch|Rick_Veitch| . An editorial decision by DC to censor Veitchs final storyline caused both Gaiman and Delano to withdraw from the title.      Gaiman produced two stories for DCs  Secret Origins  series in 1989.

In 1990, Gaiman wrote  The Books of Magic , a four-part mini-series that provided a tour of the mythological and magical parts of the  |DC_Universe|Dc_Universe|  through a  |frame_story|Frame_Story|  about an English teenager who discovers that he is destined to be the worlds greatest wizard. Manning 1990s in Dolan, p. 247: Neil Gaiman chronicled the adventures of magic pupil Timothy Hunter in this miniseries. each issue explored the realms of magic as portrayed by a different painter. The miniseries was popular, and sired an ongoing series written by  |John_Ney_Rieber|John_Ney_Rieber| .      Gaimans adaptation of  Sweeney Todd , illustrated by  |Michael_Zulli|Michael_Zulli|  for  |Stephen_R._Bissettes|Stephen_R._Bissette|  publication  Taboo , was stopped when the anthology itself was discontinued.      In the mid-1990s, he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by  |Tekno_Comix|Tekno_Comix| . The concepts were then altered and split between three titles set in the same continuity:  Lady Justice ,  Mr. Hero the Newmatic Man , and  Teknophage ,  and tie-ins. Although Gaimans name appeared prominently as creator of the characters, he was not involved in writing any of the above-mentioned books.     Gaiman wrote a semi-autobiographical story about a boys fascination with  |Michael_Moorcocks|Michael_Moorcock|  anti-hero  |Elric_of_Melniboné|Elric_Of_Melniboné|  for  |Ed_Kramers|Ed_Kramer|  anthology Tales of the White Wolf.

Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling, Gaiman said: One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was, in many ways, untouched ground. It was virgin territory. When I was working on Sandman, I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle. I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before. When Im writing novels Im painfully aware that Im working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw-droppingly brilliant things for, you know, three-four thousand years now. You know, you can go back. We have things like  The Golden Ass . And you go, well, I dont know that Im as good as that and thats two and a half thousand years old. But with comics I felt like – I can do stuff nobody has ever done. I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of. And I could and it was enormously fun.      Gaiman wrote two series for  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics| .  Marvel 1602  was an eight-issue limited series published from November 2003 to June 2004 with art by  |Andy_Kubert|Andy_Kubert|  and  |Richard_Isanove|Richard_Isanove| .

In 2011 Pratchett said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them, Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaimans scheduled involvement with Sandman.      The 1996  |novelisation|Neverwhere|  of Gaimans teleplay for the BBC mini-series  Neverwhere  was his first solo novel. The novel was released in tandem with the television series though it presents some notable differences from the television series.

The wedding took place in the parlour of writers  |Ayelet_Waldman|Ayelet_Waldman|  and  |Michael_Chabon|Michael_Chabon| .  On marrying Palmer, he took her middle name, MacKinnon, as one of his names.

Gaiman is a supporter and board member of the  |Comic_Book_Legal_Defense_Fund|Comic_Book_Legal_Defense_Fund| .        One of Gaimans most commented-upon friendships is with the musician  |Tori_Amos|Tori_Amos| , a Sandman fan who became friends with Gaiman after making a reference to Neil and the Dream King on her 1991 demo tape. He included her in turn as a character in his novel Stardust. Tori Amos, Tear in Your Hand,  Little Earthquakes  Amos also mentions Gaiman in her songs, Tear in Your Hand ,  Space Dog ,  Horses ,  Carbon ,  Sweet Dreams ,  and Not Dying Today . He also wrote stories for the tour book of  Boys for Pele  and  Scarlets Walk , a letter for the tour book of  American Doll Posse , and the stories behind each girl in her album  Strange Little Girls . Amos penned the introduction for his novel Death: the High Cost of Living, and posed for the cover. She also wrote a song called Sister Named Desire based on his Sandman character, which was included on his anthology, Wheres Neil When You Need Him?.     Gaiman is godfather to Tori Amoss daughter Tash,  and wrote a poem called Blueberry Girl for Tori and Tash.  The poem has been turned into a book by the illustrator  |Charles_Vess|Charles_Vess| .  Gaiman read the poem aloud to an audience at the Sundance Kabuki Theater in San Francisco on 5 October 2008 during his book reading tour for The Graveyard Book.  It was published in March 2009 with the title  Blueberry Girl .       In 1993, Gaiman was contracted by  |Todd_McFarlane|Todd_Mcfarlane|  to write a single issue of  Spawn , a popular title at the newly created  |Image_Comics|Image_Comics|  company. McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman,  |Alan_Moore|Alan_Moore| ,  |Frank_Miller|Frank_Miller| , and  |Dave_Sim|Dave_Sim|  each write a single issue.     In issue No. 9 of the series, Gaiman introduced the characters  |Angela|Angela| ,  |Cogliostro|Cogliostro| , and  |Medieval_Spawn|Hellspawn| . Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no direction. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawns existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to  |Malebolgia|Malebolgia| , the demon that creates Hellspawn.     As intended, See Judge Shabazs ruling for the legal reasoning: As a co-owner, McFarlane was not violating the Copyright Act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work, but, as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation, he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latters share of the profits. all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe. In papers filed by Gaiman in early 2002, however, he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter and artist , not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series. Listen to the Oral Argument,  . Retrieved 22 September 2008. See also the  . Retrieved 22 September 2008. Disagreement over who owned the rights to a character was the primary motivation for McFarlane and other artists to form Image Comics . See  |Khoury,_George|George_Khoury| , Image Comics: The Road To Independence ,  As McFarlane used the characters without Gaimans permission or royalty payments, Gaiman believed his  |copyright|Copyright| ed work was being infringed upon, which violated their original oral agreement. McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters, and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively swap McFarlanes interest in the character  |Marvelman|Marvelman|  See Judge Shabazs   but later claimed that Gaimans work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaimans creations entirely. The presiding judge, however, ruled against their agreement being work for hire, based in large part on the legal requirement that copyright assignments must be in writing. Judge Shabaz,  , as per Schiller & Schmidt, Inc. v. Nordisco Corp., 969 F.2d 410, 413     The  |Seventh_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals|United_States_Court_Of_Appeals_For_The_Seventh_Circuit|  upheld the district court ruling in February 2004  granting joint ownership of the characters to Gaiman and McFarlane. On the specific issue of Cogliostro, presiding Judge  |John_C._Shabaz|John_C._Shabaz|  proclaimed, The expressive work that is the comic-book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane—their contributions strike us as quite equal—and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright . See Judge Shabazs   for similar statements on Angela and Medieval Spawn. Similar analysis led to similar results for the other two characters, Angela and Medieval Spawn.     This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically formed Marvels and Miracles,  |LLC|Limited-Liability_Company| , which Gaiman created to help sort out  |the_legal_rights_surrounding_Marvelman|Marvelmanownership_Battle| . Gaiman wrote  Marvel 1602 in 2003 to help fund this project.  All of Marvel Comics profits for the original issues of the series went to Marvels and Miracles. In 2009, Marvel Comics purchased Marvelman.      Gaiman returned to court over three more Spawn characters,  |Dark_Ages_Spawn|Dark_Ages_Spawn| ,  |Domina|Domina|  and  |Tiffany|Tiffany| , that are claimed to be derivative of the three he co-created with McFarlane.  The judge ruled that Gaiman was right in his claims and gave McFarlane until the start of September 2010 to settle matters.        Gaimans work is known for a high degree of  |allusiveness|Allusion| . See particularly Rodney Sharkey, James Fleming, and Zuleyha Cetiner-Oktems articles in ImageTexT s special issue on Gaimans work: . Meredith Collins, for instance, has commented upon the degree to which his novel  Stardust  depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture. Collins, Meredith. Fairy and Faerie: Uses of the Victorian in Neil Gaimans and Charles Vesss Stardust. ImageTexT 4.1.  Particularly in The Sandman, literary figures and characters appear often; the character of Fiddlers Green is modelled visually on  |G._K._Chesterton|G._K._Chesterton| , both  |William_Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare|  and  |Geoffrey_Chaucer|Geoffrey_Chaucer|  appear as characters, as do several characters from within  A Midsummer Nights Dream  See this detailed analysis: . and  The Tempest . The comic also draws from numerous mythologies and historical periods.     Analyzing Gaimans The Graveyard Book, bibliographer and librarian  |Richard_Bleiler|Richard_Bleiler|  detects patterns of and allusions to the Gothic novel, from  |Horace_Walpoles|Horace_Walpole|   The Castle of Otranto  to  |Shirley_Jacksons|Shirley_Jackson|   The Haunting of Hill House . He concludes that Gaiman is utilizing works, characters, themes, and settings that generations of scholars have identified and classified as Gothic, ... subverts them and develops the novel by focusing on the positive aspects of maturation, concentrating on the values of learning, friendship, and sacrifice.  Regarding another works assumed connection and allusions to this form, Gaiman himself quipped: Ive never been able to figure out whether Sandman is a gothic.      Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works, often to the exclusion of his collaborators. Smith, Clay. Get Gaiman?: PolyMorpheus Perversity in Works by and about Neil Gaiman. ImageTexT 4.1.  However, Smiths viewpoint is in the minority: to many, if there is a problem with Gaiman scholarship and intertextuality it is that ... his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work.      David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel  Coraline , where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on  |Sigmund_Freuds|Sigmund_Freud|  notion of  |the_Uncanny|Uncanny| , or the  Unheimlich .      Though Gaimans work is frequently seen as exemplifying the  |monomyth|Monomyth|  structure laid out in  |Joseph_Campbells|Joseph_Campbell|   The Hero with a Thousand Faces , See Stephen Rauch, Neil Gaimans The Sandman and Joseph Campbell: In Search of the Modern Myth, Wildside Press, 2003 Gaiman says that he started reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it: I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true – I dont want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. Id rather do it because its true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is.          |Harvey_Awards|Harvey_Awards|  in the following categories:   1991 Best Writer for The Sandman    1992 Best Writer for The Sandman    1993 Best Continuing or Limited Series for The Sandman    From 1991 to 2014, Gaiman won  |Locus_Awards|Locus_Awards|  in the following categories:   1991 Best Fantasy Novel for  Good Omens  by Gaiman and  |Terry_Pratchett|Terry_Pratchett|     1999 Best Fantasy Novel for  Stardust     2002 Best Fantasy Novel for American Gods    2003 Best Young Adult Book for Coraline    2004 Best Novelette for A Study in Emerald   2005 Best Short Story for Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire   2006 Best Fantasy novel for  Anansi Boys .
