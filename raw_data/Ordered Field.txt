In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an ordered field is a  |field|Field|  together with a  |total_order|Total_Order| ing of its elements that is compatible with the field operations. The basic example of an ordered field is the field of  |real_numbers|Real_Numbers| , and every  |Dedekind-complete|Dedekind-Complete|  ordered field is isomorphic to the reals.     Every  |subfield|Field_Extension|  of an ordered field is also an ordered field in the inherited order. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is  |isomorphic|Isomorphism|  to the  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number| .  |Squares|Square|  are necessarily non-negative in an ordered field. This implies that the  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number|  cannot be ordered since the square of the  |imaginary_unit|Imaginary_Unit|  i is .  |Finite_fields|Finite_Field|  cannot be ordered.     Historically, the  |axiomatization|Axiomatization|  of an ordered field was abstracted gradually from the real numbers, by mathematicians including  |David_Hilbert|David_Hilbert| ,  |Otto_Hölder|Otto_Hölder|  and  |Hans_Hahn|Hans_Hahn| . This grew eventually into the  |Artin–Schreier_theory|Artin–Schreier_Theorem|  of ordered fields and  |formally_real_fields|Formally_Real_Field| .       There are two equivalent common definitions of an ordered field. The definition of total order appeared first historically and is a first-order axiomatization of the ordering ≤ as a  |binary_predicate|Binary_Predicate| . Artin and Schreier gave the definition in terms of positive cone in 1926, which axiomatizes the subcollection of nonnegative elements. Although the latter is higher-order, viewing positive cones as maximal prepositive cones provides a larger context in which field orderings are extremal partial orderings.
