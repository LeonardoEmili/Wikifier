            An orchestra  is a large  |instrumental_ensemble|Musical_Ensemble|  typical of Western  |classical_music|Classical_Music| , which combines instruments from different families, including bowed  |string_instruments|String_Instrument|  such as the  |violin|Violin| ,  |viola|Viola| ,  |cello|Cello| , and  |double_bass|Double_Bass| ,  |brass|Brass_Instrument|  instruments such as the  |horn|French_Horn| ,  |trumpet|Trumpet| ,  |trombone|Trombone|  and  |tuba|Tuba| ,  |woodwinds|Woodwind_Instrument|  such as the  |flute|Flute| ,  |oboe|Oboe| ,  |clarinet|Clarinet|  and  |bassoon|Bassoon| , and  |percussion_instruments|Percussion_Instrument|  such as the  |timpani|Timpani| ,  |bass_drum|Bass_Drum| ,  |triangle|Triangle| ,  |snare_drum|Snare_Drum| ,  |cymbals|Cymbals| , and  |mallet_percussion_instruments|Mallet_Percussion|  each grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the  |piano|Piano|  and  |celesta|Celesta|  may sometimes appear in a fifth  |keyboard_section|Keyboard_Section|  or may stand alone, as may the  |concert_harp|Concert_Harp|  and, for performances of some modern compositions,  |electronic_instruments|Electronic_Musical_Instrument| .     A full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a  or philharmonic orchestra . The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. A   is a smaller-sized ensemble of about fifty musicians or fewer. Orchestras that specialize in the  |Baroque_music|Baroque_Music|  of, for example,  |Johann_Sebastian_Bach|Johann_Sebastian_Bach|  and  |George_Frideric_Handel|George_Frideric_Handel| , or  |Classical|Classical_Music_Period|  repertoire, such as that of  |Haydn|Haydn|  and  |Mozart|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart| , tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a  |Romantic_music|Romantic_Music|  repertoire, such as the  |symphonies|Symphonies|  of  |Johannes_Brahms|Johannes_Brahms| . The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras called for in the works of  |Richard_Wagner|Richard_Wagner| , and later,  |Gustav_Mahler|Gustav_Mahler| .     Orchestras are usually led by a  |conductor|Conducting|  who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a  |conductors_baton|Conductors_Baton| . The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the  |tempo|Tempo|  and shapes the sound of the ensemble.  The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.     The leader of the first violin section, commonly called the  |concertmaster|Concertmaster| , also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the  |Baroque_music|Baroque_Music|  era , orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the  |basso_continuo|Basso_Continuo|  parts on a  |harpsichord|Harpsichord|  or  |pipe_organ|Pipe_Organ| , a tradition that some 20th-century and 21st-century  |early_music|Early_Music|  ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies,  |opera|Opera|  and  |ballet|Ballet| |overtures|Overture| ,  |concertos|Concerto|  for solo instruments, and as  |pit_ensembles|Pit_Orchestra|  for  |operas|Opera| ,  |ballets|Ballet| , and some types of  |musical_theatre|Musical_Theatre|  .     Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school,  |youth_orchestras|Youth_Orchestra| , and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.     The term orchestra derives from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  ὀρχήστρα , the name for the area in front of a stage in  |ancient_Greek_theatre|Ancient_Greek_Theatre|  reserved for the  |Greek_chorus|Greek_Chorus| . , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus                 The invention of the piston and rotary valve by  |Heinrich_Stölzel|Heinrich_Stölzel|  and  |Friedrich_Blühmel|Friedrich_Blühmel| , both  |Silesians|Silesians| , in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by  |Theobald_Boehm|Theobald_Boehm|  and the innovations of  |Adolphe_Sax|Adolphe_Sax|  in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the  |saxophone|Saxophone| . These advances would lead  |Hector_Berlioz|Hector_Berlioz|  to write a landmark book on  |instrumentation|Instrumentation| , which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music. Hector Berlioz. Traite dinstrumentation et dorchestration .       The next major expansion of symphonic practice came from  |Richard_Wagners|Richard_Wagner| |Bayreuth|Bayreuth_Festspielhaus|  orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagners works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to  Das Rheingold  calls for six  |harps|Harp| . Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work On Conducting. Richard Wagner. On Conducting , a treatise on style in the execution of classical music . This brought about a revolution in orchestral  |composition|Musical_Composition| , and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagners theories re-examined the importance of  |tempo|Tempo| ,  |dynamics|Dynamics| , bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra.       As the early 20th century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of  |Gustav_Mahler|Gustav_Mahler|  was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth  |Symphony_No._8|Symphony_No._8| , Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be fixed by audio editing or  |overdubbing|Overdubbing| . Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply getting through the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution. See Lance W. Brunner. . The Orchestra and Recorded Sound , pp.  479–532 in Joan Peyser Ed. The Orchestra: Origins and Transformations, New York: Scribners Sons.            The typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related  |musical_instruments|Musical_Instrument|  called the  |woodwinds|Woodwind_Section| ,  |brass|Brass_Section| ,  |percussion|Percussion_Section| , and  |strings|String_Section| . Other instruments such as the  |piano|Piano|  and  |celesta|Celesta|  may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a  |keyboard_section|Keyboard_Section|  or may stand alone, as may the  |concert_harp|Concert_Harp|  and  |electric_and_electronic|Electronic_Music|  instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.     In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period Jack Westrup, Instrumentation and Orchestration: 3. 1750 to 1800 , New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed., edited by Stanley Sadie . and  |Ludwig_van_Beethovens|Ludwig_Van_Beethoven|  influence on the classical model. D. Kern Holoman, Instrumentation and Orchestration: 4. 19th Century , in ibid. In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed  |electric|Electric_Instrument|  and  |electronic_instruments|Electronic_Instrument|  in various combinations.     The terms symphony orchestra and philharmonic orchestra may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the  |London_Symphony_Orchestra|London_Symphony_Orchestra|  and the  |London_Philharmonic_Orchestra|London_Philharmonic_Orchestra| . A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.     Chamber orchestra usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term concert orchestra may also be used, as in the  |BBC_Concert_Orchestra|Bbc_Concert_Orchestra|  and the  |RTÉ_Concert_Orchestra|Rté_Concert_Orchestra| .       The so-called standard complement of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by  |Beethoven|Ludwig_Van_Beethoven| . The  |composers|Composer|  instrumentation almost always included paired  |flutes|Western_Concert_Flute| ,  |oboes|Oboe| ,  |clarinets|Clarinet| ,  |bassoons|Bassoon| ,  |horns|French_Horn|  and  |trumpets|Trumpet| . The exceptions to this are his  |Symphony_No._4|Symphony_No._4| ,  |Violin_Concerto|Violin_Concerto| , and  |Piano_Concerto_No._4|Piano_Concerto_No._4| , which each specify a single  |flute|Flute| . Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular  |timbral|Timbral|  palette in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the  |Eroica|Symphony_No._3|  Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of choral brass in the Trio movement.  |Piccolo|Piccolo| ,  |contrabassoon|Contrabassoon| , and  |trombones|Trombone|  add to the triumphal finale of his  |Symphony_No._5|Symphony_No._5| . A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the  |Sixth|Symphony_No._6| , also known as the Pastoral Symphony. The  |Ninth|Symphony_No._9|  asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the Eroica ; Beethovens use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned  |percussion|Percussion_Instrument| —plus  |chorus|Choir|  and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic  |instrumentation|Instrumentation|  was faithful to Beethovens well-established model, with few exceptions.          Apart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally. G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, Instrumentation and Orchestration: 5. Impression and Later Developments , in ibid. These include the  |flugelhorn|Flugelhorn|  and  |cornet|Cornet| .  |Saxophones|Saxophone|  and  |classical_guitars|Classical_Guitar| , for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example  |Maurice_Ravels|Maurice_Ravel|  orchestration of  |Modest_Mussorgskys|Modest_Mussorgsky|   Pictures at an Exhibition  and  |Sergei_Rachmaninoffs|Sergei_Rachmaninoff|   Symphonic Dances , the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravels  Boléro ,  |Sergei_Prokofievs|Sergei_Prokofiev| |Romeo_and_Juliet_Suites_1_and_2|Romeo_And_Juliet_Orchestral_Suites_Extracted_From_Romeo_And_Juliet| ,  |Vaughan_Williams|Vaughan_Williams|  Symphonies  |No.6|Symphony_No._6|  and  |9|Symphony_No._9|  and  |William_Waltons|William_Walton| |Belshazzars_Feast|Belshazzars_Feast| , and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The  |euphonium|Euphonium|  is featured in a few late  |Romantic|Romantic_Music|  and  |20th-century|20Th-Century_Classical_Music|  works, usually playing parts marked tenor tuba , including  |Gustav_Holsts|Gustav_Holst|   The Planets , and  |Richard_Strausss|Richard_Strauss|   Ein Heldenleben . The  |Wagner_tuba|Wagner_Tuba| , a modified member of the horn family, appears in  |Richard_Wagners|Richard_Wagner|  cycle  Der Ring des Nibelungen  and several other works by Strauss,  |Béla_Bartók|Béla_Bartók| , and others; it has a prominent role in  |Anton_Bruckners|Anton_Bruckner| |Symphony_No._7_in_E_Major|Symphony_No._7| .  Cornets appear in  |Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovskys|Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky|  ballet  Swan Lake ,  |Claude_Debussys|Claude_Debussy|   La Mer , and several orchestral works by  |Hector_Berlioz|Hector_Berlioz| . Unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument , orchestras typically hire  |freelance|Freelance|  musicians to augment their regular ensemble.     The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors. G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit. In Beethovens and  |Felix_Mendelssohns|Felix_Mendelssohn|  time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and  |sound_effect|Sound_Effect|  such as the  |wind_machine|Wind_Machine| . During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of  |contemporary_classical_music|Contemporary_Classical_Music| , instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer .     With this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five periods: the  |Baroque_era|Baroque_Music| , the  |Classical_music_period|Classical_Music_Period| , early/mid- |Romantic_music|Romantic_Music|  era, late-Romantic/early  |20th-century_music|20Th-Century_Music|  and  |21st-century_era|Contemporary_Classical_Music| . The first is a  |Baroque|Baroque_Music|  orchestra , which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the  |basso_continuo|Basso_Continuo|  group , played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra , which used a smaller group of performers than a  |Romantic_music|Romantic_Music|  orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era ; the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th-century orchestra , to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra .                 ; |Woodwinds|Woodwind_Instrument| |flutes|Flute|    :2–3  |oboes|Oboe|    : |bassoon|Bassoon|      ;

Instruments may include:    |theremin|Theremin| |ondes_Martenot|Ondes_Martenot| |electric_guitar|Electric_Guitar| |electric_bass|Electric_Bass| |Hammond_organ|Hammond_Organ| |Lowrey_organ|Lowrey_Organ| |ring_modulators|Ring_Modulation| |synthesizer|Synthesizer| |novachord|Novachord| |electronic_musical_instruments|Electronic_Musical_Instrument|    Non-musical instruments such as a  |typewriter|Typewriter|  or  |reel-to-reel_tape|Reel-To-Reel_Tape|  player             Among the instrument groups and within each group of instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group has a principal who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an  |accompaniment|Accompaniment|  part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the  |concertmaster|Concertmaster|  and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the  |conductor|Conducting| . The concertmaster leads the pre-concert  |tuning|Musical_Tuning|  and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductors left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.     The principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra , no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.  Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal , or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a  |tutti|Tutti|  part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.     A section string player plays in  |unison|Unison|  with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided  parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to outside and inside seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument . Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.     In modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a  |conductor|Conducting| , although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the  |concertmaster|Concertmaster|  or the  |harpsichord|Harpsichord| ist playing the  |continuo|Basso_Continuo| . Some modern orchestras also do  |without_conductors|Conductorless_Orchestra| , particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate performances of  |baroque|Baroque_Music|  and earlier music.     The most frequently performed repertoire for a  |symphony|Symphony|  orchestra is Western  |classical_music|European_Classical_Music|  or  |opera|Opera| . However, orchestras are used sometimes in  |popular_music|Popular_Music|  , extensively in  |film_music|Film_Music| , and increasingly often in  |video_game_music|Video_Game_Music| . Orchestras are also used in the  |symphonic_metal|Symphonic_Metal|  genre. The term orchestra can also be applied to a  |jazz_ensemble|Jazz_Ensemble| , for example in the performance of  |big-band|Big_Band|  music.
