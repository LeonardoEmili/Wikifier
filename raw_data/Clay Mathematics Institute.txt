     The Clay Mathematics Institute  is a private,  |non_profit|Non_Profit| |_foundation|Foundation| , based in  |Peterborough_New_Hampshire|Peterborough_New_Hampshire| , United States. CMIs scientific activities are managed from the Presidents office in  |Oxford|Oxford| , United Kingdom. The institute is dedicated to increasing and disseminating  |mathematical|Mathematics|  knowledge. It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians. The institute was founded in 1998 through the sponsorship of Boston businessman  |Landon_T_Clay|Landon_T_Clay| .  |Harvard|Harvard_University|  mathematician  |Arthur_Jaffe|Arthur_Jaffe|  was the first president of CMI.     While the institute is best known for its  |Millennium_Prize_Problems|Millennium_Prize_Problems| , it carries out a wide range of activities, including a  |postdoctoral|Postdoctoral|  program , conferences, workshops, and summer schools.       The institute is run according to a standard structure comprising a scientific advisory committee that decides on grant-awarding and research proposals, and a board of directors that oversees and approves the committees decisions. , the board is made up of members of the Clay family, whereas the advisory committee is composed of leading authorities in mathematics, namely  |Sir_Andrew_Wiles|Andrew_Wiles| ,  |Michael_Hopkins|Michael_J_Hopkins| , Carlos Kenig,  |Andrei_Okounkov|Andrei_Okounkov| , and  |Simon_Donaldson|Simon_Donaldson| .  |Martin_R_Bridson|Martin_Bridson|  is the current president of CMI.           The institute is best known for establishing the Millennium Prize Problems on May 24, 2000. These seven problems are considered by CMI to be important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years. For each problem, the first person to solve it will be awarded $1,000,000 by the CMI. In announcing the prize, CMI drew a parallel to  |Hilberts_problems|Hilberts_Problems| , which were proposed in 1900, and had a substantial impact on 20th century mathematics. Of the initial 23 Hilbert problems, most of which have been solved, only the  |Riemann_hypothesis|Riemann_Hypothesis|  is included in the seven Millennium Prize Problems. Arthur Jaffes first-hand account of how this Millennium Prize came about can be read in .     For each problem, the Institute had a professional mathematician write up an official statement of the problem, which will be the main standard by which a given solution will be measured against. The seven problems are:      |P_versus_NP|P_Versus_Np| |_Hodge_conjecture|Hodge_Conjecture| |_Poincaré_conjecture|Poincaré_Conjecture| —solved, by  |Grigori_Perelman|Grigori_Perelman|     The  |Riemann_hypothesis|Riemann_Hypothesis| |_Yang–Mills_existence_and_mass_gap|Yang–Mills_Existence_And_Mass_Gap| |_Navier–Stokes_existence_and_smoothness|Navier–Stokes_Existence_And_Smoothness| |_Birch_and_Swinnerton_Dyer_conjecture|Birch_And_Swinnerton_Dyer_Conjecture|      Some of the mathematicians who were involved in the selection and presentation of the seven problems were  |Michael_Atiyah|Michael_Atiyah| ,  |Enrico_Bombieri|Enrico_Bombieri| ,  |Alain_Connes|Alain_Connes| ,  |Pierre_Deligne|Pierre_Deligne| ,  |Charles_Fefferman|Charles_Fefferman| ,  |John_Milnor|John_Milnor| ,  |David_Mumford|David_Mumford| ,  |Andrew_Wiles|Andrew_Wiles| , and  |Edward_Witten|Edward_Witten| .            In recognition of major breakthroughs in mathematical research, the institute has an annual prize — the Clay Research Award. Its recipients to date are  |Ian_Agol|Ian_Agol| ,  |Manindra_Agrawal|Manindra_Agrawal| ,  |Yves_Benoist|Yves_Benoist| ,  |Manjul_Bhargava|Manjul_Bhargava| , Tristan Buckmaster,  |Danny_Calegari|Danny_Calegari| ,  |Alain_Connes|Alain_Connes| ,  |Nils_Dencker|Nils_Dencker| ,  |Alex_Eskin|Alex_Eskin| ,  |David_Gabai|David_Gabai| ,  |Ben_Green|Ben_J_Green| , Mark Gross,  |Larry_Guth|Larry_Guth| ,  |Christopher_Hacon|Christopher_Hacon| ,  |Richard_S_Hamilton|Richard_S_Hamilton| ,  |Michael_Harris|Michael_Harris| , Philip Isett,  |Jeremy_Kahn|Jeremy_Kahn| ,  |Nets_Katz|Nets_Katz| ,  |Laurent_Lafforgue|Laurent_Lafforgue| ,  |Gérard_Laumon|Gérard_Laumon| , Aleksandr Logunov, Eugenia Malinnikova,  |Vladimir_Markovic|Vladimir_Markovic| ,  |James_McKernan|James_Mckernan| , Jason Miller,  |Maryam_Mirzakhani|Maryam_Mirzakhani| ,  |Ngô_Bảo_Châu|Ngô_Bảo_Châu| ,  |Rahul_Pandharipande|Rahul_Pandharipande| ,  |Jonathan_Pila|Jonathan_Pila| ,  |Jean_François_Quint|Jean_François_Quint| ,  |Peter_Scholze|Peter_Scholze| ,  |Oded_Schramm|Oded_Schramm| , Scott Sheffield, Bernd Siebert,  |Stanislav_Smirnov|Stanislav_Smirnov| ,  |Terence_Tao|Terence_Tao| ,  |Clifford_Taubes|Clifford_Taubes| ,  |Richard_Taylor|Richard_Taylor| , Maryna Viazovska, Vlad Vicol,  |Claire_Voisin|Claire_Voisin| ,  |Jean_Loup_Waldspurger|Jean_Loup_Waldspurger| ,  |Andrew_Wiles|Andrew_Wiles| , Geordie Williamson,  |Edward_Witten|Edward_Witten|  and Wei Zhang.       Besides the Millennium Prize Problems, the Clay Mathematics Institute supports mathematics via the awarding of research fellowships , as well as shorter-term scholarships for programs, individual research, and book writing. The institute also has a yearly  |Clay_Research_Award|Clay_Research_Award| , recognizing major breakthroughs in mathematical research. Finally, the institute organizes a number of summer schools, conferences, workshops, public lectures, and outreach activities aimed primarily at junior mathematicians . CMI publications are available in PDF form at most six months after they appear in print.     The episode of the television series  Elementary  entitled Solve for X  mentions the Clay Mathematics Institute in reference to their involvement in the  |P_versus_NP_problem|P_Versus_Np_Problem| .
