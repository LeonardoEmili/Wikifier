He was primarily known as a guitarist. He also played the mandolin, fiddle, banjo, and ukulele.     Atkinss signature picking style was inspired by  |Merle_Travis|Merle_Travis| . Other major guitar influences were  |Django_Reinhardt|Django_Reinhardt| ,  |George_Barnes|George_Barnes| ,  |Les_Paul|Les_Paul| , and, later,  |Jerry_Reed|Jerry_Reed| . His distinctive picking style and musicianship brought him admirers inside and outside the country scene, both in the United States and abroad.

Rolling Stone  credited Atkins with inventing the popwise Nashville sound that rescued country music from a commercial slump, and ranked him number 21 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time. . Rolling Stone. Among many other honors, Atkins received 14  |Grammy_Awards|Grammy_Award|  and the  |Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award|Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award| . He also received nine  |Country_Music_Association|Country_Music_Association|  awards for Instrumentalist of the Year. He was inducted into the  |Rock_&_Roll_Hall_of_Fame|Rock_&_Roll_Hall_Of_Fame| , the  |Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum|Country_Music_Hall_Of_Fame_And_Museum| , and the  |Musicians_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum|Musicians_Hall_Of_Fame_And_Museum| . George Harrison was also inspired by Chet Atkins; Early Beatle songs such as All my Loving show the influence.           Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in  |Luttrell,_Tennessee|Luttrell,_Tennessee| , near  |Clinch_Mountain|Clinch_Mountain| . His parents divorced when he was six years old, after which he was raised by his mother. He was the youngest of three boys and a girl. He started out on the  |ukulele|Ukulele| , later moving on to the  |fiddle|Fiddle| , but made a swap with his brother, Lowell, when he was nine: an old pistol and some chores for a  |guitar|Guitar| .  He stated in his 1974 autobiography, We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression. Forced to relocate to Fortson,  |Georgia|Georgia| , outside of  |Columbus|Columbus,_Georgia| , to live with his father because of a critical  |asthma|Asthma|  condition, Atkins was a sensitive youth who made music his obsession. Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair to breathe comfortably. On those nights, he played his guitar until he fell asleep holding it, a habit that lasted his whole life. Atkins, Chet; Neely, Bill . Country Gentleman . Chicago. Harry Regnery. . While living in Fortson, he attended the historic Mountain Hill School. He returned in the 1990s to play a series of charity concerts to save the school from demolition.    Stories have been told about the very young Chet, who, when a friend or relative would come to visit and play guitar, would crowd in and put his ear so close to the instrument that it became difficult for the visitor to play.     Atkins became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school. He used the restroom in the school to practice, because it had good acoustics. Atkins, Chet; Neely, Bill . Country Gentleman .

His first guitar had a nail for a nut and was so bowed that only the first few frets could be used. Atkins, Chet; Cochran, Russ . Me and My Guitars . Milwaukee: Hal Leonard. . He later purchased a semi-acoustic electric guitar and amp, but he had to travel many miles to find an electrical outlet, since his home didnt have electricity. Atkins, Chet; Neely, Bill. . Country Gentleman . Chicago. Harry Regnery. pp. 61–62. .     Later in life, he lightheartedly gave himself  the honorary degree CGP .   In 2011, his daughter Merle Atkins Russell bestowed the CGP degree on his longtime sideman  |Paul_Yandell|Paul_Yandell| . She then declared no more CGPs would be allowed by the Atkins estate.      His half-brother, Jim, was a successful guitarist who worked with the  |Les_Paul_Trio|Les_Paul_Trio|  in New York.     Atkins did not have a strong style of his own until 1939, when he heard  |Merle_Travis|Merle_Travis|  picking over  |WLW|Wlw|  radio.   This early influence dramatically shaped his unique playing style. Whereas Traviss right hand used his index finger for the melody and thumb for bass notes, Atkins expanded his right-hand style to include picking with his first three fingers, with the thumb on bass.     Chet Atkins was an  |amateur_radio|Amateur_Radio|  general class licensee. Formerly using the call sign WA4CZD, he obtained the vanity call sign W4CGP in 1998 to include the CGP designation, which supposedly stood for Certified Guitar Picker . He was a member of the  |American_Radio_Relay_League|American_Radio_Relay_League| .        After dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at  |WNOX-AM|Wnox|  radio in  |Knoxville|Knoxville,_Tennessee| , where he played fiddle and guitar with the singer  |Bill_Carlisle|Bill_Carlisle|  and the comic  |Archie_Campbell|Archie_Campbell|  and became a member of the stations Dixieland Swingsters, a small swing instrumental combo. After three years, he moved to  |WLW-AM|Wlw|  in  |Cincinnati,_Ohio|Cincinnati,_Ohio| , where Merle Travis had formerly worked.     After six months, he moved to Raleigh and worked with  |Johnnie_and_Jack|Johnnie_And_Jack|  before heading for  |Richmond,_Virginia|Richmond,_Virginia| , where he performed with  |Sunshine_Sue_Workman|Sunshine_Sue| . Atkinss shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly country . He was fired often, but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing ability.     Atkins and  |Jethro_Burns|Jethro_Burns|   married twin sisters, Leona and Lois Johnson, who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson, the Johnson Sisters. Leona Atkins outlived her husband by eight years, dying in 2009 at the age of 85.      Travelling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for  |Red_Foley|Red_Foley| , who was leaving his star position on  |WLS-AMs|Wls|   National Barn Dance  to join the  |Grand_Ole_Opry|Grand_Ole_Opry| .  Rolling Stone. Accessed on March 28, 2008. Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foleys band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based  |Bullet_Records|Bullet_Records|  that year. That single, Guitar Blues , was fairly progressive, including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan, with  |Owen_Bradley|Owen_Bradley|  on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry, but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to  |KWTO|Kwto|  in  |Springfield,_Missouri|Springfield,_Missouri| . Despite the support of executive  |Si_Siman|Si_Siman| , however, he soon was fired for not sounding country enough .       While working with a Western band in  |Denver,_Colorado|Denver,_Colorado| , Atkins came to the attention of  |RCA_Victor|Rca_Victor_Records| . Siman had been encouraging  |Steve_Sholes|Stephen_H._Sholes|  to sign Atkins, as his style was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A & R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down in Denver.     He made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947, but they did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year, but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOXs new Saturday night radio show The Tennessee Barn Dance and the popular Midday Merry Go Round.     In 1949, he left WNOX to join  |June_Carter|June_Carter|  with Mother Maybelle and the  |Carter_Sisters|The_Carter_Sisters|  on KWTO. This incarnation of the old  |Carter_Family|Carter_Family|  featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen, and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to  |Nashville|Nashville,_Tennessee|  in the mid-1950s. Atkins began working on recording sessions and performing on  |WSM-AM|Wsm|  and the Opry. Atkins became a member of the Opry in the 1950s.      While he had not yet had a hit record for RCA Victor, his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a session leader when the New York–based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkinss first hit single was  |Mr._Sandman|Mr._Sandman|  , followed by Silver Bell , which he recorded as a duet with  |Hank_Snow|Hank_Snow| . His albums also became more popular. He was featured on ABC-TVs  The Eddy Arnold Show  in the summer of 1956 and on  Country Music Jubilee  in 1957 and 1958 .        In addition to recording, Atkins was a design consultant for  |Gretsch|Gretsch| , which manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955–1980. He became manager of RCA Victors Nashville studios, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary  |RCA_Studio_B|Rca_Studio_B| , the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous  |Music_Row|Music_Row| . Also later on, Chet and  |Owen_Bradley|Owen_Bradley|  would become instrumental in the creation of studio B’s adjacent building  |RCA_Studio_A|Rca_Studio_A|  as well.       When Sholes took over pop production in 1957—a result of his success with  |Elvis_Presley|Elvis_Presley| —he put Atkins in charge of RCA Victors Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular, Atkins and  |Bob_Ferguson|Bob_Ferguson|  took their cue from  |Owen_Bradley|Owen_Bradley|  and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the  |Nashville_sound|Nashville_Sound| , which Atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country viable.     Atkins used the  |Jordanaires|Jordanaires|  and a rhythm section on hits such as  |Jim_Reevess|Jim_Reeves| |Four_Walls|Four_Walls|  and  |Hell_Have_to_Go|Hell_Have_To_Go|   Allmusic entry for Welcome to My World, Jim Reeves 1996 box set, Bear Family Records and  |Don_Gibsons|Don_Gibson| |Oh_Lonesome_Me|Oh_Lonesome_Me|  and Blue Blue Day .  Allmusic biography of Don Gibson The once-rare phenomenon of having a country hit  |cross_over|Crossover|  to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the drivers seat, guiding an artists choice of material and the musical background.     Atkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and  |jazz|Jazz| , in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA and adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him. Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period, he became known internationally as Mister Guitar , inspiring an album,  Mister Guitar , engineered by both Bob Ferris and  |Bill_Porter|Bill_Porter| , Ferriss replacement.        At the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCAs Nashville studio, in the space eventually known as  |Studio_B|Rca_Studio_B|  after the facility expanded with a second studio in 1960. Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studios German effects device, an  |EMT|Elektro-Mess-Technik| |plate_reverb|Reverberationplate_Reverberators| . With his  |golden_ear|Golden_Ear| , Porter found the studios acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant  |room_modes|Room_Modes| . The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more  |dynamic|Dynamic_Range| .  In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him it was Porter.  Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune, he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, we got a little tuning problem  ... Everybody check and see whats going on. If that did not work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late-1964, Atkins said, the sound was never the same, never as great.     Atkinss trademark Atkins style of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis,  occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger , and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers—and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.     He enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians, and they were asked to perform at the  |Newport_Jazz_Festival|Newport_Jazz_Festival|  in 1960. That performance was cancelled because of rioting, but a live recording of the group  was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the  |White_House|White_House|  for every U.S. President from John F. Kennedy through to George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the  |Million_Dollar_Band|Million_Dollar_Band|  during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song Yankee Doodle Dixie , in which he played  |Yankee_Doodle|Yankee_Doodle|  and  |Dixie|Dixie|  simultaneously, on the same guitar.     Before his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCAs country division. In 1987, he told  |Nine-O-One_Network_magazine|Nine-O-One_Network_Magazine|  that he was ashamed of his promotion: I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president. Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine, December 1987, p.10-11 He had brought  |Waylon_Jennings|Waylon_Jennings| ,  |Willie_Nelson|Willie_Nelson| ,  |Connie_Smith|Connie_Smith| ,  |Bobby_Bare|Bobby_Bare| ,  |Dolly_Parton|Dolly_Parton| ,  |Jerry_Reed|Jerry_Reed| , and  |John_Hartford|John_Hartford|  to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others. , Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the  |civil_rights_movement|Civil_Rights_Movement|  sparked violence throughout the South, by signing country musics first African-American singer,  |Charley_Pride|Charley_Pride| , who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.     Atkinss biggest hit single came in 1965, with Yakety Axe , an adaptation of  |Yakety_Sax|Yakety_Sax|  , by his friend, the saxophonist  |Boots_Randolph|Boots_Randolph| . He rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other RCA producers, such as  |Bob_Ferguson|Bob_Ferguson|  and  |Felton_Jarvis|Felton_Jarvis| , to lessen his workload.       In the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records, but could still turn out hits such as  |Perry_Comos|Perry_Como|  1973 pop hit  |And_I_Love_You_So|And_I_Love_You_So|  . He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who had become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of  |colon_cancer|Colorectal_Cancer| , however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with Reed or even Jethro Burns from Homer and Jethro after Homer died in 1971. Atkins would turn over his administrative duties to  |Jerry_Bradley|Jerry_Bradley| , son of Owen, in 1973 at RCA.     Atkins did little production work at RCA after stepping down and in fact, had hired producers at the label in the 1960s, among them  |Bob_Ferguson|Bob_Ferguson|  and  |Felton_Jarvis|Felton_Jarvis| . As a recording artist, Atkins grew disillusioned with RCA in the late 1970s. He felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into jazz. He had also produced late 60s jazz recordings by Canadian guitarist  |Lenny_Breau|Lenny_Breau| , a friend and protege. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences,  |Les_Paul|Les_Paul| ,  Chester & Lester  and  Guitar Monsters , had already reflected that interest; Chester & Lester was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkinss career. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with  |Gibson|Gibson_Guitar_Corporation| . Atkins ended his 35-year association with RCA in 1982 and signed with  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records| , for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.     Jazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by pure country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a country guitarist, insisting that he was a guitarist, period. Although he played  |by_ear|Playing_By_Ear|  and was a masterful improviser, he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When  |Roger_C._Field|Roger_C._Field| , a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer, he did so with  |Suzy_Bogguss|Suzy_Bogguss| .     He returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with  |Mark_Knopfler|Mark_Knopfler|  and Jerry Reed. Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend  |Tommy_Emmanuel|Tommy_Emmanuel| .

In later years, he even went back to radio, appearing on  |Garrison_Keillors|Garrison_Keillor|   Prairie Home Companion  radio program, on  |American_Public_Media|American_Public_Media|  radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time, and performing songs such as  |Bob_Willss|Bob_Wills| |Corrina,_Corrina|Corrina,_Corrina|  and  |Willie_Nelsons|Willie_Nelson| |Seven_Spanish_Angels|Seven_Spanish_Angels|  with Nelson on a 1985 broadcast of the show at the Bridges Auditorium on the campus of  |Pomona_College|Pomona_College| .       Atkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy awards and nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year. In 1993, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Billboard magazine awarded him its Century Award, its highest honor for distinguished creative achievement, in December 1997. . Rolling Stone. Accessed on May 10, 2008.     Atkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of the stride pianist  |James_P._Johnsons|James_P._Johnson|  Johnson Rag , all the way to the rock stylings of  |Eric_Johnson|Eric_Johnson| , an invited guest on Atkinss recording sessions, who, when Atkins attempted to copy his influential rocker  |Cliffs_of_Dover|Cliffs_Of_Dover|  , led to Atkinss creation of a unique arrangement of Londonderry Air .     The classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded  |smooth_jazz|Smooth_Jazz|  guitar still played on American airwaves today.
