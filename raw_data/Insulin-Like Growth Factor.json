These proteins help to modulate IGF action in complex ways that involve both inhibiting IGF action by preventing binding to the IGF-1 receptor as well as promoting IGF action possibly through aiding in delivery to the receptor and increasing IGF half-life. Currently, there are seven characterized IGF Binding Proteins . There is currently significant data suggesting that IGFBPs play important roles in addition to their ability to regulate IGFs.   IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are GH dependent, whereas IGFBP-1 is insulin regulated.   IGFBP-1 production from the liver is significantly elevated during insulinopenia while serum levels of bioactive IGF-1 is increased by insulin.

It is somewhat difficult to relate this finding to the mammals, however, because in the smaller organism there are many genes  that are insulin-like or IGF-1-like , whereas in the mammals insulin-like proteins comprise only seven members . The human insulin-like genes have apparently distinct roles with some but less crosstalk presumably because there are multiple insulin-receptor-like proteins in humans. Simpler organisms typically have fewer receptors; for example, only one insulin-like receptor exists in the nematode C. elegans.  Additionally, C. elegans do not have specialized organs such as the , which sense insulin in response to glucose homeostasis. Moreover, IGF1 affects lifespan in nematodes by causing dauer formation, a developmental stage of C. elegans larva. There is no mammalian correlate. Therefore, it is an open question as to whether either IGF-1 or insulin in the mammal may perturb aging, although there is the suggestion that dietary restriction phenomena may be related.
