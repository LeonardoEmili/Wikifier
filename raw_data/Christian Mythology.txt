Christian mythology is the  |body_of_myths|Mythology|  associated with  |Christianity|Christianity|  and the  |Bible|Bible| . The term encompasses a broad variety of  |legends|Legend|  and stories, especially those considered sacred narratives. Mythological  |themes_and_elements|Mytheme|  occur throughout Christian literature, including recurring myths such as ascending to a mountain, the  axis mundi , myths of combat,  |descent_into_the_Underworld|Katabasis| , accounts of a  |dying_and_rising_god|Dying_And_Rising_God| ,  |flood_stories|Flood_Myth| , stories about the founding of a tribe or city, and myths about great  |hero|Hero| es  of the past,  |paradises|Paradise| , and  |self_sacrifice|Self_Sacrifice| .     Various authors have also used it to refer to other mythological and  |allegorical|Allegory|  elements found in the  |Bible|Bible| , such as the story of the  |Leviathan|Leviathan| . The term has been applied to myths and legends from the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , such as the story of  |Saint_George_and_the_Dragon|Saint_George_And_The_Dragon| , the stories of  |King_Arthur|King_Arthur|  and his  |Knights_of_the_Round_Table|Knights_Of_The_Round_Table| , and the legends of the  Parsival . Multiple commentators have classified  |John_Miltons|John_Milton|  epic poem  Paradise Lost  as a work of Christian mythology. The term has also been applied to modern stories revolving around Christian themes and motifs, such as the writings of  |C_S_Lewis|C_S_Lewis| ,  |J_R_R_Tolkien|J_R_R_Tolkien| ,  |Madeleine_LEngle|Madeleine_Lengle| , and  |George_MacDonald|George_Macdonald| .     Over the centuries, Christianity has divided into many  |denominations|Christian_Denomination| . Not all of these denominations hold the same set of sacred traditional narratives. For example, the  |books_of_the_Bible|Books_Of_The_Bible|  accepted by the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church|  and the  |Eastern_Orthodox_churches|Eastern_Orthodoxy|  include a number of texts and stories  that many  |Protestant|Protestantism|  denominations do not accept as  |canonical|Canonical_Gospel| .          Christian theologian and professor of  |New_Testament|New_Testament| ,  |Rudolf_Bultmann|Rudolf_Bultmann|  wrote that:      The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially  |myth|Myth| ical in character. The world is viewed as a three storied structure, with the earth in the center, the heaven above, and the underworld beneath. Heaven is the abode of God and of celestial beings -- the angels. The underworld is hell, the place of torment. Even the earth is more than the scene of natural, everyday events, of the trivial round and common task. It is the scene of the supernatural activity of God and his angels on the one hand, and of Satan and his demons on the other. These supernatural forces intervene in the course of nature and in all that men think and will and do. Miracles are by no means rare. Man is not in control of his own life. Evil spirits may take possession of him. Satan may inspire him with evil thoughts. Alternatively, God may inspire his thought and guide his purposes. He may grant him heavenly visions. He may allow him to hear his word of succor or demand. He may give him the supernatural power of his Spirit. History does not follow a smooth unbroken course; it is set in motion and controlled by these supernatural powers. This æon is held in bondage by Satan, sin, and death , and hastens towards its end. That end will come very soon, and will take the form of a cosmic catastrophe. It will be inaugurated by the woes of the last time. Then the Judge will come from heaven, the dead will rise, the last judgment will take place, and men will enter into eternal salvation or damnation.            In its broadest academic sense, the word myth simply means a traditional story. However, many scholars restrict the term myth to sacred stories.   |Folklorists|Folklorists|  often go further, defining myths as tales believed as true, usually sacred, set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world, and with extra-human, inhuman, or heroic characters .      In  |classical_Greek|Ancient_Greek_Language| , muthos, from which the English word myth derives, meant story, narrative. By the time of Christ, muthos had started to take on the connotations of fable, fiction, Eliade, Myth and Reality , p. 162 and early Christian writers often avoided calling a story from canonical scripture a  |myth|Myth|  . Sullivan  |Paul|Paul_The_Apostle|  warned  |Timothy|Saint_Timothy|  to have nothing to do with godless and silly myths .  . This negative meaning of myth passed into popular usage. Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, pp. 23 Some modern Christian scholars and writers have attempted to rehabilitate the term myth outside academia, describing stories in canonical scripture as true myth ; examples include  |C_S_Lewis|C_S_Lewis|  and  |Andrew_Greeley|Andrew_Greeley| . C. S. Lewis used the expression true myth to describe the story of Jesus Christ: The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is Gods myth where the others are mens myths . Andrew Greeley stated: Many Christians have objected to my use of this word even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith . Several modern Christian writers, such as  |C_S_Lewis|C_S_Lewis| , have described elements of Christianity, particularly the story of Christ, as myth which is also true . Sammons 231 Dorrien 236 and throughout Lazo 210 Others object to associating Christianity with myth for a variety of reasons: the association of the term myth with polytheism, Henry, chapter 3 Tyndale House Publishers 9 the use of the term myth to indicate falsehood or non-historicity, Nwachukwu 47 Holman Bible Publishers 896 Hamilton 56-57 and the lack of an agreed-upon definition of myth .

Christian tradition contains many stories that do not come from  |canonical_Christian_texts|Biblical_Canon|  yet still illustrate  |Christian|Christianity|  themes. These non-canonical Christian myths include legends, folktales, and elaborations on canonical Christian mythology. Christian tradition has produced a rich body of legends that were never incorporated into the official scriptures. Legends were a staple of medieval literature. Guerber, p. 2 Examples include  |hagiographies|Hagiography|  such as the stories of  |Saint_George|Saint_George|  or  |Saint_Valentine|Saint_Valentine| . A case in point is the historical and canonized  |Brendan_of_Clonfort|Brendan| , a 6th-century Irish churchman and founder of abbeys. Round his authentic figure was woven a tissue that is arguably  |legend|Legend| ary rather than historical: the Navigatio or Journey of Brendan . The legend discusses mythic events in the sense of supernatural encounters. In this narrative, Brendan and his shipmates encounter sea monsters, a  |paradisal_island|Paradise|  and a floating ice islands and a rock island inhabited by a holy hermit: literal-minded devotés still seek to identify Brendans islands in actual geography. This voyage was recreated by  |Tim_Severin|Tim_Severin| , suggesting that  |whales|Whale| ,  |icebergs|Iceberg|  and  |Rockall|Rockall|  were encountered.      Folktales form a major part of non-canonical Christian tradition. Folklorists define folktales as stories that are considered purely fictitious by their tellers and that often lack a specific setting in space or time. Segal, p. 5; Zong In-Sob, p. xxi; Welker Christian-themed folktales have circulated widely among peasant populations. One widespread folktale genre is that of the Penitent Sinner ; another popular group of folktales describe a clever mortal who outwits the Devil. Degh, p. 67 Not all scholars accept the folkloristic convention of applying the terms myth and folktale to different categories of traditional narrative. Segal, p. 5     Christian tradition produced many popular stories elaborating on canonical scripture. According to an English folk belief, certain herbs gained their current healing power from having been used to heal  |Christs|Christ|  wounds on  |Mount_Calvary|Mount_Calvary| . In this case, a non-canonical story has a connection to a non-narrative form of  |folklore|Folklore|  — namely,  |folk_medicine|Folk_Medicine| . Eliade, Cosmos and History, pp. 30-31  |Arthurian_legend|Arthurian_Legend|  contains many elaborations upon canonical mythology. For example,  |Sir_Balin|Sir_Balin|  discovers the  |Lance_of_Longinus|Lance_Of_Longinus| , which had pierced the side of Christ. Thomas Malory, Le Morte dArthur 2:16 According to a tradition widely attested in early Christian writings,  |Adams|Adam|  skull lay buried at Calvary; when Christ was crucified, his blood fell over Adams skull, symbolizing humanitys redemption from Adams sin. Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, p. 375; Wilson, pp. 159-66         |Gospel|Gospel|  accounts of  |Jesus_Christ|Jesus_Christ| , his life and death. Here the narrative is combined by the author with a story of how all Christian theology came to be . For example, the story of Jesus as the word or  |Logos|Logosuse_In_Christianity|  , the  |Incarnation|Incarnation|  of the Logos or  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_Godjesus_As_Divine|  as the man Jesus , and Christs  |atonement|Atonement_In_Christianity|  for humanitys sins .
