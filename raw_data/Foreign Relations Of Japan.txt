Japanese foreign relations had earliest beginnings in 14th century and after their opening to the world in 1854 with the  |Convention_of_Kanagawa|Convention_Of_Kanagawa| . Japan rapidly modernized and built a strong military. It was imperialistic seeking control of nearby areas --with major wars against China and Russia. It gained control of parts of China and Manchuria, as well as Korea and islands such as Taiwan and Okinawa. It lost in World War II and was stripped of all of its foreign conquests and possessions.

Japan has continued to extend significant support to development and technical assistance projects in  |Latin_America|Latin_America| .                By 1990 Japans interaction with the vast majority of Asia-Pacific countries, especially its burgeoning economic exchanges, was multifaceted and increasingly important to the recipient countries. The developing countries of the  |Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|Association_Of_Southeast_Asian_Nations|  regarded Japan as critical to their development. Japans aid to the ASEAN countries totaled US$1.9 billion in Japanese fiscal year 1988 versus about US$333 million for the  |United_States|United_States|  during U.S. FY 1988. Japan was the number one foreign investor in the ASEAN countries, with cumulative investment as of March 1989 of about US$14.5 billion, more than twice that of the United States. Japans share of total foreign investment in ASEAN countries in the same period ranged from 70 to 80 percent in  |Thailand|Thailand|  to 20 percent in  |Indonesia|Indonesia| .     In the late 1980s, the Japanese government was making a concerted effort to enhance its diplomatic stature, especially in Asia.  |Toshiki_Kaifus|Toshiki_Kaifu|  much publicized spring 1991 tour of five Southeast Asian nations— |Malaysia|Malaysia| ,  |Brunei|Brunei| , Thailand,  |Singapore|Singapore| , and the  |Philippines|Philippines| —culminated in a 3 May major foreign policy address in Singapore, in which he called for a new partnership with the ASEAN and pledged that Japan would go beyond the purely economic sphere to seek an appropriate role in the political sphere as a nation of peace. As evidence of this new role, Japan took an active part in promoting negotiations to resolve the  |Cambodia|Cambodia| n conflict.     In 1997, the ASEAN member nations and the Peoples Republic of China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the  |ASEAN_Plus_Three|Asean_Plus_Three|  meetings. In 2005 the ASEAN plus Three countries together with  |India|India| ,  |Australia|Australia|  and  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  held the inaugural  |East_Asia_Summit|East_Asia_Summit|  .       In  |South_Asia|South_Asia| , Japans role is mainly that of an aid donor. Japans aid to seven South Asian countries totaled US$1.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, dropping to just under US$900 million in 1990. Except for  |Pakistan|Pakistan| , which received heavy inputs of aid from the United States, all other South Asian countries receive most of their aid from Japan. Four South Asian nations— |India|India| , Pakistan,  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| , and  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka| —are in the top ten list of Tokyos aid recipients worldwide. A point to note is that Indian Government has a no receive aid policy since the tsunami that struck India but Indian registered NGOs look to Japan for much investment in their projects     Prime Minister  |Toshiki_Kaifu|Toshiki_Kaifu|  signaled a broadening of Japans interest in South Asia with his swing through the region in April 1990. In an address to the  |Indian_parliament|Indian_Parliament| , Kaifu stressed the role of free markets and democracy in bringing about a new international order, and he emphasized the need for a settlement of the  |Kashmir_territorial_dispute|Kashmir_Conflict|  between India and Pakistan and for economic liberalization to attract foreign investment and promote dynamic growth. To India, which was very short of hard currency, Kaifu pledged a new concessional loan of ¥100 billion for the coming year.                  In what became known as the  |Tenshō_embassy|Tenshō_Embassy| , the first ambassadors from Japan to European powers reached  |Lisbon|Lisbon| , Portugal in August 1584. From Lisbon, the ambassadors left for the  |Vatican|Holy_See|  in Rome, which was the main goal of their journey. The embassy returned to Japan in 1590, after which time the four nobleman ambassadors were ordained by  |Alessandro_Valignano|Alessandro_Valignano|  as the  |first_Japanese_Jesuit_fathers|History_Of_Roman_Catholicism_In_Japan| .     A second embassy, headed by  |Hasekura_Tsunenaga|Hasekura_Tsunenaga|  and sponsored by  |Date_Masamune|Date_Masamune| , was also a diplomatic mission to the Vatican. The embassy left 28 October 1613 from  |Ishinomaki|Ishinomaki,_Miyagi| ,  |Miyagi_Prefecture|Miyagi_Prefecture| , in the northern  |Tōhoku_region|Tōhoku_Region|  of Japan, where Date was  daimyō . It traveled to Europe by way of  |New_Spain|New_Spain| , arriving in  |Acapulco|Acapulco|  on 25 January 1614,  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City|  in March,  |Havana|Havana|  in July, and finally  |Seville|Seville|  on 23 October 1614. After a short stop-over in France, the embassy reached Rome in November 1615, where it was received by  |Pope_Paul_V|Pope_Paul_V| . After return travel by way of  |New_Spain|New_Spain|  and the  |Philippines|Philippines| , the embassy reached the harbor of  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki|  in August 1620. While the embassy was gone, Japan had undergone significant change, starting with the 1614  |Osaka_Rebellion|Siege_Of_Osaka| , leading to a 1616 decree from the  |Tokugawa_shogunate|Tokugawa_Shogunate|  that all interaction with non-Chinese foreigners was confined to  |Hirado|Hirado|  and  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki| . In fact, the only western country that was allowed to trade with Japan was the Dutch Republic. This was the beginning of  |sakoku|Sakoku|  , where Japan was essentially closed to the western world until 1854.          The cultural and non-economic ties with  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe|  grew significantly during the 1980s, although the economic nexus remained by far the most important element of Japanese – West European relations throughout the decade. Events in West European relations, as well as political, economic, or even military matters, were topics of concern to most Japanese commentators because of the immediate implications for Japan. The major issues centred on the effect of the coming West European economic unification on Japans trade, investment, and other opportunities in Western Europe. Some West European leaders were anxious to restrict Japanese access to the newly integrated  |European_Union|European_Union| , but others appeared open to Japanese trade and investment. In partial response to the strengthening economic ties among nations in Western Europe and to the United States–Canada–Mexico  |North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement| , Japan and other countries along the Asia-Pacific rim began moving in the late 1980s toward greater economic cooperation.     On 18 July 1991, after several months of difficult negotiations,  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Japan| |Toshiki_Kaifu|Toshiki_Kaifu|  signed a joint statement with the  |Dutch_prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_Netherlands|  and head of the European Community Council,  |Ruud_Lubbers|Ruud_Lubbers| , and with the  |European_Commission|European_Commission|  president,  |Jacques_Delors|Jacques_Delors| , pledging closer Japanese – European Community consultations on foreign relations, scientific and technological cooperation, assistance to developing countries, and efforts to reduce trade conflicts.  |Japanese_Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs|Japanese_Ministry_Of_Foreign_Affairs|  officials hoped that this agreement would help to broaden Japanese – European Community political links and raise them above the narrow confines of trade disputes.                           Japan has formally  |issued_apologies|List_Of_War_Apology_Statements_Issued_By_Japan|  for its  |military_occupations|Military_Occupation|  before and during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , but that has done little in helping to improve its relations with its neighbors, especially  |China|China| ,  |North_Korea|North_Korea|  and  |South_Korea|South_Korea| . They still insist that Japan has yet to formally express remorse for its wrongdoings in the 20th century, despite some formal statements of regret from  |Prime_Ministers|Prime_Minister_Of_Japan| |Hosokawa_Morihiro|Hosokawa_Morihiro|  and  |Murayama_Tomiichi|Murayama_Tomiichi| . Japans official stance claims that all war-related reparation claims have been resolved . Unofficial visits to the controversial  |Yasukuni_Jinja|Yasukuni_Jinja|  by past Prime Ministers belonging to the  |Liberal_Democratic_Party|Liberal_Democratic_Party|  and the  |exclusion_or_generalization_of_some_elements_of_Japans_military_history_in_a_number_school_textbooks|Japanese_History_Textbook_Controversies|  have also clouded the issue. In 2004, China and the two Koreas criticized Japan for sending its  |Ground_Self_Defence_Forces|Japan_Ground_Self-Defense_Force|  to  |Iraq|Iraq| , which was seen as signalling a return to  |militarism|Militarism| . The government of Japan claimed that its forces would only participate in reconstruction and humanitarian aid missions.     As a result, there is a strong  |anti-Japanese_sentiment|Anti-Japanese_Sentiment|  in China and the two Koreas, although Antagonism is not inevitable. Both Japan and South Korea successfully hosted the  |2002_FIFA_World_Cup|2002_Fifa_World_Cup| , bridging a physical and political gap between the two countries. Additionally, the great popularity in Japan of  |Bae_Yong-joon|Bae_Yong-Joon| , a South Korean actor, has also been seen as a sign that the two countries have moved closer together.          Japan has several  |territorial_disputes|Territorial_Dispute|  with its neighbors concerning the control of certain outlying islands.     Japan contests  |Russias|Russia|  control of the  |Southern_Kuril_Islands|Kuril_Islands_Dispute|  which were occupied by the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  in 1945. MOFA,    |South_Koreas|South_Korea|  assertions concerning  |Liancourt_Rocks|Liancourt_Rocks|  are acknowledged, but not accepted by Japan. MOFA,   Japan has strained relations with the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|China|  and the  |Republic_of_China|Taiwan|  over the  |Senkaku_Islands|Senkaku_Islands| ; MOFA,   and with the Peoples Republic of China over the status of  |Okinotorishima|Okinotorishima| .     These disputes are in part about  |irredentism|Irredentism| ; and they are also about the control of marine and natural resources, such as possible reserves of  |crude_oil|Crude_Oil|  and  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas| .
