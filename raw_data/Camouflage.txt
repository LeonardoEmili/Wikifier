              Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see , or by disguising them as something else . Examples include the  |leopards|Leopard|  spotted coat, the  |battledress|Battledress|  of a modern  |soldier|Soldier| , and the  |leaf_mimic_katydids|Leaf_Mimic_Katydid|  wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast  |disruptive_coloration|Disruptive_Coloration| , eliminating shadow, and  |countershading|Countershading| . In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the  |ability_to_produce_light|Bioluminescence|  is among other things used for  |counter_illumination|Counter_Illumination|  on the undersides of  |cephalopods|Cephalopod|  such as  |squid|Squid| . Some animals, such as  |chameleons|Chameleon|  and  |octopus|Octopus| es, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. It is possible that some plants use camouflage to evade being eaten by  |herbivores|Herbivore| .      |Military_camouflage|Military_Camouflage|  was spurred by the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate  |musket|Musket|  with the  |rifle|Rifle|  made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . On land, artists such as  |André_Mare|André_Mare|  designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees.  |At_sea|Ship_Camouflage| , merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in  |dazzle|Dazzle_Camouflage|  patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the targets speed, range, and heading. During and after the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , a variety of camouflage schemes were used for  |aircraft|Aircraft_Camouflage|  and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.     Non-military use of camouflage includes making  |cell_telephone_towers|Cell_Site|  less obtrusive and helping hunters to approach wary game animals. Patterns derived from military camouflage are frequently used in fashion clothing, exploiting their strong designs and sometimes their symbolism. Camouflage themes recur in modern art, and both figuratively and literally in science fiction and works of literature.          In ancient Greece,  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  commented on the colour-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for  |signalling|Signalling_Theory| , of  |cephalopods|Cephalopod|  including the octopus, in his  Historia animalium Historia Animalium. IX, 622a: 2–10. Cited in Borrelli, Luciana;  |Gherardi_Francesca|Francesca_Gherardi| ; Fiorito, Graziano . A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda. Firenze University Press. .           Camouflage has been a topic of interest and research in  |zoology|Zoology|  for well over a century. According to  |Charles_Darwins|Charles_Darwin|  1859 theory of  |natural_selection|Natural_Selection| , features such as camouflage  |evolved|Evolution|  by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage, enabling them to leave more offspring, on average, than other members of the same  |species|Species| . In his  Origin of Species , Darwin wrote:               The English zoologist  |Edward_Bagnall_Poulton|Edward_Bagnall_Poulton|  studied  |animal_coloration|Animal_Coloration| , especially camouflage. In his 1890 book  The Colours of Animals , he classified different types such as special protective resemblance , or general aggressive resemblance . His experiments showed that  |swallow_tailed_moth|Swallow_Tailed_Moth| |_pupae|Pupae|  were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as  |larvae|Larvae| . Poultons general protective resemblance  was at that time considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when  |Frank_Evers_Beddard|Frank_Evers_Beddard|  wrote in 1892 that tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of  |parrots|Parrot| ,  |iguanas|Iguana| ,  |tree_frogs|Tree_Frog| , and the  |green_tree_snake|Morelia_Viridis|  are examples . Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the alluring coloration of the  |flower_mantis|Hymenopus_Bicornis|  and the possibility of a different mechanism in the  |orange_tip_butterfly|Anthocharis_Cardamines| . He wrote that the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant an  |umbellifer|Umbellifer| , so close is their mutual resemblance.  He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the  |mackerel|Mackerel| |pelagic|Pelagic|  fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below.           The artist  |Abbott_Handerson_Thayer|Abbott_Handerson_Thayer|  formulated what is sometimes called Thayers Law, the principle of  |countershading|Countershading| . However, he overstated the case in the 1909 book  Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom , arguing that All patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever preyed or are preyed on are under certain normal circumstances obliterative , and that Not one  |mimicry|Mimicry|  mark, not one  |warning_color|Aposematism| ...  nor any  |sexually_selected|Sexual_Selection|  color, exists anywhere in the world where there is not every reason to believe it the very best conceivable device for the concealment of its wearer , and using paintings such as Peacock in the Woods to reinforce his argument. Thayer was roundly mocked for these views by critics including  |Teddy_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt| .      The English zoologist  |Hugh_Cotts|Cott_H_B_|  1940 book  Adaptive Coloration in Animals  corrected Thayers errors, sometimes sharply: Thus we find Thayer straining the theory to a fantastic extreme in an endeavour to make it cover almost every type of coloration in the animal kingdom.  Cott built on Thayers discoveries, developing a comprehensive view of camouflage based on maximum disruptive contrast , countershading and hundreds of examples. The book explained how  |disruptive_camouflage|Disruptive_Camouflage|  worked, using streaks of boldly contrasting colour, paradoxically making objects less visible by breaking up their outlines. While Cott was more systematic and balanced in his view than Thayer, and did include some experimental evidence on the effectiveness of camouflage, his 500-page textbook was, like Thayers, mainly a  |natural_history|Natural_History|  narrative which illustrated theories with examples.     Camouflage is a soft-tissue feature that is rarely preserved in the  |fossil|Fossil|  record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured  |eumelanin|Eumelanin| , reveal that both  |leatherback_turtles|Leatherback_Turtle|  and  |mosasaurs|Mosasaur|  had dark backs and light bellies.      Experimental evidence that camouflage helps prey avoid being detected by  |predators|Predator|  was first provided in 2016, when ground-nesting birds  were shown to survive according to how well their egg contrast matched the local environment.                Camouflage can be achieved by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.            Crypsis means making the animal or military equipment hard to see . Visual crypsis can be achieved in many different ways, such as by living underground or by being active only at night, as well as by a variety of methods of camouflage.       Some animals colours and patterns resemble a particular natural background. This is an important component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling  |parakeets|Parakeet|  are mainly green;  |woodcocks|Woodcock|  of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed  |bitterns|Bittern|  are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animals coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly,  |desert_animals|Xerocole|  are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the  |gerbil|Gerbil|  or  |fennec_fox|Fennec_Fox| , birds such as the  |desert_lark|Desert_Lark|  or  |sandgrouse|Sandgrouse| , or reptiles like the  |skink|Skink|  or  |horned_viper|Cerastes| . Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example  |khaki|Khaki|  uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show  |industrial_melanism|Industrial_Melanism| , including the  |peppered_moth|Biston_Betularia|  which has coloration that blends in with tree bark.  The coloration of these insects  |evolved_between_1860_and_1940|Peppered_Moth_Evolution|  to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as  |evidence_that_camouflage_is_influenced_by_natural_selection|Coloration_Evidence_For_Natural_Selection| , as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.  |Black_faced_sandgrouse|Pterocles_Decoratus| |_Papuan_frogmouth|Papuan_Frogmouth| |_giraffe|Giraffe| |_katydid|Katydid|  has the colour of fresh vegetation.                   Disruptive patterns use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes to break up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle,  or to conceal telltale features, especially  |by_masking_the_eyes|Disruptive_Eye_Mask| , as in the  |common_frog|Common_Frog| . Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as  |edge_detection|Edge_Detection| .  Predators like the  |leopard|Leopard|  use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the  |Egyptian_nightjar|Egyptian_Nightjar|  use it to avoid detection by predators.  Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.        The presence of bold skin markings does not in itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour.  Roosevelt attacks Thayer on page 191, arguing that neither zebra nor giraffe are adequately obliterated by countershading or coloration pattern or anything else. For example, although  |giraffes|Giraffe|  have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are very conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres distance.  However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied by young giraffes being far more vulnerable to predation than adults: more than half of all giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the presence of a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be very well camouflaged; this is supported by coat markings being strongly inherited.     The possibility of camouflage in plants has been little studied until the late 20th century. Leaf  |variegation|Variegation|  with white spots may serve as camouflage in forest  |understory|Understory|  plants, where there is a dappled background; leaf mottling is correlated with closed habitats. Disruptive camouflage would have a clear evolutionary advantage in plants: they would tend to escape from being eaten by  |herbivores|Herbivore| . Another possibility is that some plants have leaves differently coloured on upper and lower surfaces or on parts such as veins and stalks to make green-camouflaged insects conspicuous, and thus benefit the plants by favouring the removal of herbivores by carnivores. These hypotheses are testable.     |Jumping_spider|Jumping_Spider| |understory|Understory|  plants such as the saw greenbriar,  Smilax bona-nox  have pale markings, possibly disruptive camouflage.                 Some animals, such as the  |horned_lizards|Horned_Lizard|  of North America, have evolved elaborate measures to eliminate  |shadow|Shadow| . Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under the edge of the body.  The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the  |roundtail_horned_lizard|Roundtail_Horned_Lizard| , which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood,  Pararge aegeria , minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds, including the  |European_nightjar|European_Nightjar| , select a resting position facing the sun. Eliminating shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| .   |ibex|Ibex| |_flat_tail_horned_lizard|Flat_Tail_Horned_Lizard| |_netting|Net|          Many prey animals have conspicuous high-contrast markings which paradoxically attract the predators gaze.  These  |distractive_markings|Distractive_Markings|  serve as camouflage by distracting the predators attention from recognising the prey as a whole, for example by keeping the predator from identifying the preys outline. Experimentally, search times for  |blue_tits|Blue_Tit|  increased when artificial prey had distractive markings.             Some animals actively seek to hide by decorating themselves with materials such as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a  |caddis_fly|Caddis_Fly|  larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a  |decorator_crab|Naxia_Tumida|  covers its back with seaweed, sponges, and stones. The  |nymph|Nymph|  of the predatory  |masked_bug|Reduvius_Personatus|  uses its hind legs and a  |tarsal|Tarsus|  fan to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles  over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.       Similar principles can be applied for military purposes, for instance when a  |sniper|Sniper|  wears a  |ghillie_suit|Ghillie_Suit|  designed to be further camouflaged by decoration with materials such as tufts of grass from the snipers immediate environment. Such suits were used as early as 1916, the British army having adopted coats of motley hue and stripes of paint for snipers. Cott takes the example of the larva of the  |blotched_emerald|Blotched_Emerald|  moth, which fixes a screen of fragments of leaves to its specially hooked bristles, to argue that military camouflage uses the same method, pointing out that the device is ... essentially the same as one widely practised during the Great War for the concealment, not of caterpillars, but of caterpillar-tractors, battery positions, observation posts and so forth.    |decorator_crab|Hyastenus_Elatus| |_Ghillie_suit|Ghillie_Suit| |_Crab|Crab|  camouflaged with  |algae|Algae|   Reduvius personatus     Movement catches the eye of prey animals on the lookout for predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis therefore also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, or in the case of stalking predators such as the  |tiger|Tiger| , moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals shadows. The  |flat_tail_horned_lizard|Flat_Tail_Horned_Lizard|  similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators.  In the ocean, the  |leafy_sea_dragon|Leafy_Sea_Dragon|  sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents.  Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleays spectre stick insect,  Extatosoma tiaratum . The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification , or a combination of the two.                Most forms of camouflage are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily seen by the observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as  |hoverflies|Hoverfly|   and  |dragonflies|Dragonfly|  use  |motion_camouflage|Motion_Camouflage|   Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to  |loom_larger|Looming|  in the targets field of vision.  The same method can be used for military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by an enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the method mainly for its efficiency rather than camouflage.   Syritta pipiens   |Australian_Emperor|Australian_Emperor|  dragonflies use motion camouflage to approach rivals.                   Animals such as  |chameleon|Chameleon| , frog, flatfish such as the  |peacock_flounder|Peacock_Flounder| , squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special  |chromatophore|Chromatophore|  cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for  |signalling|Signalling_Theory| . However,  |Smiths_dwarf_chameleon|Smiths_Dwarf_Chameleon|  does use active colour change for camouflage.         Each chromatophore contains pigment of only one colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated by a type of chromatophore known as  |melanophores|Melanophore|  that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented  |organelles|Organelle|  which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animals skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animals skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by  |hormones|Hormone| . In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.      The skins of cephalopods such as the octopus contain complex units, each consisting of a chromatophore with surrounding muscle and nerve cells. The cephalopod chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can be stretched or allowed to relax under the control of the brain to vary its opacity. By controlling chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.       On a longer timescale, animals like the  |Arctic_hare|Arctic_Hare| ,  |Arctic_fox|Arctic_Fox| ,  |stoat|Stoat| , and  |rock_ptarmigan|Rock_Ptarmigan|  have  |snow_camouflage|Snow_Camouflage| , changing their coat colour from brown or grey in the summer to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the  |dog_family|Canidae|  to do so.  However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of  |Canada|Canada| , where summer is very short, remain white year-round.      The principle of varying coloration either rapidly or with the changing seasons has military applications.  Active camouflage  could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple methods such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since World War II. In 2011,  |BAE_Systems|Bae_Systems|  announced their  |Adaptiv|Adaptiv|  infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1,000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The  |Peltier_plate|Peltier_Plate|  panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicles surroundings , or an object such as a car , when viewed in infrared.     |Winter_War|Winter_War| |_Marder_III|Marder_Iii| |_jagdpanzer|Jagdpanzer| |_Veiled_chameleon|Veiled_Chameleon| , Chamaeleo calyptratus  |Adaptiv|Adaptiv|  infrared camouflage lets an armoured vehicle mimic a car.                 Countershading uses graded colour to counteract the effect of self-shadowing, creating an illusion of flatness. Self-shadowing makes an animal appear darker below than on top, grading from light to dark; countershading paints in tones which are darkest on top, lightest below, making the countershaded animal nearly invisible against a suitable background. Thayer observed that Animals are painted by Nature, darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the skys light, and vice versa . Accordingly, the principle of countershading is sometimes called Thayers Law. Countershading is widely used by  |terrestrial_animals|Terrestrial_Animals| , such as  |gazelles|Gazelle|   and grasshoppers; marine animals, such as  |sharks|Sharks|  and  |dolphins|Delphinus_Delphis| ; and birds, such as  |snipe|Common_Snipe|  and  |dunlin|Dunlin| .       Countershading is less often used for military camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English  |zoologist|Zoologist| |_Hugh_Cott|Hugh_Cott|  encouraged the use of methods including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting as a kind of invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from an enemy observers viewpoint. At the same time in  |Australia|Australia| , zoologist  |William_John_Dakin|William_John_Dakin|  advised soldiers to copy animals methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.  |Dorcas_gazelle|Dorcas_Gazelle| , Gazella dorcas  |grey_reef_shark|Grey_Reef_Shark| , Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos  |Thayers|Abbott_Handerson_Thayer| |_Focke_Wulf_Fw_190D_9|Focke_Wulf_Fw_190D_9|                  Counter-illumination means producing light to match a background that is brighter than an animals body or military vehicle; it is a form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of  |squid|Squid| , such as the  |firefly_squid|Watasenia_Scintillans|  and the  |midwater_squid|Abralia_Veranyi| . The latter has light-producing organs  scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.  Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the  |bioluminescence|Bioluminescence|  of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract  or to detect prey  and for signalling.     Counterillumination has rarely been used for military purposes.  |Diffused_lighting_camouflage|Diffused_Lighting_Camouflage|  was trialled by Canadas  |National_Research_Council|National_Research_Council|  during the Second World War. It involved projecting light on to the sides of ships to match the faint glow of the night sky, requiring awkward external platforms to support the lamps.  The Canadian concept was refined in the American  |Yehudi_lights|Yehudi_Lights|  project, and trialled in aircraft including  |B_24_Liberators|Consolidated_B_24_Liberator|  and naval  |Avengers|Grumman_Tbf_Avenger| .  The planes were fitted with forward-pointing lamps automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the night sky. This enabled them to approach much closer to a target – within  – before being seen. Counterillumination was made obsolete by  |radar|Radar| |_HMS_Largs|Hms_Largs|  by night with incomplete  |diffused_lighting_camouflage|Diffused_Lighting_Camouflage|  Largs  |Yehudi_Lights|Yehudi_Lights|  raise the average brightness of the plane from a dark shape to the same as the sky.              Many  |marine|Sea|  animals that float near the surface are highly  |transparent|Transparency_And_Translucency| , giving them almost perfect camouflage. However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different  |refractive_indices|Refractive_Index|  from seawater. Some marine animals such as  |jellyfish|Jellyfish|  have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick  |mesogloea|Mesoglea|  is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them  |buoyant|Buoyancy| , but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast, making this form of camouflage a costly trade-off with mobility. Gelatinous  |plankton|Plankton| ic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent. A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as  |cod|Cod|  at a depth of ; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters.        Some tissues such as  |muscles|Muscle|  can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. A familiar example is the transparency of the lens of the vertebrate  |eye|Eye| , which is made of the protein  |crystallin|Crystallin| , and the vertebrate  |cornea|Cornea|  which is made of the protein  |collagen|Collagen| . Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the  |retinas|Retina|  or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes – they must absorb light to be able to function. The  |camera|Camera| -type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque. Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the  |nematocysts|Nematocyst|  of the transparent  |siphonophore|Siphonophore|   Agalma okenii  resemble small  |copepods|Copepod| . Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of  |larvae|Larva| , including  |radiata|Radiata|  , siphonophores,  |salps|Salps|  ,  |gastropod_molluscs|Gastropoda| ,  |polychaete|Polychaete|  worms, many shrimplike  |crustaceans|Crustacean| , and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live. Adult  |comb_jellies|Comb_Jelly|  and jellyfish obey the rule, often being mainly transparent. Cott suggests this follows the more general rule that animals resemble their background: in a transparent medium like seawater, that means being transparent. The small  |Amazon_river|Amazon_River|  fish  Microphilypnus amazonicus  and the shrimps it associates with,  Pseudopalaemon gouldingi , are so transparent as to be almost invisible ; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled according to the local background in the environment.                Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animals body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as  |sardine|Sardine|  and  |herring|Herring|  are camouflaged by silvering.     The  |marine_hatchetfish|Marine_Hatchetfish|  is extremely flattened laterally, leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble  |aluminium_foil|Aluminium_Foil| . The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide  |structural_coloration|Structural_Coloration| |guanine|Guanine|  spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.     In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The  |cephalopods|Cephalopods| , including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multilayer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.            In  |mimesis|Mimesis|  , the camouflaged object looks like something else which is of no special interest to the observer.  Mimesis is common in  |prey|Prey|  animals, for example when a  |peppered_moth|Peppered_Moth|  caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It is also found in nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as  Leipomeles dorsata , build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.      Mimesis is also employed by some  |predators|Predation|  and  |parasites|Parasite|  to lure their prey. For example, a  |flower_mantis|Flower_Mantis|  mimics a particular kind of flower, such as an  |orchid|Orchid| . This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed  |Q_ships|Q_Ship|  disguised as merchant ships.        The  |common_cuckoo|Common_Cuckoo| , a  |brood_parasite|Brood_Parasite| , provides examples of mimesis both in the adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a  |sparrowhawk|Eurasian_Sparrowhawk| . The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so.  The cuckoos egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.    |Peppered_moth|Peppered_Moth| |_Flower_mantis|Flower_Mantis|  lures its insect prey by mimicking a  Phalaenopsis  Teratodus monticollis  |grasshopper|Grasshopper| |_tank|Tank|  concealed in  |Operation_Bertram|Operation_Bertram|  by mimicking a  |truck|Truck| |_Q_ship|Q_Ship|  lured enemy submarines by mimicking a  |merchantman|Cargo_Ship| |_Cuckoo|Common_Cuckoo|  adult mimics  |sparrowhawk|Eurasian_Sparrowhawk| |_reed_warbler|Eurasian_Reed_Warbler|  Dolophones mimicking a stick              Most forms of camouflage are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators ability to estimate the preys speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape.  Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size . As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied.  Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, there would be an evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.     An animal that is commonly thought to be dazzle-patterned is the  |zebra|Zebra| . The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which the purpose of the coloration was disputed,  an experimental study by  |Tim_Caro|Tim_Caro|  suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as  |horseflies|Horse_Fly|  and  |tsetse_flies|Tsetse_Fly| .   However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two  |visual_illusions|Visual_Illusion| : the  |wagon_wheel_effect|Wagon_Wheel_Effect| , where the perceived motion is inverted, and the  |barberpole_illusion|Barberpole_Illusion| , where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.                      Ship camouflage was occasionally used in ancient times.  |Philostratus|Philostratus|   wrote in his  Imagines  that Mediterranean pirate ships could be painted blue-gray for concealment.  |Vegetius|Publius_Flavius_Vegetius_Renatus|   says that Venetian blue was used in the  |Gallic_Wars|Gallic_Wars| , when  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  sent his speculatoria navigia to gather intelligence along the coast of Britain; the ships were painted entirely in bluish-green wax, with sails, ropes and crew the same colour. There is little evidence of military use of camouflage on land before 1800, but two unusual ceramics show men in  |Perus|Peru| |_Mochica|Mochica|  culture from before 500  AD, hunting birds with blowpipes which are fitted with a kind of shield near the mouth, perhaps to conceal the hunters hands and faces.  Another early source is a 15th-century French manuscript, The Hunting Book of Gaston Phebus, showing a horse pulling a cart which contains a hunter armed with a crossbow under a cover of branches, perhaps serving as a hide for shooting game.   |Jamaican_Maroons|Jamaican_Maroons|  are said to have used plant materials as camouflage in the  |First_Maroon_War|First_Maroon_War|  .           The development of military camouflage was driven by the increasing range and accuracy of infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular the replacement of the inaccurate  |musket|Musket|  with weapons such as the  |Baker_rifle|Baker_Rifle|  made personal concealment in battle essential. Two  |Napoleonic_War|Napoleonic_Wars|  skirmishing units of the  |British_Army|British_Army| , the  |95th_Rifle_Regiment|Rifle_Brigade|  and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage in the form of a  |rifle_green|Rifle_Green|  jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics.  A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier  |Charles_Hamilton_Smith|Charles_Hamilton_Smith|  provided evidence that grey uniforms were less visible than green ones at a range of 150 yards.     In the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War| , rifle units such as the 1st United States Sharp Shooters  similarly wore green jackets while other units wore more conspicuous colours.  The first British Army unit to adopt  |khaki|Khaki|  uniforms was the  |Corps_of_Guides|Corps_Of_Guides|  at  |Peshawar|Peshawar| , when  |Sir_Harry_Lumsden|Harry_Burnett_Lumsden|  and his second in command,  |William_Hodson|William_Stephen_Raikes_Hodson|  introduced a drab uniform in 1848.  Hodson wrote that it would be more appropriate for the hot climate, and help make his troops invisible in a land of dust .  Later they improvised by dyeing cloth locally. Other regiments in India soon adopted the khaki uniform, and by 1896  |khaki_drill|Khaki_Drill|  uniform was used everywhere outside Europe;  by the  |Second_Boer_War|Second_Boer_War|  six years later it was used throughout the British Army.      During the late 19th century camouflage was applied to British coastal fortifications.  The fortifications around Plymouth, England were painted in the late 1880s in irregular patches of red, brown, yellow and green.  From 1891 onwards British coastal artillery was permitted to be painted in suitable colours to harmonise with the surroundings  and by 1904 it was standard practice that artillery and mountings should be painted with large irregular patches of different colours selected to suit local conditions.                  In the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , the French army formed a camouflage corps, led by  |Lucien_Victor_Guirand_de_Scévola|Lucien_Victor_Guirand_De_Scévola| ,   employing artists known as  camoufleurs  to create schemes such as tree observation posts and covers for guns. Other armies soon followed them.   The term  camouflage  probably comes from camoufler, a  |Paris|Paris| ian slang term meaning to disguise, and may have been influenced by camouflet, a  |French|French_Language|  term meaning smoke blown in someones face.   The English zoologist  |John_Graham_Kerr|John_Graham_Kerr| , artist Solomon J. Solomon and the American artist Abbott Thayer led attempts to introduce scientific principles of countershading and disruptive patterning into military camouflage, with limited success. For Solomon, see BBC Radio 4 programme Warpaint: the story of camouflage by Patrick Wright, August 2002 . In early 1916 the  |Royal_Naval_Air_Service|Royal_Naval_Air_Service|  began to create dummy air fields to draw the attention of enemy planes to empty land. They created decoy homes and lined fake runways with flares, which were meant to help protect real towns from night raids. This strategy was not common practice and did not succeed at first, but in 1918 it caught the Germans off guard multiple times.       |Ship_camouflage|Ship_Camouflage|  was introduced in the early 20th century as the range of naval guns increased, with ships painted grey all over.  In April 1917, when German  |U_boats|U_Boats|  were sinking many British ships with torpedoes, the marine artist  |Norman_Wilkinson|Norman_Wilkinson|  devised  |dazzle_camouflage|Dazzle_Camouflage| , which paradoxically made ships more visible but harder to target.  In Wilkinsons own words, dazzle was designed not for low visibility, but in such a way as to break up her form and thus confuse a submarine officer as to the course on which she was heading .  West Mahomet  |Siege_howitzer|Bl_9_2_Inch_Howitzer|       In the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , the zoologist Hugh Cott, a  |protégé|Protégé|  of Kerr, worked to persuade the British army to use more effective camouflage methods, including countershading, but, like Kerr and Thayer in the First World War, with limited success. For example, he painted two rail-mounted coastal guns, one in conventional style, one  |countershaded|Countershading| . In aerial photographs, the countershaded gun was essentially invisible. The power of aerial observation and attack led every warring nation to camouflage targets of all types. The  |Soviet_Unions|Soviet_Union| |_Red_Army|Red_Army|  created the comprehensive  |doctrine|Military_Doctrine|  of  Maskirovka  for military deception, including the use of camouflage.  For example, during the  |Battle_of_Kursk|Battle_Of_Kursk| ,  |General_Katukov|Mikhail_Katukov| , the commander of the Soviet 1st Tank Army, remarked that the enemy did not suspect that our well-camouflaged tanks were waiting for him. As we later learned from prisoners, we had managed to move our tanks forward unnoticed . The tanks were concealed in previously prepared defensive emplacements, with only their turrets above ground level.  In the air, Second World War fighters were often painted in ground colours above and sky colours below, attempting two different camouflage schemes for observers above and below.  Bombers and night fighters were often black, Stephenson, Hubert Kirk . Applied Physics, pp. 200, 258. Volume 6 of Science in World War II; Office of Scientific Research and Development. Editors: Chauncey Guy Suits and George Russell Harrison. Little, Brown. while maritime reconnaissance planes were usually white, to avoid appearing as dark shapes against the sky.  For ships, dazzle camouflage was mainly replaced with plain grey in the Second World War, though experimentation with colour schemes continued.     As in the First World War, artists were pressed into service; for example, the surrealist painter  |Roland_Penrose|Roland_Penrose|  became a lecturer at the newly founded Camouflage Development and Training Centre at  |Farnham_Castle|Farnham_Castle| ,  writing the practical Home Guard Manual of Camouflage. The film-maker  |Geoffrey_Barkas|Geoffrey_Barkas|  ran the  |Middle_East_Command_Camouflage_Directorate|Middle_East_Command_Camouflage_Directorate|  during the 1941–1942 war in the Western Desert, including the successful deception of  |Operation_Bertram|Operation_Bertram| . Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves  camoufleurs , included  |Steven_Sykes|Steven_Sykes|  and  |Tony_Ayrton|Tony_Ayrton| . In Australia, artists were also prominent in the Sydney Camouflage Group, formed under the chairmanship of Professor  |William_John_Dakin|William_John_Dakin| , a zoologist from Sydney University.  |Max_Dupain|Max_Dupain| ,  |Sydney_Ure_Smith|Sydney_Ure_Smith| , and  |William_Dobell|William_Dobell|  were among the members of the group, which worked at  |Bankstown_Airport|Bankstown_Airport| ,  |RAAF_Base_Richmond|Raaf_Base_Richmond|  and Garden Island Dockyard.  In the United States, artists like  |John_Vassos|John_Vassos|  took a certificate course in military and industrial camouflage at the American School of Design with Baron Nicholas Cerkasoff, and went on to create camouflage for the Air Force.   |Catalina|Consolidated_Pby_Catalina| |_Waffen_SS|Waffen_Ss|   Flecktarn   |USS_Duluth|Uss_Duluth| |_Spitfires|Supermarine_Spitfire| |_Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe| |_Red_Army|Red_Army|  soldiers in the  |Battle_of_Stalingrad|Battle_Of_Stalingrad|  in  |snow_camouflage|Snow_Camouflage|  overalls, January 1943              Camouflage has been used to protect military equipment such as vehicles, guns,  |ships|Ship_Camouflage| ,   |aircraft|Aircraft_Camouflage|  and buildings  as well as individual soldiers and their positions.    Vehicle camouflage methods begin with paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised materials such as blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb  |near_infrared|Near_Infrared|  and  |radar|Radar|  waves.    Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from  |night_vision|Image_Intensification|  devices.    After the Second World War, radar made camouflage generally less effective, though coastal boats are sometimes painted like land vehicles.  |Aircraft_camouflage|Aircraft_Camouflage|  too came to be seen as less important because of radar, and aircraft of different air forces, such as the Royal Air Forces  |Lightning|English_Electric_Lightning| , were often uncamouflaged.      Many  |camouflaged_textile_patterns|List_Of_Camouflage_Patterns|  have been developed to suit the need to match  |combat_clothing|Battledress|  to different kinds of terrain .  The design of a pattern effective in all terrains has proved elusive.    The American  |Universal_Camouflage_Pattern|Universal_Camouflage_Pattern|  of 2004 attempted to suit all environments, but was withdrawn after a few years of service.  Terrain-specific patterns have sometimes been developed but are ineffective in other terrains.  The problem of making a pattern that works at different ranges has been solved with multiscale designs, often with a pixellated appearance and designed digitally, that provide a  |fractal|Fractal| -like range of patch sizes so they appear disruptively coloured both at close range and at a distance.  The first genuinely digital camouflage pattern was the Canadian Disruptive Pattern , issued to the army in 2002, soon followed by the American Marine pattern . A pixellated appearance is not essential for this effect, though it is simpler to design and to print.    |CADPAT|Cadpat|  was the first  |pixellated|Pixellated| |_digital_camouflage|Digital_Camouflage| |_Disruptive_Pattern_Material|Disruptive_Pattern_Material| , issued to  |special_forces|Special_Forcesunited_Kingdom| |_Finnish_Defence_Forces|Finnish_Defence_Forces| |_M05|M05| |_Chinese|Peoples_Republic_Of_China| |_Peoples_Liberation_Army|Peoples_Liberation_Army| |_Type_99|Type_99|  pattern, c. 2006   |Flecktarn|Flecktarn| |_Six_Color_Desert_Pattern|Six_Color_Desert_Pattern|  developed in 1962, widely used in  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War|               Hunters of game have long made use of camouflage in the form of materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals.  |Field_sports|Field_Sports|  such as  |driven_grouse_shooting|Driven_Grouse_Shooting|  conceal hunters in  |hides|Hunting_Blind|  .  Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.            Camouflage is occasionally used to make built structures less conspicuous: for example, in  |South_Africa|South_Africa| , towers carrying cell telephone antennae are sometimes camouflaged as tall trees with plastic branches, in response to resistance from the community . Since this method is costly , alternative forms of camouflage can include using neutral colours or familiar shapes such as cylinders and flagpoles. Conspicuousness can also be reduced by siting masts near, or on, other structures.      Automotive manufacturers often use patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage is designed to obfuscate the vehicles visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns purpose is to prevent visual observation , that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicles form factors.           Military camouflage patterns influenced  |fashion|Fashion_Design|  and  |art|Art|  from the time of the First World War onwards.  |Gertrude_Stein|Gertrude_Stein|  recalled the  |cubist|Cubism|  artist  |Pablo_Picassos|Pablo_Picasso|  reaction in around 1915:          In 1919, the attendants of a dazzle ball , hosted by the Chelsea Arts Club, wore dazzle-patterned black and white clothing. The ball influenced fashion and art via postcards and magazine articles. The  Illustrated London News  announced:         More recently, fashion designers have often used camouflage fabric for its striking designs, its patterned disorder and its symbolism.  Camouflage clothing can be worn largely for its symbolic significance rather than for fashion, as when, during the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States,  |anti_war_protestors|Opposition_To_The_Vietnam_War|  often ironically wore military clothing during demonstrations against the American involvement in the Vietnam War.      Modern artists such as  |Ian_Hamilton_Finlay|Ian_Hamilton_Finlay|  have used camouflage to reflect on war. His 1973 screenprint of a tank camouflaged in a leaf pattern, Arcadia, is described by the  |Tate|Tate_Gallery|  as drawing an ironic parallel between this idea of a natural paradise and the camouflage patterns on a tank .  The title refers to the  |Utopia|Utopia| n  |Arcadia|Arcadia|  of poetry and art, and the  memento mori   |Latin_phrase|Latin_Phrase|   Et in Arcadia ego  which recurs in Hamilton Finlays work. In  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction| ,  Camouflage  is a novel about  |shapeshifting|Shapeshifting|  alien beings by  |Joe_Haldeman|Joe_Haldeman| .  The word is used more figuratively in works of literature such as Thaisa Franks collection of stories of love and loss, A Brief History of Camouflage.    |André_Mares|André_Mare| |_Cubist|Cubism| |_sketch|Sketch| , c. 1917, of a 280 calibre gun illustrates the interplay of art and war, as artists like Mare contributed their skills as wartime  camoufleurs   |anti_war_protest|Opposition_To_The_Vietnam_War| |_fashion|Fashion|  item, 2007          .
