                 Malaria is a  |mosquito-borne_infectious_disease|Mosquito-Borne_Disease|  that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes  |symptoms|Symptoms|  that typically include  |fever|Fever| ,  |tiredness|Fatigue| ,  |vomiting|Vomiting| , and  |headaches|Headache| . In severe cases it can cause  |yellow_skin|Jaundice| ,  |seizures|Epileptic_Seizure| ,  |coma|Coma| , or  |death|Death| . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected  |mosquito|Mosquito| . If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an  |infection|Infection| , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial  |resistance|Immunity|  disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.        It is caused by  |single-celled_microorganisms|Protozoa|  of the  Plasmodium  group. The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female  Anopheles  mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the  |parasites|Parasite|  from the mosquitos  |saliva|Saliva|  into a persons  |blood|Circulatory_System| . The parasites travel to the  |liver|Liver|  where they mature and  |reproduce|Reproduce| . Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by  P.  falciparum  because  P.  vivax ,  P.  ovale , and  P.  malariae  generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species  P.  knowlesi  rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the  |microscopic_examination|Histology|  of blood using  |blood_films|Blood_Film| , or with  |antigen-based|Malaria_Antigen_Detection_Tests| |rapid_diagnostic_tests|Rapid_Diagnostic_Test| . Methods that use the  |polymerase_chain_reaction|Polymerase_Chain_Reaction|  to detect the parasites  |DNA|Dna|  have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is  |common|Endemic|  due to their cost and complexity.        The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of  |mosquito_nets|Mosquito_Net|  and  |insect_repellents|Insect_Repellent| , or with  |mosquito_control|Mosquito_Control|  measures such as spraying  |insecticides|Insecticide|  and draining  |standing_water|Standing_Water| . Several  |medications|Medications|  are available to  |prevent_malaria|Malaria_Prophylaxis|  in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication  |sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine|Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine|  are recommended in  |infants|Infant|  and after the  |first_trimester|First_Trimester|  of  |pregnancy|Pregnancy|  in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective  |vaccine|Vaccine|  exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a  |combination|Antimalarial_Medicationartemisinin-Based_Combination_Therapies|  of  |antimalarial_medications|Antimalarial_Medication|  that includes an  |artemisinin|Artemisinin| . The second medication may be either  |mefloquine|Mefloquine| ,  |lumefantrine|Lumefantrine| , or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.   |Quinine|Quinine|  along with  |doxycycline|Doxycycline|  may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing  |drug_resistance|Drug_Resistance| . Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example,  |chloroquine|Chloroquine| -resistant P.  falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.        The disease is widespread in the  |tropical|Tropics|  and  |subtropical|Subtropical|  regions that exist in a broad band around the  |equator|Equator| . This includes much of  |Sub-Saharan_Africa|Sub-Saharan_Africa| ,  |Asia|Asia| , and  |Latin_America|Latin_America| . In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 445,000 to 731,000 deaths.   Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa.  Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014, during which there were 198 million cases.  Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on  |economic_development|Economic_Development| . In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.             The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection, but may occur later in those who have taken  |antimalarial_medications_as_prevention|Malaria_Prophylaxis| . Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to  |flu|Flu| -like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as  |sepsis|Sepsis| ,  |gastroenteritis|Gastroenteritis| , and  |viral_diseases|Viral_Disease| . The presentation may include  |headache|Headache| ,  |fever|Fever| ,  |shivering|Shivering| ,  |joint_pain|Arthralgia| ,  |vomiting|Vomiting| ,  |hemolytic_anemia|Hemolytic_Anemia| ,  |jaundice|Jaundice| ,  |hemoglobin_in_the_urine|Hemoglobinuria| ,  |retinal_damage|Retinopathy| , and  |convulsions|Convulsion| .     The classic symptom of malaria is  |paroxysm|Paroxysmal_Attacks| —a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days  in P.  vivax and P.  ovale infections, and every three days  for P.  malariae. P.  falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.     Severe malaria is usually caused by P.  falciparum . Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection. Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit  |neurological|Neurological_Disorder|  symptoms, including  |abnormal_posturing|Abnormal_Posturing| ,  |nystagmus|Nystagmus| ,  |conjugate_gaze_palsy|Conjugate_Gaze_Palsy|  ,  |opisthotonus|Opisthotonus| ,  |seizures|Seizure| , or  |coma|Coma| .       Malaria has several serious  |complications|Complication| . Among these is the development of  |respiratory_distress|Respiratory_Distress| , which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.  falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of  |metabolic_acidosis|Metabolic_Acidosis| , noncardiogenic  |pulmonary_oedema|Pulmonary_Oedema| , concomitant  |pneumonia|Pneumonia| , and severe  |anaemia|Anaemia| . Although rare in young children with severe malaria,  |acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome|Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome|  occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.  |Coinfection|Coinfection|  of  |HIV|Hiv|  with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of  |blackwater_fever|Blackwater_Fever| , where hemoglobin from  |lysed|Lysis|  red blood cells leaks into the urine.     Infection with P.  falciparum may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves  |encephalopathy|Encephalopathy| . It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.  |Enlarged_spleen|Splenomegaly| ,  |enlarged_liver|Hepatomegaly|  or  |both_of_these|Hepatosplenomegaly| , severe headache,  |low_blood_sugar|Hypoglycemia| , and  |hemoglobin_in_the_urine|Hemoglobinuria|  with  |renal_failure|Renal_Failure|  may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding,  |coagulopathy|Coagulopathy| , and  |shock|Circulatory_Shock| . Davidsons Principles and Practice of Medicine/21st/351      |Malaria_in_pregnant_women|Pregnancy-Associated_Malaria|  is an important cause of  |stillbirths|Stillbirth| ,  |infant_mortality|Infant_Mortality| ,  |abortion|Abortion|  and  |low_birth_weight|Low_Birth_Weight| , particularly in P.  falciparum infection, but also with P.  vivax.            Malaria  |parasites|Parasite|  belong to the genus  Plasmodium  . In humans, malaria is caused by  P.  falciparum ,  P.  malariae ,  P.  ovale ,  P.  vivax  and  P.  knowlesi . Among those infected, P.  falciparum is the most common species identified followed by P.  vivax . Although P.  falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths, recent evidence suggests that P.  vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection. P.  vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa. There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from  |higher_apes|Simian| ; however, except for P.  knowlesi—a  |zoonotic|Zoonosis|  species that causes malaria in  |macaques|Macaques|  —these are mostly of limited public health importance.            In the  |life_cycle|Plasmodium¬If_Cycle|  of Plasmodium, a female  Anopheles  mosquito  transmits a motile infective form  to a vertebrate host such as a human , thus acting as a transmission  |vector|Vector| . A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells , where it reproduces  |asexually|Asexual_Reproduction|  , producing thousands of  |merozoites|Merozoite| . These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.      Other merozoites develop into immature  |gametocytes|Gametocytegametocytes_And_Malaria| , which are the precursors of male and female  |gametes|Gamete| . When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an  |ookinete|Ookinete| —a fertilized, motile  |zygote|Zygote| . Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insects  |salivary_glands|Salivary_Gland| , ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.     Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus Anopheles prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed. Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by  |blood_transfusions|Blood_Transfusion| , although this is rare.       Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either  |recrudescence|Recrudescence| ,  |relapse|Relapse| , or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.  Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant  |hypnozoites|Plasmodiumlife_Cycle|  in liver cells.  Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is often seen in P.  vivax and P.  ovale infections. However, relapse-like P. vivax recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation. Some of them might have an extra-vascular merozoite origin, making these recurrences recrudescences, not relapses.  One newly recognized, non-hypnozoite, possible contributing source to recurrent peripheral P. vivax parasitemia is erythrocytic forms in bone marrow.  P.  vivax malaria cases in  |temperate|Temperate|  areas often involve  |overwintering|Overwintering|  by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite. Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure.  People may develop some  |immunity|Premunity|  when exposed to frequent infections.             |Global_climate_change|Effects_Of_Global_Warming_On_Human_Healthmalaria|  is likely to affect malaria transmission, but the degree of effect and the areas affected is uncertain.  Greater rainfall in certain areas of India and following an  |El_Niño|El_Nino|  event is associated with increased mosquito numbers.                   Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the  |liver|Liver|  , and one that involves red blood cells, or  |erythrocytes|Erythrocyte|  . When an infected mosquito pierces a persons skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquitos saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.     After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms  |differentiate|Cellular_Differentiation|  to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane|  of the infected host liver cell.     Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.     Some P.  vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months to several years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P.  vivax infections, although their existence in P.  ovale is uncertain.     The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the bodys  |immune_system|Immune_System|  because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the  |spleen|Spleen| . To avoid this fate, the P.  falciparum parasite displays adhesive  |proteins|Protein|  on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the  |blood–brain_barrier|Blood–Brain_Barrier|  and cause cerebral malaria.          According to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of  |mortality|Death|  and  |morbidity|Morbidity|  caused by malaria—especially the P.  falciparum species—it has placed the greatest  |selective_pressure|Selection|  on the  |human_genome|Human_Genome|  in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including  |sickle_cell_trait|Sickle_Cell_Trait| ,  |thalassaemia|Thalassaemia|  traits,  |glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency|Glucose-6-Phosphate_Dehydrogenase_Deficiency| , and the absence of  |Duffy_antigens|Duffy_Antigen|  on red blood cells.     The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow  |capillaries|Capillaries| ; however, when the modified  |hemoglobin_S|Hemoglobin_S|  molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are  |homozygous|Homozygous|   have  |sickle-cell_anaemia|Sickle-Cell_Anaemia| , while those who are heterozygous experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the traits survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the  |benefits|Heterozygote_Advantage|  provided by the heterozygous form.       Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as  |viral_hepatitis|Viral_Hepatitis|  or  |chronic_liver_disease|Chronic_Liver_Disease| . The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.                Owing to the non-specific nature of the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history,  |enlarged_spleen|Splenomegaly| , fever,  |low_number_of_platelets|Thrombocytopenia|  in the blood, and  |higher-than-normal_levels_of_bilirubin|Hyperbilirubinemia|  in the blood combined with a normal level of  |white_blood_cells|White_Blood_Cells| . Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries where malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.        Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of  |blood_films|Blood_Film|  or by  |antigen|Antigen| -based  |rapid_diagnostic_tests|Malaria_Antigen_Detection_Tests|  . In some areas, RDTs must be able to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections.  Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The  |sensitivity|Sensitivity_And_Specificity|  of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.     In regions where laboratory tests are readily available, malaria should be suspected, and tested for, in any unwell person who has been in an area where malaria is endemic. In areas that cannot afford laboratory diagnostic tests, it has become common to use only a history of fever as the indication to treat for malaria—thus the common teaching fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise . A drawback of this practice is  |overdiagnosis|Overdiagnosis|  of malaria and mismanagement of non-malarial fever, which wastes limited resources, erodes confidence in the health care system, and contributes to drug resistance. Although  |polymerase_chain_reaction|Polymerase_Chain_Reaction| -based tests have been developed, they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common as of 2012, due to their complexity.       Malaria is classified into either severe or uncomplicated by the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  . It is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.    Decreased consciousness   Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk   Inability to feed   Two or more  |convulsions|Convulsions| |Low_blood_pressure|Low_Blood_Pressure| |Breathing_problems|Respiratory_Distress| |Circulatory_shock|Circulatory_Shock| |Kidney_failure|Kidney_Failure|  or  |hemoglobin|Hemoglobin|  in the urine   Bleeding problems, or hemoglobin less than 50  g/L    |Pulmonary_oedema|Pulmonary_Oedema| |Blood_glucose|Blood_Glucose|  less than 2.2  mmol/L    |Acidosis|Acidosis|  or  |lactate|Lactic_Acid|  levels of greater than 5  mmol/L   A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100,000 per  |microlitre|Microlitre|  in low-intensity transmission areas, or 250,000 per µL in high-intensity transmission areas     Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe P.  falciparum-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma , or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.      Various types of malaria have been called by the names below:                    Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no  |vaccine_for_malaria|Malaria_Vaccine| . The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasites reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.     Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the  |initial_costs|Capital_Cost|  required are out of reach of many of the worlds poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the  |Chinese_provinces|Chinese_Province| —the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.     In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have  |anemia|Anemia| , which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalization.               |Vector_control|Vector_Control|  refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective  |insect_repellents|Insect_Repellent|  are based on  |DEET|Deet|  or  |picaridin|Picaridin| . Insecticide-treated  |mosquito_nets|Mosquito_Net|  and  |indoor_residual_spraying|Indoor_Residual_Spraying|  have been shown highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common. Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies may also reduce transmission.              Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets, and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007 and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015. Most nets are impregnated with  |pyrethroids|Pyrethroid| , a class of insecticides with low  |toxicity|Toxicity| . They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.  It is recommended to hang a large bed net above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.        Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including  |DDT|Ddtuse_Against_Malaria|  and the pyrethroids  |cyfluthrin|Cyfluthrin|  and  |deltamethrin|Deltamethrin| . This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the  |Stockholm_Convention|Stockholm_Convention| , which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is  |insecticide_resistance|Insecticide_Resistance| . Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.       People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, is effective in some locations. Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness.       Community participation and  |health_education|Health_Education|  strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world. Recognizing the disease in the early stages can prevent the disease from becoming fatal. Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.  |Intermittent_preventive_therapy|Intermittent_Preventive_Therapy|  is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants, and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.          There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications— |mefloquine|Mefloquine| ,  |doxycycline|Doxycycline| , or the combination of  |atovaquone/proguanil|Atovaquone/Proguanil|  —are frequently used for prevention. Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.  Areas of the world with  |chloroquine|Chloroquine|  sensitive malaria are uncommon.      The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving . The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs,  |side_effects|Adverse_Effect|  from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of  |anemia|Anemia|  in the mother.  The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.            Malaria is treated with  |antimalarial_medications|Antimalarial_Medication| ; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease. While  |medications_against_fever|Antipyretics|  are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.       Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.  falciparum infection is the use of  |artemisinins|Artemisinin|  in combination with other antimalarials , which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include:  |amodiaquine|Amodiaquine| ,  |lumefantrine|Lumefantrine| , mefloquine or  |sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine|Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine| .  Another recommended combination is  |dihydroartemisinin|Dihydroartemisinin|  and  |piperaquine|Piperaquine| .  ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the  |WHO|World_Health_Organization|  recommends the use of quinine plus  |clindamycin|Clindamycin|  early in the pregnancy , and ACT in later stages . In the 2000s , malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.  vivax, P.  ovale or P.  malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.  vivax requires both treatment of blood stages and clearance of liver forms with  |primaquine|Primaquine| . Treatment with  |tafenoquine|Tafenoquine|  prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.        Severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.  Severe and complicated malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high .  Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.    Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the  |intravenous|Parenteral_Administration|  use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria,  |parenteral|Parenteral|  artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.  Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a  |critical_care_unit|Critical_Care_Unit| . This includes the management of  |high_fevers|Hyperpyrexia|  and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for  |poor_breathing_effort|Respiratory_Depression| , low blood sugar, and  |low_blood_potassium|Hypokalemia| .        |Drug_resistance|Drug_Resistance|  poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from  |artemisinins|Artemisinin| . Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam,  and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.
