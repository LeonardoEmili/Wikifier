In  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic|  and  |computer_science|Computer_Science| , the Kleene star  is a  |unary_operation|Unary_Operation| , either on  |sets|Set|  of  |strings|String|  or on sets of symbols or characters. In mathematics   it is more commonly known as the  |free_monoid|Free_Monoid|  construction. The application of the Kleene star to a set V is written as V . It is widely used for  |regular_expressions|Regular_Expression| , which is the context in which it was introduced by  |Stephen_Kleene|Stephen_Kleene|  to characterize certain  |automata|Automata_Theory| , where it means zero or more .     If V is a set of strings, then V is defined as the smallest  |superset|Superset|  of V that contains the  |empty_string|Empty_String|  ε and is  |closed|Closure|  under the  |string_concatenation_operation|Concatenation| .   If V is a set of symbols or characters, then V is the set of all strings over symbols in V, including the empty string ε.     The set V can also be described as the set of finite-length strings that can be generated by concatenating arbitrary elements of V, allowing the use of the same element multiple times. If V is either the  |empty_set|Empty_Set|  ∅ or the singleton set , then V ; if V is any other  |finite_set|Finite_Set|  or  |countably_infinite_set|Countably_Infinite_Set| , then V is a countably infinite set.      The operators are used in  |rewrite_rules|Rewrite_Rule|  for  |generative_grammars|Generative_Grammar| .       Given a set V   define   :V 0 ,   :V 1 V   and define recursively the set   :V i+1  for each  i    sup  /sup  sup  /sup  ref  /ref math /math  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  math /math  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  sup  /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  Ref name droste  /ref  .
