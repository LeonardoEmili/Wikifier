Whereas, the Parliament consists of the Dewan Negara and Dewan Rakyat . Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, & Nor Fadzlina Nawi. . Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives.

Malaysia has had a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System|  since the first  |direct_election|Direct_Election|  of the  |Federal_Legislative_Council|Federal_Legislative_Council|  of  |Malaya|Federation_Of_Malaya|  in 1955 on a  |first-past-the-post|First-Past-The-Post|  basis. The ruling party was the  |Alliance_Party|Alliance_Party|   coalition and from 1973 onwards, its successor, the  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|  coalition. Together with its predecessor, the Barisan Nasional government served for 61 years and was one of the worlds longest serving governments until it lost power to the  |Pakatan_Harapan|Pakatan_Harapan|  coalition in the  |14th_general_election|2018_Malaysian_General_Election|  that was held on 9 May 2018.     The  |Pakatan_Harapan|Pakatan_Harapan|  coalition currently consists of  |Democratic_Action_Party|Democratic_Action_Party|  ,  |Peoples_Justice_Party|Peoples_Justice_Party|  ,  |National_Trust_Party|National_Trust_Party|  and  |Malaysian_United_Indigenous_Party|Malaysian_United_Indigenous_Party|  with  |Sabah_Heritage_Party|Sabah_Heritage_Party|  and  |United_Pasokmomogun_Kadazandusun_Murut_Organisation|United_Pasokmomogun_Kadazandusun_Murut_Organisation|  as confidence-and-supply partner.

Although Malaysian politics has been relatively stable, critics allege that the government, ruling party, and administration are intertwined with few countervailing forces. Conclusion . In John Funston , Government and Politics in Southeast Asia, p. 413. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. . However, since the  |8_March_2008_General_Election|2008_Malaysian_General_Election| , the medias coverage on the countrys politics has noticeably increased. After the 14th general elections, media freedom was promised by the new government of Malaysia.     The  |Economist_Intelligence_Unit|Economist_Intelligence_Unit|  rated Malaysia a  |flawed_democracy|Democracy_Indexclassification_Definitions|  in 2016.  However, Malaysia was a runner up to the Economist 2018 Country of the Year in 2018 due to the peaceful transfer of power following the 14th general elections, losing out at least partly due to Mahathir Mohamads seeming reluctance to relax the countrys divisive racial politics or to hand over power, as agreed, to Anwar Ibrahim.            Early organised political movements in Malaysia were organised along regional and ethnic groups and were not political parties in the modern sense. They generally were loose alliances of interest groups and individuals primarily concerned with  |social_welfare|Social_Welfare| ,  |social_progress|Social_Progress|  and religious reform among the  |Muslim|Muslim| |Malay|Malay_People|  communities similar to  |interest_groups|Interest_Group|  and  |civil_society|Civil_Society|  organisations of today.        Religious reformers played a large role in developing and disseminating ideas with magazines and periodicals like al-Imam published in Singapore by  |Tahir_Jalaluddin|Sheikh_Tahir_Jalaluddin|  between 1906 and 1908, and al-Munir published in  |Penang|Penang|  by  |Abdullah_Ahmad|Abdullah_Ahmad|  between 1911 and 1916. These in turn were primarily influenced by the Egyptian Islamic reform magazine, al-Manar published in Cairo by  |Rashid_Rida|Rashid_Rida|  from 1898 to 1936.  While these publications were primarily concerned with the  |Islam|Islam| ic religion, it also touched extensively on the social, political and economic conditions of the Malays.      One of the first such movements was the  |New_Hope_Society|New_Hope_Society|   that was established in  |Johor_Bahru|Johor_Bahru|  in 1916. On 14 September 1923, a movement was established in  |Al-Azhar_University|Al-Azhar_University|  in  |Cairo|Cairo| ,  |Egypt|Egypt|  by students from  |British_Malaya|British_Malaya|  and the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies|  known as the  |Al-Jamiyah_Al-Khairiyah_lit-tholabah_Al-Azhariyah_Al-Jawiyah|Al-Jamiyah_Al-Khairiyah_Lit-Tholabah_Al-Azhariyah_Al-Jawiyah|  .  Composed primarily of students influenced by the  |Young_Turks|Young_Turks|  movement and later the  |Muslim_Brotherhood|Muslim_Brotherhood| , the movement encouraged intentional political and religious discourse through periodicals like  |Osman_Abdullahs|Osman_Abdullah|  Seruan Al-Azhar  and Pilehan Timur .        The  |Sultan_Idris_Training_College|Sultan_Idris_Training_College|  for Malay teachers in  |Tanjung_Malim|Tanjung_Malim|  was fertile ground for the exchange of ideas. The establishment of the  |Selangor_Malay_Teachers_Association|Selangor_Malay_Teachers_Association|   in 1921 by  |Muhammad_Yusof|Muhammad_Yusof|  paved the way for similar organisations to be set up in the other  |Federated_Malay_States|Federated_Malay_States|  and a magazine known as Majalah Guru  was published in 1923. This magazine allowed for the discussion of larger socio-economic issues as well political issues, establishing itself as one of the influences in the development of Malay nationalism.         Various self-help societies like the  |Maharani_Company|Maharani_Company|  in  |Muar|Muar| ,  |Johor|Johor|  and the  |Serikat_Pembaikan_Hidup|Serikat_Pembaikan_Hidup|   organised by  |Mohamad_Eunos_Abdullah|Mohamad_Eunos_Abdullah|  of the  |Singapore_Malay_Union|Singapore_Malay_Union|   established  |co-operatives|Co-Operative|  and  |communes|Commune|  to help improve the socio-economic conditions of the Malay peasants and smallholders. They too utilised newspapers and periodicals like the Maharani Company published Perjumpaan Melayu  to disseminate ideas and encourage discourse on issues pertaining to the social, political and economic conditions of the Malay people.                The  |Malay_Union|Malay_Union|   was established in 1926 W. Roff Origins of Malay Nationalism p. 190 by  |Mohamad_Eunos_Abdullah|Mohamad_Eunos_Abdullah| ,  |Tengku_Kadir_Ali|Tengku_Kadir_Ali|  and  |Embok_Suloh|Embok_Suloh|  with the aim of increasing the role of Malays in public life, upholding Malay interests with the colonial authorities, and promote higher and technical education for Malays.  Eunos himself was a  |Justice_of_Peace|Justice_Of_Peace| , a member of the Muslim Advisory Board set up by the colonial administration during  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and a member of the  |Singapore_Municipal_Council|Singapore_Municipal_Council| . In his capacity as the chairman of the KM, he became the first Malay member of the  |Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements|Legislative_Council_Of_The_Straits_Settlements| . One of the first issues championed by the KM was the appeal for land to be set aside for a Malay settlement. The appeal was granted and a sum of  |$|Straits_Dollar|  700,000 was set aside for the KM to purchase and develop the land. This settlement has evolved and is now part of the  |Eunos|Eunos,_Singapore|  neighbourhood in Singapore.      The KM also became the catalyst for the establishment of similar organisations in the other states of the British Malaya such as the  |Penang_Malay_Association|Penang_Malay_Association|  and the  |Perak_Malay_Association|Perak_Malay_Association|  . People associated with the KM included the first  |President_of_Singapore|President_Of_Singapore| ,  |Yusof_Ishak|Yusof_Ishak| . The KM survived  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  and entered into a political coalition with the  |United_Malays_National_Organisation|United_Malays_National_Organisation|  and the  |Malayan_Chinese_Association|Malayan_Chinese_Association|  to form the  |Singapore_Alliance_Party|Singapore_Alliance_Party| . It however eventually faded away with the electoral defeats of the Alliance in the 1955  |legislative_elections|1955_Singaporean_General_Election|  in Singapore.             The first political party to be organised with a pan-Malayan outlook was the  |Communist_Party_of_Malaya|Communist_Party_Of_Malaya|  established in 1930. The CPM was originally set up as a branch of the  |Comintern|Comintern|  supervised by the Far Eastern Bureau of the  |Communist_Party_of_China|Communist_Party_Of_China|  in 1926. It was then known as the South Seas Communist Party. The fraternal  |Communist_Party_of_Indonesia|Communist_Party_Of_Indonesia|  was by then underground or in exile due to their abortive  |revolt|Communist_Party_Of_Indonesiathe_1926_Revolt|  in 1926. This resulted in the CPM being almost exclusively dominated by people of Chinese descent. Efforts to establish a broader based representation were made especially in the 1935 representative conferences between the CPM and the  |General_Labour_Union|General_Labour_Union|  as well as the establishment of contact with Communist cells in  |Siam|Communist_Party_Of_Thailand|  and the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies|  in 1936. Nonetheless, the CPM remained an organisation that was predominantly Chinese in composition until the  |Japanese_occupation_of_Malaya|Japanese_Occupation_Of_Malaya|  which saw a larger participation of people from other ethnicities.             The  |Young_Malay_Union|Young_Malay_Union|   was established in  |Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala_Lumpur|  in 1938 under the leadership of  |Ibrahim_Yaacob|Ibrahim_Yaacob| . While registered as a social organisation working to improve Malay youths in sports, education, agriculture, health and other recreational pursuits, the primary aim of the KMM was to struggle for the political independence of all the Malayan states from Britain and oppose British  |imperialism|Imperialism| .     While gaining significant support from the larger Malay community, the KMM failed to gain support from the Malay aristocrats and bureaucracy and on the eve of the  |Japanese_invasion_of_Malaya|Japanese_Invasion_Of_Malaya| , more than 100 KMM members were arrested by the authorities for collaboration.     All were released after the  |fall_of_Singapore|Fall_Of_Singapore|  in February 1942. On 14 January 1942, a KMM delegation led by vice-president,  |Mustapha_Hussain|Mustapha_Hussain| , met with the Japanese authorities to negotiate for the independence of Malaya. The Japanese authorities instead disbanded KMM and established the  |Pembela_Tanah_Ayer|Pembela_Tanah_Ayer|   militia in its stead.     Most who joined PETA were also part of the underground KMM Youth League who continued to struggle for an independent Malaya and some cooperated with the CPM sponsored  |Malayan_Peoples_Anti-Japanese_Army|Malayan_Peoples_Anti-Japanese_Army|  and other anti-Japanese guerilla units like  |Force_136|Force_136|  and  |Wataniah|Rejimen_Askar_Wataniah| .     With the  |surrender_of_Japan|Surrender_Of_Japan|  in August 1945, former KMM cadres formed the nucleus of the emerging political movements like the  |Malay_Nationalist_Party|Malay_Nationalist_Party| ,  |Angkatan_Pemuda_Insaf|Angkatan_Pemuda_Insaf| , and  |Angkatan_Wanita_Sedar|Angkatan_Wanita_Sedar| .          Malaysias predominant political party, the  |United_Malays_National_Organization|United_Malays_National_Organization|  , held power in the coalition known as the  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|  with other parties since Malayas independence in 1957 until 2018. In 1973, an alliance of communally based parties was replaced with a broader coalition  – the  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|   — composed of fourteen parties. Today the Barisan Nasional coalition has three prominent members  – the UMNO, MCA  and MIC . The current  |Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia|Prime_Minister_Of_Malaysia|  is from Pakatan Harapan who is the ex-UMNO leader, marking the first time the post is occupied by a non-UMNO party member.      In addition to the UMNO and other member parties of the Barisan Nasional, three main parties compete in national and state-level elections in Malaysia. The three most competitive opposition parties are the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party and the  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|  Coalition. The Islamic Party of Malaysia promotes a more Islamist political agenda, the BN Coalition is rather critical about the current ruling government since the May 2018 General Elections.      The political process in Malaysia from 1957 to 2018 has generally been described as taking the form of  |consociationalism|Consociationalism|  whereby communal interests are resolved in the framework of a grand coalition . The executive branch is described as tending to dominate political activity, with the Prime Ministers office being in a position to preside over an extensive and ever growing array of powers to take action against individuals or organisations, and facilitate business opportunities . Critics of the ruling government generally agree that although authoritarianism in Malaysia preceded the administration of  |Mahathir_bin_Mohamad|Mahathir_Bin_Mohamad| , it was he who carried the process forward substantially . Legal scholars have suggested that the political equation for religious and racial harmony is rather fragile, and that this fragility stems largely from the identification of religion with race coupled with the  |political_primacy|Ketuanan_Melayu|  of the Malay people colliding with the aspiration of other races for complete equality.     During the terms of Dr.  |Mahathir_Mohamad|Mahathir_Mohamad|  as the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia, many constitutional amendments were made. For example, the Senate could only delay a bill from taking effect and the Monarch no longer had veto powers on proposed bills. Also, the 26 state senators were no longer the majority as another 44 senators were appointed by the King at the advice of the Prime Minister. The amendments also limited the powers of the judiciary to what parliament grants them.     In early September 1998, Prime Minister  |Mahathir_bin_Mohamad|Mahathir_Bin_Mohamad|  dismissed Deputy Prime Minister  |Anwar_Ibrahim|Anwar_Ibrahim|  and accused Anwar of immoral and corrupt conduct. Anwar said his ousting was actually owed to political differences and led a series of demonstrations advocating political reforms. Later in September, Anwar was arrested, beaten while in prison , and charged with corrupt practices, in both legal and moral contexts, charges including  |obstruction_of_justice|Obstruction_Of_Justice|  and  |sodomy|Sodomy_Law| . In April 1999, he was convicted of four counts of corruption and sentenced to six years in prison. In August 2000, Anwar was convicted of one count of sodomy and sentenced to nine years to run consecutively after his earlier six-year sentence. Both trials were viewed by domestic and international observers as unfair. Anwars conviction on sodomy has since been overturned, and having completed his six-year sentence for corruption, he has since been released from prison. In the  |November_1999_general_election|1999_Malaysian_General_Election| , the  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|  returned to power with three-fourths of the parliamentary seats, but UMNOs seats dropped from 94 to 72. The opposition, the  |Barisan_Alternatif|Barisan_Alternatif|  coalition, led by the  |Islamic_Party_of_Malaysia|Islamic_Party_Of_Malaysia|  , increased its seats to 42. PAS retained control of the state of  |Kelantan|Kelantan|  and won the additional state of  |Terengganu|Terengganu| .        The former 6th Prime Minister of Malaysia was Dato Seri Mohd. Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak. He took office following the retirement of Dato Seri  |Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi|Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi|   on April 2009.  |Mahathir_Mohamad|Mahathir_Mohamad|  took office as the  |Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia|Prime_Minister_Of_Malaysia|  under the new  |Pakatan_Harapan|Pakatan_Harapan|  government on 10 May 2018.     In the  |March_2004_general_election|2004_Malaysian_General_Election| , Dato Seri  |Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi|Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi|  led  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|  to a landslide victory, in which  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional|  recaptured the state of  |Terengganu|Terengganu| . The coalition controlled 92% of the seats in Parliament. In 2005, Mahathir stated that I believe that the country should have a strong government but not too strong. A two-thirds majority like I enjoyed when I was Prime Minister is sufficient but a 90% majority is too strong. ... We need an opposition to remind us if we are making mistakes. When you are not opposed you think everything you do is right.     The national media is largely controlled by the government and by political parties in the  |Barisan_Nasional|Barisan_Nasional| /National Front ruling coalition and the opposition has little access to the media. The print media is controlled by the Government through the requirement of obtaining annual publication licences under the  |Printing_and_Presses_Act|Printing_And_Presses_Act| . In 2007, a government agency  – the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission  – issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders.     The official state ideology is the  |Rukunegara|Rukunegara| , which has been described as encouraging respect for a pluralistic, multireligious and multicultural society , but political scientists have argued that the slogan of Bangsa, Agama, Negara used by UMNO constitutes an unofficial ideology too. Both ideologies have generally been used to reinforce a conservative political ideology, one that is Malay-centred.      |Executive_power|Executive_Branch|  is vested in the  |cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Malaysia|  led by the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Malaysia| ; the Malaysian  |constitution|Constitution_Of_Malaysia|  stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of the lower house of  |parliament|Parliament_Of_Malaysia|  who, in the opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, commands a majority in parliament. The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of Parliament and is responsible to that body.     In recent years, the former opposition, now government has been campaigning for freer and fairer elections within Malaysia. On 10 November 2007, a mass rally, called the  |2007_Bersih_Rally|2007_Bersih_Rally| , took place in the  |Dataran_Merdeka|Dataran_Merdeka| , Kuala Lumpur at 3  pm to demand for clean and fair elections. The gathering was organised by BERSIH, a coalition comprising political parties and civil society groups, and drew supporters from all over the country.     On 11 November, the Malaysian government briefly detained de facto opposition leader  |Anwar_Ibrahim|Anwar_Ibrahim|  on Tuesday and arrested a human rights lawyer and about a dozen opposition leaders, amid growing complaints that the government was cracking down on dissent. Dozens of policemen blocked the main entrance to the parliament building in  |Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala_Lumpur|  to foil an opposition-led rally. The rally was carried out along with the attempt to submit a protest note to Parliament over a government-backed plan to amend a law that would extend the tenure of the  |Election_Commission|Election_Commission_Of_Malaysia|  chief, whom the opposition claims is biased.     The Malaysian government intensified efforts on 6 March 2008 to portray opposition figure  |Anwar_Ibrahim|Anwar_Ibrahim|  as a political turncoat, days ahead of the  |2008_Malaysian_general_election|2008_Malaysian_General_Election|  on 8 March 2008 because he posed a legitimate threat to the ruling coalition.   Campaigning wrapped up 7 March 2008 for general elections that could see gains for  |Malaysias|Malaysia|  opposition amid anger over race and religion among minority Chinese and  |India|India| ns.   Malaysians voted 8 March 2008 in parliamentary elections. Election results showed that the ruling government suffered a setback when it failed to obtain two-thirds majority in parliament, and five out of 12 state legislatures were won by the opposition parties.  Reasons for the setback of the ruling party, which has retained power since the nation declared independence in 1957, were rising inflation, crime and ethnic tensions.       2018 marks the first time since independence in 1957 that a non-UMNO party namely PH formed the federal government. PH leader  |Anwar_Ibrahim|Anwar_Ibrahim|  was freed after receiving a royal pardon from the king and is designated to take over as PM from  |Mahathir_Mohamed|Mahathir_Mohamed| .             The monarch of Malaysia is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong , commonly referred to as the  |Supreme_King_of_Malaysia|Yang_Di-Pertuan_Agong| . Malaysia is a  |constitutional|Constitutional_Monarchy| |elective_monarchy|Elective_Monarchy| , the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is selected for a five-year terms from among the nine  |Sultans|Malay_Ruler|  of the  |Malay_states|Malay_States| . The other four states that do not have monarch kings, are ruled by governors.  The nine sultans and four governors together make up the  |Conference_of_Rulers|Conference_Of_Rulers|  who elect the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The position has to date been, by informal agreement, based on systematic rotation between the nine sultans; the order was originally based on seniority.     According to the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, the YDPA is considered as the Supreme Head of the Federation . As a constitutional head, the YDPA is to act on the advice of the Prime Minister . The YDPA or monarch king basically has three broad power vested in him :     The power to exercise based on the advice from the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and the Conference of Rulers   The power to exercise based on his discretionary power   The power to pardon , reprieves and respites, and/or of remitting, suspending or commuting sentences, under Clause of Article 42.     The YDPA is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces in the Federation of Malaysia . He is also the head of the Islamic faith in Malaysia. Article 3, of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia.       Malaysia is a  |federation|Federal_State|  of  |13_states_and_3_federal_territories|States_And_Federal_Territories_Of_Malaysia| . The system of government in Malaysia is closely modelled on that of  |Westminster|Westminster_System| |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System| , a legacy of  |British_colonial_rule|British_Empire| .  In practice however, more power is vested in the executive branch of government than in the legislative, and the judiciary has been weakened by sustained attacks by the government during the Mahathir era.     |Parliamentary_elections|Malaysian_General_Election|  are held at least once every five years, usually concurrent with state elections for state assemblies except for Sabah and Sarawak.                    Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures.   The bicameral parliament consists of the  |lower_house|Lower_House| , the House of Representatives or  Dewan Rakyat  ; and the  |upper_house|Upper_House| , the Senate or  Dewan Negara  .   All seventy Senate members sit for three-year terms ; twenty-six are elected by the thirteen state assemblies, and forty-four are appointed by the king based on the advice of the Prime Minister.    The 222 members of the Dewan Rakyat are elected from single-member districts by universal adult suffrage. Parliament has a maximum mandate of five years by law. The king may dissolve parliament at any time, and usually does so upon the advice of the Prime Minister.  |General_elections|Malaysian_General_Election|  must be held within sixty days of the dissolution of parliament. In practice, this has meant that elections have been held every three to five years at the discretion of the Prime Minister.     Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures. Malaysia has two sources of law.  The national constitution, the nations supreme law, can be amended by a two-thirds majority in parliament. The second source of law is  |sharia|Sharia|  , which applies only to Muslims. The federal government has little input into the administration of sharia; it falls to the states to implement Islamic law, and interpretations vary from state to state. The parliament follows a multi-party system and the governing body is elected through a  |first-past-the-post|First-Past-The-Post|  system.        |Executive_power|Executive_Branch|  is vested in the  |cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Malaysia|  led by the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Malaysia| ; the  |Malaysian_constitution|Constitution_Of_Malaysia|  stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of the Lower House of  |parliament|Parliament_Of_Malaysia|  who, in the opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong , commands a majority in parliament.  The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of Parliament and is responsible to that body.      The Executive branch of the government consists of the Prime Minister as the head of the government, followed by the various ministers of the Cabinet. It formulates various socio-economic policies and development plans, for the development of the country as a whole. The Executive has the power and authority to generate revenues through the collection of various taxes, levies, fines, summons, custom duties, and fees, to name some, from the general public.               The  |judiciary|Judiciary_Of_Malaysia|  is theoretically independent of the executive and the legislature,  although supporters of the government hold many judicial positions.  The highest court in the judicial system is the  |Federal_Court|Federal_Court_Of_Malaysia| , followed by the  |Court_of_Appeal|Court_Of_Appeal_Of_Malaysia| , and two  |High_Courts|High_Courts_Of_Malaysia| , one for  |Peninsular_Malaysia|Peninsular_Malaysia| , and one for  |East_Malaysia|East_Malaysia| . The subordinate courts in each of these jurisdictions include Sessions Courts, Magistrates Courts, and Courts for Children. Malaysia also has a Special Court to hear cases brought by or against all Royalty.      There is also a Special Court, established in 1993 to hear cases brought by or against Ruler. Before its establishment, Rulers were immune from any proceedings brought against them in their personal capacity. , now amended. Rulers include the  |Yang_di-Pertuan_Agong|Yang_Di-Pertuan_Agong|  , and the  |heads_of_state|Heads_Of_State|  of Malaysias component states.     Separate from the civil courts are the  |Syariah_Courts|Syariah_Court| , which decide on cases which involve Malaysian Muslims.  These courts run parallel to the normal court system, and are undergoing reforms that include the first ever appointment of female judges.  Debate exists in Malaysia over whether the country should be secular or Islamic.  Some state governments controlled by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, including that of Terengganu, have passed Islamic laws, but these have not gone into effect due to opposition from the federal government.            |Malaysias_legal_system|Law_Of_Malaysia|  is based on  |English_Common_Law|English_Law| , alongside a  |Sharia|Sharia|  court system for Malaysian Muslims.  The Federal Court reviews decisions referred from the Court of Appeals; it has original jurisdiction in constitutional matters and in disputes between states or between the federal government and a state. Peninsular Malaysia and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak each has a high court.   The federal government has authority over external affairs, defence, internal security, justice , federal citizenship, finance, commerce, industry, communications, transportation, and other matters.          Each state has a unicameral state legislative chamber  whose members are elected from single-member constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers , who are state assembly members from the majority party in the Dewan Undangan Negeri. They advise their respective sultans or governors. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is required to be an  |ethnic_Malay|Ethnic_Malay| , appointed by the Sultan upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister.   |Parliamentary_elections|Elections_In_Malaysia|  are held at least once every five years, with the last general election being in April 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory.    Although Malaysia is a federal state, political scientists have suggested that its federalism is highly centralised :          Race plays a large role in Malaysian politics, and many Malaysian political parties are ethnically based. The Governments  |New_Economic_Policy|Malaysian_New_Economic_Policy|   and the  |National_Development_Policy|National_Development_Policy|  which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of  Bumiputera  Malaysians. The policies provide preferential treatment to Malays over non-Malays in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. While improving in the economic position of Malays, it is a source of resentment amongst non-Malays.
