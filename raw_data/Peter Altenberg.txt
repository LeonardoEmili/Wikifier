        Peter Altenberg was a writer and poet from  |Vienna|Vienna| , Austria. He was key to the genesis of early  |modernism|Modernism|  in the city.       He was born Richard Engländer on 9 March 1859 in Vienna. The nom de plume, Altenberg , came from a small town on the  |Danube|Danube|  river. Allegedly, he chose the Peter to honor a young girl whom he remembered as an unrequited love . Although he grew up in a middle class  |Jewish|Jewish|  family, Altenberg eventually separated himself from his family of origin by dropping out of both law and medical school, and embracing  |Bohemianism|Bohemianism|  as a permanent  |lifestyle|Lifestyle|  choice. He cultivated a feminine appearance and feminine handwriting, wore a cape, sandals and a broad-brimmed hat, and despised macho masculinity.     Discovered by  |Arthur_Schnitzler|Arthur_Schnitzler|  in 1894 and appreciated by  |Hugo_von_Hofmannsthal|Hugo_Von_Hofmannsthal|  and  |Karl_Kraus|Karl_Kraus| , Altenberg was one of the main proponents of Viennese Impressionism. He was a master of short, aphoristic stories based on close observation of everyday life events. After reading Altenbergs first published collection Wie ich es sehe Hofmannsthal wrote: Even though entirely unconcerned with things important, the book has such a good conscience that one can immediately see that it cannot possibly be a German book. It is truly Viennese. It flaunts it – its origin – as it flaunts its attitude.     At the  |fin_de_siècle|Fin_De_Siècle| , when Vienna was a major crucible and center for modern arts and culture, Altenberg was a very influential part of a literary and artistic movement known as Jung-Wien . Altenberg was a contemporary of Karl Kraus,  |Gustav_Mahler|Gustav_Mahler| ,  |Arthur_Schnitzler|Arthur_Schnitzler| ,  |Gustav_Klimt|Gustav_Klimt| , and  |Adolf_Loos|Adolf_Loos| , with whom he had a very close relationship. He was somewhat older, in his early 30s, than the others. His oeuvre consists of short, poetic prose pieces that do not easily fit into usual formal categories. The inspiration for his trademark short prose he drew from the concise aesthetic of Charles Baudelaires prose poems and the spatial limitations of the Correspondenzkarte, the postcard, first launched and disseminated in his native Austria in 1869.      He became well known throughout Vienna after the publication of a book of his fragmentary observations of women and children in everyday street activities. Because most of his literary work was written while he frequented various Viennese bars and  |coffeehouses|Viennese_Coffee_House| , Altenberg is sometimes referred to as a cabaret or coffee house poet. His favorite coffeehouse was the  |Café_Central|Café_Central| , to which he even had his mail delivered.     Altenbergs detractors said he was a drug addict and a  |womanizer|Promiscuitymale_Promiscuity| . Altenberg was also rumored to have problems with  |alcoholism|Alcoholism|  and  |mental_illness|Mental_Illness| . Yet his admirers considered him to be a highly creative individual with a great love for the  |aesthetic|Aesthetic| , for nature, and for young girls. He is certainly known to have had a large collection of photographs and drawings of young girls, and those who knew him well wrote of his adoration of young girls.     Altenberg was never a commercially successful writer, but he did enjoy most if not all of the benefits of fame in his lifetime. Altenberg was at one point nominated for the Nobel Prize.  Some of the  |aphoristic|Aphorism|  poetry he wrote on the backs of postcards and scraps of paper were set to music by composer  |Alban_Berg|Alban_Berg| . In 1913, Bergs Five songs on picture postcard texts by Peter Altenberg were premiered in Vienna. The piece caused an uproar, and the performance had to be halted: a complete performance of the work was not given until 1952.     Altenberg, like many writers and artists, was constantly short of money, but he was adept at making friends, cultivating patrons, and convincing others to pay for his meals, his champagne, even his rent, with which he was frequently late. He repaid his debts with his talent, his wit, and his charm. Many academics consider him to have been a bohemians bohemian.         Most of Altenbergs work is published in the German language and, outside of anthology pieces, is difficult to find. Much of it remains in university libraries or private collections. Two selections have been translated, Evocations of Love and Telegrams of the Soul: Selected Prose of Peter Altenberg .     Altenberg, who never married, died on 8 January 1919, aged 59. He is buried at  |Central_Cemetery|Zentralfriedhof|  in Vienna, Austria.       The  |Altenberg_Trio|Altenberg_Trio|  is named after Peter Altenberg.            Wie ich es sehe. S.
