      In  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| , a measure on a  |set|Set|  is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable  |subset|Subset|  of that set, intuitively interpreted as its size. In this sense, a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length, area, and volume. A particularly important example is the  |Lebesgue_measure|Lebesgue_Measure|  on a  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space| , which assigns the conventional  |length|Length| ,  |area|Area| , and  |volume|Volume|  of  |Euclidean_geometry|Euclidean_Geometry|  to suitable subsets of the - |dimensional|Dimension|  Euclidean space . For instance, the Lebesgue measure of the  |interval|Interval|   in the  |real_numbers|Real_Line|  is its length in the everyday sense of the word, specifically, 1.     Technically, a measure is a  |function|Function|  that assigns a non-negative real number or  to subsets of a set  . It must further be  |countably_additive|Sigma_Additivity| consistent size to each subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure, one only finds trivial examples like the  |counting_measure|Counting_Measure| . This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub-collection of all subsets; the so-called measurable subsets, which are required to form a  |_algebra|Sigma_Algebra| . This means that countable  |unions|Union| , countable  |intersections|Intersection|  and  |complements|Complement|  of measurable subsets are measurable.  |Non_measurable_sets|Non_Measurable_Set|  in a Euclidean space, on which the Lebesgue measure cannot be defined consistently, are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement.  |Halmos_Paul|Paul_Halmos|  , Measure theory, Van Nostrand and Co. Indeed, their existence is a non-trivial consequence of the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| .     Measure theory was developed in successive stages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by  |Émile_Borel|Émile_Borel| ,  |Henri_Lebesgue|Henri_Lebesgue| ,  |Johann_Radon|Johann_Radon| , and  |Maurice_Fréchet|Maurice_Fréchet| , among others. The main applications of measures are in the foundations of the  |Lebesgue_integral|Lebesgue_Integral| , in  |Andrey_Kolmogorovs|Andrey_Kolmogorov| |_axiomatisation|Axiomatisation|  of  |probability_theory|Probability_Theory|  and in  |ergodic_theory|Ergodic_Theory| . In integration theory, specifying a measure allows one to define  |integrals|Integral|  on spaces more general than subsets of Euclidean space; moreover, the integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean spaces is more general and has a richer theory than its predecessor, the  |Riemann_integral|Riemann_Integral| . Probability theory considers measures that assign to the whole set the size 1, and considers measurable subsets to be events whose probability is given by the measure.  |Ergodic_theory|Ergodic_Theory|  considers measures that are invariant under, or arise naturally from, a  |dynamical_system|Dynamical_System| .            Let  be a set and  a  |_algebra|Sigma_Algebra|  over . A function  from  to the  |extended_real_number_line|Extended_Real_Number_Line|  is called a measure if it satisfies the following properties:     Non-negativity in Σ, we have .   Null empty setCountable additivity  |countable|Countable|  collections   of pairwise  |disjoint_sets|Disjoint_Sets|  in Σ,   :         One may require that at least one set  has finite measure. Then the empty set automatically has measure zero because of countable additivity, because   :     +   +   +     which implies that   .     If only the second and third conditions of the definition of measure above are met, and  takes on at most one of the values , then  is called a  signed measure .     The pair  is called a  |measurable_space|Measurable_Space| , the members of Σ are called measurable sets. If   and   are two measurable spaces, then a function f : X   Y is called measurable if for every -measurable set B     , the  |inverse_image|Image_Inverse_Image|  is -measurable – i.e.: f     . In this setup, the  |composition|Function_Composition|  of measurable functions is measurable, making the measurable spaces and measurable functions a  |category|Category| , with the measurable spaces as objects and the set of measurable functions as arrows. See also  |Measurable_functionTerm_usage_variations|Measurable_Functionterm_Usage_Variations|  about another setup.     A  |triple|Tuple|   is called a  |measure_space|Measure_Space| . A  |probability_measure|Probability_Measure|  is a measure with total measure one – i.e. . A  |probability_space|Probability_Space|  is a measure space with a probability measure.     For measure spaces that are also  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  various compatibility conditions can be placed for the measure and the topology. Most measures met in practice in  |analysis|Analysis|   are  |Radon_measures|Radon_Measure| . Radon measures have an alternative definition in terms of linear functionals on the  |locally_convex_space|Locally_Convex_Space|  of  |continuous_functions|Continuous_Function|  with  |compact_support|Support_Compact_Support| . This approach is taken by  |Bourbaki|Nicolas_Bourbaki|  and a number of other sources. For more details, see the article on  |Radon_measures|Radon_Measure| .       Some important measures are listed here.     The  |counting_measure|Counting_Measure|  is defined by  number of elements in .   The  |Lebesgue_measure|Lebesgue_Measure|  on  is a  |complete|Complete_Measure| |_translation_invariant|Translational_Invariance|  measure on a σ-algebra containing the  |intervals|Interval|  in  such that ; and every other measure with these properties extends Lebesgue measure.   Circular  |angle|Angle|  measure is invariant under  |rotation|Rotation| , and  |hyperbolic_angle|Hyperbolic_Angle|  measure is invariant under  |squeeze_mapping|Squeeze_Mapping| .   The  |Haar_measure|Haar_Measure|  for a  |locally_compact|Locally_Compact_Space| |_topological_group|Topological_Group|  is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure and has similar uniqueness properties.   The  |Hausdorff_measure|Hausdorff_Measure|  is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure to sets with non-integer dimension, in particular, fractal sets.   Every  |probability_space|Probability_Space|  gives rise to a measure which takes the value 1 on the whole space . Such a measure is called a probability measure. See  |probability_axioms|Probability_Axioms| .   The  |Dirac_measure|Dirac_Measure|  δ a  is given by δ a  χ S , where χ S is the  |indicator_function|Indicator_Function|  of . The measure of a set is 1 if it contains the point  and 0 otherwise.     Other named measures used in various theories include:  |Borel_measure|Borel_Measure| ,  |Jordan_measure|Jordan_Measure| ,  |ergodic_measure|Ergodic_Measure| ,  |Euler_measure|Euler_Measure| ,  |Gaussian_measure|Gaussian_Measure| ,  |Baire_measure|Baire_Measure| ,  |Radon_measure|Radon_Measure| ,  |Young_measure|Young_Measure| , and  |Loeb_measure|Loeb_Measure| .     In physics an example of a measure is spatial distribution of  |mass|Mass|  , or another non-negative  |extensive_property|Extensive_Property| ,  |conserved|Conserved_Quantity|   or not. Negative values lead to signed measures, see generalizations below.      |Liouville_measure|Liouvilles_Theorem_Symplectic_Geometry| , known also as the natural volume form on a symplectic manifold, is useful in classical statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics.    |Gibbs_measure|Gibbs_Measure|  is widely used in statistical mechanics, often under the name  |canonical_ensemble|Canonical_Ensemble| .       Let  be a measure.       If  and  are measurable sets with  then   :               For any  |countable|Countable| |_sequence|Sequence|   of measurable sets  in Σ:   :               If  are measurable sets and En   E, for all , then the  |union|Union|  of the sets  is measurable, and   :             If  are measurable sets and, for all , E   En, then the  |intersection|Intersection|  of the sets  is measurable; furthermore, if at least one of the  has finite measure, then     :           This property is false without the assumption that at least one of the  has finite measure. For instance, for each , let rather than ∞1 i  Ii  J .
