         The Roman Inquisition, formally the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, was a system of tribunals developed by the  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  of the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| , during the second half of the 16th century, responsible for prosecuting individuals accused of a wide array of crimes relating to religious doctrine or alternate religious  |doctrine|Doctrine|  or alternate religious beliefs. In the period after the  |Medieval_Inquisition|Medieval_Inquisition| , it was one of three different manifestations of the wider  |Catholic_Inquisition|Inquisition|  along with the  |Spanish_Inquisition|Spanish_Inquisition|  and  |Portuguese_Inquisition|Portuguese_Inquisition| .       Like other iterations of the Inquisition, the Roman Inquisition was responsible for  |prosecuting|Prosecution|  individuals accused of committing offenses relating to  |heresy|Heresy| , including  |Protestantism|Protestantism| ,  |sorcery|Maleficium| ,  |immorality|Immorality| ,  |blasphemy|Blasphemy| ,  |Judaizing|Judaizing|  and  |witchcraft|Witchcraft| , as well as for  |censorship|Censorship|  of printed literature. After 1567, with the execution of  |Pietro_Carnesecchi|Pietro_Carnesecchi| , an allegedly leading heretic, the Holy Office moved to broaden concerns beyond that of theological matters, such as love magic, witchcraft, superstitions, and cultural morality. However, the treatment was more disciplinary than punitive. Black, Christopher F. 2009. The Italian Inquisition. New Haven: Yale University Press.   The tribunals of the Roman Inquisition covered most of the  |Italian_peninsula|Italian_Peninsula|  as well as  |Malta|Malta|  and also existed in isolated pockets of  |papal|Papal| |_jurisdiction|Jurisdiction|  in other parts of  |Europe|Europe| , including  |Avignon|Avignon| , a papal enclave within the territory of  |France|France| . The Roman Inquisition, though, was considerably more  |bureaucratic|Bureaucratic|  and focused on pre-emptive control in addition to the reactive  |judicial|Judicial|  prosecution experienced under other iterations.  by  |John_Bargrave|John_Bargrave| , edited by  |James_Craigie_Robertson|James_Craigie_Robertson|        Typically, the  |pope|Pope|  appointed one  |cardinal|Cardinal|  to preside over meetings of the Congregation. Though often referred to in historical literature as Grand Inquisitors, the role was substantially different from the formally appointed  |Grand_Inquisitor|Grand_Inquisitor|  of the Spanish Inquisition. There were usually ten other cardinals who were members of the Congregation, as well as a  |prelate|Prelate|  and two assistants all chosen from the  |Dominican_Order|Dominican_Order| . The Holy Office also had an international group of  |consultants|Consultor| ; experienced scholars of  |theology|Theology|  and  |canon_law|Canon_Law|  who advised on specific questions. The congregation, in turn, presided over the activity of local tribunals.       The Roman Inquisition began in 1542 as part of the Catholic Churchs Counter-Reformation against the spread of Protestantism, but it represented a less harsh affair than the previously established Spanish Inquisition.    In 1588,  Dissertation C. Beaudet, The Catholic University of America, 2010  |Pope_Sixtus_V|Pope_Sixtus_V|  established 15  |congregations|Congregation|  of the  |Roman_Curia|Roman_Curia|  of which the  |Supreme_Sacred_Congregation_of_the_Roman_and_Universal_Inquisition|Supreme_Sacred_Congregation_Of_The_Roman_And_Universal_Inquisition|  was one. In 1908, the congregation was renamed the  |Supreme_Sacred_Congregation_of_the_Holy_Office|Supreme_Sacred_Congregation_Of_The_Holy_Office|  and in 1965 it was renamed again and is now known as the  |Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith|Congregation_For_The_Doctrine_Of_The_Faith| .     While the Roman Inquisition was originally designed to combat the spread of Protestantism in Italy, the institution outlived that original purpose and the system of tribunals lasted until the mid 18th century, when pre- |unification|Unification_Of_Italy|  Italian states began to suppress the local inquisitions, effectively eliminating the power of the church to prosecute heretical crimes.          Nicolaus Copernicus published a formulated model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe in his book  |De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium|De_Revolutionibus_Orbium_Coelestium|  , in 1543.     In 1616, the Roman Inquisitions consultants judged the proposition that the  |sun|Sun|  is immobile and  |at_the_center_of_the_universe|Heliocentric|  and that the  |Earth|Earth|  moves around it, to be foolish and absurd in philosophy and that the first was formally heretical while the second was at least erroneous in faith .  Domínguez, Nuño .  EsMateria.com.; also      This assessment led to Copernicuss On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres being placed on the  Index Librorum Prohibitorum  .           |Galileo_Galilei|Galileo_Galilei|  revised the Copernican theories and was admonished for his views on  |heliocentrism|Heliocentrism|  in 1615. The Roman Inquisition concluded that his theory could only be supported as a possibility, not as an established fact. Hannam, James. The Genesis of Science . 2011. p329-344. Galileo later defended his views in  Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , which appeared to attack Pope  |Urban_VIII|Urban_Viii|  and thus alienated him and the  |Jesuits|Jesuits| , who had both supported Galileo up until this point.     He was tried by the Inquisition in 1633. Galileo was found vehemently suspect of heresy , forced to recant, and the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems was also placed on the  Index Librorum Prohibitorum  . He spent the rest of his life under house arrest at his villa in  |Arcetri|Arcetri|  near  |Florence|Florence| .        Among the subjects of this Inquisition were  |Franciscus_Patricius|Franciscus_Patricius| ,  |Giordano_Bruno|Giordano_Bruno| ,  |Tommaso_Campanella|Tommaso_Campanella| ,  |Gerolamo_Cardano|Gerolamo_Cardano| , and  |Cesare_Cremonini|Cesare_Cremonini| . Of these, only Bruno was executed, the last by the Roman Inquisition. Campanella was later implicated in a conspiracy to drive the Spanish from Naples and Sicily and was imprisoned for twenty-seven years in various Neapolitan fortresses.  , Edward N. Zalta He was finally released from the  |Castel_Nuovo|Castel_Nuovo|  in 1626, through Pope Urban VIII, who personally interceded on his behalf with  |Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip_Iv_Of_Spain| . The miller  |Domenico_Scandella|Menocchio|  was also  |burned_at_the_stake|Burned_At_The_Stake|  on the orders of  |Pope_Clement_VIII|Pope_Clement_Viii|  in 1599 for his belief that God was created from chaos. Ginzburg, Carlo The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth Century Miller , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,      The Inquisition also concerned itself with the  |Benandanti|Benandanti|  in the  |Friuli|Friuli|  region, but considered them a lesser danger than the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  and only handed out light sentences.     17th century traveler and author, John Bargrave, gave an account of his interactions with the Roman Inquisition. Arriving in the city of  |Reggio|Reggio_Emilia|  , Bargrave was stopped by the  |city_guard|City_Guard|  who inspected his books on suspicion some may have been on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Bargrave was brought before the citys chief  |inquisitor|Inquisitor|  who suggested they converse in  |Latin|Latin_Language|  rather than  |Italian|Italian_Language|  so that the guards might be prevented from understanding them. The inquisitor told him that the inquisition were not accustomed to stopping visitors or travellers unless someone had suggested they do so . Nonetheless, Bargrave was told he was required to hold a  |license|License|  from the inquisition. Even with a license, Bargrave was prohibited from carrying any books printed at any heretical city, as  |Geneva|Geneva| ,  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam| ,  |Leyden|Leyden| , London, or the like . Bargrave provided a  |catalog|Library_Catalog| ue of his books to the inquisition and was provided with a license to carry them for the rest of his journey.     The Inquisition in Malta is generally considered to have been gentler.      Italian historian Andrea Del Col estimates that out of 51,000–75,000 cases judged by Inquisition in Italy after 1542, around 1,250 resulted in a  |death_sentence|Execution| . Andrea Del Col: LInquisizione in Italia. Milan:  |Oscar_Mondadori|Oscar_Mondadori| , 2010, pp. 779–780. .       The Inquisitions have long been one of the primary subjects in the scholarly debates regarding witchcraft accusations of the early modern period. Historian Henry Charles Lea places an emphasis on torture methods employed to force confessions from the convicted. Connor, E. . Burning times: The inquisitions reign of terror . WomenWise, 12, 5 Carlo Ginzburg, in one of his most influential works, The Night Battles, discussed how Inquisitorial propaganda of demonology distorted popular folk beliefs. Ginzburg, Carlo. 1983. The Night Battles: Witchcraft & Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth & Seventeenth Centuries. London; Melbourne: Routledge & Kegan Paul. In similar light, Elliott P. Currie saw the Inquisitions as one singular, ongoing phenomenon, which drove the witch-hunt to its peak. Currie argued that the methods pioneered by the Inquisition indirectly guided continental Europe to a series of persecutions motivated by profit. Second-wave feminism also saw a surge of historical interpretation of the witch-hunt. Currie, Elliott P.. 1968. Crimes Without Criminals: Witchcraft and Its Control in Renaissance Europe . Law & Society Review 3 . 7–32 A number of 100,000 to 9,000,000 executions was given, all of which was attributed to the Inquisition. Feminist scholars Claudia Honeger and Nelly Moia saw the early modern witch-craze as a product of Inquisitorial influence, namely the  Malleus Maleficarum . Honegger, Claudia. 1979.
