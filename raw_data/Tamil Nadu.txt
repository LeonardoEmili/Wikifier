           Tamil Nadu , is one of the  |28_states_of_India|States_And_Union_Territories_Of_India| . Its capital and largest city is  |Chennai|Chennai|  . Tamil Nadu lies in the southernmost part of the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent|  and is bordered by the  |union_territory|Union_Territory|  of  |Puducherry|Puducherry|  and the  |South_India|South_India| n states of  |Kerala|Kerala| ,  |Karnataka|Karnataka| , and  |Andhra_Pradesh|Andhra_Pradesh| . It is bounded by the  |Eastern_Ghats|Eastern_Ghats|  on the north, by the  |Nilgiri_Mountains|Nilgiri_Mountains| , the  |Meghamalai|Meghamalai|  Hills, and  |Kerala|Kerala|  on the west, by the  |Bay_of_Bengal|Bay_Of_Bengal|  in the east, by the  |Gulf_of_Mannar|Gulf_Of_Mannar|  and the  |Palk_Strait|Palk_Strait|  on the southeast, and by the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean|  on the south. The state shares a maritime border with the nation of  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka| .     The region was ruled by several empires, including the  |three_great_empires|Three_Crowned_Kings|  –  |Chera|Chera_Dynasty| ,  |Chola|Chola_Dynasty|  and  |Pandyan|Pandya_Dynasty|  empires, which shape the regions  |cuisine|Tamil_Cuisine| ,  |culture|Tamil_Culture| , and  |architecture|Architecture_Of_Tamil_Nadu| . The  |British_Colonial_rule|British_Empire|  during the modern period led to the emergence of  |Chennai|Chennai| , then known as Madras, as a world-class city. Modern-day Tamil Nadu was formed in 1956 after the  |reorganisation_of_states|States_Reorganisation_Act,_1956|  on linguistic lines. The state is home to a number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage sites,  |hill_stations|Hill_Station|  and three  |World_Heritage_sites|World_Heritage_Site| .      Tamil Nadu is the  |tenth_largest_Indian_state_by_area|List_Of_States_And_Union_Territories_Of_India_By_Area|  and the  |sixth_largest_by_population|List_Of_States_And_Union_Territories_Of_India_By_Population| .

Tamil Nadu has the  |sixth_highest_ranking|List_Of_Indian_States_And_Territories_By_Human_Development_Index|  among Indian states in  |human_development_index|Human_Development_Index| . It was ranked as one of the top seven developed states in India based on a Multidimensional Development Index in a 2013 report published by the  |Reserve_Bank_of_India|Reserve_Bank_Of_India| .  Its official language is  |Tamil|Tamil_Language| , which is one of the longest-surviving  |classical_languages|Classical_Language|  in the world.              Archaeological evidence points to this area being one of the longest continuous habitations in the Indian peninsula. In  |Attirampakkam|Attirampakkam| , archaeologists from the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education excavated ancient stone tools which suggests that a humanlike population existed in the Tamil Nadu region somewhere around 300,000 years before  |homo_sapiens|Homo_Sapiens|  arrived from Africa.   In  |Adichanallur|Adichanallur| ,  from  |Tirunelveli|Tirunelveli| , archaeologists from the  |Archaeological_Survey_of_India|Archaeological_Survey_Of_India|  unearthed 169 clay urns containing human skulls, skeletons, bones, husks, grains of rice, charred rice and  |celts|Celt|  of the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  period, 3,800 years ago. The ASI archaeologists have proposed that the script used at that site is very rudimentary  |Tamil_Brahmi|Tamil_Brahmi| . Adichanallur has been announced as an archaeological site for further excavation and studies. About 60 per cent of the total epigraphical inscriptions found by the ASI in India are from Tamil Nadu, and most of these are in the  |Tamil_language|Tamil_Language| .  .  |The_Times_of_India|The_Times_Of_India| .

Sastri, A History of South India, OUP p 124 Kamil Veith Zvelebil, Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature, p 12       A Neolithic stone  |celt|Celt|  with the  |Indus_script|Indus_Script|  on it was discovered at Sembian-Kandiyur near  |Mayiladuthurai|Mayiladuthurai|  in Tamil Nadu. According to epigraphist  |Iravatham_Mahadevan|Iravatham_Mahadevan| , this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the  |Harappan_language|Harappan_Language| , and therefore that the Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a  |Harappan_language|Harappan_Language|  . The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter’s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: ‘There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism… Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South… This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double “archaeological miracle”: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions. Such a phenomenon is unheard of.’                    The early history of the people and rulers of Tamil Nadu is a topic in Tamil literary sources known as  |Sangam_literature|Sangam_Literature| . Numismatic, archaeological and literary sources corroborate that the Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BC to AD 300. The recent excavations in  |Alagankulam|Alagankulam|  archaeological site suggests that Alagankulam is one of the important trade centres or port cities of the Sangam Era.   |Kaveri_River|Kaveri_River|  in  |Thanjavur_district|Thanjavur_District|  by  |Karikala_Chola|Karikala_Chola|  around the 2nd century CE      |Shore_Temple|Shore_Temple|  built by the  |Pallavas|Pallavas|  at  |Mamallapuram|Mamallapuram|  during the 8th century, now a  |UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site|Unesco_World_Heritage_Site| |Vettuvan_Koil|Vettuvan_Koil| , the unfinished temple is believed to have been built during the 8th century by  |Pandyas|Pandyas|  in Kalugumalai, a panchayat town in  |Thoothukudi_district|Thoothukudi_District| .     During the 4th to 8th centuries, Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the  |Pallava_dynasty|Pallava_Dynasty|  under  |Mahendravarman_I|Mahendravarman_I|  and his son Mamalla  |Narasimhavarman_I|Narasimhavarman_I| . The Pallavas ruled parts of  |South_India|South_India|  with  |Kanchipuram|Kanchipuram|  as their capital.  |Tamil_architecture|Tamil_Architecture|  reached its peak during Pallava rule.  |Narasimhavarman_II|Narasimhavarman_Ii|  built the  |Shore_Temple|Shore_Temple|  which is a  |UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site|Unesco_World_Heritage_Site| .     Much later, the  |Pallavas|Pallavas|  were replaced by the  |Chola_dynasty|Chola_Dynasty|  as the dominant kingdom in the 9th century and they in turn were replaced by the  |Pandyan_Dynasty|Pandyan_Dynasty|  in the 13th century. The Pandyan capital  |Madurai|Madurai|  was in the deep south away from the coast. They had extensive trade links with the south east Asian maritime empires of  |Srivijaya|Srivijaya|  and their successors, as well as contacts, even formal diplomatic contacts, reaching as far as the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| . During the 13th century,  |Marco_Polo|Marco_Polo|  mentioned the Pandyas as the  |richest_empire|Richest_Country|  in existence. Temples such as the  |Meenakshi_Amman_Temple|Meenakshi_Amman_Temple|  at  |Madurai|Madurai|  and  |Nellaiappar_Temple|Nellaiappar_Temple|  at  |Tirunelveli|Tirunelveli|  are the best examples of Pandyan temple architecture. The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature. They controlled the pearl fisheries along the south coast of India, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced some of the finest pearls in the known ancient world.                During the 9th century, the Chola dynasty was once again revived by  |Vijayalaya_Chola|Vijayalaya_Chola| , who established  |Thanjavur|Thanjavur|  as Cholas new capital by conquering central Tamil Nadu from  |Mutharaiyar|Mutharaiyar|  and the Pandya king  |Varagunavarman_II|Varagunavarman_Ii| .  |Aditya_I|Aditya_I|  and his son  |Parantaka_I|Parantaka_I|  expanded the kingdom to the northern parts of Tamil Nadu by defeating the last Pallava king,  |Aparajitavarman|Aparajitavarman| .  |Parantaka_Chola_II|Parantaka_Chola_Ii|  expanded the Chola empire into what is now interior Andhra Pradesh and coastal Karnataka, while under the great  |Rajaraja_Chola|Rajaraja_Chola|  and his son  |Rajendra_Chola|Rajendra_Chola| , the Cholas rose to a notable power in south east Asia. Now the  |Chola_Empire|Chola_Empire|  stretched as far as  |Bengal|Bengal|  and Sri Lanka. At its peak, the empire spanned almost . Rajaraja Chola conquered all of peninsular  |south_India|South_India|  and parts of Sri Lanka. Rajendra Cholas navy went even further, occupying coasts from Burma to Vietnam, the  |Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands|Andaman_And_Nicobar_Islands| , Lakshadweep,  |Sumatra|Sumatra| ,  |Java|Java| ,  |Malaya|Malay_Peninsula| , Philippines  in South East Asia and Pegu islands. He defeated  |Mahipala|Mahipala| , the king of Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital and named it  |Gangaikonda_Cholapuram|Gangaikonda_Cholapuram| .        The Cholas were prolific temple builders right from the times of the first medieval king  |Vijayalaya_Chola|Vijayalaya_Chola| . These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power and built some of the most imposing religious structures in their lifetime and they also renovated temples and buildings of the  |Pallavas|Pallavas| , acknowledging their common socio-religious and cultural heritage. The celebrated  |Nataraja|Nataraja|  temple at  |Chidambaram|Chidambaram|  and the  |Sri_Ranganathaswami_Temple|Sri_Ranganathaswamy_Temple,_Srirangam|  at  |Srirangam|Srirangam|  held special significance for the Cholas which have been mentioned in their inscriptions as their tutelary deities.  |Rajaraja_Chola_I|Rajaraja_Chola_I|  and his son  |Rajendra_Chola|Rajendra_Chola|  built temples such as the  |Brihadeshvara_Temple|Brihadeshvara_Temple|  of Thanjavur and Brihadeshvara Temple of  |Gangaikonda_Cholapuram|Gangaikonda_Cholapuram| , the  |Airavatesvara_Temple|Airavatesvara_Temple|  of  |Darasuram|Darasuram|  and the  |Sarabeswara|Sarabeswara|  Temple, also called the Kampahareswarar Temple at  |Thirubhuvanam|Thirubuvanam| , the last two temples being located near Kumbakonam. The first three of the above four temples are titled  |Great_Living_Chola_Temples|Great_Living_Chola_Temples|  among the  |UNESCO|Unesco| |World_Heritage_Sites|World_Heritage_Sites| .     |gopuram|Gopuram|  of  |Brihadeeswarar_Temple|Brihadeeswarar_Temple| |Airavatesvara_Temple|Airavatesvara_Temple|  built by  |Rajaraja_Chola_II|Rajaraja_Chola_Ii| |Brihadisvara_Temple|Brihadisvara_Temple,_Gangaikonda_Cholapuram| |Thanjavur|Thanjavur|                The Muslim invasions of southern India triggered the establishment of the  |Hindu|Hindu| |Vijayanagara_Empire|Vijayanagara_Empire|  with  |Vijayanagara|Vijayanagara|  in modern  |Karnataka|Karnataka|  as its capital. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the  |Battle_of_Talikota|Battle_Of_Talikota|  in 1565 by a confederacy of  |Deccan_sultanates|Deccan_Sultanates| . Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called  |Nayaks|Nayak_Dynasty| , succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the  |Nayaks_of_Madurai|Nayaks_Of_Madurai|  and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom. The Nayaks of Madurai and  |Nayaks_of_Thanjavur|Nayaks_Of_Thanjavur|  were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century. They reconstructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu such as the  |Meenakshi_Temple|Meenakshi_Temple| .          By the early 18th century, the political scene in Tamil Nadu saw a major change-over and was under the control of many minor rulers aspiring to be independent. The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the  |sultanate_of_Golconda|Sultanate_Of_Golconda|  a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the  |nawab_of_the_Carnatic|Nawab_Of_The_Carnatic| , who had his seat in  |Arcot|Arcot|  from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the  |Thanjavur_Nayaks|Thanjavur_Nayaks|  led to a short-lived  |Thanjavur_Maratha_kingdom|Thanjavur_Maratha_Kingdom| . The fall of the  |Madurai_Nayaks|Madurai_Nayaks|  brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as  |Palaiyakkarar|Palaiyakkarar|  and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.        Europeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions. Around 1609, the Dutch established a settlement in  |Pulicat|Pulicat| , Bethencourt p.211 while the Danes had their establishment in  |Tharangambadi|Tharangambadi|  also known as Tranquebar.  In 1639, the British, under the East India Company, established a settlement further south of Pulicat, in present-day  |Chennai|Chennai| . British constructed  |Fort_St._George|Fort_St._George|   and established a trading post at Madras.  The office of  |mayoralty_of_Madras|List_Of_Mayors_Of_Chennai|  was established in 1688. The French established trading posts at  |Pondichéry|Pondichéry|  by 1693. The British and French were competing to expand the trade in the northern parts of Tamil Nadu which also witnessed many battles like  |Battle_of_Wandiwash|Battle_Of_Wandiwash|  as part of the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War| .  British reduced the French dominions in India to Puducherry. Nawabs of the Carnatic bestowed tax revenue collection rights on the East India Company for defeating the  |Kingdom_of_Mysore|Kingdom_Of_Mysore| . Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah surrendered much of his territory to the East India Company which firmly established the British in the northern parts. In 1762, a tripartite treaty was signed between Thanjavur Maratha, Carnatic and the British by which Thanjavur became a vassal of the Nawab of the Carnatic which eventually ceded to the British.     In the south, Nawabs granted taxation rights to the British which led to conflicts between British and the Palaiyakkarar, which resulted in series of wars called  |Polygar_war|Polygar_War|  to establish independent states by the aspiring Palaiyakkarar.  |Puli_Thevar|Puli_Thevar|  was one of the earliest opponents of the British rule in South India.  Thevars prominent exploits were his confrontations with  |Marudhanayagam|Marudhanayagam_Pillai| , who later rebelled against the British in the late 1750s and early 1760s.  |Rani_Velu_Nachiyar|Rani_Velu_Nachiyar| , was the first woman freedom fighter of India and Queen of Sivagangai.  She was drawn to war after her husband Muthu Vaduganatha Thevar , King of  |Sivaganga|Sivaganga|  was murdered at  |Kalayar_Kovil|Kalayar_Kovil|  temple by British. Before her death, Queen Velu Nachi granted powers to the  |Maruthu_brothers|Maruthu_Brothers|  to rule Sivaganga.   |Kattabomman|Kattabomman|  , Palaiyakkara chief of Panchalakurichi who fought the British in the First  |Polygar_War|Polygar_War| .  He was captured by the British at the end of the war and hanged near Kayattar in 1799.  |Veeran_Sundaralingam|Veeran_Sundaralingam|  was the General of Kattabomman Nayakans palayam, who died in the process of blowing up a British ammunition dump in 1799 which killed more than 150 British soldiers to save Kattapomman Palace.  |Oomaithurai|Oomaithurai| , younger brother of Kattabomman, took asylum under the Maruthu brothers, Periya Marudhu and Chinna Marudhu and raised an army  . They formed a coalition with  |Dheeran_Chinnamalai|Dheeran_Chinnamalai|  and Kerala Varma  |Pazhassi_Raja|Pazhassi_Raja|  which fought the British in Second Polygar Wars.  |Dheeran_Chinnamalai|Dheeran_Chinnamalai|  , Polygar chieftain of Kongu and ally of Tipu Sultan who fought the British in the Second Polygar War. After winning the Polygar wars in 1801, the East India Company consolidated most of southern India into the  |Madras_Presidency|Madras_Presidency| .          The Pudukkottai Thondaimans rose to power over the Pudukkottai area by the end of the 17th Century. The Pudukkottai kingdom has the distinction of being the only princely state in Tamil Nadu, and only became part of the Indian union in 1948 after independence.           At the beginning of the 19th century, the British firmly established governance over entirety of Tamil Nadu. The  |Vellore_mutiny|Vellore_Mutiny|  on 10 July 1806 was the first instance of a large-scale mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British  |East_India_Company|East_India_Company| , predating the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by half a century.  The revolt, which took place in  |Vellore|Vellore| , was brief, lasting one full day, but brutal as mutineers broke into the Vellore fort and killed or wounded 200 British troops, before they were subdued by reinforcements from nearby Arcot.   The British crown took over the control governance from the company and the remainder of the 19th century did not witness any native resistance until the beginning of 20th century Indian Independence movements. During the administration of Governor  |George_Harris|George_Harris,_3Rd_Baron_Harris|  measures were taken to improve education and increase representation of Indians in the administration. Legislative powers given to the Governors Council under the Indian Councils Act 1861 and 1909  |Minto-Morley_Reforms|Minto-Morley_Reforms|  eventually led to the establishment of the  |Madras_Legislative_Council|Madras_Legislative_Council| . Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the  |Ryotwari|Ryotwari|  system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the  |Great_Famine_of_1876–78|Great_Famine_Of_1876–78|  and the  |Indian_famine_of_1896–97|Indian_Famine_Of_1896–97| . The famine led to the migration of people as bonded labourers for the British to various countries which eventually formed the present  |Tamil_diaspora|Tamil_Diaspora| .       When India became independent in 1947, Madras presidency became  |Madras_state|Madras_State| , comprising present-day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh up to Ganjam district in Odisha, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning Tamil country .              Tamil Nadu covers an area of , and is the tenth largest state in India. The bordering states are  |Kerala|Kerala|  to the west,  |Karnataka|Karnataka|  to the north west and  |Andhra_Pradesh|Andhra_Pradesh|  to the north. To the east is the  |Bay_of_Bengal|Bay_Of_Bengal|  and the state encircles the  |union_territory|Union_Territory|  of  |Puducherry|Puducherry| . The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is  |Kanyakumari|Kanyakumari|  which is the meeting point of the  |Arabian_Sea|Arabian_Sea| , the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean.     The western, southern and the northwestern parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The  |Western_Ghats|Western_Ghats|  and the  |Eastern_Ghats|Eastern_Ghats|  meet at the  |Nilgiri_hills|Nilgiri_Hills| . The Western Ghats traverse the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain bearing clouds of the south west monsoon from entering the state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the south central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall than the other regions.     Tamil Nadu has the countrys third longest  |coastline|Coastline_Of_Tamil_Nadu|  at about .  Tamil Nadus coastline bore the brunt of the 2004  |Indian_Ocean_tsunami|Indian_Ocean_Tsunami|  when it hit India, which caused 7,793 direct deaths in the state. Tamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards map, Tamil Nadu falls in zones II and III. Historically, parts of this region have experienced seismic activity in the M5.0 range.       Tamil Nadu is mostly dependent on monsoon rains, and thereby is prone to droughts when the monsoons fail. The climate of the state ranges from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. The state has two distinct periods of rainfall:    |South_west_monsoon|Monsoon|  from June to September, with strong southwest winds;    |North_east_monsoon|Monsoonlate_In_Year|  from October to December, with dominant northeast winds;     The annual rainfall of the state is about  of which 48 per cent is through the north east monsoon, and 32 percent through the south west monsoon. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute  |water_scarcity|Water_Scarcity|  and severe drought. Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: north east, north west, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and  |Kaveri|Kaveri|  Delta .          There are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu. Protected areas provide safe habitat for large mammals including  |elephants|Indian_Elephant| ,  |tigers|Bengal_Tiger| ,  |leopards|Indian_Leopard| ,  |wild_dogs|Dhole| ,  |sloth_bears|Sloth_Bear| ,  |gaurs|Gaur| ,  |lion-tailed_macaques|Lion-Tailed_Macaque| ,  |Nilgiri_langurs|Nilgiri_Langur| ,  |Nilgiri_tahrs|Nilgiri_Tahr| ,  |grizzled_giant_squirrels|Grizzled_Giant_Squirrel|  and  |sambar_deer|Sambar_Deer| , resident and migratory birds such as  |cormorants|Cormorant| ,  |darters|Darter| ,  |herons|Heron| ,  |egrets|Egret| ,  |open-billed_storks|Asian_Openbill_Stork| ,  |spoonbills|Spoonbill|  and  |white_ibises|Black-Headed_Ibis| ,  |little_grebes|Little_Grebe| ,  |Indian_moorhen|Common_Moorheneurasian_Common_Moorhen| ,  |black-winged_stilts|Black-Winged_Stilt| , a few migratory  |ducks|Duck|  and occasionally  |grey_pelicans|Pelecanus_Philippensis| , marine species such as the  |dugongs|Dugong| , turtles, dolphins,  Balanoglossus  and a wide variety of fish and insects.     Indian  |Angiosperm|Angiosperm|  diversity comprises 17,672 species with Tamil Nadu leading all states in the country, with 5640 species accounting for 1/3 of the total flora of India. This includes 1,559 species of  |medicinal_plants|Medicinal_Plant| , 533  |endemic|Endemism|  species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants and 230  |red-listed|Red-Listed|  species. The  |gymnosperm|Gymnosperm|  diversity of the country is 64 species of which Tamil Nadu has four indigenous species and about 60 introduced species. The  |Pteridophytes|Pteridophyte|  diversity of India includes 1,022 species of which Tamil Nadu has about 184 species. Vast numbers of  |bryophytes|Bryophyte| ,  |lichen|Lichen| , fungi,  |algae|Algae|  and bacteria are among the wild plant diversity of Tamil Nadu.     Common plant species include the state tree:  |palmyra_palm|Borassus_Flabellifercultural_Symbolism| ,  |eucalyptus|Eucalyptus| , rubber,  |cinchona|Cinchona| , clumping bamboos ,  |common_teak|Tectona_Grandis| ,  Anogeissus latifolia ,  |Indian_laurel|Terminalia_Tomentosa| ,  |grewia|Grewia| , and blooming trees like  |Indian_labumusum|Cassia_Fistula| ,  |ardisia|Ardisia| , and  |solanaceae|Solanaceae| . Rare and unique plant life includes Combretum ovalifolium,  |ebony|Ebony|  ,  Habenaria rariflora ,  Alsophila ,  Impatiens elegans,  Ranunculus reniformis, and  |royal_fern|Osmunda_Regalis| .             Tamil Nadu has a wide range of  |biomes|Biomes|  extending east from the  |South_Western_Ghats_montane_rain_forests|South_Western_Ghats_Montane_Rain_Forests|  in the  |Western_Ghats|Western_Ghats|  through the  |South_Deccan_Plateau_dry_deciduous_forests|South_Deccan_Plateau_Dry_Deciduous_Forests|  and  |Deccan_thorn_scrub_forests|Deccan_Thorn_Scrub_Forests|  to  |tropical_dry_broadleaf_forests|Tropical_And_Subtropical_Dry_Broadleaf_Forests|  and then to the beaches,  |estuaries|Estuaries| ,  |salt_marsh|Salt_Marsh| es,  |mangroves|Mangrove| ,  |seagrass|Seagrass| es and  |coral_reefs|Coral_Reef|  of the  |Bay_of_Bengal|Bay_Of_Bengal| .   The state has a range of flora and fauna with many species and habitats. To protect this diversity of wildlife there are  |Protected_areas|Protected_Areas|  of Tamil Nadu as well as  |biospheres|Biosphere_Reserves_Of_India|  which protect larger areas of natural habitat often include one or more national parks. The  |Gulf_of_Mannar_Biosphere_Reserve|Gulf_Of_Mannar_Biosphere_Reserve|  established in 1986 is a marine ecosystem with seaweed seagrass communities, coral reefs, salt marshes and mangrove forests.
