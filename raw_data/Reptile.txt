        Reptiles are  |tetrapod|Tetrapod|  animals in the  |class|Class|  Reptilia, comprising todays  |turtles|Turtle| ,  |crocodilia|Crocodilia| ns,  |snakes|Snake| ,  |amphisbaenia|Amphisbaenia| ns,  |lizards|Lizard| ,  |tuatara|Tuatara| , and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile  |orders|Order| , historically combined with that of modern  |amphibians|Amphibian| , is called  |herpetology|Herpetology| .     Because some reptiles are more closely related to  |birds|Bird|  than they are to other reptiles , the traditional groups of reptiles listed above do not together constitute a  |monophyletic|Monophyletic|  grouping or  |clade|Clade|  . For this reason, many modern scientists prefer to consider the  |birds|Bird|  part of Reptilia as well, thereby making Reptilia a monophyletic class, including all living  |Diapsids|Diapsid| .       The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the  |Carboniferous|Carboniferous|  period, having evolved from advanced  |reptiliomorph|Reptiliomorpha|  tetrapods that became increasingly adapted to life on dry land. Some early examples include the lizard-like  Hylonomus  and  Casineria . In addition to the living reptiles, there are many diverse groups that are now  |extinct|Extinction| , in some cases due to  |mass_extinction_events|Extinction_Event| . In particular, the  |Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Extinction_Event|  wiped out the  |pterosaurs|Pterosaur| ,  |plesiosaurs|Plesiosauria| ,  |ornithischia|Ornithischia| ns, and  |sauropods|Sauropoda| , as well as many species of  |theropods|Theropoda| , including  |troodontids|Troodontidae| ,  |dromaeosaurids|Dromaeosauridae| ,  |tyrannosaurids|Tyrannosauridae| , and  |abelisaurids|Abelisauridae| , along with many  |Crocodyliformes|Crocodyliformes| , and  |squamates|Squamata|  .     Modern non-avian reptiles inhabit all the continents except  |Antarctica|Antarctica| , although some birds are found on the periphery of Antarctica. Several living subgroups are recognized:  |Testudines|Testudines|  , 350 species;   |Rhynchocephalia|Rhynchocephalia|  , 1 species;   |Squamata|Squamata|  , over 10,200 species;  |Crocodilia|Crocodilia|  , 24 species; and Aves , approximately 10,000 species.      Reptiles are  |tetrapod|Tetrapod| |_vertebrates|Vertebrates| , creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike  |amphibians|Amphibian| , reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are  |oviparous|Oviparous| , although several species of squamates are  |viviparous|Viviparity| , as were some extinct aquatic clades   – the fetus develops within the mother, contained in a  |placenta|Placenta|  rather than an  |eggshell|Eggshell| . As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their  |fetus|Fetus| es through various forms of placenta analogous to those of  |mammals|Mammal| , with some providing initial care for their hatchlings.  |Extant|Neontology|  reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko,  Sphaerodactylus ariasae , which can grow up to  to the  |saltwater_crocodile|Saltwater_Crocodile| , Crocodylus porosus, which can reach  in length and weigh over .                      In the 13th century the category of reptile was recognized in Europe as consisting of a miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including snakes, various fantastic monsters, lizards, assorted amphibians, and worms , as recorded by  |Vincent_of_Beauvais|Vincent_Of_Beauvais|  in his Mirror of Nature.    In the 18th century, the reptiles were, from the outset of classification, grouped with the  |amphibians|Amphibian| .  |Linnaeus|Carl_Linnaeus| , working from species-poor  |Sweden|Sweden| , where the  |common_adder|Common_Adder|  and  |grass_snake|Grass_Snake|  are often found hunting in water, included all reptiles and amphibians in  |class|Class|  III  –  |Amphibia|Amphibia_In_The_10Th_Edition_Of_Systema_Naturae|  in his  Systema Naturæ .    The terms reptile and amphibian were largely interchangeable, reptile  being preferred by the French.   |Josephus_Nicolaus_Laurenti|Josephus_Nicolaus_Laurenti|  was the first to formally use the term Reptilia for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus. Laurenti, J.N. : Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium Emendatam cum Experimentis circa Venena. , showing the mixed composition of his Reptilia Today, the two groups are still commonly treated under the same heading as  |herptiles|Herpetology| .          It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and  |Pierre_André_Latreille|Pierre_André_Latreille|  erected the class Batracia for the latter, dividing the  |tetrapods|Tetrapod|  into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Latreielle, P.A. : Nouveau Dictionnaire à Histoire Naturelle, xxiv., cited in Latreilles Familles naturelles du règne animal, exposés succinctement et dans un ordre analytique, 1825 The British anatomist  |Thomas_Henry_Huxley|Thomas_Henry_Huxley|  made Latreilles definition popular and, together with  |Richard_Owen|Richard_Owen| , expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil  |antediluvian|Antediluvian|  monsters , including  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|  and the mammal-like   Dicynodon  he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the  |Hunterian_lectures|Hunterian_Lectures|  delivered at the  |Royal_College_of_Surgeons|Royal_College_Of_Surgeons_Of_England|  in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into  |mammals|Mammal| , sauroids, and ichthyoids . He subsequently proposed the names of  |Sauropsida|Sauropsida|  and  |Ichthyopsida|Ichthyopsida|  for the latter two groups. Huxley, T.H. : The Structure and Classification of the Mammalia. Hunterian lectures, presented in Medical Times and Gazette, 1863.  In 1866,  |Haeckel|Ernst_Haeckel|  demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the  |amniotic_egg|Amniotic_Egg| .     The terms Sauropsida and  |Theropsida|Synapsid|  were used again in 1916 by  |E_S_Goodrich|Edwin_Stephen_Goodrich|  to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand and  |mammals|Mammal|  and their extinct relatives on the other. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, Protosauria in which he included some animals today considered  |reptile_like_amphibians|Reptiliomorpha| , as well as early reptiles.      In 1956,  |D_M_S_Watson|D_M_S_Watson|  observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian history, so he divided Goodrichs Protosauria between them. He also reinterpreted Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals, respectively. Thus his Sauropsida included  |Procolophonia|Procolophonia| ,  |Eosuchia|Eosuchia| ,  |Millerosauria|Millerettid| ,  |Chelonia|Turtle|  ,  |Squamata|Squamata|  ,  |Rhynchocephalia|Sphenodontia| ,  |Crocodilia|Crocodilia| ,  |thecodonts|Thecodontia|  , non- |avian|Wikt_Avian| |dinosaurs|Dinosaur| ,  |pterosaurs|Pterosaur| ,  |ichthyosaurs|Ichthyosaur| , and  |sauropterygia|Sauropterygia| ns.      In the late 19th century, a number of definitions of Reptilia were offered. The traits listed by  |Lydekker|Richard_Lydekker|  in 1896, for example, include a single  |occipital_condyle|Occipital_Condyle| , a jaw joint formed by the  |quadrate|Quadrate_Bone|  and  |articular|Articular|  bones, and certain characteristics of the  |vertebrae|Vertebral_Column| .  The animals singled out by these formulations, the  |amniotes|Amniote|  other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.          The synapsid/sauropsid division supplemented another approach, one that split the reptiles into four subclasses based on the number and position of  |temporal_fenestrae|Skulltemporal_Fenestra| , openings in the sides of the skull behind the eyes. This classification was initiated by  |Henry_Fairfield_Osborn|Henry_Fairfield_Osborn|  and elaborated and made popular by  |Romers|Alfred_Romer|  classic  Vertebrate Paleontology .  , 3rd ed., 1966. Those four subclasses were:    |Anapsid|Anapsid| a  – no fenestrae  –  |cotylosaurs|Cotylosaur|  and  |Chelonia|Turtle|   This taxonomy does not reflect modern molecular evidence, which places turtles within Diapsida.    |Synapsid|Synapsid| a  – one low fenestra  –  |pelycosaurs|Pelycosaur|  and  |therapsids|Therapsid| |_Euryapsida|Euryapsida|   – one high fenestra  –  |protorosaurs|Protorosaur|  and the marine  |sauropterygia|Sauropterygia| ns and  |ichthyosaurs|Ichthyosaurs| , the latter called  |Parapsida|Parapsida|  in Osborns work.    |Diapsid|Diapsid| a  – two fenestrae  – most reptiles, including  |lizards|Lizard| ,  |snakes|Snake| ,  |crocodilians|Crocodilian| ,  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|  and  |pterosaurs|Pterosaur|      The composition of Euryapsida was uncertain.  |Ichthyosaurs|Ichthyosaurs|  were, at times, considered to have arisen independently of the other euryapsids, and given the older name Parapsida. Parapsida was later discarded as a group for the most part . However, four subclasses remained more or less universal for non-specialist work throughout the 20th century. It has largely been abandoned by recent researchers: in particular, the anapsid condition has been found to occur so variably among unrelated groups that it is not now considered a useful distinction.           By the early 21st century, vertebrate paleontologists were beginning to adopt  |phylogenetic|Phylogenetic|  taxonomy, in which all groups are defined in such a way as to be  |monophyletic|Clade| ; that is, groups include all descendants of a particular ancestor. The reptiles as historically defined are  |paraphyletic|Paraphyly| , since they exclude both birds and mammals. These respectively evolved from dinosaurs and from early therapsids, which were both traditionally called reptiles.  Birds are more closely related to  |crocodilians|Crocodilian|  than the latter are to the rest of extant reptiles.  |Colin_Tudge|Colin_Tudge|  wrote:     Mammals are a  |clade|Cladistics| , and therefore the  |cladists|Phylogenetic_Nomenclature|  are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon  |Mammal|Mammal| ia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon  |Aves|Bird| . Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just a section of the clade  |Amniota|Amniota| |synapomorphies|Synapomorphy| , as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes.         Despite the early proposals for replacing the paraphyletic Reptilia with a monophyletic  |Sauropsida|Sauropsida| , which includes birds, that term was never adopted widely or, when it was, was not applied consistently.  When Sauropsida was used, it often had the same content or even the same definition as Reptilia. In 1988,  |Jacques_Gauthier|Jacques_Gauthier|  proposed a  |cladistic|Cladistics|  definition of Reptilia as a monophyletic node-based  |crown_group|Crown_Group|  containing turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants. Because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time, Gauthiers definition came to be considered inadequate.     A variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthiers paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the  |PhyloCode|Phylocode| , was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to  Lacerta agilis  and  Crocodylus niloticus  than to  Homo sapiens . This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Andersons definition includes birds, as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.

Lee, in 2013.  All  |genetic|Molecular_Phylogenetics|  studies have supported the hypothesis that turtles are diapsids; some have placed turtles within archosauriformes,  though a few have recovered turtles as lepidosauriformes instead.  The cladogram below used a combination of genetic and fossil data to obtain its results.            The placement of turtles has historically been highly variable. Classically, turtles were considered to be related to the primitive anapsid reptiles. Molecular work has usually placed turtles within the diapsids. As of 2013, three turtle genomes have been sequenced.  The results place turtles as a  |sister_clade|Sister_Clade|  to the  |archosaurs|Archosaur| , the group that includes crocodiles, dinosaurs, and birds.                       The origin of the reptiles lies about 310–320 million years ago, in the steaming swamps of the late  |Carboniferous|Carboniferous|  period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced  |reptiliomorphs|Reptiliomorpha| .        The oldest known animal that may have been an  |amniote|Amniote|  is  Casineria  .   Chapter 6: Walking with early tetrapods: evolution of the postcranial skeleton and the phylogenetic affinities of the Temnospondyli . In. PhD Thesis. La Trobe University, Melbourne.  A series of footprints from the fossil strata of  |Nova_Scotia|Nova_Scotia|  dated to  show typical reptilian toes and imprints of scales.  These tracks are attributed to  Hylonomus , the oldest unquestionable reptile known.    It was a small, lizard-like animal, about  long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet.  Other examples include  Westlothiana    and  Paleothyris , both of similar build and presumably similar habit.       The earliest amniotes, including stem-reptiles , were largely overshadowed by larger stem-tetrapods, such as  Cochleosaurus , and remained a small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until the  |Carboniferous_Rainforest_Collapse|Carboniferous_Rainforest_Collapse| .  This sudden collapse affected several large groups. Primitive tetrapods were particularly devastated, while stem-reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed. Primitive tetrapods, like modern amphibians, need to return to water to lay eggs; in contrast, amniotes, like modern reptiles  – whose eggs possess a shell that allows them to be laid on land  – were better adapted to the new conditions. Amniotes acquired new niches at a faster rate than before the collapse and at a much faster rate than primitive tetrapods. They acquired new feeding strategies including herbivory and carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores. From this point forward, reptiles dominated communities and had a greater diversity than primitive tetrapods, setting the stage for the Mesozoic .  One of the best known early stem-reptiles is  Mesosaurus , a genus from the  |Early_Permian|Cisuralian|  that had returned to water, feeding on fish.            It was traditionally assumed that the first reptiles retained an  |anapsid|Anapsid|  skull inherited from their ancestors. Coven, R : History of Life.  |Blackwell_Science|Blackwell_Science| , Oxford, UK.  from Google Books This type of skull has a  |skull_roof|Skull_Roof|  with only holes for the nostrils, eyes and a  |pineal_eye|Pineal_Eye| .  |Romer_A_S|Alfred_Romer| . & T.S. Parsons. 1977. The Vertebrate Body. 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. The discoveries of  |synapsid|Synapsid| -like openings in the skull roof of the skulls of several members of  |Parareptilia|Parareptilia|  , including  |lanthanosuchoids|Lanthanosuchoidea| ,  |millerettids|Millerettidae| ,  |bolosaurids|Bolosauridae| , some  |nycteroleterids|Nycteroleteridae| , some  |procolophonoids|Procolophonoidea|  and at least some  |mesosaurs|Mesosaur|     made it more ambiguous and its currently uncertain whether the ancestral amniote had an anapsid-like or synapsid-like skull. These animals are traditionally referred to as anapsids , and form a  |paraphyletic|Paraphyly|  basic stock from which other groups evolved. Very shortly after the first amniotes appeared, a lineage called  |Synapsida|Synapsida|  split off; this group was characterized by a temporal opening in the skull behind each eye to give room for the jaw muscle to move. These are the mammal-like amniotes , or stem-mammals, that later gave rise to the true  |mammals|Mammals| .  Soon after, another group evolved a similar trait, this time with a double opening behind each eye, earning them the name  |Diapsida|Diapsida|  . The function of the holes in these groups was to lighten the skull and give room for the jaw muscles to move, allowing for a more powerful bite.     Turtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving parareptiles, on the basis of their anapsid skull structure, which was assumed to be primitive trait. , 3rd ed. 2004  The rationale for this classification has been disputed, with some arguing that turtles are diapsids that evolved anapsid skulls in order to improve their armor. Later morphological  |phylogenetic|Phylogenetics|  studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within Diapsida.  All  |molecular|Molecular_Phylogenetics|  studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids, most commonly as a sister group to extant  |archosaurs|Archosaur| .           With the close of the  |Carboniferous|Carboniferous| , the amniotes became the dominant tetrapod fauna. While primitive, terrestrial  |reptiliomorphs|Reptiliomorpha|  still existed, the synapsid amniotes evolved the first truly terrestrial  |megafauna|Megafauna|  in the form of  |pelycosaurs|Pelycosaurs| , such as  Edaphosaurus  and the carnivorous  Dimetrodon . In the mid-Permian period, the climate became drier, resulting in a change of fauna: The pelycosaurs were replaced by the  |therapsids|Therapsids| .  |Colbert_E_H_|Edwin_Harris_Colbert|  & Morales, M. :  Colberts Evolution of the Vertebrates: A History of the Backboned Animals Through Time . 4th edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York. .     The parareptiles, whose massive  |skull_roofs|Skull_Roof|  had no postorbital holes, continued and flourished throughout the Permian. The  |pareiasaur|Pareiasaur| ian parareptiles reached giant proportions in the late Permian, eventually disappearing at the close of the period .     Early in the period, the modern reptiles, or  |crown_group_reptiles|Sauria| , evolved and split into two main lineages: the  |Archosauromorpha|Archosauromorpha|   and the  |Lepidosauromorpha|Lepidosauromorpha|  . Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.       The close of the Permian saw the greatest mass extinction known , an event prolonged by the combination of two or more distinct extinction pulses.  Most of the earlier parareptile and synapsid megafauna disappeared, being replaced by the true reptiles, particularly  |archosauromorphs|Archosauromorpha| . These were characterized by elongated hind legs and an erect pose, the early forms looking somewhat like long-legged crocodiles. The  |archosaurs|Archosaur|  became the dominant group during the  |Triassic|Triassic|  period, though it took 30 million years before their diversity was as great as the animals that lived in the Permian. Archosaurs developed into the well-known  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur|  and  |pterosaurs|Pterosaur| , as well as the ancestors of  |crocodiles|Crocodile| . Since reptiles, first  |rauisuchia|Rauisuchia| ns and then dinosaurs, dominated the Mesozoic era, the interval is popularly known as the Age of Reptiles . The dinosaurs also developed smaller forms, including the feather-bearing smaller  |theropods|Theropoda| . In the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  period, these gave rise to the first true  |birds|Birds| .      The  |sister_group|Sister_Group|  to Archosauromorpha is  |Lepidosauromorpha|Lepidosauromorpha| , containing  |lizards|Lizard|  and  |tuataras|Tuatara| , as well as their fossil relatives. Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea reptiles: the  |mosasaurs|Mosasaurs| , which lived during the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  period. The phylogenetic placement of other main groups of fossil sea reptiles – the  |ichthyopterygia|Ichthyopterygia| ns  and the  |sauropterygia|Sauropterygia| ns, which evolved in the early Triassic – is more controversial. Different authors linked these groups either to lepidosauromorphs Gauthier J.A. : The diversification of the amniotes. In: D.R. Prothero and R.M. Schoch Major Features of Vertebrate Evolution: 129-159. Knoxville, Tennessee: The Paleontological Society. or to archosauromorphs,    and ichthyopterygians were also argued to be diapsids that did not belong to the least inclusive clade containing lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs.             The close of the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  period saw the demise of the Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna . Of the large marine reptiles, only  |sea_turtles|Sea_Turtle|  were left; and of the non-marine large reptiles, only the semi-aquatic  |crocodiles|Crocodilia|  and broadly similar  |choristoderes|Choristodera|  survived the extinction, with the latter becoming extinct in the  |Miocene|Miocene| .  Of the great host of dinosaurs dominating the Mesozoic, only the small beaked  |birds|Birds|  survived. This dramatic extinction pattern at the end of the Mesozoic led into the Cenozoic. Mammals and birds filled the empty niches left behind by the reptilian megafauna and, while reptile diversification slowed, bird and mammal diversification took an exponential turn. However, reptiles were still important components of the megafauna, particularly in the form of large and giant  |tortoises|Tortoise| .       After the extinction of most archosaur and marine reptile lines by the end of the Cretaceous, reptile diversification continued throughout the Cenozoic.  |Squamates|Squamata|  took a massive hit during the KT-event, only recovering ten million years after it,  but they underwent a great radiation event once they recovered, and today squamates make up the majority of living reptiles ref name The Reptile Database  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref /ref ref  /ref ref nameGarnett /ref ref  /ref ref /ref ref name CGF1 /ref !--or because their metabolism is a result of their ecology :As this it is just a restatement of reptiles are cold blooded due to their ecology, essentially it was saying whether A was because of B or A was because of B, which is stupid!-- ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref  ref /ref ref nameLandberg /ref ref nameLandberg/ ref /ref ref /ref ref name Dermatological Diseases in Lizards /ref ref name Dermatological Diseases in Lizards / ref name Veterinary Nursing of Exotic Pets /ref ref name Dermatological Diseases in Lizards / ref name Veterinary Nursing of Exotic Pets / ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref !-- thu eating a lizard.-- ref /ref ref nameGarnett/ ref name SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates / ref nameherbivory /ref ref nameherbivory/ ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref name Romer, A 1977 / ref /ref ref  /ref ref name firefly /ref ref /ref ref /ref br / ref /ref ref namePFML12 /ref ref name S12 /  ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref nameCogger /ref  ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref /ref ref name pianka /ref ref /ref  ref nameTorrens  /ref ref nameGlut /ref  ref /ref ref nameGlut/ ref nameGregory /ref ref nameSearles /ref  ref name BF85 /ref  ref nameDeane /ref  ref  /ref ref /ref ref namePlotkin  /ref ref nameBall  /ref  ref nameStookey  /ref  ref name Sinha  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  .
