              A diesel multiple unit or DMU is a  |multiple_unit|Multiple_Unit|  train powered by on-board  |diesel_engines|Diesel_Engine| . A DMU requires no separate  |locomotive|Locomotive| , as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. Diesel-powered single-unit  |railcars|Railcar|  are also generally classed as DMUs. Diesel-powered units may be further classified by their transmission type: diesel–electric , diesel–mechanical or diesel–hydraulic .       The diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor. Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or in a separate car.       DMUs are usually classified by the method of transmitting motive power to their wheels.      |gearbox|Transmission|  and driveshaft directly to the wheels of the train, like a  |car|Automobile| . The transmissions can be shifted manually by the driver, as in the great majority of first-generation  |British_Rail|British_Rail|  DMUs, but in most applications, gears are changed automatically.       In a diesel–hydraulic multiple unit , a hydraulic  |torque_converter|Torque_Converter| , a type of fluid coupling, acts as the transmission medium for the motive power of the diesel engine to turn the wheels. Some units feature a hybrid mix of hydraulic and mechanical transmissions, usually reverting to the latter at higher operating speeds as this decreases engine RPM and noise.      |diesel_engine|Diesel_Engine|  drives an  |electrical_generator|Electrical_Generator|  or an  |alternator|Alternatordiesel_Electric_Locomotive_Alternators|  which produces  |electrical_energy|Electrical_Energy| . The generated current is then fed to electric  |traction_motors|Traction_Motor|  on the  |wheels|Wheel|  or  |bogies|Bogie|  in the same way as a conventional  |diesel–electric_locomotive|Diesel–Electric_Locomotive| .     In modern DEMUs, such as the  |Bombardier_Voyager_family|Bombardier_Voyager_Family| , each car is entirely self-contained and has its own engine, generator and electric motors.  In older designs, such as the  |British_Rail_Class_207|British_Rail_Class_207Technical_Details| , some cars within the  |consist|Consist|  may be entirely unpowered or only feature electric motors, obtaining electric current from other cars in the consist which have a generator and engine.          A train composed of DMU cars scales well, as it allows extra passenger capacity to be added at the same time as motive power. It also permits passenger capacity to be matched to demand, and for trains to be split and joined en route. It is not necessary to match the power available to the size and weight of the train, as each unit is capable of moving itself. As units are added, the power available to move the train increases by the necessary amount. DMUs may have better acceleration capabilities, with more power-driven axles, making them more suitable for routes with frequent closely spaced stops, as compared with conventional locomotive and unpowered carriage setups.     Distribution of the propulsion among the cars also results in a system that is less vulnerable to single-point-of-failure outages. Many classes of DMU are capable of operating with faulty units still in the consist. Because of the self-contained nature of diesel engines, there is no need to run  |overhead_electric_lines|Railway_Electrification|  or  |electrified_track|Third_Rail| , which can result in lower system construction costs.     Such advantages must be weighed against the underfloor noise and vibration that may be an issue with this type of train.     Generally diesel traction has several downsides compared to electric traction, namely higher fuel costs, more noise and exhaust as well as worse acceleration and top speed performance. The power to weight ratio also tends to be worse.     DMUs have further disadvantages compared to diesel locomotives in that they cannot be swapped out when passing onto an electrified line, necessitating either passengers to change trains or Diesel operation on electrified lines. Similarly the lost investment once electrification reduces the demand for diesel rolling stock is higher than with locomotive hauled trains where only the locomotive has to be replaced.               NMBS/SNCB uses its  |NMBS_SNCB_Class_41|Nmbs_Sncb_Class_41|  DMUs on the few remaining unelectrified lines. As electrification progresses, the DMUs become less and less important.          Diesel multiple units cover large number of passenger lines in  |Croatia|Croatia|  which are operated by the national operator  |Croatian_Railways|Croatian_Railways| . On Croatian Railways, DMUs have important role since they cover local, regional and distant lines all across the country. Countrys two largest towns,  |Zagreb|Zagreb|  and  |Split|Split_Croatia| , are daily connected with an Inter City service that is provided by DMU  |tilting|Tilting_Train|  trains  |RegioSwinger|Regioswinger|  since 2004. Those trains may also cover other lines in the country depending on need and availability.     Luxury DMU series  |7021|Hž_Series_7021|  covered some of the high ranked lines across former  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia|  and present day Croatia from 1970s until mid-1990s when they were transferred on regional line Zagreb- |Zabok|Zabok| |_Varaždin|Varaždin| - |Čakovec|Čakovec| -Zagreb where they covered fast services until their withdrawal in 2005. Units  |7121|Hž_Series_7121|  and  |7122|Y1|  , together with the newest series 7022 and 7023 built in 2010s Croatia, cover many of the countrys local and regional services, mainly on unelectrified lines.                 In the Republic of Ireland the  |Córas_Iompair_Éireann|Córas_Iompair_Éireann|  , which controlled the republics railways between 1945 and 1986, introduced DMUs in the mid-1950s and they were the first diesel trains on many main lines.            DMUs are used mostly on shorter and less frequently travelled routes in remote and often poorer areas like  |Banat|Banat|  and  |Bukovina|Bukovina| . The national railway company  |CFR|Căile_Ferate_Române|  uses  |Malaxa|Nicolae_Malaxa|  class 77 and 78 DMUs locally built between the 1920s and 50s and refurbished in the 70s. It also uses a smaller number of other newer DMUs. Main DMU in use is the Class 96  |Siemens_Desiro|Siemens_Desiro|  aka Săgeata Albastră .                     The first significant use of DMUs in the United Kingdom was by the  |Great_Western_Railway|Great_Western_Railway| , which introduced its small but successful series of diesel–mechanical  |GWR_railcars|Gwr_Railcars|  in 1934. The  |London_and_North_Eastern_Railway|London_And_North_Eastern_Railway|   and  |London_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway|London_Midland_And_Scottish_Railway|  also experimented with DMUs in the 1930s, the LMS both on  |its_own_system|Lms_Railcars| , and on that of its  |Northern_Irish_subsidiary|Northern_Counties_Committeerailcars| , but development was curtailed by  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .     After nationalisation,  |British_Rail|British_Rail| ways revived the concept in the early 1950s. At that time there was an urgent need to move away from expensive steam traction which led to many experimental designs using diesel propulsion and  |multiple_units|Multiple_Unit| . The early DMUs proved successful, and under BRs  |1955_Modernisation_Plan|History_Of_Rail_Transport_In_Great_Britain_1948–1994The_Modernisation_Plan|  the building of a large fleet was authorised. These BR First Generation DMUs were built between 1956 and 1963.     BR required that contracts for the design and manufacture of new locomotives and rolling stock be split between numerous private firms as well as BRs own workshops, while different BR Regions laid down different specifications. The result was a multitude of different types, one of which was:   Intercity units, which were more substantially constructed, and shared many features with contemporary hauled coaching stock. They were built for express services on important secondary routes on the  |Scottish|Scottish_Region_Of_British_Railways| ,  |North_Eastern|North_Eastern_Region_Of_British_Railways|  and  |Western|Western_Region_Of_British_Railways|  regions.     In 1960, British Railways introduced its  |Blue_Pullman|British_Rail_Classes_251_And_261|  high-speed DEMUs.    These were few in number and relatively short-lived, but they paved the way for the very successful  |InterCity_125|Intercity_125|  or High Speed Train units, which were built between 1975 and 1982 to take over most principal express services on non-electrified routes.     These  trains run with a streamlined power car at each end and 7 to 9 intermediate trailer cars. Although originally classified as DEMUs, the trailer cars are very similar to loco-hauled stock, and the power cars were later reclassified as locomotives under  |Class_43|British_Rail_Class_43| . They remain in widespread use.       By the early 1980s, many of the surviving First Generation units were reaching the end of their design life, leading to spiralling maintenance costs, poor reliability and a poor public image for the railway. A stopgap solution was to convert some services back to locomotive haulage, as spare locomotives and hauled coaching stock were available, but this also increased operating costs. Commencing in the mid 80s, British Rail embarked upon its so called Sprinterisation programme, to replace most of the first generation DMUs and many locomotive-hauled trains with three new families of DMU:    |Class_140–144|Pacer|  Pacer  |railbus|Railbus| es, ultra-low-cost diesel–mechanical units utilising 4-wheeled chassis and lightweight bus bodywork, designed for provincial branch line and stopping services.    |Sprinter|Sprinter|  a family of diesel–hydraulic DMUs. These fall into three sub-groups;  |Class_150|British_Rail_Class_150|  Sprinters ,  |Class_153|British_Rail_Class_153|  /  |155|British_Rail_Class_155|  /  |156|British_Rail_Class_156|  Super Sprinters , and  |Class_158|British_Rail_Class_158|  /  |159|British_Rail_Class_159|  Express units ;   Networker diesel–hydraulic units, of  |Class_165|British_Rail_Class_165|  Network Turbo and  |Class_166|British_Rail_Class_166|  Network Express . These took over the remaining non-electric commuter services into London.     Following the  |impact_of_the_privatisation_of_British_Rail|Impact_Of_The_Privatisation_Of_British_Rail|  in the late 1990s, several other diesel–hydraulic DMU families have been introduced:  |Class_168|British_Rail_Class_168|  Clubman and  |Class_170|British_Rail_Class_170| / |171|British_Rail_Class_171| / |172|British_Rail_Class_172|   Turbostar s, a development of the earlier Networkers. These are built by  |Adtranz|Adtranz|  and later  |Bombardier|Bombardier_Transportation|  at  |Derby_Litchurch_Lane_Works|Derby_Litchurch_Lane_Works|  and are the most numerous and widespread of the post-privatisation designs. Purchased by  |Anglia_Railways|Anglia_Railways| ,  |Central_Trains|Central_Trains| ,  |Chiltern_Railways|Chiltern_Railways| ,  |London_Midland|London_Midland| ,  |London_Overground_Rail_Operations|London_Overground_Rail_Operations| ,  |Midland_Mainline|Midland_Mainline|  and  |ScotRail|Scotrail| .    |Class_175|British_Rail_Class_175|   Alstom Coradia s were designed by  |Alstom|Alstom|  as a rival to the 170 Turbostar, but bought only by  |First_North_Western|First_North_Western| |_Class_180|British_Rail_Class_180|  Adelantes were an Alstom design for express services built only for  |First_Great_Western|First_Great_Western| |_Class_185|British_Rail_Class_185|   Siemens Desiro s, built by  |Siemes|Siemens_Mobility|  introduced in 2006 by  |First_TransPennine_Express|First_Transpennine_Express| |_Class_195|British_Rail_Class_195| / |196|British_Rail_Class_196|   CAF Civity s, being built by  |CAF|Construcciones_Y_Auxiliar_De_Ferrocarriles|  for  |Arriva_Rail_North|Arriva_Rail_North|  and  |West_Midlands_Trains|West_Midlands_Trains| |_Class_220|British_Rail_Class_220| / |221|British_Rail_Class_221| / |222|British_Rail_Class_222|   Voyagers/Meridians  built by Bombardier in  |Bruges|Bruges|  for  |Hull_Trains|Hull_Trains| , Midland Mainline and  |Virgin_CrossCountry|Virgin_Crosscountry|      In 2018 the first  |bi_and_tri_mode_electro_diesel_multiple_units|Electro_Diesel_Locomotive|  were introduced:    |Class_800|British_Rail_Class_800| / |802s|British_Rail_Class_802|  are being built by  |Hitachi|Hitachi|  for  |Great_Western_Railway|Great_Western_Railway| , Hull Trains,  |London_North_Eastern_Railway|London_North_Eastern_Railway|  and  |TransPennine_Express|Transpennine_Express|    Railway Gazette International  30 June 2016    |Class_755|British_Rail_Class_755|   Stadler Flirt s are to be operated by  |Abellio_Greater_Anglia|Abellio_Greater_Anglia|   Railway Gazette International 10 August 2016    |Class_769s|British_Rail_Class_769|  are being converted by  |Brush_Traction|Brush_Traction|  from  |Class_319s|British_Rail_Class_319|  for Arriva Rail North, Great Western Railway and  |KeolisAmey_Wales|Keolisamey_Wales|   Railway Gazette International 20 April 2018    |Class_230s|British_Rail_Class_230|  are being converted by  |Vivarail|Vivarail|  from  |London_Underground|London_Underground| |_D78_Stock|London_Underground_D78_Stock|   for  |West_Midland_Trains|West_Midlands_Trains|   and  |Transport_for_Wales|Transport_For_Wales_Rail_Services| |_|Transport_For_Wales_Rail_Services|                 Canada generally follows similar buffer strength requirements to the US, Such as the  |Railroad_Safety_Appliance_Act|Railroad_Safety_Appliance_Act|  of 1893. but new services are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As a result, several types of lightweight DMUs have been used:     The  |O_Train|O_Train| |_Trillium_Line|Trillium_Line|  in  |Ottawa_Ontario|Ottawa_Ontario|  uses European-standard  |Alstom_Coradia_LINT|Alstom_Coradia_Lint|   DMUs on conventional railway tracks under a specific safety agreement with  |Transport_Canada|Transport_Canada| .  |Via_Rail|Via_Rail|  operates  |Budd_Rail_Diesel_Cars|Budd_Rail_Diesel_Car|  on its  |Sudbury_–_White_River_train|Sudbury_–_White_River_Train| .    |Réseau_Charlevoix|Charlevoix_Tourist_Train|   operates a shuttle in the  |Charlevoix|Charlevoix|  region, Québec.    |Canadian_National|Canadian_National|  operates the small custom-built  |Kaoham_Shuttle|Kaoham_Shuttle|  between  |Lillooet|Lillooet_British_Columbia| , and  |DArcy|Darcy_British_Columbia|  via  |Seton_Portage|Seton_Portage_British_Columbia| ,  northeast of  |Vancouver|Vancouver| , in a partnership with the  |Seton_Lake_Indian_Band|Seton_Lake_Indian_Band| .      |Union_Pearson_Express|Union_Pearson_Express|  uses  |Nippon_Sharyo_DMU|Nippon_Sharyo_Dmu|  trains for express service between  |Union_Station|Union_Station|  and  |Pearson_Airport|Toronto_Pearson_International_Airport| .          Costa Rica has purchased several Apolo 2400 series DMU railcars from the former narrow gauge operator in Spain, which are run in commuter service.             A type of diesel multiple units in the U.S. was the  |Budd_Rail_Diesel_Car|Budd_Rail_Diesel_Car|  . The RDC was a single passenger car with two diesel engines and two sets of controls.     In the United States only FRA-compliant DMU systems are permitted on freight rail corridors. This is due to the  |Federal_Railway_Administration|Federal_Railway_Administration|  setting higher  |coupling_strength|Coupler|  requirements than European regulators, effectively prohibiting the use of lighter weight European-style  |inter_city_rail|Inter_City_Rail|  DMUs on U.S. main line railways without  |timesharing|Timesharing|  with freight operations or special waivers from the FRA. This has greatly restricted the development of DMUs within the U.S. as no other country requires the much heavier FRA compliant vehicles, and no export market for them exists.     Operations using FRA-compliant vehicles:   The  |South_Florida_Regional_Transportation_Authority|South_Florida_Regional_Transportation_Authority|  has used a  |Colorado_Railcar|Colorado_Railcar| |_bi_Level|Bilevel_Rail_Car|  DMU and Coach consist since October 2006 as a technology demonstrator on the 87-mile long  |Tri_Rail|Tri_Rail|  commuter rail line between  |Miami|Miami|  and  |West_Palm_Beach|West_Palm_Beach| ,  |Florida|Florida| . In early 2007, three more bi-level DMUs and an additional bi-level non-powered coach were acquired.  |TriMet|Trimet|  is using FRA-compliant  |Colorado_Railcar|Colorado_Railcar|  DMUs for its rush-hour  |WES_Commuter_Rail|Wes_Commuter_Rail|  service, a suburb-to-suburb line between  |Beaverton|Beaverton_Oregon|  and  |Wilsonville_Oregon|Wilsonville_Oregon| . The opening of the line was delayed from fall 2008 to early 2009 due to delays in getting the vehicles. TriMet also has 4 refurbished former  |Alaska_RR|Alaska_Railroad|  and  |Trinity_Railway_Express|Trinity_Railway_Express|  RDCs as backup trainsets for when one or more Colorado Railcar DMUs is out of service.  |Oregon|Oregon| , former  |BC_Rail|Bc_Rail|  RDCs were used on the Lewis and Clark Explorer excursion train from  |Portland|Portland_Oregon|  to  |Astoria|Astoria_Oregon| .     |Sonoma–Marin_Area_Rail_Transit|Sonoma–Marin_Area_Rail_Transit| , also referred to as SMART, operates  |Nippon_Sharyo_DMUs|Nippon_Sharyo_Dmu|  on its route between San Rafael and Santa Rosa, California. Service commenced in 2017.     Operations using non FRA-compliant vehicles:    |Capital_Metro|Capital_Metro|  uses  |Stadler_GTW|Stadler_Gtw|  cars to operate  |Capital_MetroRail|Capital_Metrorail| , a commuter rail line serving the  |Greater_Austin|Greater_Austin| ,  |Texas|Texas|  area.   In  |Denton_County|Denton_County| ,  |Texas|Texas| ,  |DCTA|Dcta|  also uses  |Stadler_GTW|Stadler_Gtw|  cars to operate its  |A_train|A_Train|  service. DCTA has secured from the FRA the first-ever alternative vehicle technology waiver to use these cars on active freight corridors.     |TEXRail|Texrail|  in  |Tarrant_County_Texas|Tarrant_County_Texas|  is a commuter rail line operated by  |Trinity_Metro|Trinity_Metro|  which uses  |Stadler|Stadler_Rail| |_FLIRT|Stadler_Flirt|  DMUs. The vehicles are FRA Alternate Compliant.  The line has 9 stops with termini at  |DFW_Airport|Dfw_Airport_Terminal_B_Station|  and  |T_P_Station|T_P_Station| .     |NJ_Transit|Nj_Transit|  operates the  |River_Line|River_Line|  from  |Camden_NJ|Camden_Nj|  to  |Trenton_NJ|Trenton_Nj| , every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes at other times. It uses modified  |Stadler_GTW|Stadler_Gtw|  trains of one or two cars. The line is classified as  |light_rail|Light_Rail|  because it utilizes imported European made DMUs that do not meet  |FRA|Federal_Railway_Administration|  crash guidelines. The cars may not operate with the  |freight_rail|Freight_Rail|  service that shares the line, so evening operating hours are restricted to Saturday nights. This line currently carries over 7,500 passengers on a typical weekday, exceeding expectations.    |NCTD|North_County_Transit_District|  operates the  |Sprinter|Sprinter|  line using  |Desiro_Classic|Siemens_Desiro|  DMUs built by  |Siemens_AG|Siemens_Ag| . Opened March, 2008, The line operates every half-hour daily, except limitations in the morning and at night on Saturday, Sunday and on holidays. The line runs from  |Oceanside_CA|Oceanside_Ca| , where transfer is possible with  |Coaster|Coaster| |_commuter_rail|Commuter_Rail|  service to  |San_Diego|San_Diego| , to  |Escondido_CA|Escondido_Ca| . Like the NJT River Line, it is classified as light rail due to the use of European made DMUs, but does not run at a more typical light rail frequency.   The  |eBART|Ebart|  expansion of the  |Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit_System|Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit_System|  implements  |Stadler_GTW|Stadler_Gtw|  diesel multiple unit train service from Pittsburg/Bay Point station east along the Highway 4 corridor to the town of Antioch. Future expansions in this direction could also connect the eBART service to Oakley, Brentwood, Byron, and beyond to Tracy and Stockton. The DMU system was chosen as a less-expensive alternative to the existing third-rail BART design.  Service began on May 25, 2018.      Proposed operations:   The  |Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority|Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority|  approved an allocation of $250,000 for a feasibility study of DMUs for future transportation options for the region on 5 July 2006 .     |Chicagos|Chicago|  commuter rail line,  |Metra|Metra| , is studying the use of DMUs on its newly proposed lines . They claim these DMUs will have better acceleration, be more fuel efficient, and seat more customers than the current diesel locomotive and double decker rail cars that are currently in use.    Seattle area – The Central Puget Sounds regional transit agency  |Sound_Transit|Sound_Transit| , along with the  |Puget_Sound_Regional_Council|Puget_Sound_Regional_Council|  evaluated the feasibility of both DMU and diesel locomotive technology for operation in the Eastside BNSF Corridor in response to a state legislative request. The Eastside BNSF corridor runs from the City of Snohomish in the north to Renton in the south of the metro area. Sound Transit has no plans to operate passenger rail service in the eastside BNSF corridor, but has committed limited funds to provide capital improvements in the event another public or private operator proposes to operate the service.    Anchorage Mat-Su area – As part of a joint U.S. Forest Service and ARRC Chugach Forest Whistle Stop project, a self-propelled rail car was purchased and delivered spring 2009. The diesel multiple unit may be available for flexible demonstration service during winter months.    The  |Long_Island_Rail_Road|Long_Island_Rail_Road| , the busiest commuter railroad in the United States, is exploring the possibility of operating DMUs on some of its lesser traveled routes in non-electrified territory , where operation of its current fleet of  |C3|C3|  bilevel railcars pulled by  |DE30AC|De30Ac| / |DM30AC|Dm30Ac|  locomotives is uneconomical and inefficient.    |Arrow|Arrow|  will utilize  |Stadler_FLIRT|Stadler_Flirt|  trainsets along its service route in  |Redlands_California|Redlands_California| .   A proposal to use DMUs on Bostons  |Fairmount_Line|Fairmount_Line|  was initially approved, but was canceled in 2016.                 DMUs were first introduced to Australia in the late mid-20th century for use on quiet branch lines that could not justify a locomotive hauled service. Today, DMUs are widely used throughout Australias southern states:      |Adelaide_Metro|Adelaide_Metro|  uses a variety of DMUs on their suburban network.    |NSW_TrainLink|Nsw_Trainlink|  use  |Xplorer_DMUs|New_South_Wales_Xplorer|  on services from  |Sydney|Central_Railway_Station_Sydney|  to  |Canberra|Canberra_Railway_Station|  ,  |Griffith|Griffith_Railway_Station| ,  |Broken_Hill|Broken_Hill_Railway_Station| ,  |Armidale|Armidale_Railway_Station|  and  |Moree|Moree_Railway_Station| .  |Endeavour_DMUs|New_South_Wales_Endeavour_Railcar|  are used on services to  |Bathurst|Bathurst_Railway_Station_New_South_Wales| ,  |Moss_Vale|Moss_Vale_Railway_Station|  and  |Goulburn|Goulburn_Railway_Station|  on the  |Southern_Highlands_line|Southern_Highlands_Line| ,  |Kiama|Kiama_Railway_Station|  to  |Bomaderry|Bomaderry_Railway_Station|  and on the  |Hunter_line|Hunter_Railway_Line| .  |Hunter_DMUs|New_South_Wales_Hunter_Railcar|  are also used on the  |Hunter_line|Hunter_Railway_Line| .   Victorias  |V_Line|V_Line|  uses  |Sprinter|V_Line_Sprinter|  and  |V_Locity|V_Line_Vlocity|  DMUs on all medium distance services.   Western Australias  |Transwa|Transwa|  operates the  |Prospector|Transwa_Prospector| ,  |AvonLink|Avonlink|  and  |Australind|Transwa_Australind|  on medium and long distance country services.     In Queensland, heritage DMUs are used on the  |Savannahlander|Savannahlander|  and  |Gulflander|Gulflander|  tourist trains.       Chinese manufactured DEMU was introduced in Bangladesh from May 25, 2013. DEMU is the countrys first-ever commuter train service starting its journey on the Chittagong–Fouzdarhat line. These DEMUs also operate on the  |Chittagong_Circular_Railway|Chittagong_Circular_Railway|  and on the  |Bangladesh_Railways|Bangladesh_Railway|  service between  |Dhaka|Dhaka|  and  |Narayanganj|Narayanganj| .          DMUs are widely used in India. DEMUs in India are used in both the 8 coach format and the 4 coach format. These trains replaced many trains with a WDM-2 or WDM-3A locomotive in the middle. These old trains had the loco controls duplicated in the Driving Trailer coach and all the actuation information reaching the locomotive through thin communication lines. This was called push-pull train. The longest running such push-pull service operated between Diva - Bhiwandi Road and Vasai Road and was recently converted into an MEMU train service in 2018.             First generation DMU:   Rated power was 700 HP and had 3 or 6 coaches, made first by ICF.   Transmission was Voith-hydraulic.   Max speed 100 kmph.        Second generation DMU:   Rated power was 1400 HP and have 8 coaches.   Max speed is 105 kmph.   Transmission is DC electric.   Made at HCF and RCF.        Third generation DMU:   Rated power is 1600 HP and have 10 coaches.   Max speed is 110 kmph.   Transmission is AC electric.   Made at ICF.                State-owned company  |PT_INKA|Industri_Kereta_Api|  builds several type of DMU, some of which operate in urban and suburban areas:    |Kualanamu_Airport_Rail_Link|Kualanamu_Airport_Rail_Link|  - -Woojin DMU    |Minangkabau_Airport_Rail_Link|Minangkabau_Airport_Rail_Link| |_Adisumarmo_Airport_Rail_Link|Adisumarmo_Airport_Rail_Link|     In Japan, where gasoline-driven railbuses and railmotors  had been built since the 1920s, the first two streamlined DMUs came in service in 1937, class  |Kiha_43000|Kiha_43000|  .      The service of several hundreds of diesel railcars and DMUs started in 1950s following the improvement of fuel supply that was critical during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .                  The Southrail or the South Main Line of the  |Philippine_National_Railways|Philippine_National_Railways|  which travels South of the Luzon island is one of the oldest rail lines in Asia and in the world.
