     Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg  was  |Elector|Prince-Elector|  and  |Archbishop_of_Mainz|Archbishop_Of_Mainz|  from 1514 to 1545, and  |Archbishop_of_Magdeburg|Archbishop_Of_Magdeburg|  from 1513 to 1545.     His involvement in the sale of indulgences to fund his debt was to prompt Martin Luther, a friar, to complain about the abuse. His subsequent failure to meet with and take seriously the complaints from Luther, his failure to inform Rome of the seriousness of the situation and finally Romes refusal to act properly faced with the situation, forced Luther to more serious action. These failures to respond adequately make him notable for his failure to prevent the  |Reformation|Reformation| .

In 1514 he obtained the Electorate of Mainz , and in 1518, at the age of 28, was made a cardinal . To pay for the pallium of the see of Mainz and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 ducat s from Jakob Fugger , Fugger article says 48,000 ducats and had obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of indulgences in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as he forwarded half of the income to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinals retinue in charge of the cashbox. He procured the services of John Tetzel to sell the indulgences.     Largely in reaction to the commerce in indulgences, Martin Luther wrote his famous 95 Theses , which led to the Reformation . Luther sent these to Albert on 31 October 1517, and according to a false tradition nailed a copy to the door of Castle Church in Wittenberg . Albert forwarded the theses to Rome, suspecting Luther of heresy. When the imperial election of 1519 drew near, partisans of the two leading candidates eagerly solicited the vote of the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz, and Albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote. The electors eventually chose Charles, who became the Emperor Charles V.     thu     Alberts large and liberal ideas, his friendship with Ulrich von Hutten , and his political ambitions, appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to Protestantism ; but after the German Peasants War of 1525 he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of Catholicism , and was among the princes who joined the League of Dessau in July 1525.     Cardinal Albert needed a prestigious church building that met his expectations at a central location in his  |Residenz|Residenz|  town. Albert feared for his peace of mind in heaven, and collected more than 8,100 relics and 42 holy skeletons which needed to be stored. These precious treasures, known as Hallesches Heilthum , indirectly related to the sale of indulgences which had triggered the Reformation a few years before. Then the cardinal and the Catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of the Reformation by holding far grander masses and services in a new church dedicated solely to Saint Mary.     thu and Saint Maurice , by Matthias Grünewald , between 1517 and 1523. Grünewald used Albert of Mainz, who commissioned the painting, as the model for St. Erasmus .   Alberts hostility towards the reformers, however, was not so extreme as that of his brother Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg ; and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace, although he was a member of the League of Nuremberg, formed in 1538 as a counterpoise to the League of Schmalkalden . New doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 florin s. During his later years showed more intolerance towards the Protestants, and favoured the teaching of the Jesuits in his dominions.       The Market Church of Our Lady in Halle , which had been built to defend against the spread of Reformation sympathies, was the very spot where Justus Jonas officially introduced the Reformation into Halle with his Good Friday sermon in 1541. The service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air, because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave. Jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed. Cardinal Albert left the town permanently after the estates  in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of Jacob Fugger . Halle became Protestant and in 1542 Jonas was appointed as priest to St. Marys and in 1544 bishop over the city.     Albert adorned the collegiate church  at Halle and the cathedral at Mainz in sumptuous fashion, and took as his motto the words Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae . A generous patron of art and learning, he counted  |Erasmus|Erasmus|  among his friends.       Albert died at the  |Martinsburg,_Mainz|Martinsburg,_Mainz|  in 1545.   BRANDENBURG, Albrecht von       .
