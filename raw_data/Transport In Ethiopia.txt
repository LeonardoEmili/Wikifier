Transport in Ethiopia is overseen by the  |Ministry_of_Transport_and_Communications|Ministry_Of_Transport_And_Communications| . Over the last years, the  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| n federal authorities have significantly increased funding for rail and road construction to build an infrastructure, that allows better  |economic_development|Economic_Development| .             Ethiopia is building a  |standard_gauge|Standard_Gauge|  railway network, the  |National_Railway_Network_of_Ethiopia|National_Railway_Network_Of_Ethiopia| , planned to consist of up to 5,000 km of railways in a number of years. The railway network serves a strategic goal to allow Ethiopia a sustainable and stable  |economic_development|Economic_Development| . The railway networks primary purpose is then both to connect  |landlocked|Landlocked_Country| |_Ethiopia|Ethiopia|  to the  |world_market|World_Economy|  by ensuring a seamless access to one or several  |sea_ports|Sea_Port|  for  |trade|Trade|  and for transporting most  |imports|Imports|  and  |exports|Exports| . The  |rail_transport|Rail_Transport|  of  |goods|Goods|  appears favorable – if compared to  |road_transport|Road_Transport|  – in terms of volume, costs, safety and speed of transportation for both imports and exports. The primary port for Ethiopia is the  |Port_of_Djibouti|Port_Of_Djibouti|  in  |Djibouti|Djibouti| . More than 95% of Ethiopias  |trade|Trade|  passes through Djibouti.       The port of Djibouti is served by one international railway, the  |electrified|Railway_Electrification_System|  standard gauge 756  km long  |Addis_Ababa_–_Djibouti_Railway|Addis_Ababa–Djibouti_Railway|  . This railway has officially been opened in October 2016 but it is in trial service with no regular traffic in 2017. Once operational by the end of 2017 or in 2018, it will allow passenger transport and a travel time from Addis Ababa to  |Djibouti_City|Djibouti_City|  in less than twelve hours with a designated speed of 120  km/hour.      Another railway, the  |Awash_–_Hara_Gebeya_Railway|Awash–Hara_Gebeya_Railway|  will go into trial service over its first 270  km in 2018. This second railway links Addis Ababa and the Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway with the north of Ethiopia. Once operational over its first 270  km, possibly 2018 or 2019, it will allow both freight and passenger transport. A train ride from Addis Ababa to the twin cities of  |Kombolcha|Kombolcha|  and  |Dessie|Dessie|  will be possible in around six hours with a designated speed of 120  km/hour.                    Road projects now represent around a quarter of the annual infrastructure budget of the Ethiopian federal government. Additionally, through the Road Sector Development Program , the government has earmarked $4 billion to construct, repair and upgrade roads over the next decade.      As the first part of a 10-year Road Sector Development Program, between 1997 and 2002 the Ethiopian government began a sustained effort to improve its infrastructure of roads. As a result, as of 2002 Ethiopia has a total 33,297  km of roads, both paved and gravel. The share of federally managed roads in good quality improved from 14% in 1995 to 31% in 2002 as a result of this program, and to 89% in 2009 the road density increased from 21  km per 1000  km 2 to 889  km; per 1000  km 2 however, this is much greater than the average of 50  km per 1000  km 2 for Africa.  , p.3      The Ethiopian government had begun the second part of the Road Sector Development Program, which was completed in 2007. This had involved the upgrading or construction of over 7,500  km of roads, with the goal of improving the average road density for Ethiopia to 35  km per 1000  km 2 , and reduce the proportion of the country area that is more than 5  km from an all-weather road from 75% to 70%. World Bank, Second Road Sector , p.11     According to the  |Government_of_Ethiopia|Government_Of_Ethiopia| , it has spent over 600 billion  |birr|Ethiopian_Birr|  on infrastructure since 1990.   total : 101,359  km   asphalt: 90,336  km    gravel: 11,023  km   maintained by Regional governmentNo 1 |Adama|Adama|  and  |Awash|Awash_Ethiopia|  to  |Bure|Bure_Africa|  on  |Eritrea|Eritrea| n border    No 2  |Dessie|Dessie| ,  |Mekele|Mekele|  and  |Adigrat|Adigrat|  to  |Axum|Axum|    No 3 |Blue_Nile|Blue_Nile|  at  |Dejen|Dejen|  and again at  |Bahir_Dar|Bahir_Dar|  east around  |Lake_Tana|Lake_Tana|  737  km to  |Gondar|Gondar| .

In December 2015, construction began on a second expressway between  |Awasa|Awasa|  and  |Mojo|Mojo_Ethiopia| , where it will connect to the existing expressway.      In addition, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has undertaken a three year project to upgrade over 370  km of roads in the country. Contracts have been signed with the Ethiopian Defense Construction, China Railway Engineering, Eney Construction, China Wuyi, Yotek Construction and FAL General Contractor.           It is said that Ethiopia has the highest rates of traffic fatalities per vehicle in the world. This is due to many factors. For example, the roads are poorly maintained, lightened and marked; which are major factors in road accidents. Another major factor is the people themselves, who ignore the rules of the road. Their disregard of road safety puts every other driver at risk. Due to this, foreigners are advised to keep a safe distance from the car in front of them because the driving is unpredictable; anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Even the surroundings involving transport can be incredibly dangerous. For example, there are instances when carjackings and robberies occur on highways or streets that are away from the public eye. Due to this, people are forced to be highly alert of their surroundings, such as checking to make sure no one is lurking around their vehicle before entering and avoiding nighttime travel.           Ethiopia is  |landlocked|List_Of_Landlocked_Countries|  and was by agreement with  |Eritrea|Eritrea|  using the ports of  |Asseb|Asseb|  and  |Massawa|Massawa|  until 1997; since the  |Eritrean_Ethiopian_War|Eritrean_Ethiopian_War| , Ethiopia has used the port of  |Djibouti|Djibouti|  for nearly all of its imports. Ethiopia increasingly relies on inland  |dry_ports|Dry_Port|  for distributing cargo, after cargo arrived from Djibouti. The main Ethiopian dry port is  |Modjo_dry_port|Modjo_Dry_Port| .       Only one river, the  |Baro|Baro_River|  is used for transport.

The  |Addis_Ababa_Airport|Addis_Ababa_Airport|  handles international jet transportation. It is the main hub of Ethiopian Airlines, the national airline that serves destinations in Ethiopia and throughout the African continent, as well as nonstop service to Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The airport is also the base of the Ethiopian Aviation Academy. As of June 2018, nearly 450 flights per day were departing from and arriving at the airport. In 2018, about 12 million passengers were carried on domestic and international flights.     ;Paved runways   total:   14   over 3,047 m:   3   2,438 to 3,047 m:   5   1,524 to 2,437 m:   5   914 to 1,523 m:   1     ;Unpaved runways   total:   68   over 3,047 m:   3   2,438 to 3,047 m:   2   1,524 to 2,437 m:   13   914 to 1,523 m:   27   under 914 m: .
