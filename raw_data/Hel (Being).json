The term is etymologically related to Modern English hall and therefore also  Valhalla , an afterlife hall of the slain in Norse Mythology. Hall and its numerous Germanic cognates derive from Proto-Germanic hallō covered place, hall, from Proto-Indo-European kol-. This is highlighted in Watkins .     Related early Germanic terms and concepts include Proto-Germanic xalja-rūnō, a feminine compound noun, and xalja-wītjan, a neutral compound noun. This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun haliurunnae , Old English helle-rúne , and Old High German helli-rūna magic. The compound is composed of two elements: xaljō  and rūnō, the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English  rune . See discussion at Orel . The second element in the Gothic haliurunnae may however instead be an agent noun from the verb rinnan , which would make its literal meaning one who travels to the netherworld .
