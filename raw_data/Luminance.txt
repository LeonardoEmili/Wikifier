      Luminance is a  |photometric|Photometry|  measure of the  |luminous_intensity|Luminous_Intensity|  per  |unit_area|Units_Of_Measurement|  of  |light|Light|  travelling in  |a_given|Wikt_Givennoun|  direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted from, or is reflected from a particular area, and falls within a given  |solid_angle|Solid_Angle| .      |Brightness|Brightness|  is the  |term|Terminology|  for the subjective impression of the objective luminance measurement standard .     The  |SI_unit|Si_Base_Unit|  for luminance is  |candela_per_square_metre|Candela_Per_Square_Metre|  , as defined by the International System of Units  standard for the  |modern_metric_system|Modern_Metric_System| . A non-SI term for the same unit is the  |nit|Nit| . The unit in the  |Centimetre–gram–second_system_of_units_|Centimetre–Gram–Second_System_Of_Units|  is the  |stilb|Stilb| , which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10  kcd/m 2 .       Luminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat,  |diffuse|Diffuse_Reflection|  surfaces. Luminance levels indicate how much  |luminous_power|Luminous_Flux|  could be detected by the  |human_eye|Human_Eye|  looking at a particular surface from a particular  |angle_of_view|Angle_Of_View| . Luminance is thus an indicator of how  |bright|Brightness|  the surface will appear. In this case, the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the eyes  |pupil|Pupil| .     Luminance is used in the video industry to characterize the brightness of displays. A typical computer display emits between 50 and . The sun has a luminance of about  at noon.      Luminance is  |invariant|Invariant|  in  |geometric_optics|Geometric_Optics| .  This means that for an ideal optical system, the luminance at the output is the same as the input luminance.     For real, passive optical systems, the output luminance is at most equal to the input. As an example, if one uses a lens to form an image that is smaller than the source object, the luminous power is concentrated into a smaller area, meaning that the  |illuminance|Illuminance|  is higher at the image. The light at the image plane, however, fills a larger solid angle so the luminance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens. The image can never be brighter than the source.          Retinal damage can occur when the eye is exposed to high luminance. Damage can occur because of local heating of the retina. Photochemical effects can also cause damage, especially at short wavelengths.       A luminance meter is a device used in  |photometry|Photometry|  that can measure the luminance in a particular direction and with a particular  |solid_angle|Solid_Angle| . The simplest devices measure the luminance in a single direction while imaging luminance meters measure luminance in a way similar to the way a  |digital_camera|Digital_Camera|  records color images.           The luminance of a specified point of a light source, in a specified direction, is defined by the  |derivative|Derivative|      :   L            where    v is the luminance ,   d 2  v is the  |luminous_flux|Luminous_Flux|   leaving the area d in any direction contained inside the solid angle d Σ ,   d is an  |infinitesimal|Infinitesimal|  area  of the source containing the specified point,   d Σ is an infinitesimal  |solid_angle|Solid_Angle|   containing the specified direction,    Σ is the  |angle|Angle|  between the  |normal|Normal|  n Σ to the surface d and the specified direction.      If light travels through a  |lossless|Lossless|  medium, the luminance does not change along a given  |light_ray|Light_Ray| . As the ray crosses an arbitrary surface S, the luminance is given by     :   L            where   d is the infinitesimal area of S seen from the source inside the solid angle d Σ ,   d S is the infinitesimal solid angle  |subtended|Subtended_Angle|  by d as seen from d,    S is the angle between the normal n S to d and the direction of the light.     More generally, the luminance along a light ray can be defined as     :   L  n2        where   d is the  |etendue|Etendue|  of an infinitesimally narrow beam containing the specified ray,   d v is the luminous flux carried by this beam,    is the  |index_of_refraction|Index_Of_Refraction|  of the medium.       The luminance of a reflecting surface is related to the  |illuminance|Illuminance|  it receives:     :         L          & M      & E  R           where the integral covers all the directions of emission , and    v is the surfaces  |luminous_exitance|Luminous_Exitance|   v is the received illuminance, and    is the  |reflectance|Reflectance| .     In the case of a perfectly  |diffuse_reflector|Diffuse_Reflector|  , the luminance is isotropic, per  |Lamberts_cosine_law|Lamberts_Cosine_Law| . Then the relationship is simply     :   L  E  R /           A variety of units have been used for luminance, besides the candela per square metre.     One candela per square metre is equal to:   10 −4  |stilbs|Stilb|     & pi;  |apostilbs|Apostilb|    & pi;×10 −4  |lamberts|Lambert|    0.292  |foot_lambert|Foot_Lambert| .
