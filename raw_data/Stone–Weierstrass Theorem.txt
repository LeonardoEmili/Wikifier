In  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| , the Weierstrass approximation theorem states that every  |continuous_function|Continuous_Function|  defined on a closed  |interval|Interval|   can be  |uniformly_approximated|Uniform_Convergence|  as closely as desired by a  |polynomial|Polynomial|  function. Because polynomials are among the simplest functions, and because computers can directly evaluate polynomials, this theorem has both practical and theoretical relevance, especially in  |polynomial_interpolation|Polynomial_Interpolation| . The original version of this result was established by  |Karl_Weierstrass|Karl_Weierstrass|  in  |1885|Historical_Works|  using the  |Weierstrass_transform|Weierstrass_Transform| .      |Marshall_H._Stone|Marshall_H._Stone|  considerably generalized the theorem  and simplified the proof . His result is known as the Stone–Weierstrass theorem. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem generalizes the Weierstrass approximation theorem in two directions both regressive and progressive: instead of the real interval , an arbitrary  |compact|Compact_Space| |Hausdorff_space|Hausdorff_Space|   is considered, and instead of the  |algebra|Algebra_Over_A_Field|  of polynomial functions, approximation with elements from more general subalgebras of  is investigated. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem is a vital result in the study of the algebra of  |continuous_functions_on_a_compact_Hausdorff_space|Continuous_Functions_On_A_Compact_Hausdorff_Space| .     Further, there is a generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem to noncompact  |Tychonoff_spaces|Tychonoff_Space| , namely, any continuous function on a Tychonoff space is approximated  |uniformly_on_compact_sets|Compact-Open_Topology|  by algebras of the type appearing in the Stone–Weierstrass theorem and described below.     A different generalization of Weierstrass original theorem is  |Mergelyans_theorem|Mergelyans_Theorem| , which generalizes it to functions defined on certain subsets of the  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane| .       The statement of the approximation theorem as originally discovered by Weierstrass is as follows:     :Weierstrass Approximation Theorem. Suppose  is a continuous real-valued function defined on the real interval . For every , or equivalently, the  |supremum_norm|Supremum_Norm|  , there exists a compact set  such that , then there exists a polynomial function  in two variables such that   there exist .      The theorem has many other applications to analysis, including:      |Fourier_series|Fourier_Series|  is dense in , where we identify the endpoints of the interval  to obtain a circle. An important consequence of this is that the  are an  |orthonormal_basis|Orthonormal_Basis|  of the space  of  |square-integrable_functions|Square-Integrable_Function|  on .       Slightly more general is the following theorem, where we consider the algebra C of complex-valued continuous functions on the compact space X , again with the topology of uniform convergence. This is a  |C-algebra|C-Algebra|  with the -operation given by pointwise  |complex_conjugation|Complex_Conjugation| .     :Stone–Weierstrass Theorem . Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and let S be a  |separating_subset|Separating_Set|  of C . Then the complex  |unital|Unital_Algebra| |-algebra|-Algebra|  generated by S is dense in C .     The complex unital -algebra generated by S consists of all those functions that can be obtained from the elements of S by throwing in the constant function  and adding them, multiplying them, conjugating them, or multiplying them with complex scalars, and repeating finitely many times.     This theorem implies the real version, because if a sequence of complex-valued functions uniformly approximate a given function f , then the real parts of those functions uniformly approximate the real part of f . As in the real case, an analog of this theorem is true for locally compact Hausdorff spaces.       Following  : consider the algebra  of quaternion-valued continuous functions on the compact space , again with the topology of uniform convergence. If a quaternion q is written in the form q    a  +  ib;+  jc  +  kd then the scalar part a is the real number /4. Likewise being the scalar part of −qi, −qj and −qk : b,c and d are respectively the real numbers /4,   /4 and /4. Then we may state :     :Stone–Weierstrass Theorem . Suppose  is a compact Hausdorff space and  is a subalgebra of  which contains a non-zero constant function. Then  is dense in  if and only if it  |separates_points|Separating_Set| .       The space of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X i.e. C is the canonical example of a unital  |commutative_C-algebra|C-Algebracommutative_C.2A-Algebras|    . The space X may be viewed as the space of pure states on   , with the weak- topology. Following the above cue, a non-commutative extension of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which has remain unsolved, is as follows:     :Conjecture. If a unital  |C-algebra|C-Algebra|    has a C-subalgebra   which separates the pure states of   , then     .     In 1960, Jim Glimm proved a weaker version of the above conjecture.     :Stone–Weierstrass theorem .  If a unital C-algebra   has a C-subalgebra   which separates the pure state space of   , then     .       Let  be a compact Hausdorff space. Stones original proof of the theorem used the idea of  |lattices|Lattice|  in . A subset  of  is called a  |lattice|Lattice|  if for any two elements , the functions also belong to . The lattice version of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem states:     :Stone–Weierstrass Theorem . Suppose  is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and  is a lattice in  with the property that for any two distinct elements  and  of  and any two real numbers  and  there exists an element  with  and . Then  is dense in .     The above versions of Stone–Weierstrass can be proven from this version once one realizes that the lattice property can also be formulated using the  |absolute_value|Absolute_Value|   which in turn can be approximated by polynomials in . A variant of the theorem applies to linear subspaces of  closed under max Stone–Weierstrass Theorem. Suppose  is a compact Hausdorff space and  is a family of functions in  such that   :  separates points.   :  contains the constant function 1.   : If  then  for all constants .   : If , then .   :Then  is dense in .     More precise information is available:     :Suppose  is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and  is a lattice in . The function  belongs to the  |closure|Closure|  of  if and only if for each pair of distinct points x and y in  and for each  and  .
