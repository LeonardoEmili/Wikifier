      Computer music is the application of  |computing_technology|Computing_Technology|  in  |music_composition|Musical_Composition| , to help human  |composers|Composer|  create new music or to have computers independently create music, such as with  |algorithmic_composition|Algorithmic_Composition|  programs. It includes the theory and application of new and existing computer  |software|Software|  technologies and basic aspects of music, such as  |sound_synthesis|Sound_Synthesis| ,  |digital_signal_processing|Digital_Signal_Processing| ,  |sound_design|Sound_Design| , sonic diffusion,  |acoustics|Acoustics| , and  |psychoacoustics|Psychoacoustics| . The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origins of  |electronic_music|Electronic_Music| , and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century.     In the 2000s, with the widespread availability of relatively affordable  |home_computers|Personal_Computing|  that have a fast processing speed, and the growth of  |home_recording|Home_Recording|  using  |digital_audio_recording|Digital_Audio_Recording|  systems ranging from  |GarageBand|Garageband|  to  |Pro_Tools|Pro_Tools| , the term is sometimes used to describe music that has been created using digital technology.             Much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between  |music_and_mathematics|Music_And_Mathematics| , a relationship which has been noted since the  |Ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greece|  described the  |harmony_of_the_spheres|Harmony_Of_The_Spheres|  .     Musical melodies were first generated by the computer originally named the CSIR Mark 1  in Australia in 1950. There were newspaper reports from America and England that computers may have played music earlier, but thorough research has debunked these stories as there is no evidence to support the newspaper reports . Research has shown that people speculated about computers playing music, possibly because computers would make noises,  but there is no evidence that they actually did it.       The worlds first computer to play music was the CSIR Mark 1 , which was designed and built by  |Trevor_Pearcey|Trevor_Pearcey|  and Maston Beard from the late 1940s. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIR Mark 1 to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1950 the CSIR Mark 1 was used to play music, the first known use of a digital computer for the purpose. The music was never recorded, but it has been accurately reconstructed.     In 1951 it publicly played the  |Colonel_Bogey_March|Colonel_Bogey_March|   of which only the reconstruction exists. However, the CSIR Mark 1 played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice, as  |Max_Mathews|Max_Mathews|  did, which is current computer-music practice.     The first music to be performed in England was a performance of the  |British_National_Anthem|God_Save_The_King|  that was programmed by  |Christopher_Strachey|Christopher_Strachey|  on the  |Ferranti_Mark_1|Ferranti_Mark_1| , late in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a  |BBC|Bbc|  outside broadcasting unit: the National Anthem,  |Ba,_Ba_Black_Sheep|Ba,_Ba_Black_Sheep| , and  |In_the_Mood|In_The_Mood|  and this is recognised as the earliest recording of a computer to play music as the  |CSIRAC|Csirac|  music was never recorded. This recording can be heard at the . Researchers at the  |University_of_Canterbury|University_Of_Canterbury| , Christchurch declicked and restored this recording in 2016 and the results may be heard on  |SoundCloud|Soundcloud| .        Two further major 1950s developments were the origins of digital sound synthesis by computer, and of  |algorithmic_composition|Algorithmic_Composition|  programs beyond rote playback. Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories developed the influential  |MUSIC_I|Music-N|  program and its descendents, further popularising computer music through a 1963 article in Science.  Amongst other pioneers, the musical chemists  |Lejaren_Hiller|Lejaren_Hiller|  and Leonard Isaacson worked on a series of algorithmic composition experiments from 1956-9, manifested in the 1957 premiere of the Illiac Suite for string quartet. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson, Experimental Music: Composition with an Electronic Computer . .      In  |Japan|Japan| , experiments in computer music date back to 1962, when  |Keio_University|Keio_University|  professor Sekine and  |Toshiba|Toshiba|  engineer Hayashi experimented with the  computer. This resulted in a piece entitled TOSBAC Suite, influenced by the Illiac Suite. Later Japanese computer music compositions include a piece by Kenjiro Ezaki presented during  |Osaka_Expo_70|Osaka_Expo_70|  and Panoramic Sonore by music critic Akimichi Takeda. Ezaki also published an article called Contemporary Music and Computers in 1970. Since then, Japanese research in computer music has largely been carried out for commercial purposes in  |popular_music|Popular_Music| , though some of the more serious Japanese musicians used large computer systems such as the  Fairlight  in the 1970s.         Early computer-music programs typically did not run in  |real_time|Real-Time_Computing| , although the first experiments on  |CSIRAC|Csirac|  and the  |Ferranti_Mark_1|Ferranti_Mark_1|  did operate in  |real_time|Real-Time_Computing| . From the late 1950s, with increasingly sophisticated programming, programs would run for hours or days, on multimillion-dollar computers, to generate a few minutes of music.  In 1957 the MUSIC program allowed an IBM 704 mainframe computer to play a 17-second composition by Mathews. Back then computers were ponderous, so synthesis would take an hour.  The generation of sound signals requires very high sampling rates.... A high speed machine such as the I.B.M. 7090 ... can compute only about 5000 numbers per second ... when generating a reasonably complex sound. One way around this was to use a hybrid system of digital control of an  |analog_synthesiser|Analog_Synthesiser|  and early examples of this were Max Mathews GROOVE system and also MUSYS by  |Peter_Zinovieff|Peter_Zinovieff|  . In the late 1970s these systems became commercialised, notably by systems like the  |Roland_MC-8_Microcomposer|Roland_Mc-8_Microcomposer| , where a  |microprocessor|Microprocessor| -based system controls an  |analog_synthesizer|Analog_Synthesizer| , released in 1978.  |John_Chownings|John_Chowning|  work on  |FM_synthesis|Fm_Synthesis|  from the 1960s to the 1970s allowed much more efficient digital synthesis,  eventually leading to the development of the affordable FM synthesis-based  |Yamaha_DX7|Yamaha_Dx7| |digital_synthesizer|Digital_Synthesizer| , released in 1983.  In addition to the Yamaha DX7, the advent of inexpensive digital  |chips|Microprocessor|  and  |microcomputers|Microcomputer|  opened the door to real-time generation of computer music. In the 1980s, Japanese  |personal_computers|Personal_Computer|  such as the  |NEC_PC-88|Nec_Pc-8801|  came installed with FM synthesis  |sound_chips|Sound_Chip|  and featured  |audio_programming_languages|Audio_Programming_Language|  such as  |Music_Macro_Language|Music_Macro_Language|  and  |MIDI|Midi|  interfaces, which were most often used to produce  |video_game_music|Video_Game_Music| , or  |chiptunes|Chiptune| . By the early 1990s, the performance of microprocessor-based computers reached the point that real-time generation of computer music using more general programs and algorithms became possible.  ... by the 90s ... digital sound manipulation became widespread, fluent and stable.   Interesting sounds must have a fluidity and changeability that allows them to remain fresh to the ear. In computer music this subtle ingredient is bought at a high computational cost, both in terms of the number of items requiring detail in a score and in the amount of interpretive work the instruments must produce to realize this detail in sound.        Advances in computing power and software for manipulation of digital media have dramatically affected the way computer music is generated and performed. Current-generation micro-computers are powerful enough to perform very sophisticated audio synthesis using a wide variety of algorithms and approaches. Computer music systems and approaches are now ubiquitous, and so firmly embedded in the process of creating music that we hardly give them a second thought: computer-based synthesizers, digital mixers, and effects units have become so commonplace that use of digital rather than analog technology to create and record music is the norm, rather than the exception.        Despite the ubiquity of computer music in contemporary culture, there is considerable activity in the field of computer music, as researchers continue to pursue new and interesting computer-based synthesis, composition, and performance approaches. Throughout the world there are many organizations and institutions dedicated to the area of computer and electronic music study and research, including the  |ICMA|International_Computer_Music_Association|  , C4DM ,  |IRCAM|Ircam| , GRAME,  |SEAMUS|Seamus|  ,  |CEC|Canadian_Electroacoustic_Community|  , and a great number of institutions of higher learning around the world.             Later, composers such as  |Gottfried_Michael_Koenig|Gottfried_Michael_Koenig|  and  |Iannis_Xenakis|Iannis_Xenakis|  had computers generate the sounds of the composition as well as the score. Koenig produced  |algorithmic_composition|Algorithmic_Composition|  programs which were a generalisation of his own  |serial_composition|Serial_Composition|  practice. This is not exactly similar to Xenakis work as he used mathematical abstractions and examined how far he could explore these musically. Koenigs software translated the calculation of mathematical equations into codes which represented musical notation. This could be converted into musical notation by hand and then performed by human players. His programs Project 1 and Project 2 are examples of this kind of software. Later, he extended the same kind of principles into the realm of synthesis, enabling the computer to produce the sound directly. SSP is an example of a program which performs this kind of function. All of these programs were produced by Koenig at the  |Institute_of_Sonology|Institute_Of_Sonology|  in  |Utrecht|Utrecht|  in the 1970s.        Computers have also been used in an attempt to imitate the music of great composers of the past, such as  |Mozart|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart| . A present exponent of this technique is  |David_Cope|David_Cope| . He wrote computer programs that analyse works of other composers to produce new works in a similar style. He has used this program to great effect with composers such as Bach and Mozart , and also within his own pieces, combining his own creations with that of the computer.       |Melomics|Melomics| , a research project from the  |University_of_Málaga|University_Of_Málaga| , Spain, developed a computer composition cluster named  |Iamus|Iamus| , which composes complex, multi-instrument pieces for editing and performance. Since its inception,  |Iamus|Iamus|  has composed a full album in 2012, appropriately named  |Iamus|Iamus| , which  |New_Scientist|New_Scientist|  described as The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra.  The group has also developed an  |API|Api|  for developers to utilize the technology, and makes its music available on its website.     Computer-aided algorithmic compositionComputer-aided algorithmic composition is the implementation and use of  |algorithmic_composition|Algorithmic_Composition|  techniques in software. This label is derived from the combination of two labels, each too vague for continued use. The label computer-aided composition lacks the specificity of using generative algorithms. Music produced with notation or sequencing software could easily be considered computer-aided composition. The label algorithmic composition is likewise too broad, particularly in that it does not specify the use of a computer. The term  |computer-aided|Computer-Aided| , rather than computer-assisted, is used in the same manner as  |computer-aided_design|Computer-Aided_Design| . Christopher Ariza: An Open Design for Computer-Aided Algorithmic Music Composition, Universal-Publishers Boca Raton, Florida, 2005, p. 5          Machine improvisation uses computer algorithms to create  |improvisation|Improvisation|  on existing music materials. This is usually done by sophisticated recombination of musical phrases extracted from existing music, either live or pre-recorded. In order to achieve credible improvisation in particular style, machine improvisation uses  |machine_learning|Machine_Learning|  and  |pattern_matching|Pattern_Matching|  algorithms to analyze existing musical examples. The resulting patterns are then used to create new variations in the style of the original music, developing a notion of stylistic reinjection.   This is different from other improvisation methods with computers that use  |algorithmic_composition|Algorithmic_Composition|  to generate new music without performing analysis of existing music examples. Mauricio Toro, Carlos Agon, Camilo Rueda, Gerard Assayag.  , Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology 86, no. 2 : 327–331.       Style modeling implies building a computational representation of the musical surface that captures important stylistic features from data. Statistical approaches are used to capture the redundancies in terms of pattern dictionaries or repetitions, which are later recombined to generate new musical data. Style mixing can be realized by analysis of a database containing multiple musical examples in different styles. Machine Improvisation builds upon a long musical tradition of statistical modeling that began with Hiller and Isaacsons Illiac Suite for String Quartet and Xenakis uses of  |Markov_chains|Markov_Chains|  and  |stochastic_processes|Stochastic_Processes| . Modern methods include the use of  |lossless_data_compression|Lossless_Data_Compression|  for incremental parsing,  |prediction_suffix_tree|Prediction_Suffix_Tree| ,  |string_searching|String_Searching|  and more. S. Dubnov, G. Assayag, O. Lartillot, G. Bejerano, Using Machine-Learning Methods for Musical Style Modeling , IEEE Computers, 36 , pp. 73–80, Oct. 2003. Style mixing is possible by blending models derived from several musical sources, with the first style mixing done by S. Dubnov in a piece NTrope Suite using Jensen-Shannon joint source model.

It is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by G. Assayag, M. Chemillier and G.
