           Plutarch , Lamberton, Robert. Plutarch. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001.  later named, upon becoming a  |Roman_citizen|Roman_Citizenship| , Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus,  was a Greek  |biographer|Biography|  and  |essay|Essay| ist, known primarily for his  Parallel Lives  and  Moralia .        He is classified Dillon, John M. https://books.google.com/books?idaJQ9dvgh6BwC & dqPlutarch+middle+platonist & sourcegbsnavlinkss The Middle Platonists: 80 BC to AD 220. Cornell University Press, 1996. pp. 184 ff. as a  |Middle_Platonist|Middle_Platonism| . Plutarchs surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers.                     Plutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of  |Chaeronea|Chaeronea| , about  east of  |Delphi|Delphi| , in the Greek region of  |Boeotia|Boeotia| . His family was wealthy. The name of Plutarchs father has not been preserved, but based on the common Greek custom of repeating a name in alternate generations, it was probably Nikarchus . The name of Plutarchs grandfather was  |Lamprias|Lamprias| , as he attested in  Moralia  Symposiacs, Book IX, questions II & III and in his Life of Antony.     His brothers, Timon and Lamprias, are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, which speak of Timon in particular in the most affectionate terms.  |Rualdus|Joannes_Rualdus| , in his 1624 work Life of Plutarchus, recovered the name of Plutarchs wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence afforded by his writings. A letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not to grieve too much at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother. He hinted at a belief in  |reincarnation|Reincarnation|  in that letter of consolation.      The exact number of his sons is not certain, although two of them, Autobulus and the second Plutarch, are often mentioned. Plutarchs treatise De animae procreatione in Timaeo is dedicated to them, and the marriage of his son Autobulus is the occasion of one of the dinner parties recorded in the Table Talk . Another person,  |Soklarus|Soklarus| , is spoken of in terms which seem to imply that he was Plutarchs son, but this is nowhere definitely stated. His treatise on marriage questions, addressed to  |Eurydice|Eurydice|  and  |Pollianus|Pollianus| , seems to speak of the latter as having been recently an inmate of his house, but without any clear evidence on whether she was his daughter or not.      Plutarch was the uncle of  |Sextus_of_Chaeronea|Sextus_Of_Chaeronea| , who was one of the teachers of  |Marcus_Aurelius|Marcus_Aurelius| , and who may have been the same person as the philosopher  |Sextus_Empiricus|Sextus_Empiricus| .     Plutarch studied  |mathematics|Mathematics|  and  |philosophy|Philosophy|  at the  |Academy|Platonic_Academy|  of  |Athens|Athens|  under  |Ammonius|Ammonius_Of_Athens|  from 66 to 67.      At some point, Plutarch received  |Roman_citizenship|Roman_Citizenship| . As evidenced by his new name, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus, his sponsor for citizenship was  |Lucius_Mestrius_Florus|Lucius_Mestrius_Florus| , a Roman of  |consular|Roman_Consul|  status whom Plutarch also used as a historical source for his Life of Otho. Plutarch, Otho 14.1     He lived most of his life at Chaeronea, and was initiated into the  |mysteries|Greco-Roman_Mysteries|  of the Greek god  |Apollo|Apollo| . For many years Plutarch served as one of the two priests at the temple of Apollo at Delphi, the site of the famous Delphic Oracle, twenty miles from his home. He probably took part in the  |Eleusinian_Mysteries|Eleusinian_Mysteries| .  By his writings and lectures Plutarch became a celebrity in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , yet he continued to reside where he was born, and actively participated in local affairs, even serving as mayor. At his country estate, guests from all over the empire congregated for serious conversation, presided over by Plutarch in his marble chair. Many of these dialogues were recorded and published, and the 78 essays and other works which have survived are now known collectively as the Moralia.        In addition to his duties as a priest of the Delphic temple, Plutarch was also a magistrate at Chaeronea and he represented his home town on various missions to foreign countries during his early adult years. Plutarch held the office of  |archon|Archon|  in his native municipality, probably only an annual one which he likely served more than once. He busied himself with all the little matters of the town and undertook the humblest of duties.      The  Suda , a  |medieval|Medieval|  Greek encyclopedia, states that Emperor  |Trajan|Trajan|  made Plutarch  |procurator|Procurator|  of  |Illyria|Illyria| . However, most historians consider this unlikely, since Illyria was not a procuratorial province, and Plutarch probably did not speak  |Illyrian|Illyrian_Languages| . Gianakaris, C. J. Plutarch. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1970.     According to the 8th/9th-century historian  |George_Syncellus|George_Syncellus| , late in Plutarchs life, Emperor  |Hadrian|Hadrian|  appointed him nominal  |procurator|Procurator|  of  |Achaea|Achaea|  – which entitled him to wear the vestments and ornaments of a consul. Russell, D. A. Plutarch. New York: Scribner, 1973.          Plutarch spent the last thirty years of his life serving as a priest in Delphi. He thus connected part of his literary work with the sanctuary of Apollo, the processes of oracle-giving and the personalities who lived or traveled there. One of his most important works is the Why Pythia does not give oracles in verse .  Even more important is the dialogue On the E in Delphi , Plutarch, Moralia, On the E at Delphi    which features  |Ammonius|Ammonius_Of_Athens| , a Platonic philosopher and teacher of Plutarch, and Lambrias, Plutarchs brother. According to Ammonius, the letter E written on the temple of Apollo in Delphi originated from the following fact: the wise men of antiquity, whose  |maxims|Delphic_Maxims|  were also written on the walls of the vestibule of the temple, were not seven but actually five:  |Chilon|Chilon| ,  |Solon|Solon| ,  |Thales|Thales| ,  |Bias|Bias_Of_Priene|  and  |Pittakos|Pittakos| . However, the tyrants  |Cleobulos|Cleobulus|  and  |Periandros|Periandros|  used their political power in order to be incorporated in the list. Thus, the E, which corresponds to number 5, constituted an acknowledgment that the Delphic maxims actually originated from the five real wise men.   The portrait of a philosopher exhibited at the exit of the  |Archaeological_Museum_of_Delphi|Delphi_Archaeological_Museum| , dating to the 2nd century AD, had been in the past identified with Plutarch. The man, although bearded, is depicted at a relatively young age. His hair and beard are rendered in coarse volumes and thin incisions. The gaze is deep, due to the heavy eyelids and the incised pupils. The portrait is no longer thought to represent Plutarch.   But a fragmentary  |hermaic|Herm| |stele|Stele|  next to the portrait probably did once bear a portrait of Plutarch, since it is inscribed, The Delphians along with the Chaeroneans dedicated this to Plutarch, following the precepts of the Amphictyony .              Plutarchs first biographical works were the Lives of the Roman Emperors from  |Augustus|Augustus|  to  |Vitellius|Vitellius| . Of these, only the Lives of  |Galba|Galba|  and  |Otho|Otho|  survive. The Lives of  |Tiberius|Tiberius|  and  |Nero|Nero|  are extant only as fragments, provided by Damascius Ziegler, Konrad, Plutarchos von Chaironeia , 258. Citation translated by the author. and Plutarch himself , respectively. These early emperors’ biographies were probably published under the  |Flavian_dynasty|Flavian_Dynasty|  or during the reign of Nerva .     There is reason to believe that the two Lives still extant, those of Galba and Otho, ought to be considered as a single work. Cf. among others, Holzbach, M.-C.. Plutarch: Galba-Otho und die Apostelgeschichte : ein Gattungsvergleich. Religion and Biography, 14 . Berlin London: LIT, p. 13 Therefore, they do not form a part of the Plutarchian canon of single biographies – as represented by the Life of  |Aratus_of_Sicyon|Aratus_Of_Sicyon|  and the Life of  |Artaxerxes_II|Artaxerxes_Ii_Of_Persia|  . Unlike in these biographies, in Galba-Otho the individual characters of the persons portrayed are not depicted for their own sake but instead serve as an illustration of an abstract principle; namely the adherence or non-adherence to Plutarch’s morally founded ideal of governing as a  |Princeps|Princeps|  . Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24, 67–83     Arguing from the perspective of Platonic political philosophy , in Galba-Otho Plutarch reveals the constitutional principles of the  |Principate|Principate|  in the time of the civil war after Neros death. While morally questioning the behavior of the autocrats, he also gives an impression of their tragic destinies, ruthlessly competing for the throne and finally destroying each other. The Caesars house in Rome, the Palatium, received in a shorter space of time no less than four Emperors , Plutarch writes, passing, as it were, across the stage, and one making room for another to enter . The citation from Galba was extracted from the Dryden translation as given at the      Galba-Otho was handed down through different channels. It can be found in the appendix to Plutarchs Parallel Lives as well as in various Moralia manuscripts, most prominently in  |Maximus_Planudes|Maximus_Planudes|  edition where Galba and Otho appear as Opera XXV and XXVI. Thus it seems reasonable to maintain that Galba-Otho was from early on considered as an illustration of a moral-ethical approach, possibly even by Plutarch himself. Cf. Holzbach, op. cit., 24     Parallel Lives          Plutarchs best-known work is the  Parallel Lives , a series of  |biographies|Biography|  of famous Greeks and Romans, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common  |moral|Morality|  virtues and vices. The surviving Lives contain 23 pairs, each with one Greek Life and one Roman Life, as well as four unpaired single Lives.     As is explained in the opening paragraph of his Life of Alexander, Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men. Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch-making events, he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality, reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter; indeed, he went to tremendous lengths to draw  |parallels_between_physical_appearance|Physiognomy|  and  |moral_character|Moral_Character| . In many ways, he must be counted amongst the earliest  |moral_philosophers|Ethics| .     Some of the Lives, such as those of  |Heracles|Heracles| ,  |Philip_II_of_Macedon|Philip_Ii_Of_Macedon| ,  |Epaminondas|Epaminondas|  and  |Scipio_Africanus|Scipio_Africanus| , no longer exist; many of the remaining Lives are truncated, contain obvious  |lacunae|Lacuna|  or have been tampered with by later writers. Extant Lives include those on  |Solon|Solon| ,  |Themistocles|Themistocles| ,  |Aristides|Aristides| ,  |Agesilaus_II|Agesilaus_Ii| ,  |Pericles|Pericles| ,  |Alcibiades|Alcibiades| ,  |Nicias|Nicias| ,  |Demosthenes|Demosthenes| ,  |Pelopidas|Pelopidas| ,  |Philopoemen|Philopoemen| ,  |Timoleon|Timoleon| ,  |Dion_of_Syracuse|Dion_Of_Syracuse| ,  |Eumenes|Eumenes| ,  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| ,  |Pyrrhus_of_Epirus|Pyrrhus_Of_Epirus| ,  |Romulus|Romulus| ,  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius| ,  |Coriolanus|Gaius_Marcius_Coriolanus| ,  |Theseus|Theseus| ,  |Aemilius_Paullus|Aemilius_Paullus| ,  |Tiberius_Gracchus|Tiberius_Gracchus| ,  |Gaius_Gracchus|Gaius_Gracchus| ,  |Gaius_Marius|Gaius_Marius| ,  |Sulla|Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla| ,  |Sertorius|Sertorius| ,  |Lucullus|Lucullus| ,  |Pompey|Pompey| ,  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| ,  |Cicero|Cicero| ,  |Cato_the_Elder|Cato_The_Elder| ,  |Mark_Antony|Mark_Antony| , and  |Marcus_Junius_Brutus|Marcus_Junius_Brutus| .       Since Spartans wrote no history prior to the Hellenistic period — their only extant literature is fragments of 7th-century lyrics — Plutarchs five Spartan lives and Sayings of Spartans and Sayings of Spartan Women, rooted in sources that have since disappeared, are some of the richest sources for historians of  |Lacedaemonia|Laconia| . Pomeroy, Sarah B, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, and Tolbert Roberts Jennifer . Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History. New York: Oxford University Press But while they are important, they are also controversial. Plutarch lived centuries after the Sparta he writes about and even though he visited Sparta, many of the ancient customs he reports had been long abandoned, so he never actually saw what he wrote of. Plutarchs sources themselves can be problematic. As the historians  |Sarah_Pomeroy|Sarah_B._Pomeroy| ,  |Stanley_Burstein|Stanley_M._Burstein| , Walter Donlan, and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts have written, Plutarch was influenced by histories written after the decline of Sparta and marked by nostalgia for a happier past, real or imagined. Turning to Plutarch himself, they write, the admiration writers like Plutarch and Xenophon felt for Spartan society led them to exaggerate its monolithic nature, minimizing departures from ideals of equality and obscuring patterns of historical change. Thus the Spartan egalitarianism and superhuman immunity to pain that have seized the popular imagination are likely myths, and their main architect is Plutarch. While flawed, Plutarch is nonetheless indispensable as one of the only ancient sources of information on Spartan life. Pomeroy et al. conclude that Plutarchs works on Sparta, while they must be treated with skepticism, remain valuable for their large quantities of information and these historians concede that Plutarchs writings on Sparta, more than those of any other ancient author, have shaped later views of Sparta , despite their potential to misinform. He was also referenced in saying unto Sparta, “The beast will feed again.”     Life of AlexanderLife of Alexander, written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar, is one of only five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| . It includes  |anecdotes|Anecdote|  and descriptions of events that appear in no other source, just as Plutarchs portrait of  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius| , the putative second king of Rome, holds much that is unique on the early  |Roman_calendar|Roman_Calendar| .     Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexanders drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth. He also draws extensively on the work of  |Lysippus|Lysippus| , Alexanders favourite  |sculptor|Sculptor| , to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conquerors physical appearance. When it comes to his character, Plutarch emphasizes his unusual degree of self-control and scorn for luxury: He desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory. As the narrative progresses, however, the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury. The murder of  |Cleitus_the_Black|Cleitus_The_Black| , which Alexander instantly and deeply regretted, is commonly cited to this end.     Life of Caesar |Suetoniuss|Suetonius|   The Twelve Caesars , and  |Caesars|Julius_Caesar|  own works  |de_Bello_Gallico|Commentarii_De_Bello_Gallico|  and  de Bello Civili , this Life is the main account of  |Julius_Caesars|Julius_Caesar|  feats by ancient historians. Plutarch starts by telling of the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss  |Cinnas|Lucius_Cornelius_Cinna|  daughter,  |Cornelia|Cornelia| . Other important parts are those containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesars capacity of inspiring the soldiers.          However, this Life shows few differences between Suetonius work and Caesars own works . Sometimes, Plutarch quotes directly from the De Bello Gallico and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works.     In the final part of this Life, Plutarch recounts details of Caesars assassination. The book ends by telling the destiny of his murderers, and says that Caesars great guardian-genius avenged him after his death.     Life of PyrrhusLife of Pyrrhus is a key text because it is the main historical account on Roman history for the period from 293 to 264 BC, for which neither  |Dionysius|Dionysius_Of_Halicarnassus|  nor  |Livy|Livy|  have surviving texts.      Parallel Lives     Plutarch stretches and occasionally fabricates the similarities between famous Greeks and Romans in order to be able to write their biographies as parallel. The lives of Nicias and Crassus, for example, have little in common except that both were rich and both suffered great military defeats at the ends of their lives .      In his Life of Pompey, Plutarch praises Pompeys trustworthy character and tactful behaviour in order to conjure a moral judgement that opposes most historical accounts. Plutarch delivers anecdotes with moral points, rather than in-depth comparative analyses of the causes of the fall of the  |Achaemenid_Empire|Achaemenid_Dynasty|  and the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic| ,  and tends on occasion to fit facts to hypotheses.     On the other hand, he generally sets out his moral anecdotes in chronological order  and is rarely narrow-minded and unrealistic, almost always prepared to acknowledge the complexity of the human condition where moralising cannot explain it.     Moralia          The remainder of Plutarchs surviving work is collected under the title of the  Moralia  . It is an eclectic collection of seventy-eight essays and transcribed speeches, including On Fraternal Affection—a discourse on honour and affection of siblings toward each other, On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great —an important adjunct to his Life of the great king, On the Worship of Isis and Osiris  ,  along with more philosophical treatises, such as On the Decline of the Oracles, On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance, On Peace of Mind and lighter fare, such as  Odysseus and Gryllus , a humorous  |dialogue|Dialogue|  between  |Homers|Homer|  Odysseus and one of  |Circes|Circe|  enchanted pigs. The Moralia was composed first, while writing the Lives occupied much of the last two decades of Plutarchs own life.     QuestionsMoralia contains the Roman and Greek Questions . The customs of Romans and Greeks are illuminated in little essays that pose questions such as Why were patricians not permitted to live on the Capitoline?  and then suggests answers to them.     On the Malice of Herodotus     In  On the Malice of Herodotus  Plutarch criticizes the historian  |Herodotus|Herodotus|  for all manner of prejudice and misrepresentation. It has been called the first instance in literature of the slashing review. The 19th-century English historian  |George_Grote|George_Grote|  considered this essay a serious attack upon the works of Herodotus, and speaks of the honourable frankness which Plutarch calls his malignity.  Plutarch makes some palpable hits, catching Herodotus out in various errors, but it is also probable that it was merely a rhetorical exercise, in which Plutarch plays devils advocate to see what could be said against so favourite and well-known a writer. According to Plutarch scholar R. H. Barrow, Herodotus’ real failing in Plutarch’s eyes was to advance any criticism at all of those states that saved Greece from Persia. “Plutarch”, he concluded, “is fanatically biased in favor of the Greek cities; they can do no wrong.”        Symposiacs  ;  Convivium Septem Sapientium .       The Romans loved the Lives, and enough copies were written out over the centuries so that a copy of most of the lives has survived to the present day. An ancient list of works attributed to Plutarch, the Catalogue of Lamprias contains 227 works, of which 78 have come down to us. Russell, D.A.F.M. The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 849 The  |lost_works|Lost_Workclassical_World|  of Plutarch are determined by references in his own texts to them and from other authors references over time. There are traces of twelve more Lives that are now lost.      Plutarchs general procedure for the Lives was to write the life of a prominent Greek, then cast about for a suitable Roman parallel, and end with a brief comparison of the Greek and Roman lives. Currently, only 19 of the parallel lives end with a comparison, while possibly they all did at one time. Also missing are many of his Lives which appear in a list of his writings: those of Hercules, the first pair of Parallel Lives,  |Scipio_Africanus|Scipio_Africanus|  and  |Epaminondas|Epaminondas| , and the companions to the four solo biographies. Even the lives of such important figures as  |Augustus|Augustus| ,  |Claudius|Claudius|  and  |Nero|Nero|  have not been found and may be lost forever.       Other lost works include Whether One Who Suspends Judgment on Everything Is Condemned to Inaction , On Pyrrho’s Ten Modes , and On the Difference between the Pyrrhonians and the Academics . Mauro Bonazzi, Plutarch on the Differences Between the Pyrrhonists and Academics , Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy, 2012           Plutarch was a  |Platonist|Middle_Platonism| , but was open to the influence of the  |Peripatetics|Peripatetics| , and in some details even to  |Stoicism|Stoicism|  despite his criticism of their principles. Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th edition, p. 306 He rejected only  |Epicureanism|Epicureanism|  absolutely. He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them. Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th edition, p. 307 He was more interested in moral and religious questions.     In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean atheism he cherished a pure idea of  |God|God|  that was more in accordance with  |Plato|Plato| . He adopted a second principle  in order to explain the phenomenal world. This principle he sought, however, not in any indeterminate matter but in the evil world-soul which has from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it. Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil. He elevated God above the finite world, and thus  |daemons|Daemon|  became for him agents of Gods influence on the world. He strongly defends freedom of the will, and the immortality of the soul.     Platonic-Peripatetic  |ethics|Ethics|  were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans. The most characteristic feature of Plutarchs ethics is, however, its close connection with religion. Eduard Zeller, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy, 13th edition, p. 308 However pure Plutarchs idea of God is, and however vivid his description of the vice and corruption which superstition causes, his warm religious feelings and his distrust of human powers of knowledge led him to believe that God comes to our aid by direct revelations, which we perceive the more clearly the more completely that we refrain in enthusiasm from all action; this made it possible for him to justify popular belief in  |divination|Divination|  in the way which had long been usual among the Stoics.     His attitude to popular religion was similar. The gods of different peoples are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve it. The  |myths|Greek_Mythology|  contain philosophical truths which can be interpreted allegorically. Thus Plutarch sought to combine the philosophical and religious conception of things and to remain as close as possible to tradition.     Plutarch was the teacher of  |Favorinus|Favorinus| .          Plutarchs writings had an enormous influence on  |English|English_Literature|  and  |French_literature|French_Literature| .  |Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare|  paraphrased parts of  |Thomas_Norths|Thomas_North|  translation of selected Lives in  |his_plays|Shakespeares_Plays| , and occasionally quoted from them verbatim. Honigmann 1959.      |Jean-Jacques_Rousseau|Jean-Jacques_Rousseau|  quotes from Plutarch in the 1762  Emile, or On Education , a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. Rousseau introduces a passage from Plutarch in support of his position against eating meat: You ask me, said Plutarch, why  |Pythagoras|Pythagoras|  abstained from eating the flesh of beasts...       |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|  and the  |Transcendentalists|Transcendentalism|  were greatly influenced by the Moralia and in his glowing introduction to the five-volume, 19th-century edition, he called the Lives a bible for heroes .  He also opined that it was impossible to read Plutarch without a tingling of the blood; and I accept the saying of the Chinese  |Mencius|Mencius| |Montaignes|Michel_De_Montaigne|   Essays  draw extensively on Plutarchs Moralia and are consciously modelled on the Greeks easygoing and discursive inquiries into science, manners, customs and beliefs. Essays contains more than 400 references to Plutarch and his works.      |James_Boswell|James_Boswell|  quoted Plutarch on writing lives, rather than biographies, in the introduction to his own  Life of Samuel Johnson . Other admirers included  |Ben_Jonson|Ben_Jonson| ,  |John_Dryden|John_Dryden| ,  |Alexander_Hamilton|Alexander_Hamilton| ,  |John_Milton|John_Milton| ,  |Louis_Lamour|Louis_Lamour| , and  |Francis_Bacon|Francis_Bacon| , as well as such disparate figures as  |Cotton_Mather|Cotton_Mather|  and  |Robert_Browning|Robert_Browning| .     Plutarchs influence declined in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it remains embedded in the popular ideas of Greek and Roman history. One of his most famous quotes was one that he included in one of his earliest works. The world of man is best captured through the lives of the men who created history.

He went to Italy and studied the Vatican text of Plutarch, from which he published a French translation of the Lives in 1559 and Moralia in 1572, which were widely read by educated Europe.  Amyots translations had as deep an impression in England as France, because Thomas North later published his English translation of the Lives in 1579 based on Amyot’s French translation instead of the original Greek.       Plutarchs Lives were translated into English, from Amyots version, by  |Sir_Thomas_North|Sir_Thomas_North|  in 1579. The complete Moralia was first translated into English from the original Greek by  |Philemon_Holland|Philemon_Holland|  in 1603.     In 1683,  |John_Dryden|John_Dryden|  began a life of Plutarch and oversaw a translation of the Lives by several hands and based on the original Greek.

In 1770, English brothers  |John|John_Langhorne|  and  |William_Langhorne|William_Langhorne|  published Plutarchs Lives from the original Greek, with notes critical and historical, and a new life of Plutarch in 6 volumes and dedicated to Lord Folkestone. Their translation was re-edited by Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1819.     From 1901 to 1912, an American classicist,  |Bernadotte_Perrin|Bernadotte_Perrin| ,  produced a new translation of the Lives for the  |Loeb_Classical_Library|Loeb_Classical_Library| . The Moralia is also included in the Loeb series, translated by various authors.      |Penguin_Classics|Penguin_Classics|  began a series of translations by various scholars in 1958 with The Fall of the Roman Republic, which contained six Lives and was translated by Rex Warner.

Following some Hebrew translations of selections from Plutarchs Parallel Lives published in the 1920s and the 1940s, a complete translation was published in three volumes by the  |Bialik_Institute|Bialik_Institute|  in 1954, 1971 and 1973. The first volume, Roman Lives, first published in 1954, presents the translations of Joseph G. Liebes to the biographies of  |Coriolanus|Coriolanus| ,  |Fabius_Maximus|Quintus_Fabius_Maximus_Verrucosus| ,  |Tiberius_Gracchus|Tiberius_Gracchus|  and  |Gaius_Gracchus|Gaius_Gracchus| ,  |Cato_the_Elder|Cato_The_Elder|  and  |Cato_the_Younger|Cato_The_Younger| ,  |Gaius_Marius|Gaius_Marius| ,  |Sulla|Sulla| ,  |Sertorius|Sertorius| ,  |Lucullus|Lucullus| ,  |Pompey|Pompey| ,  |Crassus|Crassus| ,  |Cicero|Cicero| ,  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| ,  |Brutus|Brutus|  and  |Mark_Anthony|Mark_Antony| .     The second volume, Greek Lives, first published in 1971 presents A. A. Halevys translations of the biographies of  |Lycurgus|Lycurgus_Of_Sparta| ,  |Aristides|Aristides| ,  |Cimon|Cimon| ,  |Pericles|Pericles| ,  |Nicias|Nicias| ,  |Lysander|Lysander| ,  |Agesilaus|Agesilaus| ,  |Pelopidas|Pelopidas| ,  |Dion|Dion_Of_Syracuse| ,  |Timoleon|Timoleon| ,  |Demosthenes|Demosthenes| ,  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| ,  |Eumenes|Eumenes|  and  |Phocion|Phocion| . Three more biographies presented in this volume, those of  |Solon|Solon| ,  |Themistocles|Themistocles|  and  |Alcibiades|Alcibiades|  were translated by M. H. Ben-Shamai.     The third volume, Greek and Roman Lives, published in 1973, presented the remaining biographies and parallels as translated by Halevy. Included are the biographies of  |Demetrius|Demetrius_I_Of_Macedon| ,  |Pyrrhus|Pyrrhus_Of_Epirus| ,  |Agis|Agis_Iv|  and  |Cleomenes|Cleomenes_Iii| ,  |Aratus|Aratus|  and  |Artaxerxes|Artaxerxes_I_Of_Persia| ,  |Philopoemen|Philopoemen| ,  |Camillus|Marcus_Furius_Camillus| ,  |Marcellus|Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus| ,  |Flamininus|Flamininus| ,  |Aemilius_Paulus|Aemilius_Paulus| ,  |Galba|Galba|  and  |Otho|Otho| ,  |Theseus|Theseus| ,  |Romulus|Romulus| ,  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius|  and  |Poplicola|Poplicola| . It completes the translation of the known remaining biographies. In the introduction to the third volume Halevy explains that originally the Bialik Institute intended to publish only a selection of biographies, leaving out mythological figures and biographies that had no parallels. Thus, to match the first volume in scope the second volume followed the same path and the third volume was required.            Some editions of the Moralia include several works now known to have been  |falsely_attributed|Pseudepigrapha|  to Plutarch. Among these are the Lives of the Ten Orators, a series of biographies of the  |Attic_orators|Attic_Orators|  based on  |Caecilius_of_Calacte|Caecilius_Of_Calacte| ; On the Opinions of the Philosophers, On Fate, and On Music.  These works are all attributed to a single, unknown author, referred to as  |Pseudo-Plutarch|Pseudo-Plutarch|  . Pseudo-Plutarch lived sometime between the third and fourth centuries AD. Despite being falsely attributed, the works are still considered to possess historical value.
