He was the leader of the  |Country_Party|National_Party_Of_Australia|  from 1921 to 1939, and was the most influential figure in its early years.     Page was born in  |Grafton_New_South_Wales|Grafton_New_South_Wales| . He entered the  |University_of_Sydney|University_Of_Sydney|  at the age of 15, and completed a degree in medicine at the age of 21. After completing his  |residency|Medical_Residency|  at Sydneys  |Royal_Prince_Alfred_Hospital|Royal_Prince_Alfred_Hospital| , he moved back to Grafton and opened a private hospital. He soon became involved in local politics, and in 1915 purchased a part-share in  The Daily Examiner , a local newspaper. He also briefly served as a military surgeon during World War I. Page gained prominence as an advocate of various development schemes for the  |Northern_Rivers|Northern_Rivers|  region, especially those involving hydroelectricity. He also helped found a movement for  |New_England_statehood|New_England_New_State_Movement| .      |In_1919|1919_Australian_Federal_Election| , Page was elected to  |federal_parliament|Parliament_Of_Australia|  representing the  |Division_of_Cowper|Division_Of_Cowper| . He joined the new Country Party the following year as its inaugural  |whip|Whip| , and then replaced  |William_McWilliams|William_Mcwilliams|  as party leader in 1921. Page opposed the economic policies of Prime Minister  |Billy_Hughes|Billy_Hughes| , and when the Country Party gained the  |balance_of_power|Balance_Of_Power|  at the  |1922_election|1922_Australian_Federal_Election| , he demanded Hughes resignation as the price for a coalition with the  |Nationalist_Party|Nationalist_Party| . He was subsequently made  |Treasurer|Treasurer_Of_Australia|  under the new prime minister,  |Stanley_Bruce|Stanley_Bruce| , serving in that role from 1923 to 1929. He had a significant degree of influence on domestic policy, with Bruce concentrating on international issues.     Page returned to cabinet after the  |1934_election|1934_Australian_Federal_Election| , when the Country Party entered a new coalition with  |Joseph_Lyons|Joseph_Lyons| |_United_Australia_Party|United_Australia_Party| . He was appointed  |Minister_for_Commerce|Minister_For_Agriculture| , and concentrated on agricultural issues. When Lyons died in office in April 1939, Page was commissioned as his successor in a caretaker capacity while the UAP  |elected|1939_United_Australia_Party_Leadership_Election|  a new leader,  |Robert_Menzies|Robert_Menzies| . Page subsequently refused to serve in Menzies cabinet, withdrawing the Country Party from the coalition, but this proved unpopular and he resigned the party leadership after a few months. The coalition was eventually reconstituted, and Page served again as Minister for Commerce under Menzies and  |Arthur_Fadden|Arthur_Fadden|  until the governments defeat in October 1941.     Pages last major role was as  |Minister_for_Health|Minister_For_Health|  in the post-war  |Menzies_Government|Menzies_Government| . He retired from cabinet at the age of 76, and died a short time after losing his seat at the  |1961_election|1961_Australian_Federal_Election| . Page served in parliament for almost 42 years, and only Menzies lasted longer as the leader of a major Australian political party. He secured his partys independence by refusing overtures to join the Nationalists and the UAP, and the policies that he favoured – decentralisation, agrarianism, and government support of primary industry – have remained the basis of its platform up to the present day. The coalitions that he established and maintained with Bruce and Lyons have served as a model for  |all_subsequent_coalition_governments|Coalition| .
