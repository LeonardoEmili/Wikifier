The 6309 is  |Hitachis|Hitachi,_Ltd.|  CMOS version of the  |Motorola_6809|Motorola_6809| |microprocessor|Microprocessor| . While in Emulation Mode it is fully compatible with the 6809. To the 6809 specifications it adds higher clock rates, enhanced features, new instructions, and additional  |registers|Processor_Register| . Most new instructions were added to support the additional registers, as well as up to 32-bit math, hardware division, bit manipulations, and block transfers. The 6309 is generally 30% faster in  |native_mode|Native_Mode|  than the 6809.     Surprisingly, this information was never published by Hitachi. The April 1988 issue of Oh! FM, a Japanese magazine for Fujitsu personal computer users, contained the first description of the 6309s additional capabilities. Later, Hirotsugu Kakugawa posted details of the 6309s new features and instructions to comp.sys.m6809. This led to the development of  for the  |Tandy_Color_Computer|Tandy_Color_Computer|  3.              The 6309 differs from the 6809 in several key areas.       The 6309 is fabricated in  |CMOS|Cmos|  technology, while the 6809 is an  |NMOS|Nmos_Logic|  device. As a result, the 6309 requires less power to operate than the 6809. It is also a fully  |static|Clocked_Logicstatic_Versus_Dynamic_Logic|  device, which will not lose internal state information. This means it can be used with external DMA without needing refresh every 14 cycles as the 6809 does.       The 6309 has B versions as the 6809 does. However, a C speed rating was produced with either a 3.0 or 3.5  MHz maximum clock rate, depending on which datasheet is referenced. . Anecdotal and individual reports indicate that the 63C09 variant can be clocked at 5  MHz with no ill effects. Like the 6809, the Hitachi CPU comes in both internal and external clock versions       When switched into 6309 Native Mode many key instructions will complete in fewer clock cycles. This often improves execution speeds by up to 30%.       Two 8-bit  |accumulators|Accumulator|  indicates that many of the new instructions are actually slower than the equivalent 6809 code, especially in tight loops. Careful analysis should be done to ensure that the programmer uses the most efficient code for the particular application.       It is possible to change the mode of operation for the FIRQ interrupt. Instead of stacking the PC and CC registers the FIRQ interrupt can be set to stack the entire register set, as the IRQ interrupt does. In addition, the 6309 has two possible trap modes, one for an illegal instruction fetch and one for division by zero. The illegal instruction fetch is not maskable, and many  |TRS-80_Color_Computer|Trs-80_Color_Computer|  users reported that their 6309s were buggy when in reality it was an indicator of enhanced and unknown features.
