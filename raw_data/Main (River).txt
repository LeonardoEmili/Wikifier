   The Main  is a  |river|River|  in  |Germany|Germany| . With a length of   , it is the longest right tributary of the  |Rhine|Rhine| . It is also the longest river lying entirely in Germany . The largest cities along the Main are  |Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt_Am_Main|  and  |Würzburg|Würzburg| .       The mainspring of the Main River flows through the  |German_states|States_Of_Germany|  of  |Bavaria|Bavaria| ,  |Baden_Württemberg|Baden_Württemberg|  and  |Hesse|Hesse| . Its  |basin|Drainage_Basin|  competes with the  |Danube|Danube|  for water; as a result, many of its boundaries are identical with those of the  |European_Watershed|European_Watershed| .     The Main begins near  |Kulmbach|Kulmbach|  in  |Franconia|Franconia|  at the joining of its two headstreams, the  |Red_Main|Red_Main|   and the  |White_Main|White_Main|  . The Red Main originates in the  |Franconian_Jura|Franconian_Jura|  mountain range,  in length, and runs through  |Creussen|Creussen|  and  |Bayreuth|Bayreuth| . The White Main originates in the mountains of the  |Fichtelgebirge|Fichtelgebirge| ; it is  long. In its upper and middle section, the Main runs through the valleys of the German Highlands. Its lower section crosses the Lower Main Lowlands  to  |Wiesbaden|Wiesbaden| , where it discharges into the  |Rhine|Rhine| . Major tributaries of the Main are the  |Regnitz|Regnitz| , the  |Franconian_Saale|Franconian_Saale| , the  |Tauber|Tauber| , and the  |Nidda|Nidda_River| .     The name Main derives from the  |Latin|Latin|  Moenus or Menus. It is not related to the name of the city  |Mainz|Mainz|  .       The Main is navigable for shipping from its mouth at the Rhine close to Mainz for  to  |Bamberg|Bamberg| . Since 1992, the Main has been connected to the Danube via the  |Rhine_Main_Danube_Canal|Rhine_Main_Danube_Canal|  and the highly regulated  |Altmühl|Altmühl|  river. The Main has been canalized with 34 large locks  to allow CEMT class V vessels  to navigate the total length of the river. The 16 locks in the adjacent Rhine-Main-Danube Canal and the Danube itself are of the same dimensions.          There are 34 dams and locks along the 380 km navigable portion of the Main, from the confluence with the Regnitz near Bamberg, to the Rhine.      No.: Number of the lock .   Name: Name of the lock.   Location: City or town where the lock is located.   Year built: Year when the lock was put into operation .   Main-km: Location on the Main, measured from the 0  km stone in Mainz-Kostheim. The reference point is the center of the lock or lock group.   Distance between locks : length in km of impoundment .   Altitude: height in meters above mean sea level of the upper water at normal levels.   Height: Height of the dam in meters .   Lock length: Usable length of the lock chamber in meters.   Lock width: Usable width of the lock chamber in meters.            Most of the dams along the Main also have turbines for power generation.   No.: Number of the dam .   Name: Name of the dam.   Height: Height of the dam in meters .   Power: Maximum power generation capacity in megawatts.   Turbines: Type and number of turbines.   Operator: Operator of the hydroelectric plant.             |Tributaries|Tributary|  from source to mouth:         Left    |Regnitz|Regnitz| |_Tauber|Tauber| |_Mümling|Mümling|       Right    |Rodach_|Rodach| |_Itz|Itz| |_Franconian_Saale|Franconian_Saale| |_Aschaff|Aschaff| |_Kahl|Kahl| |_Kinzig|Kinzig| |_Nidda|Nidda| |_Frankfurt|Frankfurt|  at night   Image:Offenbach 4.jpg Main in  |Offenbach_am_Main|Offenbach_Am_Main|    Image:Mainspitze fg01.JPG Confluence into the Rhine at  |Mainz_Kostheim|Mainz_Kostheim|          Around Frankfurt are several large inland ports. Because the river is rather narrow on many of the upper reaches, navigation with larger vessels and push convoys requires great skill.     The largest cities along the Main are  |Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt_Am_Main|  and  |Würzburg|Würzburg| . The Main also passes the following towns and cities:  |Burgkunstadt|Burgkunstadt| ,  |Lichtenfels|Lichtenfels_Bavaria| ,  |Bad_Staffelstein|Bad_Staffelstein| ,  |Eltmann|Eltmann| ,  |Haßfurt|Haßfurt| ,  |Schweinfurt|Schweinfurt| ,  |Volkach|Volkach| ,  |Kitzingen|Kitzingen| ,  |Marktbreit|Marktbreit| ,  |Ochsenfurt|Ochsenfurt| ,  |Karlstadt|Karlstadt_Am_Main| ,  |Gemünden|Gemünden_Am_Main| ,  |Lohr|Lohr_Am_Main| ,  |Marktheidenfeld|Marktheidenfeld| ,  |Wertheim|Wertheim_Am_Main| ,  |Miltenberg|Miltenberg| ,  |Obernburg|Obernburg| ,  |Erlenbach_Main|Erlenbach_Am_Main| ,  |Aschaffenburg|Aschaffenburg| ,  |Seligenstadt|Seligenstadt| ,  |Hainburg|Hainburg_Germany| ,  |Hanau|Hanau| ,  |Offenbach|Offenbach_Am_Main| ,  |Hattersheim|Hattersheim_Am_Main| ,  |Flörsheim|Flörsheim| , and  |Rüsselsheim|Rüsselsheim| .     The river has gained enormous importance as a vital part of European  |Corridor_VII|Pan_European_Corridors|  , the inland waterway link from  |the_North_Sea|North_Sea|  to the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea| .           In a historical and political sense, the Main line is referred to as the northern border of  |Southern_Germany|Southern_Germany| , with its predominantly  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  population. The river roughly marked the southern border of the  |North_German_Federation|North_German_Federation| , established in 1867 under  |Prussian|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  leadership as the predecessor of the  |German_Empire|German_Empire| .     The river course also corresponds with the  |Speyer_line|Speyer_Line|  isogloss between  |Central|Central_German|  and  |Upper_German|Upper_German|  dialects, sometimes mocked as  Weißwurstäquator .         The  |Main_Radweg|Main_Radweg|  is a major German bicycle path running along the Main River. It is approximately  and was the first long-distance bicycle path to be awarded 5  stars by the General German Bicycle Club  |ADFC|Allgemeiner_Deutscher_Fahrrad_Club|  in 2008. It starts from either  |Creußen|Creußen|  or  |Bischofsgrün|Bischofsgrün|  and ends in  |Mainz|Mainz| .         |Roman_camp_at_Marktbreit|Roman_Camp_Marktbreit| .
