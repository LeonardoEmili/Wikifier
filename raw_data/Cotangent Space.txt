In  |differential_geometry|Differential_Geometry| , one can attach to every point x of a  |smooth_manifold|Smooth_Manifold| ,   M , a  |vector_space|Vector_Space|  called the cotangent space at  x . Typically, the cotangent space, Tx  M is defined as the  |dual_space|Dual_Space|  of the  |tangent_space|Tangent_Space|  at  x , Tx  M , although there are more direct definitions . The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors.       All cotangent spaces at points on a connected manifold have the same  |dimension|Dimension_Of_A_Vector_Space| , equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be glued together to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the  |cotangent_bundle|Cotangent_Bundle|  of the manifold.     The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore  |isomorphic|Isomorphic|  to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a  |Riemannian_metric|Riemannian_Metric|  or a  |symplectic_form|Symplectic_Form|  gives rise to a  |natural_isomorphism|Natural_Isomorphism|  between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.             Let    M  be a smooth manifold and let  x  be a point in    M . Let  Tx  M  be the  |tangent_space|Tangent_Space|  at  x . Then the cotangent space at x is defined as the  |dual_space|Dual_Space|  of  Tx  M  |linear_functionals|Linear_Functional|  on  Tx  M . That is, every element   Tx  M is a  |linear_map|Linear_Map|    :   M   F     where F is the underlying  |field|Field|  of the vector space being considered, for example, the field of  |real_numbers|Real_Number| . The elements of Tx  M are called cotangent vectors.         In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of  |equivalence_class|Equivalence_Class| es of smooth functions on    M . Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point  x  if they have the same first-order behavior near  x , analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions f and g have the same first order behavior near  x  if and only if the derivative of the function f-g vanishes at  x . The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near  x .     Let M be a smooth manifold and let x be a point in    M . Let Ix be the  |ideal|Ideal|  of all functions in C  vanishing at  x , and let Ix2 be the set of functions of the form   fi gi  , where fi,gi  Ix . Then  Ix  and Ix2 are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the  |quotient_space|Quotient_Space|  Tx  M Ix/I2x .     This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the  |Zariski_tangent_space|Zariski_Tangent_Space|  in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to  |locally_ringed_spaces|Locally_Ringed_Space| .         Let M be a smooth manifold and let f ∈ C ∞  be a  |smooth_function|Smooth_Function| . The differential of f at a point x is the map   :df x  X x    where X x is a  |tangent_vector|Differential_Geometry_Of_Curves|  at x, thought of as a derivation. That is X  is the  |Lie_derivative|Lie_Derivative|  of f in the direction X, and one has dfX. Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write   :df x  & prime;   In either case, df x is a linear map on T x M and hence it is a tangent covector at x.     We can then define the differential map d : C ∞  → T x M at a point x as the map which sends f to df x . Properties of the differential map include:     d is a linear map: d a df + b dg for constants a and b,   d x fdg x + gdf x ,     The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function f ∈ I x  we can form the linear functional df x as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on I x 2 , d descends to a map from I x / I x 2 to the dual of the tangent space,  . One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.         Just as every differentiable map f : M → N between manifolds induces a linear map  between the tangent spaces   : f  Tx M   T N   every such map induces a linear map  between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:   : f  T N   T M   The pullback is naturally defined as the dual of the  |pushforward|Pushforward| . Unraveling the definition, this means the following:   :     where θ ∈ T f N and X x ∈ T x M. Note carefully where everything lives.     If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let g be a smooth function on N vanishing at f. Then the pullback of the covector determined by g  is given by   : f  dg   d.   That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on M vanishing at x determined by g o f.         The k-th  |exterior_power|Exterior_Power|  of the cotangent space, denoted Λ k , is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the kth exterior power, or more precisely sections of the k-th exterior power of the  |cotangent_bundle|Cotangent_Bundle| , are called  |differential_k-forms|Differential_Form| . They can be thought of as alternating,  |multilinear_maps|Multilinear_Map|  on k tangent vectors.   For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called  one-form s.
