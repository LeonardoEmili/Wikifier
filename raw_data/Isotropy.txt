   Isotropy is uniformity in all orientations; it is derived from the Greek isos and tropos . Precise definitions depend on the subject area. Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the prefix an, hence  anisotropy . Anisotropy is also used to describe situations where properties vary systematically, dependent on direction.  |Isotropic_radiation|Isotropic_Radiation|  has the same intensity regardless of the direction of  |measurement|Measurement| , and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test  |particle|Elementary_Particle|  is oriented.       Within  |mathematics|Mathematics| , isotropy has a few different meanings:   ;  |Isotropic_manifolds|Isotropic_Manifold| : A  |manifold|Manifold|  is isotropic if the  |geometry|Geometry|  on the manifold is the same regardless of direction. A similar concept is  |homogeneity|Homogeneous_Space| .   ;  |Isotropic_quadratic_form|Isotropic_Quadratic_Form| |quadratic_form|Quadratic_Form|  q is said to be isotropic if there is a non-zero vector v such that ; such a v is an  |isotropic_vector|Isotropic_Vector|  or null vector. In complex geometry, a line through the origin in the direction of an isotropic vector is an  |isotropic_line|Isotropic_Line| .   ;  |Isotropic_coordinates|Isotropic_Coordinates| |Lorentzian_manifolds|Lorentzian_Manifolds| .   ;  |Isotropy_group|Isotropy_Group| |isomorphisms|Isomorphism|  from any  |object|Object|  to itself in a  |groupoid|Groupoid| . A  |groupoid|Groupoid|    G is a  |category|Category|  where all  |morphisms|Morphism|  are  |isomorphisms|Isomorphism| , i.e., invertible. If G     G is any object, then   G denotes its  |isotropy_group|Isotropy_Group| |isotropy_representation|Isotropy_Representation|  is a representation of an isotropy group.   ;  |Isotropic_position|Isotropic_Position| |probability_distribution|Probability_Distribution|  over a  |vector_space|Vector_Space|  is in isotropic position if its  |covariance_matrix|Covariance_Matrix|  is the  |identity|Identity_Matrix| .       ;  |Quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  or  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics| must be isotropic in the rest frame of the decaying particle regardless of the detailed physics of the decay. This follows from  |rotational_invariance|Rotational_Invariance|  of the  |Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian_Mechanics| , which in turn is guaranteed for a spherically symmetric potential.   : |Kinetic_theory_of_gases|Kinetic_Theory_Of_Gases|  is also an example of isotropy. It is assumed that the molecules move in random directions and as a consequence, there is an equal probability of a molecule moving in any direction. Thus when there are many molecules in the gas, with high probability there will be very similar numbers moving in one direction as any other, demonstrating approximate isotropy.     ;  |Fluid_dynamics|Fluid_Dynamics| |Thermal_expansion|Thermal_Expansion| |Electromagnetics|Electromagnetism| |Optics|Optics| |reflectance|Reflectance|  or  |transmittance|Transmittance|  of the domains is averaged if the macroscopic reflectance or transmittance is to be calculated. This can be verified simply by investigating, e.g., a  |polycrystalline|Polycrystalline|  material under a polarizing microscope having the polarizers crossed: If the crystallites are larger than the resolution limit, they will be visible.     ;  |Cosmology|Cosmology| |Big_Bang|Big_Bang|  theory of the evolution of the observable universe assumes that space is isotropic.  It also assumes that space is homogeneous. These two assumptions together are known as the  |cosmological_principle|Cosmological_Principle| . As of 2006, the observations suggest that, on distance scales much larger than galaxies, galaxy clusters are  |Great|Great_Wall|  features, but small compared to so-called  |multiverse|Multiverse|  scenarios. Here homogeneous means that the universe is the same everywhere and isotropic implies that there is no preferred direction.          In the study of  |mechanical_properties_of_materials|List_Of_Materials_Properties| , isotropic means having identical values of a property in all directions. This definition is also used in  |geology|Geology|  and  |mineralogy|Mineralogy| . Glass and metals are examples of isotropic materials.  Common anisotropic materials include  |wood|Wood| , because its material properties are different parallel and perpendicular to the grain, and layered rocks such as  |slate|Slate| .     Isotropic materials are useful since they are easier to shape, and their behavior is easier to predict. Anisotropic materials can be tailored to the forces an object is expected to experience. For example, the fibers in  |carbon_fiber|Carbon_Fiber|  materials and  |rebars|Rebar|  in  |reinforced_concrete|Reinforced_Concrete|  are oriented to withstand tension.       In industrial processes, such as etching steps, isotropic means that the process proceeds at the same rate, regardless of direction. Simple chemical reaction and removal of a substrate by an acid, a solvent or a reactive gas is often very close to isotropic. Conversely, anisotropic means that the attack rate of the substrate is higher in a certain direction. Anisotropic etch processes, where vertical etch-rate is high, but lateral etch-rate is very small are essential processes in  |microfabrication|Microfabrication|  of  |integrated_circuits|Integrated_Circuits|  and  |MEMS|Microelectromechanical_Systems|  devices.       An  |isotropic_antenna|Isotropic_Antenna|  is an idealized  |radiating_element|Radiator|  used as a  |reference|Reference| ; an  |antenna|Antenna|  that broadcasts power equally  in all directions. The  |gain|Antenna_Gain|  of an arbitrary antenna is usually reported in  |decibels|Decibel|  relative to an isotropic antenna, and is expressed as dBi or dB.       ;  |Cell_biology|Cell_Biology| |cell_wall|Cell|  are more or less the same everywhere, it is said to be isotropic. The interior of the cell is anisotropic due to intracellular  |organelles|Organelle| .     ;  |Physiology|Physiology| , the term  |isotropic|Isotropic_Bands|  refers to the light bands  that contribute to the striated pattern of the cells.     ;  |Pharmacology|Pharmacology|  Anatomy and Embryology  1988; 178:1-13  Most recently,  |isotropic_formulations|Isotropic_Formulations|  have been used extensively in dermatology for drug delivery.
