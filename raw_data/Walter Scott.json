In 1679, this policy of using extrajudicial imprisonments to quell rebellion finally provoked the English Parliament to pass the Act of Habeas Corpus in England. Usually translated as produce the body , habeas corpus could be invoked by any subject to require that the king or his agents produce the body of a prisoner for adjudication before the courts. In its barest terms the Great Writ protected a subject from indefinite terms of imprisonment, from imprisonment outside the kingdom, or from imprisonment without cause. It did so by asserting the jurisdiction of the courts as superior to the executive powers of the king. The Act was thus part of a long debate within the three kingdoms about the relationship of king to law and vice versa.

Likewise, her father, Isaac of York, a Jewish moneylender, is shown as a victim rather than a villain.

At the time Scott wrote, Scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism. Through the medium of Scotts novels, the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which Scott defined, as the subtitle of Waverley indicates, as something that happened at least 60 years ago.
