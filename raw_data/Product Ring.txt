In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , it is possible to combine several  |rings|Ring|  into one large product ring. This is done by giving the  |Cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|  of a family of rings coordinatewise addition and multiplication. The resulting ring is called a direct product of the original rings.       An important example is the ring Z/nZ of  |integers|Integer| |modulo|Modular_Arithmetic|  n. If n is written as a product of  |prime|Prime_Number|  powers ,     : np1 p2  pk,     where the p i  are distinct primes, then Z/nZ is naturally  |isomorphic|Isomorphic|  to the product ring     :                             This follows from the  |Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese_Remainder_Theorem| .       If  is a product of rings, then for every i in I we have a  |surjective|Surjective| |ring_homomorphism|Ring_Homomorphism|   which projects the product on the ith coordinate. The product R, together with the projections p i , has the following  |universal_property|Universal_Property| S is any ring and  is a ring homomorphism for every i in I, then there exists precisely one ring homomorphism  such that  for every i in I.   This shows that the product of rings is an instance of  |products_in_the_sense_of_category_theory|Product| .     When I is finite, the underlying additive group of  coincides with the  |direct_sum|Direct_Sum|  of the additive groups of the R i . In this case, some authors call R the direct sum of the rings R i and write , but this is incorrect from the point of view of category theory, since it is usually not a  |coproduct|Coproduct|  in the category of rings: for example, when two or more of the R i are nonzero, the inclusion map  fails to map 1 to 1 and hence is not a ring homomorphism.          Direct products are commutative and associative , meaning that it doesnt matter in which order one forms the direct product.     If A i  is an  |ideal|Ideal|  of R i  for each i in I, then  is an ideal of R. If I is finite, then the converse is true, i.e., every ideal of R is of this form. However, if I is infinite and the rings R i  are non-zero, then the converse is false: the set of elements with all but finitely many nonzero coordinates forms an ideal which is not a direct product of ideals of the R i . The ideal A is a  |prime_ideal|Prime_Ideal|  in R if all but one of the A i  are equal to R i  and the remaining A i  is a prime ideal in R i . However, the converse is not true when I is infinite. For example, the  |direct_sum|Direct_Sum_Of_Modules|  of the R i  form an ideal not contained in any such A, but the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice|  gives that it is contained in some  |maximal_ideal|Maximal_Ideal|  which is  |a_fortiori|A_Fortiori|  prime.     An element x in R is a unit if and only if all of its components are units, i.e., if and only if  is a unit in R i  for every i in I. The group of units of R is the  |product|Direct_Product_Of_Groups|  of the groups of units of R i .     A product of two or more non-zero rings always has nonzero  |zero_divisors|Zero_Divisors| x is an element of the product whose coordinates are all zero except , and y is an element of the product with all coordinates zero except  where , then .
