   A Grand Unified Theory  is a model in  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  in which, at high  |energies|Energy| , the three  |gauge_interactions|Gauge_Theory|  of the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  that define the  |electromagnetic|Electromagnetism| ,  |weak|Weak_Interaction| , and  |strong|Strong_Interaction| |interactions|Fundamental_Interaction| , or forces, are merged into a single force. Although this unified force has not been directly observed, the many GUT models theorize its existence. If unification of these three interactions is possible, it raises the possibility that there was a  |grand_unification_epoch|Grand_Unification_Epoch|  in the  |very_early_universe|Very_Early_Universe|  in which these three  |fundamental_interactions|Fundamental_Interactions|  were not yet distinct.     Experiments have confirmed that at high energy, the electromagnetic interaction and weak interaction unify into a single  |electroweak_interaction|Electroweak_Interaction| . GUT models predict that at even  |higher_energy|Grand_Unification_Energy| , the strong interaction and the electroweak interaction will unify into a single electronuclear interaction. This interaction is characterized by one larger  |gauge_symmetry|Gauge_Theory|  and thus several  |force_carriers|Force_Carrier| , but one unified  |coupling_constant|Coupling_Constant| . Unifying  |gravity|Gravity|  with the electronuclear interaction would provide a  |theory_of_everything|Theory_Of_Everything|  rather than a GUT. GUTs are often seen as an intermediate step towards a TOE.     The novel particles predicted by GUT models are expected to have extremely high masses of around the  |GUT_scale|Gut_Scale|  of 10 GeV —just a few orders of magnitude below the  |Planck_scale|Planck_Scale|  of 10 GeV—and so are well beyond the reach of any foreseen particle collider experiments. Therefore, the particles predicted by GUT models will be unable to be observed directly and instead the effects of grand unification might be detected through indirect observations such as  |proton_decay|Proton_Decay| , electric dipole moments of elementary particles, or the properties of  |neutrinos|Neutrino| .  Some GUTs, such as the  |Pati-Salam_model|Pati-Salam_Model| , predict the existence of  |magnetic_monopoles|Magnetic_Monopoles| .     GUT models which aim to be completely realistic are quite complicated, even compared to the Standard Model, because they need to introduce additional fields and interactions, or even additional dimensions of space. The main reason for this complexity lies in the difficulty of reproducing the observed fermion masses and mixing angles which may be related to an existence of some additional  |family_symmetries|Family_Symmetries|  beyond the conventional GUT models. Due to this difficulty, and due to the lack of any observed effect of grand unification so far, there is no generally accepted GUT model.     Models that do not unify the three interactions using one  |simple_group|Simple_Group|  as the gauge symmetry, but do so using  |semisimple_groups|Semisimple_Group| , can exhibit similar properties and are sometimes referred to as Grand Unified Theories as well.            Historically, the first true GUT which was based on the  |simple_Lie_group|Simple_Lie_Group|  , was proposed by  |Howard_Georgi|Howard_Georgi|  and  |Sheldon_Glashow|Sheldon_Glashow|  in 1974.  The  |Georgi–Glashow_model|Georgi–Glashow_Model|  was preceded by the  |semisimple_Lie_algebra|Semisimple_Lie_Algebra| |Pati–Salam_model|Pati–Salam_Model|  by  |Abdus_Salam|Abdus_Salam|  and  |Jogesh_Pati|Jogesh_Pati| ,  who pioneered the idea to unify gauge interactions.     The acronym GUT was first coined in 1978 by CERN researchers  |John_Ellis|John_Ellis| ,  |Andrzej_Buras|Andrzej_Buras| ,  |Mary_K._Gaillard|Mary_K._Gaillard| , and  |Dimitri_Nanopoulos|Dimitri_Nanopoulos| , however in the final version of their paper  they opted for the less anatomical GUM . Nanopoulos later that year was the first to use  the acronym in a paper.        The supposition that the  |electric_charges|Electric_Charge|  of  |electrons|Electron|  and  |protons|Proton|  seem to cancel each other exactly to extreme precision is essential for the existence of the macroscopic world as we know it, but this important property of elementary particles is not explained in the Standard Model of particle physics. While the description of  |strong|Strong_Interaction|  and  |weak|Weak_Interaction|  interactions within the Standard Model is based on  |gauge_symmetries|Gauge_Theory|  governed by the  |simple_symmetry_groups|Simple_Lie_Group|   and  which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the  |weak_hypercharge|Weak_Hypercharge|  interaction is described by an  |abelian_symmetry|Abelian_Group|   which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments. There are however certain constraints on the choice of particle charges from theoretical consistency, in particular  |anomaly_cancellation|Gauge_Anomaly| . The observed  |charge_quantization|Charge_Quantization| , namely the postulation that all known  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle|  carry electric charges which are exact multiples of ⅓ of the  |elementary_charge|Elementary_Charge| , has led to the idea that  |hypercharge|Hypercharge|  interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the  |fundamental_interactions|Fundamental_Interaction|  which we observe, in particular the  |weak_mixing_angle|Weak_Mixing_Angle| , Grand Unification ideally reduces the number of independent input parameters, but is also constrained by observations.     Grand Unification is reminiscent of the unification of electric and magnetic forces by  |Maxwells_theory_of_electromagnetism|Maxwell_Equations|  in the 19th century, but its physical implications and mathematical structure are qualitatively different.                            is the simplest GUT. The smallest  |simple_Lie_group|Simple_Lie_Group|  which contains the  |standard_model|Standard_Model| , and upon which the first Grand Unified Theory was based, is     : SU   SU  SU  U .     Such group symmetries allow the reinterpretation of several known particles as different states of a single particle field. However, it is not obvious that the simplest possible choices for the extended Grand Unified symmetry should yield the correct inventory of elementary particles. The fact that all currently known matter particles fit perfectly into three copies of the smallest  |group_representations|Group_Representation|  of  and immediately carry the correct observed charges, is one of the first and most important reasons why people believe that a Grand Unified Theory might actually be realized in nature.     The two smallest  |irreducible_representations|Group_Representationreducibility|  of  are  and . In the standard assignment, the  contains the  |charge_conjugates|Charge_Conjugation|  of the right-handed  |down-type_quark|Quark| |color|Quantum_Chromodynamics| |triplet|Triplet_State|  and a left-handed  |lepton|Lepton| |isospin|Isospin| |doublet|Doublet_State| , while the  contains the six  |up-type_quark|Quark|  components, the left-handed  |down-type_quark|Quark| |color|Quantum_Chromodynamics|  triplet, and the right-handed  |electron|Electron| . This scheme has to be replicated for each of the three known  |generations_of_matter|Generation| . It is notable that the theory is  |anomaly_free|Gauge_Anomaly|  with this matter content.     The hypothetical  |right-handed_neutrinos|Neutrinochirality|  are a singlet of , which means its mass is not forbidden by any symmetry; it doesnt need a spontaneous symmetry breaking which explains why its mass would be heavy. .                 The next simple Lie group which contains the standard model is     : SO  SU  SU  SU  U .     Here, the unification of matter is even more complete, since the  |irreducible|Group_Representation| |spinor|Spinor| |representation|Group_Representation|   contains both the  and  of  and a right-handed neutrino, and thus the complete particle content of one generation of the extended  |standard_model|Standard_Model|  with  |neutrino_masses|Neutrino| . This is already the largest  |simple_group|Simple_Group|  which achieves the unification of matter in a scheme involving only the already known matter particles .     Since different standard model fermions are grouped together in larger representations, GUTs specifically predict relations among the fermion masses, such as between the  |electron|Electron|  and the  |down_quark|Down_Quark| , the  |muon|Muon|  and the  |strange_quark|Strange_Quark| , and the  |tau_lepton|Tau_Lepton|  and the  |bottom_quark|Bottom_Quark|  for  and . Some of these mass relations hold approximately, but most dont .     The boson matrix for  is found by taking the  matrix from the  representation of  and adding an extra row and column for the right-handed neutrino. The bosons are found by adding a partner to each of the 20 charged bosons and adding an extra heavy neutral Z-boson to make 5 neutral bosons in total. The boson matrix will have a boson or its new partner in each row and column. These pairs combine to create the familiar 16D Dirac  |spinor|Spinor|  matrices of .          In some forms of  |string_theory|String_Theory| , including E 8   & times;  E 8  |heterotic_string_theory|Heterotic_String_Theory| , the resultant four-dimensional theory after spontaneous  |compactification|Compactification|  on a six-dimensional  |Calabi-Yau_manifold|Calabi-Yau_Manifold|  resembles a GUT based on the group  |E_6|E6| . Notably E 6 is the only  |exceptional_simple_Lie_group|Exceptional_Simple_Lie_Group|  to have any  |complex_representations|Complex_Representation| , a requirement for a theory to contain chiral fermions . Hence the other four  cant be the gauge group of a GUT.       Non-chiral extensions of the Standard Model with vectorlike split-multiplet particle spectra which naturally appear in the higher SU GUTs considerably modify the desert physics and lead to the realistic grand unification for conventional three quark-lepton families even without using  |supersymmetry|Supersymmetry|  . On the other hand, due to a new missing VEV mechanism emerging in the supersymmetric SU GUT the simultaneous solution to the gauge hierarchy problem and problem of unification of flavor can be found. J.L.Chkareuli, SU SUSY GUTS WITH STRING REMNANTS: MINIMAL SU AND BEYOND, Invited Talk given at 29th International Conference on High-Energy Physics , Vancouver, 23–29 July 1998. In Vancouver 1998, High energy physics, vol. 2 1669–73     GUTs with four families / generations, SU types of particles. These can be put into  representations of . This can be divided into  which is the  theory together with some heavy bosons which act on the generation number.     GUTs with four families / generations, O128 particles and anti-particles can be put into a single spinor representation of .       Symplectic gauge groups could also be considered. For example,   has a representation in terms of  quaternion unitary matrices which has a  dimensional real representation and so might be considered as a candidate for a gauge group.  has 32 charged bosons and 4 neutral bosons. Its subgroups include  so can at least contain the gluons and photon of . Although its probably not possible to have weak bosons acting on chiral fermions in this representation. A quaternion representation of the fermions might be:     :     e+i      ur+i      ug+i      ub+i            A further complication with  |quaternion|Quaternion|  representations of fermions is that there are two types of multiplication: left multiplication and right multiplication which must be taken into account. It turns out that including left and right-handed  quaternion matrices is equivalent to including a single right-multiplication by a unit quaternion which adds an extra SU and so has an extra neutral boson and two more charged bosons. Thus the group of left- and right-handed  quaternion matrices is  which does include the standard model bosons:     : SUL  HR Sp  SU   SU  SU   SU  SU  U     If   is a quaternion valued spinor, A  is quaternion hermitian  matrix coming from  and B  is a pure imaginary quaternion then the interaction term is:     ::           It can be noted that a generation of 16 fermions can be put into the form of an  |octonion|Octonion|  with each element of the octonion being an 8-vector. If the 3 generations are then put in a 3x3 hermitian matrix with certain additions for the diagonal elements then these matrices form an exceptional  |Jordan_algebra|Jordan_Algebra| , which has the symmetry group of one of the exceptional Lie groups depending on the details.     :     a & e &         & b &         &   & c         :   J3     Because they are fermions the anti-commutators of the Jordan algebra become commutators. It is known that E 6 has subgroup  and so is big enough to include the Standard Model. An E 8 gauge group, for example, would have 8 neutral bosons, 120 charged bosons and 120 charged anti-bosons. To account for the 248 fermions in the lowest multiplet of E 8 , these would either have to include anti-particles , have new undiscovered particles, or have gravity-like  bosons affecting elements of the particles spin direction. Each of these possess theoretical problems.       Other structures have been suggested including  |Lie_3-algebras|Lie_3-Algebra|  and  |Lie_superalgebras|Lie_Superalgebra| . Neither of these fit with  |Yang–Mills_theory|Yang–Mills_Theory| . In particular Lie superalgebras would introduce bosons with the wrong statistics.  |Supersymmetry|Supersymmetry|  however does fit with Yang–Mills. For example, N4 Super Yang Mills Theory requires an  gauge group.       The unification of forces is possible due to the energy scale dependence of force  |coupling_parameters|Coupling_Constant|  in  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory|  called  |renormalization_group_running|Renormalization_Group| , which allows parameters with vastly different values at usual energies to converge to a single value at a much higher energy scale.      The  |renormalization_group|Renormalization_Group|  running of the three gauge couplings in the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  has been found to nearly, but not quite, meet at the same point if the  |hypercharge|Hypercharge|  is normalized so that it is consistent with  or  GUTs, which are precisely the GUT groups which lead to a simple fermion unification. This is a significant result, as other Lie groups lead to different normalizations. However, if the  |supersymmetric|Supersymmetry|  extension  |MSSM|Minimal_Supersymmetric_Standard_Model|  is used instead of the Standard Model, the match becomes much more accurate. In this case, the coupling constants of the strong and electroweak interactions meet at the  |grand_unification_energy|Grand_Unification_Energy| , also known as the GUT scale:     :     10  .     It is commonly believed that this matching is unlikely to be a coincidence, and is often quoted as one of the main motivations to further investigate  |supersymmetric_theories|Supersymmetry|  despite the fact that no supersymmetric partner particles have been experimentally observed. Also, most model builders simply assume  |supersymmetry|Supersymmetry|  because it solves the  |hierarchy_problem|Hierarchy_Problem| —i.e., it stabilizes the electroweak  |Higgs_mass|Mssm_Higgs_Mass|  against  |radiative_corrections|Renormalization| .       Since  |Majorana|Majorana_Fermion|  masses of the right-handed neutrino are forbidden by  symmetry,  GUTs predict the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos to be close to the  |GUT_scale|Gut_Scale|  where the symmetry is  |spontaneously_broken|Spontaneous_Symmetry_Breaking|  in those models. In  |supersymmetric|Supersymmetry|  GUTs, this scale tends to be larger than would be desirable to obtain realistic masses of the light, mostly left-handed neutrinos  via the  |seesaw_mechanism|Seesaw_Mechanism| . These predictions are independent of the  |Georgi–Jarlskog_mass_relations|Georgi–Jarlskog_Mass_Relation| , wherein some GUTs predict other fermion mass ratios.       Several theories have been proposed, but none is currently universally accepted. An even more ambitious theory that includes all  |fundamental_forces|Fundamental_Interaction| , including  |gravitation|Gravitation| , is termed a  |theory_of_everything|Theory_Of_Everything| . Some common  |mainstream|Mainstream|  GUT models are:        |left-right_model|Left-Right_Model|  —   |Georgi–Glashow_model|Georgi–Glashow_Model|  —   |SO|So| |Flipped|Flipped_Su|  —   |Pati–Salam_model|Pati–Salam_Model|  —   |Flipped|Flipped_So|  —      |Trinification|Trinification|  —     |331_model|331_Model| |chiral_color|Chiral_Color|         Not quite GUTs:        |Technicolor_models|Technicolor| |Little_Higgs|Little_Higgs| |String_theory|String_Theory| |Causal_fermion_systems|Causal_Fermion_System| |M-theory|M-Theory| |Preons|Preon| |Loop_quantum_gravity|Loop_Quantum_Gravity| |Causal_dynamical_triangulation_theory|Causal_Dynamical_Triangulation|       Note |Lie_algebras|Lie_Algebra|  not to  |Lie_groups|Lie_Group| . The Lie group could be , just to take a random example.     The most promising candidate is .    does not contain any  |exotic_fermions|Exotic_Fermion|  , and it unifies each generation into a single  |irreducible_representation|Irreducible_Representation| . A number of other GUT models are based upon subgroups of . They are the minimal  |left-right_model|Left-Right_Model| , ,  |flipped|Flipped_Su|  and the  |Pati–Salam_model|Pati–Salam_Model| . The GUT group E 6 contains , but models based upon it are significantly more complicated. The primary reason for studying E 6 models comes from   |heterotic_string_theory|Heterotic_String_Theory| .     GUT models generically predict the existence of  |topological_defects|Topological_Defect|  such as  |monopoles|Magnetic_Monopoles| ,  |cosmic_strings|Cosmic_Strings| ,  |domain_walls|Domain_Wall| , and others. But none have been observed. Their absence is known as the  |monopole_problem|Monopole_Problem|  in  |cosmology|Physical_Cosmology| . Many GUT models also predict  |proton_decay|Proton_Decay| , although not the Pati–Salam model; proton decay has never been observed by experiments. The minimal experimental limit on the protons lifetime pretty much rules out minimal  and heavily constrains the other models. The lack of detected supersymmetry to date also constrains many models.      X boson in  X boson in flipped   GUT     Some GUT theories like  and  suffer from what is called the  |doublet-triplet_problem|Doublet-Triplet_Problem| . These theories predict that for each electroweak Higgs doublet, there is a corresponding  |colored|Color_Charge|  Higgs triplet field with a very small mass . In theory, unifying  |quarks|Quark|  with  |leptons|Lepton| , the Higgs doublet would also be unified with a Higgs triplet. Such triplets have not been observed. They would also cause extremely rapid proton decay and prevent the gauge coupling strengths from running together in the renormalization group.     Most GUT models require a threefold replication of the matter fields. As such, they do not explain why there are three generations of fermions. Most GUT models also fail to explain the  |little_hierarchy|Little_Hierarchy|  between the fermion masses for different generations.       A GUT model consists of a  |gauge_group|Gauge_Group|  which is a  |compact_Lie_group|Compact_Lie_Group| , a  |connection_form|Connection_Form|  for that Lie group, a  |Yang–Mills_action|Yang–Mills_Action|  for that connection given by an  |invariant|Invariant| |symmetric_bilinear_form|Symmetric_Bilinear_Form|  over its Lie algebra , a  |Higgs_sector|Higgs_Sector|  consisting of a number of scalar fields taking on values within real/complex  |representations|Representations_Of_Lie_Groups|  of the Lie group and chiral  |Weyl_fermions|Weyl_Fermion|  taking on values within a complex rep of the Lie group. The Lie group contains the  |Standard_Model_group|Standard_Model_Group|  and the Higgs fields acquire  |VEVs|Vev|  leading to a  |spontaneous_symmetry_breaking|Spontaneous_Symmetry_Breaking|  to the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model| . The Weyl fermions represent matter.       There is currently no hard evidence that nature is described by a Grand Unified Theory. The discovery of  |neutrino_oscillations|Neutrino_Oscillation|  indicates that the Standard Model is incomplete and has led to renewed interest toward certain GUT such as . One of the few possible experimental tests of certain GUT is  |proton_decay|Proton_Decay|  and also fermion masses. There are a few more special tests for supersymmetric GUT. However, minimum proton lifetimes from research have ruled out simpler GUTs and most non-SUSY models. The maximum upper limit on proton lifetime , is calculated at 6 x 10 39 years for SUSY models and 1.4 x 10 36 years for minimal non-SUSY GUTs. Pran Nath and Pavel Fileviez Perez, Proton Stability   in Grand Unified Theories, in Strings and in Branes , Appendix H; 23 April 2007. arXiv:hep-ph/0601023      The  |gauge_coupling|Gauge_Coupling|  strengths of  |QCD|Quantum_Chromodynamics| , the  |weak_interaction|Weak_Interaction|  and  |hypercharge|Hypercharge|  seem to meet at a common length scale called the  |GUT_scale|Grand_Unification_Energy|  and equal approximately to 10 16 GeV , which is somewhat suggestive. This interesting numerical observation is called the gauge coupling unification, and it works particularly well if one assumes the existence of  |superpartners|Superpartner|  of the Standard Model particles. Still it is possible to achieve the same by postulating, for instance, that ordinary .
