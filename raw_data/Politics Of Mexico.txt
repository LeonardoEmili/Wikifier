   The Politics of Mexico take place in a framework of a  |federal|Federation| |_presidential|Presidential_System| |_representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |_republic|Republic|  whose government is based on a  |congressional_system|Congressional_System| , whereby the  |President_of_Mexico|President_Of_Mexico|  is both  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and of a  |multi_party_system|Multi_Party_System| . The  |federal_government|Federal_Government_Of_Mexico|  represents the  |United_Mexican_States|Mexico|  and is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judicial, Anahis term as established by the  |Political_Constitution_of_the_United_Mexican_States|Constitution_Of_Mexico| , published in 1917. The  |constituent_states|State_Governments_Of_Mexico|  of the federation must also have a republican form of government based on a congressional system as established by their respective constitutions.     The  |executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the President, advised by a cabinet of secretaries that are independent of the legislature.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested upon the  |Congress_of_the_Union|Congress_Of_The_Union| , a two-chamber legislature comprising the  |Senate_of_the_Republic|Senate_Of_The_Republic|  and the  |Chamber_of_Deputies|Chamber_Of_Deputies| . Judicial power is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the  |Supreme_Court_of_Justice_of_the_Nation|Supreme_Court_Of_Justice_Of_The_Nation| , the Council of the Federal Judiciary and the collegiate, unitary and district tribunals.     The politics of Mexico are dominated by four political parties:  |Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|  ,  |National_Action_Party|National_Action_Party|  ,  |Party_of_the_Democratic_Revolution|Party_Of_The_Democratic_Revolution|  ,  and the  |National_Regeneration_Movement|National_Regeneration_Movement|  . Founded in  |1929|1929_In_Mexico|  as the Partido Nacional Revolucionario , PRI has dominated Mexican politics for over 70 years.  PAN was founded in  |1939|1939_In_Mexico| , but it did not win its first governorship until  |1989|1989_In_Mexico| ; its candidates won the presidency in  |2000|2000_In_Mexico|  and  |2006|2006_In_Mexico| .  The beginnings of PRD go back to  |1988|1988_In_Mexico|  when dissident members of PRI decided to challenge the leadership and nominated  |Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas|Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas|  for president of Mexico. Cardenas lost in a highly contested election, but a new political party was born and the party emerged as a third force in Mexican politics, even though they have never captured the presidency.  MORENA grew out of a dispute between  |Andrés_Manuel_López_Obrador|Andrés_Manuel_López_Obrador|  and other leaders of PRD after his loss in the  |2012|2012_In_Mexico|  presidential election. MORENA won its official recognition in  |2014|2014_In_Mexico| , and dominated the  |2018|2018_In_Mexico|  elections.      According to a survey by the  |National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico|National_Autonomous_University_Of_Mexico|  in 2017, 74 percent of Mexicans believe that Mexicos electoral system is not transparent and distrust official results              Constitutionally, political parties in Mexico must promote the participation of the people in the democratic life of the country, contribute in the representation of the nation and citizens, and be the access through which citizens can participate in public office, through whatever programs, principles and ideals they postulate.  All political parties must be registered with the  |National_Electoral_Institute|National_Electoral_Institute|  , the institution in charge of organizing and overseeing the federal electoral processes, and must obtain at least 2% of votes in the federal elections to keep their registry. Registered political parties receive public funding for their operation and can also obtain private funding within the limits prescribed by the law.   As of 2010 the following political parties are registered with the INE and all have representatives at the Congress of the Union:    |Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|  , founded in 1929;    |National_Action_Party|National_Action_Party|  , founded in 1939;    |Party_of_the_Democratic_Revolution|Party_Of_The_Democratic_Revolution|  , founded in 1989;    |Labor_Party|Labor_Party|  , founded in 1990;    |Green_Ecological_Party|Ecologist_Green_Party_Of_Mexico|  , founded in 1986, but lost its registration for two consecutive elections; it has retained its registration since 1993;    |Citizens’_Movement|Citizens_Movement|  , founded in 1997;    |New_Alliance|New_Alliance_Party|  , founded in 2005;    |National_Regeneration_Movement|National_Regeneration_Movement|  , founded in 2012;     Political parties are allowed to form alliances or coalitions to nominate candidates for any particular election. The coalition must identify itself with a particular name and logo. Proportional representation seats are assigned to the coalition based on the percentage of votes obtained in the elections, and then the coalition reassigns them to the constituent political parties. Once each party in the coalition has been assigned plurinominal seats, they do not necessarily continue to work as a coalition in government.     Throughout the 20th century, PRI had an almost hegemonic power at the state and federal level, which slowly began to recede in the late 1980s. Even though since the 1940s, PAN had won a couple of seats in the Congress, and in 1947 the first presidential municipality ,  it wasnt until 1989, that the first non-PRI state governor was elected . It was in 1997, that PRI lost its absolute majority at the Congress of the Union. In 2000 the first non-PRI president since 1929 was elected.               Suffrage is universal, free, secret and direct for all Mexican citizens 18 and older, and is compulsory .  The  |identity_document|Identity_Document|  in Mexico serves also as the voting card, so all citizens are automatically registered for all elections; that is, no pre-registration is necessary for every election. All elections are direct; that is, no electoral college is constituted for any of the elections at the federal, state or municipal level. Only when an incumbent president is absolutely absent , the Congress of the Union constitutes itself acts as an electoral college to elect an interim president by absolute majority.     Presidential elections are scheduled every six years, except in the exceptional case of absolute absence of the president. However, the term of the current president,  |Andrés_Manuel_López_Obrador|Andrés_Manuel_López_Obrador| , will be only 5 years, 10 months  due to a Constitutional change.  Legislative elections are scheduled every six years for the Senate, to be fully renewed in elections held concurrently with the presidential elections; and every three years for the Chamber of Deputies. Elections have traditionally been held on the first Sunday of July, but the new law means they will be held on the first Sunday in June instead. State governors are also elected every six years, except in  |Baja_California|Baja_California| , where the governor is elected for a two-year term.  The state legislatures are renewed every three years. State elections need not be concurrent with federal elections. Federal elections are organized and supervised by the autonomous public  |Federal_Electoral_Institute|Federal_Electoral_Institute| , whereas state and municipal elections are organized and supervised by electoral institutes constituted by each state of the federation. Elections within Mexico City are also organized by a local electoral institute.     A strongly ingrained concept in Mexican political life is no reelection. The theory was implemented after  |Porfirio_Díaz|Porfirio_Díaz|  managed to monopolize the presidency for over 25 years. Presently, Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term, and no one who has held the office even on a caretaker basis is allowed to hold the office again. Deputies and senators were not allowed to immediately succeed themselves until 2018; Both may now serve a maximum of 12 consecutive years.              Federal presidential elections were held on July 2, 2006 concurrent with the full renovation of both chambers of the Congress of the Union. In these elections the  |Party_of_the_Democratic_Revolution|Party_Of_The_Democratic_Revolution|  , the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  and  |Convergence|Convergence|  formed a coalition called  |Coalition_for_the_Good_of_All|Coalition_For_The_Good_Of_All| . The  |Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|  and the  |Ecologist_Green_Party|Ecologist_Green_Party_Of_Mexico|  formed a coalition called  |Alliance_for_Mexico|Alliance_For_Mexico| . The Federal Electoral Tribunal declared  |Felipe_Calderón|Felipe_Calderón|  the winner of the elections on September 5, and president-elect. He took office on December 1, 2006 and his term ended on November 30, 2012. The concurrent congressional elections were not contested by any party. Both chambers were completely renewed and no party obtained an absolute majority.          In 2012, Mexico elected  |Enrique_Peña_Nieto|Enrique_Peña_Nieto|  as President.          In 2018, Mexico elected  |Andrés_Manuel_López_Obrador|Andrés_Manuel_López_Obrador|  as President.             The elections in each state are done at different times, depending on the state, and are not necessarily held at the same time with the federal elections.  |PRI|Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|  governs 13 states:  |Campeche|Campeche| ,  |Coahuila|Coahuila| ,  |Colima|Colima| ,  |Guerrero|Guerrero| ,  |Hidalgo|Hidalgo| ,  |Jalisco|Jalisco| ,  |Mexico|State_Of_Mexico| ,  |Oaxaca|Oaxaca| ,  |San_Luis_Potosí|San_Luis_Potosí| ,  |Sinaloa|Sinaloa| ,  |Sonora|Sonora| ,  |Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala| ,  |Yucatán|Yucatán|  and  |Zacatecas|Zacatecas| .    |PAN|National_Action_Party|  governs 11 states:  |Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes| ,  |Baja_California|Baja_California| ,  |Baja_California_Sur|Baja_California_Sur| ,  |Chihuahua|Chihuahua| ,  |Durango|Durango| ,  |Guanajuato|Guanajuato| ,  |Nayarit|Nayarit| ,  |Puebla|Puebla| ,  |Querétaro|Querétaro| ,  |Tamaulipas|Tamaulipas| , and  |Veracruz|Veracruz| .    |PRD|Party_Of_The_Democratic_Revolution|  governs 4 states and Mexico City:  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City| ,  |Michoacán|Michoacán| ,  |Morelos|Morelos| ,  |Quintana_Roo|Quintana_Roo| , and  |Tabasco|Tabasco| .    |PVEM|Ecologist_Green_Party_Of_Mexico|  governs a state:  |Chiapas|Chiapas| .    |Nuevo_León|Nuevo_León|  is governed by the countrys first independent governor in modern Mexican history.          The  |Mexican_Revolution|Mexican_Revolution|  was followed by the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , which led to a severely fragmented society and very weak institutions.  In 1929, all factions and generals of the  |Mexican_Revolution|Mexican_Revolution|  were united into a single party, the National Revolutionary Party , with the aim of stabilizing the country and ending internal conflicts. During the following administrations, since 1928, many of the revolutionary ideals were put into effect, among them the free distribution of land to peasants and farmers, the nationalization of the oil companies, the birth and rapid growth of the Social Security Institute as well as that of Labor Unions, and the protection of national industries.     President  |Lázaro_Cárdenas|Lázaro_Cárdenas|  was fundamental to recover some of the social control that was lost during the Revolution and the following economic meltdown in the United States. However, Cárdenas was followed by a series of less-talented leaders that were unable to continue this path and establish an effective rule of law on Mexican society. Moreover, Cárdenas presidency happened before the UN focused on states as the rule in the 1940s and 1950s.      The NRP was later renamed the Mexican Revolution Party and finally the  |Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|Institutional_Revolutionary_Party| . The social institutions created by the party itself provided it with the necessary strength to stay in power. In time, the system gradually became, as some political scientists have labeled it, an electoral authoritarianism , Using the phrase of Schedler A From Electoral Authoritarianism to Democratic Consolidation in Mexicos Democracy at Work, Crandall R, Paz G, Roett R , Lyenne Reinner Publisher, Colorado USA in that the party resorted to any means necessary, except that of the dissolution of the constitutional and electoral system itself, to remain in power. In fact, Mexico was considered a bastion of continued constitutional government in times where  |coup_détats|Coup_Détat|  and military dictatorships were the norm in Latin America, in that the institutions were renovated electorally, even if only in appearance and with little participation of the opposition parties at the local level.     The lack of the establishment of a true democracy in Mexico can be partially explained many factors, like the ones described above. However, one of them could also be the oil reserves that exist in the country and that were nationalized by the Cárdenas government. Several empirical studies point to a correlation between the existence of natural resources and the difficulty of turning into a democracy. Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013.  Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University.     The first cracks in the system, even though they were merely symbolic, were the 1970s reforms to the electoral system and the composition of the Congress of the Union which for the first time incorporated proportional representation seats allowing opposition parties to obtain seats, though limited in number, in the Chamber of Deputies. As minority parties became involved in the system, they gradually demanded more changes, and a full democratic representation. Even though in the 1960s, a couple municipalities were governed by opposition parties, the first state government to be won by an opposition party was  |Baja_California|Baja_California| , in 1989.     Historically, there were important high-profile defections from the  |Institutional_Revolutionary_Party|Institutional_Revolutionary_Party| , like the ones of  |Juan_Andreu_Almazán|Juan_Andreu_Almazán|  ,  |Ezequiel_Padilla|Ezequiel_Padilla_Peñaloza|  ,  |Miguel_Henríquez_Guzmán|Miguel_Henríquez_Guzmán|  , and  |Cuahtémoc_Cárdenas|Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas|  , son of President Lázaro Cárdenas. These departures happened mainly because they opposed the presidential candidate nominations; however, only Cárdenas departure in 1988 resulted in the establishment of another political party .      The  |presidential_elections|1988_Mexican_General_Election|  held in 1988 marked a watershed in Mexican politics, as they were the first serious threat to the party in power by an opposition candidate:  |Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas|Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas| , who was nominated by a broad coalition of leftist parties. He officially received 31.1 percent of the vote, against 50.4 percent for  |Carlos_Salinas_de_Gortari|Carlos_Salinas_De_Gortari| , the PRI candidate, and 17 percent for  |Manuel_Clouthier|Manuel_Clouthier|  of the  |National_Action_Party|National_Action_Party|  . It was believed by some that Cardenas had won the election, but that the then government-controlled electoral commission had altered the results after the infamous the system crashed . In the concurrent elections, the PRI came within 11 seats of losing the majority of  |Chamber_of_Deputies|Chamber_Of_Deputies_Of_Mexico| , and opposition parties captured 4 of the 64  |Senate|Senate_Of_Mexico|  seats—the first time that the PRI had failed to hold every seat in the Senate. Capitalizing on the popularity of President Salinas, however, the PRI rebounded in the mid-term  |congressional_elections_of_1991|1991_Mexican_Legislative_Election| , winning 320 seats.     Subsequent changes included the creation of the Federal Electoral Institute in the 1990s and the inclusion of proportional representation and first minority seats in the Senate. The  |presidential_election_of_1994|1994_Mexican_General_Election|  was judged to be the first relatively free election in modern Mexican history.  |Ernesto_Zedillo|Ernesto_Zedillo|  of the PRI won with 50.2 percent of the vote, against 26.7 percent for  |Diego_Fernández_de_Cevallos|Diego_Fernández_De_Cevallos|  of PAN and 17.1 percent for Cardenas, who this time represented the  |Party_of_the_Democratic_Revolution|Party_Of_The_Democratic_Revolution|  . Although the opposition campaign was hurt by the desire of the Mexican electorate for stability, following the assassination of  |Luis_Donaldo_Colosio|Luis_Donaldo_Colosio|  and the recent outbreak of  |hostilities_in_the_state_of_Chiapas|Chiapas_Conflict| , Zedillos share of the vote was the lowest official percentage for any PRI presidential candidate up to that time.     In the  |1997_mid_term_elections|1997_Mexican_Legislative_Election| , no party held majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and in 2000 the first opposition party president was sworn in office since 1929.  |Vicente_Fox|Vicente_Fox|  won the election with 43% of the vote, followed by  |PRI|Partido_Revolucionario_Institucional|  candidate  |Francisco_Labastida|Francisco_Labastida|  with 36%, and  |Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas|Cuauhtémoc_Cárdenas|  of the  |Party_of_the_Democratic_Revolution|Party_Of_The_Democratic_Revolution|  with 17%.     Numerous electoral reforms implemented after 1989 aided in the opening of the Mexican political system, and opposition parties made historic gains in elections at all levels. Many of the current electoral concerns have shifted from outright fraud to campaign fairness issues. During 1995-96 the political parties negotiated constitutional amendments to address these issues. Implementing legislation included major points of consensus that had been worked out with the opposition parties. The thrust of the new laws has public financing predominate over private contributions to political parties, tighter procedures for auditing the political parties, and strengthening the authority and independence of electoral institutions. The court system also was given greatly expanded authority to hear civil rights cases on electoral matters brought by individuals or groups. In short, the extensive reform efforts have leveled the playing field for the parties.     The  |2006_elections|2006_Mexican_Elections|  saw the PRI fall to third place behind both the PAN and the PRD.  |Roberto_Madrazo|Roberto_Madrazo| .
