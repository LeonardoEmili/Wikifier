Abercromby was the eldest son of Mary Dundas , daughter of Ralph Dundas of Manour,  |Perthshire|Perthshire|  and George Abercromby of  |Tullibody|Tullibody|  House,  |Clackmannanshire|Clackmannanshire| . He was brother of the advocate  |Alexander_Abercromby_Lord_Abercromby|Alexander_Abercromby_Lord_Abercromby|  and  |General_Robert_Abercromby|Robert_Abercromby_Of_Airthrey| . He was born at  |Menstrie_Castle|Menstrie_Castle|  in  |Clackmannanshire|Clackmannanshire| .  |Chambers_Biographical_Dictionary|Chambers_Biographical_Dictionary| , , page 4     Abercrombys education was begun by a private tutor, then continued at the school of Mr Moir in  |Alloa|Alloa| , then considered one of the best in Scotland despite its Jacobite leanings. After passing some time there, Ralph was sent to  |Rugby_School|Rugby_School| , where he remained until he was 18. He then became a student at the  |University_of_Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh| . There he studied moral and natural philosophy and civil law, and was regarded by his professors as sound rather than brilliant.  He completed his studies at  |Leipzig_University|Leipzig_University|  in Germany, from 1754, taking more detailed studies in  |civil_law|Civil_Law|  with a view to a career as an  |advocate|Advocate| .        Abercromby was a  |Freemason|Freemasonry| . He was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in Lodge  |Canongate|Canongate|  Kilwinning, No. 2, on 25 May 1753. History of Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2. Compiled from the Records, 1677-1888. P.237. By Allan MacKenzie. Edinburgh. Published 1888.       On returning from the continent, Abercromby expressed a strong preference for the military profession, and a  |cornets|Cornet|  commission was accordingly obtained for him in the  |3rd_Dragoon_Guards|3Rd_Dragoon_Guards| . He served with his regiment in the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War| , and thus, the opportunity afforded him of studying the methods of  |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_Ii_Of_Prussia| , which moulded his military character and formed his tactical ideas.      Abercromby rose through the intermediate grades to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the regiment and  |brevet|Brevet|  colonel in 1780, and in 1781, he became colonel of the newly raised  |Kings_Irish_infantry|103Rd_Regiment_Of_Foot| . When that regiment was disbanded in 1783, he retired on  |half_pay|Half_Pay| . He also entered Parliament as MP for  |Clackmannanshire|Clackmannanshire|  .      Abercromby was a strong supporter of the American cause in the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| , and remained in Ireland to avoid having to fight against the colonists. David Andress, The Savage Storm: Britain on me Brink in the Age of Napoleon p 61     When France declared war against Great Britain in 1793, Abercromby resumed his duties. He was appointed command of a brigade under the  |Duke_of_York|Prince_Frederick_1St_Duke_Of_York_And_Albany|  for service in the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at  |Le_Cateau|Le_Cateau_Cambrésis| . During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at  |Boxtel|Battle_Of_Boxtel|  and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the  |Waal|Waal| . In 1795, he was appointed a  |Knight_of_the_Bath|Order_Of_The_Bath|  for his services.     That same year, he was appointed to succeed  |Sir_Charles_Grey|Charles_Grey_1St_Earl_Grey|  as commander-in-chief of the British forces in the  |West_Indies|West_Indies| . In 1796,  |Grenada|Grenada|  was suddenly attacked and taken by a detachment of the army under his orders. Afterwards, Abercromby secured possession of the settlements of  |Demerara|Demerara|  and  |Essequibo|Essequibo|  in South America, the islands of  |Saint_Lucia|Saint_Lucia| ,  |Saint_Vincent|Saint_Vincent|  and  |Trinidad|Trinidad| . A  |major_assault|Battle_Of_San_Juan|  on the port of  |San_Juan|Battle_Of_San_Juan| ,  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico| , in April 1797 failed  after fierce fighting where both sides suffered heavy losses.             Abercromby returned to Europe and, in reward for his services, was appointed colonel of the  |2nd_Regiment_of_Dragoons|Royal_Scots_Greys| . He was also made  |Lieutenant_Governor_of_the_Isle_of_Wight|Lieutenant_Governor_Of_The_Isle_Of_Wight| ,  |Governor_of_Fort_George_and_Fort_Augustus|Governor_Of_Fort_George_And_Fort_Augustus|  in the Scottish Highlands, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-general. He again entered Parliament as member for Clackmannanshire from 1796 to 1798. From 1797 to 1798, he was Commander-in-Chief of the forces in  |Ireland|Ireland| .     To quote the biographic entry in the 1888 Encyclopædia Britannica,      After holding for a short period the office of  |commander_in_chief_in_Scotland|Commander_In_Chief_In_Scotland| , Abercromby, when the enterprise against the Dutch  |Batavian_Republic|Batavian_Republic|  was resolved upon in 1799, was again called to command under the Duke of York. The  |Anglo_Russian_invasion_of_Holland|Anglo_Russian_Invasion_Of_Holland|  in 1799 ended in disaster, but friend and foe alike confessed that the most decisive victory could not have more conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer.     In 1801, Abercromby was sent with an army to recover  |Egypt_from_France|Battle_Of_Alexandria| . His experience in the Netherlands and the West Indies particularly fitted him for this new command, as was proved when he carried his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies to the destined scene of action despite great difficulties. The debarkation of the troops at  |Abukir|Abukir| , in the face of strenuous opposition, is justly ranked among the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army.               In 1800 Abercromby commanded the expedition to the Mediterranean, and after some brilliant operations defeated the French in the  |Battle_of_Alexandria|Battle_Of_Alexandria| , 21 March 1801. During the action he was struck by a musket-ball in the thigh; but not until the battle was won and he saw the enemy retreating did he show any sign of pain. He was borne from the field in a hammock, cheered by the blessings of the soldiers as he passed, and conveyed on board the flag-ship  |HMS_Foudroyant|Hms_Foudroyant|  which was moored in the harbour. The ball could not be extracted; mortification ensued, and seven days later, on 28 March 1801, he died.      Abercrombys old friend and commander, the Duke of York, paid tribute to Abercrombys memory in general orders: His steady observance of discipline, his ever-watchful attention to the health and wants of his troops, the persevering and unconquerable spirit which marked his military career, the splendour of his actions in the field and the heroism of his death, are worthy the imitation of all who desire, like him, a life of heroism and a death of glory. He was buried on St Johns Bastion within  |Fort_Saint_Elmo|Fort_Saint_Elmo|  in  |Valletta|Valletta| ,  |Malta|Malta| . The British military renamed it Abercrombies Bastion in his honour.  The adjacent curtain wall linking this bastion to the  |fortifications_of_Valletta|Fortifications_Of_Valletta| , originally called Santa Ubaldesca Curtain, was also renamed Abercrombies Curtain.          By a vote of the House of Commons, a monument was erected in Abercrombys honour in  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|St_Pauls_Cathedral|  in  |London|London| . His widow was created Baroness Abercromby of Tullibody and Aboukir Bay, and a pension of £2,000 a year was settled on her and her two successors in the title.     Abercromby Place in  |Edinburghs_New_Town|New_Town_Edinburgh|  is named in his honour.       On 17 November 1767, Abercromby married  |Mary_Anne|Mary_Anne_Menzies| , daughter of  |John_Menzies|John_Menzies|  and Ann, daughter of Patrick Campbell.  cites   cites  They had seven children.
