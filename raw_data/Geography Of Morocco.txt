The strait of Gibraltar separates Spain off Morocco with a  span of water. Morocco borders the  |North_Atlantic_Ocean|North_Atlantic_Ocean|  to the west, and the west  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea|  to the north.     The terrain of  |Morocco|Morocco|  is largely mountainous. The  |Atlas_Mountains|Atlas_Mountains|  stretch from the central north to the south west. It expands to about  and is the dorsal spine of the country. To the north of the  |Atlas_Mountains|Atlas_Mountains| , there are the  |Rif_Mountains|Rif_Mountains| , a chain that makes part of the  |Sierra_Nevada|Sierra_Nevada|  mountain range in Andalusia, Spain. The massive range expands to about  from  |Tangier|Tangier|  in the west to  |Nador|Nador|  eastward.     In the west of the country, along the Atlantic coast, the Moroccan Plateau stretches from Tangier to Lagouira, about  long, and get inward to Saiss Plains near  |Fes|Fes|  and Tansift-Alhaouz near  |Marrakech|Marrakech| . These vast plains promotes fertile agricultural lands and support 15% of the local economy.     In the extreme South-East of the country, the lands are arid, due to their proximity to the Sahara desert . Palm trees oasis are developed in many regions, notably in  |Figuig|Figuig|  and  |Zagora|Mount_Zagora| .        |Coordinates|Geographic_Coordinates|      Areatotal:   446,550  km² , 712,550  km²    land:   446,300  km²   water:   250  km²     Area – comparative:   Morocco without  |Western_Sahara|Western_Sahara|  is slightly larger than  |California|California| ; slightly larger than  |Newfoundland_and_Labrador|Newfoundland_And_Labrador| ; slightly more than half the size of  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales|  province of Australia; slightly less than twice the size of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| .

In the southeast, the climate is arid, and poorly populated. In the northwest the climate is temperate and akin to the climatic conditions that prevail in the Iberian Peninsula. 95% of Moroccan population lives in these regions.     The largely populated areas of the northwest of the country is predominantly Mediterranean, but since the country is heavily mountainous,  |continental|Continental_Climate|  and  |alpine|Alpine_Climate|  influence is evident, as well as the  |oceanic|Oceanic_Climate|  influence along the Atlantic coastline. And finally, the semi-arid lands, that cover few regions in the northeast, the central south and the southwest.     Along the Mediterranean coast, the climate is typically Mediterranean and supports all types of typical Mediterranean vegetation. The summers are moderately hot and the winters are mild. Further away from the coast, into the Rif Mountain range, the climate starts to become more continental in character, with colder winters and hotter summers. At elevations above , the climate is alpine with warm summers and cold winters. Rainfall is much higher on the west side, than it is on the east side. The average annual precipitation is between , and  respectively. Snow is abundant at higher elevations.     Typical Mediterranean climate cities:  |Tangier|Tangier| ,  |Tétouan|Tétouan| ,  |Al_Hoceima|Al_Hoceima| ,  |Nador|Nador|    Typical continental-influenced cities:  |Chefchaouen|Chefchaouen| ,  |Issaguen|Issaguen| ,  |Targuist|Targuist| ,  |Taza|Taza|    Typical alpine-influenced cities:  |Bab_Berred|Bab_Berred|      Along the Atlantic coast, the climate is Mediterranean with an oceanic influence. The imprint of the oceanic climate differs along the coastline from region to region. It is generally presented from  |Asilah|Asilah|  to  |Essaouira|Essaouira| . The summers are warm to moderately hot, and winters are cooler than in the Mediterranean coast. Further away from the coastal lands, into the Atlas Mountain range, the climate starts to become more continental in character, with colder winters and hotter summers. At elevations above , the climate is typically alpine, with warm summers and cold winters. Rainfall is generally high. The average annual precipitations is between  on the north, but as you move southward, the average drops by about . Snow is abundant at higher elevations. There are two ski stations, one in the middle-Atlas  |Mischliffen|Mischliffen| , and the other in the High-Atlas  |Oukaïmeden|Oukaïmeden| .     Typical oceanic-influenced cities:  |Rabat|Rabat| ,  |Casablanca|Casablanca| ,  |Essaouira|Essaouira| ,  |Larache|Larache|    Typical continental-influenced cities:  |Fès|Fès| ,  |Meknès|Meknès| ,  |Khenifra|Khenifra| ,  |Beni_Mellal|Beni_Mellal|    Typical alpine-influenced cities:  |Ifrane|Ifrane| ,  |Azrou|Azrou| ,  |Midelt|Midelt| ,  |Imouzzer_Kandar|Imouzzer_Kandar|      The southern regions of the northwest are Semi-arid influenced. Rainfall is lower, and is between  annually. Although temperature ranges generally do not change in comparison with the upper provinces, a slight increase in high averages is not to be dismissed. Largely due to the lower latitudes where they fall.     Typical cities with such climate are  |Agadir|Agadir|  and  |Marrakesh|Marrakesh| .     The disputed  |Western_Sahara|Western_Sahara|  region features a  |hot_desert_climate|Hot_Desert_Climate| , but temperatures are more moderate along the coast.          The northern coast and interior are mountainous with large areas of bordering plateaus, intermontane valleys, and rich coastal plains. The northern mountains are geologically unstable and subject to earthquakes.     Morocco occupies a strategic location along the  |Strait_of_Gibraltar|Strait_Of_Gibraltar| , the waterway between the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.
