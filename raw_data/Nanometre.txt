      The nanometre  or nanometer  is a  |unit|Units_Of_Measurement|  of  |length|Length|  in the  |metric_system|Metric_System| , equal to one billionth  of a  |metre|Metre|  . The name combines the  |SI_prefix|Si_Prefix|  nano-  with the parent unit name metre . It can be written in  |scientific_notation|Scientific_Notation|  as , in  |engineering_notation|Engineering_Notation|  as , and as simply  metres. When used as a  |prefix|Prefix|  for something other than a unit of measure , nano refers to  |nanotechnology|Nanotechnology| , or phenomena typically occurring on a scale of nanometres .     The nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale: the diameter of a  |helium|Helium|  atom, for example, is about 0.06  nm, and that of a  |ribosome|Ribosome|  is about 20  nm. The nanometre is also commonly used to specify the  |wavelength|Wavelength|  of  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  near the visible part of the  |spectrum|Electromagnetic_Spectrum| https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069746Plasmonicpumpprobemethodtostudysemi-transparentnanofluids?evprfpub Plasmonic pump – probe method to study semi-transparent nanofluids, Applied Optics, 52:6041-6050 The  |ångström|Ångström| , which is equal to 0.1  nm, was formerly used for these purposes, but is still used in other fields.     Since the late 1980s, in usages such as the  |32_nm|32_Nanometer|  and the  |22_nm|22_Nanometer| |semiconductor_node|Semiconductor_Node| , it has also been used to describe typical feature sizes in successive generations of the  |ITRS_Roadmap|Internationaltechnologyroadmapforsemiconductors|  for  |miniaturization|Semiconductor_Device_Fabrication|  in the  |semiconductor_industry|Semiconductor_Industry| .       The nanometre was formerly known as the millimicrometre  – or, more commonly, the millimicron for short  – since it is  of a  |micron|Micron|  , and was often denoted by the symbol mµ or  as µµ.
