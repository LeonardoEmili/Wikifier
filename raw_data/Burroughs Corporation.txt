     The Burroughs Corporation was a major American manufacturer of business equipment. The company was founded in 1886 as the  |American_Arithmometer_Company|American_Arithmometer_Company| , and after the 1986 merger with  |Sperry_UNIVAC|Univac|  was renamed  |Unisys|Unisys| . The companys history paralleled many of the major developments in  |computing|History_Of_Computing| . At its start, it produced mechanical  |adding_machines|Adding_Machine| , and later moved into programmable ledgers and then computers. It was one of the largest producers of  |mainframe_computers|Mainframe_Computer|  in the world, also producing related equipment including  |typewriters|Typewriter|  and  |printers|Printer| .                In 1886, the American Arithmometer Company was established in  |St_Louis|St_Louis| ,  |Missouri|Missouri| , to produce and sell an  |adding_machine|Adding_Machine|  invented by  |William_Seward_Burroughs|William_Seward_Burroughs_I|  . In 1904, six years after Burroughs death, the company moved to Detroit and changed its name to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. It was soon the biggest adding machine company in America.         The adding machine range began with the basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design included some revolutionary features, foremost of which was the  |dashpot|Dashpot| . The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 provided a moveable carriage, and the P600 and top-of-the-range P612 offered some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the J series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the c series of both manual and electrical assisted  |comptometers|Comptometer| . In the late 1960s, the Burroughs sponsored  |_nixi_tube_|Nixie_Tube|  provided an electronic display calculator. Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the Sensimatic, which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain  |ledgers|General_Ledger| . It could store 9, 18 or 27  |balances|Trial_Balance|  during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the Sensitronic which could store balances on a  |magnetic_stripe|Magnetic_Stripe_Card|  which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which were computer systems supporting card reader/punches and a  |line_printer|Line_Printer| .     Later, Burroughs was selling more than adding machines, including typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953: the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burroughs purchase in June 1956, of the  |ElectroData_Corporation|Electrodata_Corporation|  in  |Pasadena_California|Pasadena_California| , a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments and had a cooperative relationship with  |Caltech|California_Institute_Of_Technology|  in Pasadena. Sawyer, T.J.,  ElectroData had built the  |Datatron_205|Datatron|  and was working on the Datatron 220. The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the L and TC series range was produced  which had a  |golf_ball_printer|Ibm_Selectric_Typewriter|  and in the beginning a 1K disk  |memory|Computer_Memory| . These were popular as branch  |terminals|Computer_Terminal|  to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, and sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.       Burroughs was one of the nine major United States computer companies in the 1960s, with  |IBM|Ibm|  the largest,  |Honeywell|Honeywell| ,  |NCR_Corporation|Ncr_Corporation| ,  |Control_Data_Corporation|Control_Data_Corporation|  ,  |General_Electric|General_Electric|  ,  |Digital_Equipment_Corporation|Digital_Equipment_Corporation|  ,  |RCA|Rca|  and  |Sperry_Rand|Sperry_Rand|  . In terms of sales, Burroughs was always a distant second to  |IBM|Ibm| . In fact, IBMs market share was so much larger than all of the others that this group was often referred to as IBM and the Seven Dwarfs.    By 1972 when GE and RCA were no longer in the mainframe business, the remaining five companies behind IBM became known as the  |BUNCH|Bunch| , an  |acronym|Acronym|  based on their initials.     At the same time, Burroughs was very much a competitor. Like IBM, Burroughs tried to supply a complete line of products for its customers, including Burroughs-designed printers,  |disk_drives|Disk_Drive| ,  |tape_drives|Tape_Drive| , computer printing paper, and even  |typewriter_ribbons|Typewriter_Ribbon| .     In the 1950s, Burroughs worked with the  |Federal_Reserve_Bank|Federal_Reserve_Bank|  on the development and computer processing of  |magnetic_ink_character_recognition|Magnetic_Ink_Character_Recognition|  especially for the processing of bank cheques. Burroughs made special MICR/OCR sorter/readers which attached to their medium systems line of computers  and this entrenched the company in the computer side of the banking industry.       The Burroughs Corporation developed three highly innovative  |architectures|Computer_Architecture| , based on the design philosophy of  |language_directed_design|Language_Directed_Design|  . Their machine instruction sets favored one or many  |high_level_programming_languages|High_Level_Programming_Languages| , such as  |ALGOL|Algol| ,  |COBOL|Cobol|  or  |FORTRAN|Fortran| . All three architectures were considered  |mainframe|Mainframe_Computer|  class machines:   The  |Burroughs_large_systems|Burroughs_Large_Systems|  machines started with the B5000 in 1961. The B5500 came a few years later when large rotating disks replaced drums as the main external memory media. These B5000 Series systems used the worlds first virtual memory multi-programming operating system. They were followed by the B6500/B6700 in the later 1960s, the B7700 in the mid 1970s, and the A series in the 1980s. The underlying architecture of these machines is similar and continues today as the  |Unisys|Unisys|  ClearPath MCP line of computers:  |stack_machines|Stack_Machine|  designed to be programmed in an extended  |Algol_60|Algol_60| . Their  |operating_systems|Operating_System| , called MCP , were programmed in  |ESPOL|Executive_Systems_Problem_Oriented_Language|  , and later in NEWP almost a decade before  |Unix|Unix| . The command interface developed into a compiled  |structured_language|Structured_Programming|  with declarations, statements and procedures called WFL . Many  |computer_scientists|Computer_Scientist|  consider these series of computers to be technologically groundbreaking. Stack oriented processors, with 48 bit word length where each word was defined as data or program contributed significantly to a secure operating environment, long before  |spyware|Spyware|  and  |viruses|Computer_Virus|  affected computing. And the modularity of these large systems was also unique: multiple  |CPUs|Cpu| , multiple memory modules and multiple  |I_O|I_O|  and Data Comm processors permitted incremental and  |cost_effective|Cost_Effective|  growth of system performance and reliability. In industries like banking, where continuous operations was mandatory, Burroughs large systems penetrated most every large bank, including the  |Federal_Reserve_Bank|Federal_Reserve_Bank| . Burroughs built the backbone  |switching_systems|Switching_Systems|  for  |Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication|Society_For_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication|  which sent its first message in 1977. Unisys is still the provider to SWIFT today.   Burroughs produced the  |B2500|Burroughs_B2500|  or medium systems computers aimed primarily at the business world. The machines were designed to execute  |COBOL|Cobol|  efficiently. This included a BCD  based arithmetic unit, storing and addressing the main memory using  |base_10|Base_10|  numbering instead of  |binary|Binary_Numeral_System| . The designation for these systems was Burroughs B2500 through B49xx, followed by Unisys V-Series V340 through V560.   Burroughs produced the  |B1700|Burroughs_B1700|  or small systems computers that were designed to be  |microprogram|Microprogram| med, with each process potentially getting its own  |virtual_machine|Virtual_Machine|  designed to be the best match to the  |programming_language|Programming_Language|  chosen for the program being run.   The smallest general-purpose computers were the B700 microprocessors which were used both as stand-alone systems and as special-purpose data-communications or disk-subsystem controllers.   Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of  |accounting_machines|Accounting_Machine|  including both stand-alone systems such as the  |Sensimatic|Burroughs_Sensimatic| , L500 and B80, and dedicated terminals including the TC500 and specialised check processing equipment.    In 1982, Burroughs began producing  |personal_computers|Personal_Computer| , the B20 and B25 lines with the  |Intel_8086|Intel_8086| / |8088|Intel_8088|  family of 16-bit chips as the processor. , 1987 These ran the  |BTOS|Convergent_Technologies_Operating_System|  operating system, which Burroughs licensed from  |Convergent_Technologies|Convergent_Technologies| . These machines implemented an early  |Local_Area_Network|Local_Area_Network|  to share a  |hard_disk|Hard_Disk|  between  |workgroup|Workgroup|  users. These microcomputers were later manufactured in  |Kunming|Kunming| ,  |China|China|  for use in China under agreement with Burroughs. , The New York Times,  |AP|Associated_Press|  story, January 3, 1985   Burroughs collaborated with  |University_of_Illinois|University_Of_Illinois|  on a multiprocessor architecture developing the  |ILLIAC_IV|Illiac_Iv|  computer in the early 1960s. The ILLIAC had up to 128 parallel processors while the B6700 & B7700 only accommodated a total of 7 CPUs and/or IO units .   Burroughs made military computers, such as the D825 , in its Great Valley Laboratory in  |Paoli_Pennsylvania|Paoli_Pennsylvania| . , archived at SMECC  The D825 was, according to some scholars, the first true multiprocessor computer.  Paoli was also home to the Defense and Space Group Marketing Division.  , Defense and Space Group Marketing Division, Paoli, Pennsylvania, 1965   In 1964 Burroughs had also completed the D830 which was another variation of the D825 designed specifically for real-time applications, such as airline reservations. Burroughs designated it the B8300 after  |Trans_World_Airlines|Trans_World_Airlines|  ordered one in September 1965. A system with three instruction processors was installed at TWAs reservations center in  |Rockleigh_New_Jersey|Rockleigh_New_Jersey|  in 1968. The system, which was called George, with an application programmed in  |JOVIAL|Jovial| , was intended to support some 4000 terminals, but the system experienced repeated crashes due to a filing system disk allocation error when operating under a large load. A fourth processor was added but did nothing to resolve the problem. The problem was resolved in late 1970 and the system became stable. Unfortunately, the decision to cancel the project was being made at the very time that the problem was resolved. TWA cancelled the project and acquired one  |IBM_System_360|Ibm_System_360|  Model 75, two IBM System/360 model 65s, and IBMs  |PARS|Programmed_Airline_Reservations_System|  software for its reservations system. TWA sued Burroughs for non-fulfillment of the contract, but Burroughs counter-sued, stating that the basic system did work and that the problems were in TWAs applications software. The two companies reached an out-of-court settlement.    Burroughs developed a half-size version of the D825 called the D82, cutting the word size from 48 to 24 bits and simplifying the computers instruction set. The D82 could have up to 32,768 words of core memory and continued the use of separate instruction and i/o processors. Burroughs sold a D82 to  |Air_Canada|Air_Canada|  to handle reservations for trips originating in  |Montreal|Montreal|  and  |Quebec|Quebec| . This design was further refined and made much more compact as the  |D84|Pershingmissilebibliographyburroughs|  machine which was completed in 1965. A D84 processor/memory unit with 4096 words of memory occupied just 1.4 cubic feet. This system was used successfully in two military projects: field test systems used to check the electronics of the Air Force  |General_Dynamics_F_111_Aardvark|General_Dynamics_F_111_Aardvark|  fighter plane and systems used to control the countdown and launch of the Armys  |Pershing_1|Pershing_1|  and  |1a|Pershing_1A|  missile systems.  , University of Minnesota archives       In September 1986, Burroughs Corporation merged with  |Sperry_Corporation|Sperry_Corporation|  to form  |Unisys|Unisys| . For a time, the combined company retained the Burroughs processors as the A- and V-systems lines. However, as the market for large systems shifted from proprietary architectures to common servers, the company eventually dropped the V-Series line, although customers continued to use V-series systems .  Unisys continues to develop and market the A-Series, now known as ClearPath.               In 2010, Unisys sold off its Payment Systems Division to  |Marlin_Equity_Partners|Marlin_Equity_Partners| , a California-based private investment firm, which incorporated it as Burroughs Payment Systems based in  |Plymouth_Michigan|Plymouth_Michigan| .  , Burroughs press release, February 3, 2010.
