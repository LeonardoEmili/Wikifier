Guam is an  |organized_unincorporated_territory|Government_Of_Guam|  of the  |United_States|United_States|  with policy relations between Guam and the US under the jurisdiction of the  |Office_of_Insular_Affairs|Office_Of_Insular_Affairs| .       The economy of Guam is greatly dependent on the U.S. military bases there. The U.S. connection also contributes to Guams status as a Japanese tourist destination. Some assume the Guamanian population is sympathetic toward the United States, based on common tribulations during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , and on relations with the U.S. military since.     However, maintenance of the status quo vis-à-vis the current political relationship between the territory and the United States is not without controversy. There is a significant movement in favor of the Territory becoming a  |commonwealth|Commonwealth| , which would give it a political status similar to  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico|  and the  |Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands| . Competing movements exist, which advocate political independence from the United States, statehood, or a combination with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single territory . These proposals, however, are not seen as favorable by the U.S. federal government, which argues Guam does not have the financial stability or self-sufficiency to warrant such status. They cite Guam’s increasing reliance on Federal spending as evidence, and question how commonwealth status or statehood would benefit the United States as a whole.     A portion of the people on Guam favor a modified version of the current Territorial status, involving greater autonomy from the federal government . Perceived indifference by the U.S. Congress regarding a change-of-status petition submitted by Guam has led many to feel that the territory is being deprived of the benefits of a more equitable union with the United States..
