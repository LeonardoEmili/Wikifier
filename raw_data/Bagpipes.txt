           Bagpipes are a  |woodwind_instrument|Woodwind_Instrument|  using enclosed  |reeds|Reed|  fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. The Scottish  |Great_Highland_bagpipes|Great_Highland_Bagpipe|  are the best known in the  |Anglophone_world|Anglophone_World| ; however, bagpipes have been played for a millennium or more throughout large parts of  |Europe|Europe| ,  |northern_Africa|Northern_Africa| , and  |western_Asia|Western_Asia| , including  |Anatolia|Anatolia| , the  |Caucasus|Caucasus| , and around the  |Persian_Gulf|Persian_Gulf| . The term bagpipe is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as the pipes , a set of pipes or a stand of pipes .                   A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a  |chanter|Chanter| , and usually at least one  |drone|Drone| . Many bagpipes have more than one drone in various combinations, held in place in stocks—sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.       The most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a  |non_return_valve|Non_Return_Valve|  that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.     An innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a  |bellows|Bellows|  to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called  |cauld_wind_pipes|Cauld_Wind_Pipes|  , air is not heated or moistened by the players breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish  |uilleann_pipes|Uilleann_Pipes| ; the  |border_or_Lowland_pipes|Border_Pipes| ,  |Scottish_smallpipes|Scottish_Smallpipes| ,  |Northumbrian_smallpipes|Northumbrian_Smallpipes| ,  |pastoral_pipes|Pastoral_Pipes|  in Britain; and the  |musette_de_cour|Musette_De_Cour| , the  |musette_bechonnet|Musette_Bechonnet|  and the  |cabrette|Cabrette|  in France, the  |Dudy_wielkopolskie|Dudy_Wielkopolskie| ,  |koziol_bialy|Koziol_Bialy|  and  |koziol_czarny|Koziol_Czarny|  in Poland.       The bag is an airtight  |reservoir|Reservoir|  that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including  |Gore_Tex|Gore_Tex|  have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of  |lung_infection|Respiratory_Tract_Infection| .  An advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.     Bags cut from larger materials are usually  |saddle_stitched|Saddle_Stitch|  with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched or glued to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.          The chanter is the  |melody|Melody|  pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, in the Balkans, and in Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.     The chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant,  |legato|Legato|  sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes  have closed ends or stop the end on the players leg, so that when the player closes the chanter becomes silent.     A  |practice_chanter|Practice_Chanter|  is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.     The term chanter is derived from the Latin cantare, or to sing , much like the modern French word  chanteur .       The note from the chanter is produced by a  |reed|Reed|  installed at its top. The reed may be a  |single|Single_Reed_Instrument|  or  |double_reed|Double_Reed|  . Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.          Most bagpipes have at least one  |drone|Drone| Oxford History of Music says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a  |Hittite|Hittites|  slab at  |Euyuk|Euyuk|  in Anatolia, dated to 1000 BC. Several authors identify the  |ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  askaulos  with the bagpipe.  In the 2nd century AD,  |Suetonius|Suetonius|  described the Roman emperor  |Nero|Nero|  as a player of the tibia utricularis.   |Dio_Chrysostom|Dio_Chrysostom|  wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign who could play a pipe  with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit.                In the early part of the second millennium, definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography. The  |Cantigas_de_Santa_Maria|Cantigas_De_Santa_Maria| , written in  |Galician_Portuguese|Galician_Portuguese|  and compiled in  |Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile|  in the mid-13th century, depicts several types of bagpipes.  Several illustrations of bagpipes also appear in the Chronique dite de Baudoin d’Avesnes, a 13th-century manuscript of northern French origin. Chronique dite de Baudoin dAvesnes, Arras, BM, ms. 0863, f. 007, 126v, 149v  Although evidence of bagpipes in the British Isles prior to the 14th century is contested, they are explicitly mentioned in  The Canterbury Tales  :         Bagpipes were also frequent subjects for carvers of wooden choir stalls in the late 15th and early 16th century throughout Europe, sometimes with animal musicians.      Actual examples of bagpipes from before the 18th century are extremely rare; however, a substantial number of paintings, carvings, engravings, manuscript illuminations, and so on survive. They make it clear that bagpipes varied hugely throughout Europe, and even within individual regions. Many examples of early folk bagpipes in continental Europe can be found in the paintings of Brueghel, Teniers, Jordaens, and Durer.         The first clear reference to the use of the Scottish  |Highland_bagpipes|Highland_Bagpipes|  is from a French history, which mentions their use at the  |Battle_of_Pinkie_Cleugh|Battle_Of_Pinkie_Cleugh|  in 1547.  |George_Buchanan|George_Buchanan|  claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 , , p. 169. The Highlands of the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the  |MacCrimmonds|Maccrimmon| , MacArthurs,  |MacGregors|Clan_Gregor|  and the Mackays of  |Gairloch|Gairloch| . J. Porter, Introduction in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century , , p. 35.     Evidence of the bagpipe in Ireland occurs in 1581, when John Derricks  The Image of Irelande  clearly depicts a bagpiper. Derricks illustrations are considered to be reasonably faithful depictions of the attire and equipment of the English and Irish population of the 16th century.  The Battell sequence from  My Ladye Nevells Booke  by  |William_Byrd|William_Byrd| , which probably alludes to the Irish wars of 1578, contains a piece entitled The bagpipe: & the drone. In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonalds Compleat Theory. Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a  |William_Dixon|William_Dixon_Manuscript|  from  |Northumberland|Northumberland|  contains music that fits the  |border_pipes|Border_Pipes| , a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern  |Great_Highland_bagpipe|Great_Highland_Bagpipe| . However the music in Dixons manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of  |Northumbrian_smallpipe|Northumbrian_Smallpipe|  tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.      As Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.     Extensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the  |Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art|Metropolitan_Museum_Of_Art|  in New York City, the  |International_Bagpipe_Museum|International_Bagpipe_Museum|  in  |Gijón|Gijón| , Spain, the  |Pitt_Rivers_Museum|Pitt_Rivers_Museum|  in Oxford, England and the  |Morpeth_Chantry_Bagpipe_Museum|Morpeth_Chantry_Bagpipe_Museum|  in Northumberland, and the  |Musical_Instrument_Museum|Musical_Instrument_Museum|  in Phoenix, Arizona.          The  |International_Bagpipe_Festival|International_Bagpipe_Festival|   is held every two years in  |Strakonice|Strakonice| ,  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic| .          During the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included  |Highland_regiments|Scottish_Regimenthighland_Regiments| , the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well-known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.     In the United Kingdom and  |Commonwealth_Nations|Commonwealth_Nations|  such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the  |Great_Highland_bagpipe|Great_Highland_Bagpipe|  is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.        In recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In  |Brittany|Brittany| , the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the  |pipe_band|Pipe_Band|  were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the  |bagad|Bagad| . The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the  |Galician_gaita|Galician_Bagpipe|  as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film  Braveheart  and the theatrical show  Riverdance  have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.     Bagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of  |curling|Curling| , bagpipes are also the official instrument of the  |World_Curling_Federation|World_Curling_Federation|  and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.     Bagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the worlds biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010.   In the late 20th century, various models of  |electronic_bagpipes|Electronic_Bagpipes|  were invented. The first custom-built  |MIDI|Midi|  bagpipes were developed by the Asturian piper known as  |Hevia|Hevia|  .               Dozens of types of bagpipes today are widely spread across Europe and the Middle East, as well as through much of the former  |British_Empire|British_Empire| . The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the  |Great_Highland_bagpipe|Great_Highland_Bagpipe| , overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the  |Irish_piping_tradition|Uilleann_Pipes| , which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the  |Asturian_gaita|Gaita_Asturiana| , the  |Galician_gaita|Galician_Gaita| , the Portuguese  |gaita_transmontana|Gaita_Transmontana| , the Aragonese  |gaita_de_boto|Gaita_De_Boto| ,  |Northumbrian_smallpipes|Northumbrian_Smallpipe| , the  |Breton|Breton_People| |_biniou|Biniou| , the  |Balkan|Balkan| |_gaida|Gaida| , the  |Romanian|Romanians| |_cimpoi|Cimpoi| , the Black Sea  |tulum|Tulum| , the  |Scottish_smallpipes|Scottish_Smallpipes|  and  |pastoral_pipes|Pastoral_Pipes| |_Kaba_gaida|Kaba_Gaida| |_Baghèt|Baghèt| |_zampogna|Zampogna| |_Laz|Laz_People|  man from Turkey playing a  |tulum|Tulum| |_Cillian_Vallely|Cillian_Vallely| |_Gaida|Gaida| |_Galician_gaita|Galician_Gaita| |_Sruti_upanga|Sruti_Upanga| |_duda|Duda| |_Bagad|Bagad| |_säckpipa|Säckpipa| |_Pastoral_pipes|Pastoral_Pipes| |_torupill|Torupill| |_huemmelchen|Huemmelchen| |_Gaita_asturiana|Gaita_Asturiana| |_Welsh_bagpipes|Welsh_Bagpipes| |_Tsampouna|Tsampouna| |_Żaqq|Żaqq| |_Royal_Palace_of_Amsterdam|Royal_Palace_Of_Amsterdam| |_cimpoi|Cimpoi|        Since the 1960s, bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with  |Paul_McCartneys|Paul_Mccartney| |_Mull_of_Kintyre|Mull_Of_Kintyre|  ,  |AC_DCs|Ac_Dc| |_Its_a_Long_Way_to_the_Top_|Its_A_Long_Way_To_The_Top|  , and  |Peter_Maxwell_Daviess|Peter_Maxwell_Davies|  composition  An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise .
