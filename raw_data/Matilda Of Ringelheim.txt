      Saint Matilda  was  |Duchess_of_Saxony|List_Of_Saxon_Consorts|  from 912 and  |German_queen|List_Of_German_Queens|   from 919 by her marriage with  |Henry_the_Fowler|Henry_The_Fowler| , the first king of the  |Ottonian_dynasty|Ottonian_Dynasty| . Upon her husbands death in 936, she founded  |Quedlinburg_Abbey|Quedlinburg_Abbey|  to commemorate the late king. Matilda lived to see Western Imperial rule restored when her eldest son  |Otto|Otto_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  was crowned  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 962. Her surname refers to  |Ringelheim|Salzgitter_Ringelheim| , where her comital  |Immedinger|Immedinger|  relatives established a nunnery about  940.       The details of St. Matildas life come primarily from brief mentions in the  Res gestae saxonicae  by the monastic historian  |Widukind_of_Corvey|Widukind_Of_Corvey|  , and from two hagiographies: the Vita antiquior, written about 974, and Vita posterior, circa 1003.     Matilda was born in  |Enger|Enger|  near  |Herford|Herford| , in the  |Westphalia|Westphalia| n part of the German  |stem_duchy|Stem_Duchy|  of  |Saxony|Duchy_Of_Saxony| . She was the daughter of the local count  |Dietrich|Dietrich_Of_Ringelheim|  and his wife Reinhild,  a noblewoman of  |Danish|Denmark|  and  |Frisian|Frisians|  descent.  Matildas biographers traced her ancestry back to the legendary  |Saxon|Old_Saxony|  leader  |Widukind|Widukind|  , who presumably was buried in the Enger church. Her sister Frederuna married Count  |Wichmann_the_Elder|Wichmann_The_Elder| , a member of the  |Billung|Billung|  dynasty.     As a young girl she was sent to  |Herford_Abbey|Herford_Abbey| , Sanctity and Power: The Dual Pursuit of Early Medieval Women, Suzanne F. Wemple, Becoming Visible: Women in European History, ed. Renate Bridenthal, Claudia Koonz and Susan Stuard, , 139. where her grandmother Matilda was abbess and where her reputation for beauty and virtue –and possibly also her extensive Westphalian dowry– is said to have attracted the attention of the Saxon duke  |Otto_the_Illustrious|Otto_I_Duke_Of_Saxony| , who betrothed her to his son and heir, Henry, about 20 years her senior. By the conjugal union, the Ottonian dynasty considerably enlarged their possessions in the western parts of Saxony. Henrys previous marriage with  |Hatheburg_of_Merseburg|Hatheburg_Of_Merseburg|  was annulled. They were married at the  Pfalz  of  |Wallhausen|Wallhausen_Saxony_Anhalt|  in 909 .     As the eldest surviving son, Henry succeeded his father as  |Duke_of_Saxony|List_Of_Rulers_Of_Saxony|  in 912 and upon the death of  |King_Conrad_I|Conrad_I_Of_Germany|  was elected  |King_of_East_Francia|List_Of_German_Monarchs|   in 919. He and Matilda had three sons and two daughters:      |Hedwig|Hedwig_Of_Saxony|  , who married the  |West_Frankish|West_Francia|  duke  |Hugh_the_Great|Hugh_The_Great|  and became the mother of  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet| , the first  |King_of_the_Franks|List_Of_French_Monarchs|  of the  |House_of_Capet|House_Of_Capet| |_Otto|Otto_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  , who succeeded his father as  |Duke_of_Saxony|List_Of_Rulers_Of_Saxony|  and  |King_of_Germany|List_Of_German_Monarchs|  from 936, crowned  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 962    |Gerberga|Gerberga_Of_Saxony|  , married  |Duke_Giselbert_of_Lorraine|Gilbert_Duke_Of_Lorraine|  and King  |Louis_IV_of_France|Louis_Iv_Of_France| |_Henry|Henry_I_Duke_Of_Bavaria|  , appointed  |Duke_of_Bavaria|List_Of_Rulers_Of_Bavaria|  from 948    |Bruno|Bruno_The_Great|  , later Saint, became  |Archbishop_of_Cologne|List_Of_Bishops_And_Archbishops_Of_Cologne|  in 953 and  |Duke_of_Lorraine|List_Of_Rulers_Of_Lorraine|  in 954.      In 929 Matilda received the estates of  |Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg| ,  |Pöhlde|Pöhlde_Abbey| ,  |Nordhausen|Nordhausen|  in  |Thuringia|Duchy_Of_Thuringia| , Grona , and  |Duderstadt|Duderstadt|  as her  wittum . After her husband died in 936 at  |Memleben|Memleben_Abbey| , Matilda and her son, now King Otto I of East Francia, established  |Quedlinburg_Abbey|Quedlinburg_Abbey|  near  |Halberstadt|Halberstadt|  in  |Saxony|Duchy_Of_Saxony|   in Henrys memory. The abbey was a convent of noble  |canoness|Canoness| es, where her granddaughter, also named  |Matilda|Matilda_Abbess_Of_Quedlinburg| , became abbess in 966. At first the Queen Mother remained at the court of her son. During quarrels between the new king and his rebellious brother Henry, Matilda seemed to have favoured her younger son, as he was born after his fathers accession to the throne. In turn, a cabal of royal advisors is reported to have accused her of decreasing the royal treasury in order to pay for her charitable activities. After a brief exile at her Westphalian estates in Enger, where she established a college of  |canons|Canon|  in 947, Matilda was brought back to court at the urging of King Ottos first wife, the Anglo-Saxon princess  |Edith_of_Wessex|Eadgyth| .     Matilda died after long illness on 14 March 968 in Quedlinburg Abbey,  outliving her husband by 32 years, and having seen the restoration of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . Her and Henrys mortal remains are buried in the  |crypt|Crypt|  of St. Servatius Church in Quedlinburg.       Medieval chroniclers like  |Liutprand_of_Cremona|Liutprand_Of_Cremona|  and  |Thietmar_of_Merseburg|Thietmar_Of_Merseburg|  celebrated Matilda for her devotion to prayer and almsgiving. Her first biographer depicted her  leaving her husbands side in the middle of the night and sneaking off to church to pray. St. Matilda founded many  |religious|Religion|  institutions, including the canonry of Quedlinburg, which became a center of  |ecclesiastical|Ecclesiastical|  and secular life in Germany under the rule of the Ottonian dynasty. She also founded the convents of St. Wigbert in  |Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg| , in  |Pöhlde|Pöhlde| ,  |Enger|Enger| , and Nordhausen, likely the source of at least one of her  vitae .     She was later  |canonized|Canonized| , with her cult largely confined to Saxony and Bavaria. St. Matildas  |feast_day|Feast_Day|  according to the  |regional_German_calendar_of_saints|General_Roman_Calendargermany|  is 14 March. In 1856–58 the  |Neo_Gothic|Gothic_Revival_Architecture|  St. Matildas Church was erected in Quedlinburg, according to plans designed by the Austrian architect  |Friedrich_Schmidt|Friedrich_Von_Schmidt| . Another St. Matildas Church was consecrated in  |Laatzen|Laatzen| ,  |Lower_Saxony|Lower_Saxony|  in 1938. The  |Melkite_Greek_Catholic_community_of_Aleppo|Melkite_Greek_Catholic_Archeparchy_Of_Aleppo|  built a church dedicated to Saint Matilda in 1964. There is a stained glass window dedicated to Saint Matilda in the parish church of  |Coole|Coole_County_Westmeath| , Ireland.         |Widukind|Widukind| ,  Res gestae Saxonicae , ed.
