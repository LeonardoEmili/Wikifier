             The Fresnel equations  describe the reflection and transmission of  |light|Light|   when incident on an interface between different optical  |media|Medium| . They were deduced by  |Augustin-Jean_Fresnel|Augustin-Jean_Fresnel|   who was the first to understand that light is a  |transverse_wave|Transverse_Wave| , even though no one realized that the vibrations of the wave were electric and magnetic fields. For the first time,  |polarization|Polarization|  could be understood quantitatively, as Fresnels equations correctly predicted the differing behaviour of waves of the s and p polarizations incident upon a material interface.       When light strikes the interface between a medium with  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index|  n 1 and a second medium with refractive index n 2 , both  |reflection|Reflection|  and  |refraction|Refraction|  of the light may occur. The Fresnel equations describe the ratios of the reflected and transmitted waves electric fields to the incident waves electric field . Since these are complex ratios, they describe not only the relative amplitude, but  |phase_shifts|Reflection_Phase_Shift|  between the waves.     The equations assume the interface between the media is flat and that the media are homogeneous and  |isotropic|Isotropy| . Born & Wolf, 1970, p.38. The incident light is assumed to be a  |plane_wave|Plane_Wave| , which is sufficient to solve any problem since any incident light field can be decomposed into plane waves and polarizations.          There are two sets of Fresnel coefficients for two different linear  |polarization|Polarization|  components of the incident wave. Since any  |polarization_state|Polarization_Polarization_State|  can be resolved into a combination of two orthogonal linear polarizations, this is sufficient for any problem. Likewise,  |unpolarized|Polarization_Unpolarized_And_Partially_Polarized_Light|  light has an equal amount of power in each of two linear polarizations.     The s polarization refers to polarization of a waves electric field normal to the plane of incidence ; then the magnetic field is in the plane of incidence. P polarization refers to polarization of the electric field in the plane of incidence ; then the magnetic field is normal to the plane of incidence.     Although the reflectivity and transmission are dependent on polarization, at normal incidence  there is no distinction between them so all polarization states are governed by a single set of Fresnel coefficients .                In the diagram on the right, an incident  |plane_wave|Plane_Wave|  in the direction of the ray IO strikes the interface between two media of refractive indices n 1 and n 2 at point O. Part of the wave is reflected in the direction OR, and part refracted in the direction OT. The angles that the incident, reflected and refracted rays make to the  |normal|Surface_Normal|  of the interface are given as θ i , θ r and θ t , respectively.     The relationship between these angles is given by the  |law_of_reflection|Law_Of_Reflection| |Snells_law|Snells_Law| |electromagnetic_wave|Electromagnetic_Wave| , and the laws of  |electromagnetism|Maxwells_Equations| , as shown  |below|Theory| . The ratio of waves electric field amplitudes are obtained, but in practice one is more often interested in formulae which determine power coefficients, since power  is what can be directly measured at optical frequencies. The power of a wave is generally proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude.     We call the fraction of the incident  |power|Power|  that is reflected from the interface the  |reflectance|Reflectance|  R, and the fraction that is refracted into the second medium is called the transmittance T. Note that these are what would be measured right at each side of an interface and do not account for attenuation of a wave in an absorbing medium following transmission or reflection. Hecht, 1987, p.100.       The  |reflectance|Reflectance|  for  |s-polarized_light|S-Polarized_Light|  is     :   R          while the  |reflectance|Reflectance|  for  |p-polarized_light|P-Polarized_Light|  is     :   R          where  and  are the  |wave_impedances|Wave_Impedance|  of media 1 and 2, respectively.     We assume that the media are non-magnetic , which is typically a good approximation at optical frequencies .  Then the wave impedances are determined solely by the refractive indices n 1 and n 2 :   : Zi     where  is the  |impedance_of_free_space|Impedance_Of_Free_Space|  and 1,2. Making this substitution, we obtain equations using the refractive indices:   :   R                    :   R                      The second form of each equation is derived from the first by eliminating θ t using  |Snells_law|Snells_Law|  and  |trigonometric_identities|Trigonometric_Identity| .     As a consequence of  |conservation_of_energy|Conservation_Of_Energy| , one can find the transmitted power  simply as the portion of the incident power that isnt reflected: Hecht, 1987, p.102.   : T  1 - R      and   : T  1 - R      Note that all such intensities are measured in terms of a waves irradiance in the direction normal to the interface; this is also what is measured in typical experiments. That number could be obtained from irradiances in the direction of an incident or reflected wave  multiplied by cosθ for a wave at an angle θ to the normal direction . This complication can be ignored in the case of the reflection coefficient, since cosθ i    cosθ r , so that the ratio of reflected to incident irradiance in the waves direction is the same as in the direction normal to the interface.     Although these relationships describe the basic physics, in many practical applications one is concerned with natural light that can be describe as unpolarized. That means that there is an equal amount of power in the s and p polarizations, so that the effective reflectivity of the material is just the average of the two reflectivities:   : R        For low-precision applications involving unpolarized light, such as  |computer_graphics|Computer_Graphics| , rather than rigorously computing the effective reflection coefficient for each angle,  |Schlicks_approximation|Schlicks_Approximation|  is often used.         For the case of  |normal_incidence|Normal_Incidence| ,     0 , and there is no distinction between s and p polarization. Thus, the reflectance simplifies to   :   R     .     For common glass  surrounded by air , the power reflectance at normal incidence can be seen to be about 4%, or 8% accounting for both sides of a glass pane.          At a dielectric interface from  to , there is a particular angle of incidence at which  goes to zero and a p-polarised incident wave is purely refracted. This angle is known as  |Brewsters_angle|Brewsters_Angle| , and is around 56° for n 1 1 and n 2 1.5 .          When light travelling in a denser medium strikes the surface of a less dense medium , beyond a particular incidence angle known as the critical angle, all light is reflected and . This phenomenon, known as  |total_internal_reflection|Total_Internal_Reflection| , occurs at incidence angles for which Snells law predicts that the sine of the angle of refraction would exceed unity . For glass with n1.5 surrounded by air, the critical angle is approximately 41°.     practical equations relating powers  are derived from the actual Fresnel equations which solve the physical problem in terms of electric and magnetic field amplitudes. Those underlying equations supply generally complex-valued ratios of those amplitudes and may take several different forms, depending on formalisms used. The amplitude coefficients are usually represented by lower case r and t .           In the following, the reflection coefficient  is the ratio of the reflected waves  |complex|Complex_Number|  electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave. The transmission coefficient  is the ratio of the transmitted waves electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave. We require separate formulae for the s and p polarizations. In each case we assume an incident plane wave at an  |angle_of_incidence|Angle_Of_Incidence|    on a plane interface, reflected at an angle   , and with a transmitted wave at an angle   , corresponding to the above figure. Note that in the cases of an interface into an absorbing material  or total internal reflection, the angle of transmission might not evaluate to a real number.     We consider the sign of a waves electric field in relation to a waves direction. Consequently for p polarization at normal incidence, the positive direction of electric field for an incident wave is opposite that of a reflected wave ; for s polarization both are the same . Some authors use the opposite sign convention for , so that  is positive when the incoming and reflected magnetic fields are anti-parallel, and negative when they are parallel. This latter convention has the convenient advantage that the s and p sign conventions are the same at normal incidence. However, either convention, when used consistently, gives the right answers.     Using these conventions, Lecture notes by Bo Sernelius, , see especially . Born & Wolf, 1970, p.40, eqs.,.     :     r  &       t  &   ,     r  &       t  &   .           One can see that  Hecht, 2002, p.116, eqs.,. and . One can write similar equations applying to the ratio of magnetic fields of the waves, but these are usually not required.     Because the reflected and incident waves propagate in the same medium and make the same angle with the normal to the surface, the power reflection coefficient R is just the squared magnitude of r Hecht, 2002, p.120, eq..   : R  r 2.     On the other hand, calculation of the power transmission coefficient  is less straight-forward, since the light travels in different directions in the two media. Whats more, the wave impedances in the two media differ; power is only proportional to the square of the amplitude when the medias impedances are the same . This results in Hecht, 2002, p.120, eq.. :   : T    t 2.     The factor of  is the reciprocal of the ratio of the medias  |wave_impedances|Wave_Impedance|  . The factor of  is from expressing power in the direction normal to the interface, for both the incident and transmitted waves.     In the case of  |total_internal_reflection|Total_Internal_Reflection|  where the power transmission  is zero,  nevertheless describes the electric field just beyond the interface. This is an  |evanescent_field|Evanescent_Field|  which does not propagate as a wave  but has nonzero values very close to the interface. The phase shift of the reflected wave on total internal reflection can similarly be obtained from the  |phase_angles|Argument|  of  and  . These phase shifts are different for s and p waves, which is the well-known principle by which total internal reflection is used to effect  |polarization_transformations|Fresnel_Rhomb| .         In the above formula for , if we put n2n1  and multiply the numerator and denominator by , we  obtain Fresnel, 1866, p.773. Hecht, 2002, p.115, eq..     : r      If we do likewise with the formula for , the result is easily shown to be equivalent to Fresnel, 1866, p.757. Hecht, 2002, p.115, eq..     : r        These formulas E. Verdet, in Fresnel, 1866, p.789n. Born & Wolf, 1970, p.40, eqs.. Jenkins & White, 1976, p.524, eqs.. are known respectively as Fresnels sine law and Fresnels tangent law. Whittaker, 1910, p.134; Darrigol, 2012, p.213. Although at normal incidence these expressions reduce to 0/0, one can see that they yield the correct results in the  |limit|Limit|  as .       When light makes multiple reflections between two or more parallel surfaces, the multiple beams of light generally  |interfere|Interference|  with one another, resulting in net transmission and reflection amplitudes that depend on the lights wavelength. The interference, however, is seen only when the surfaces are at distances comparable to or smaller than the lights  |coherence_length|Coherence_Length| , which for ordinary white light is few micrometers; it can be much larger for light from a  |laser|Laser| .     An example of interference between reflections is the  |iridescent|Iridescence|  colours seen in a  |soap_bubble|Soap_Bubble|  or in thin oil films on water. Applications include  |Fabry–Pérot_interferometers|Fabry–Pérot_Interferometer| ,  |antireflection_coatings|Antireflection_Coating| , and  |optical_filters|Optical_Filter| . A quantitative analysis of these effects is based on the Fresnel equations, but with additional calculations to account for interference.     The  |transfer-matrix_method|Transfer-Matrix_Method| , or the recursive Rouard method  chapt. 4. can be used to solve multiple-surface problems.            In 1808,  |Étienne-Louis_Malus|Étienne-Louis_Malus|  discovered that when a ray of light was reflected off a non-metallic surface at the appropriate angle, it behaved like one of the two rays emerging from a  |doubly-refractive|Birefringence|  calcite crystal. Darrigol, 2012, pp.191–2. He later coined the term polarization to describe this behavior.   In 1815, the dependence of the polarizing angle on the refractive index was determined experimentally by  |David_Brewster|David_Brewster| . D. Brewster, , Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, vol.105, pp.125–59, read 16  March 1815. But the reason for that dependence was such a deep mystery that in late 1817,  |Thomas_Young|Thomas_Young|  was moved to write:      In 1821, however,  |Augustin-Jean_Fresnel|Augustin-Jean_Fresnel|  derived results equivalent to his sine and tangent laws , by modeling light waves as  |transverse_elastic_waves|S-Wave|  with vibrations perpendicular to what had previously been called the  |plane_of_polarization|Plane_Of_Polarization| . Fresnel promptly confirmed by experiment that the equations correctly predicted the direction of polarization of the reflected beam when the incident beam was polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence, for light incident from air onto glass or water; in particular, the equations gave the correct polarization at Brewsters angle. Buchwald, 1989, pp.390–91; Fresnel, 1866, pp.646–8. The experimental confirmation was reported in a postscript to the work in which Fresnel first revealed his theory that light waves, including unpolarized waves, were purely transverse. A. Fresnel, Note sur le calcul des teintes que la polarisation développe dans les lames cristallisées , Annales de Chimie et de Physique, vol.17, pp.102–12 , 167–96 , 312–16 ; reprinted in Fresnel, 1866, pp.609–48.     Details of Fresnels derivation, including the modern forms of the sine law and tangent law, were given later, in a memoir read to the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in January 1823. A. Fresnel, Mémoire sur la loi des modifications que la réflexion imprime à la lumière polarisée , read 7  January 1823; reprinted in Fresnel, 1866, pp.767–99 , pp.753–62 . See especially pp.773 , 757 , 760–61 and 792–6 . That derivation combined conservation of energy with continuity of the tangential vibration at the interface, but failed to allow for any condition on the normal component of vibration. Buchwald, 1989, pp.391–3; Whittaker, 1910, pp.133–5. The first derivation from electromagnetic principles was given by  |Hendrik_Lorentz|Hendrik_Lorentz|  in 1875. Buchwald, 1989, p.392.     In the same memoir of January 1823, Fresnel found that for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, his formulas for the reflection coefficients  gave complex values with unit magnitudes. Noting that the magnitude, as usual, represented the ratio of peak amplitudes, he guessed that the  |argument|Argument|  represented the phase shift, and verified the hypothesis experimentally. Lloyd, 1834, pp.369–70; Buchwald, 1989, pp.393–4,453; Fresnel, 1866, pp.781–96. The verification involved   calculating the angle of incidence that would introduce a total phase difference of 90° between the s and p components, for various numbers of total internal reflections at that angle ,   subjecting light to that number of total internal reflections at that angle of incidence, with an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of incidence, and   checking that the final polarization was  |circular|Circular_Polarization| . Fresnel, 1866, pp.760–61,792–6; Whewell, 1857, p.359.   Thus he finally had a quantitative theory for what we now call the Fresnel rhomb — a device that he had been using in experiments, in one form or another, since 1817 .     The success of the complex reflection coefficient inspired  |James_MacCullagh|James_Maccullagh|  and  |Augustin-Louis_Cauchy|Augustin-Louis_Cauchy| , beginning in 1836, to analyze reflection from metals by using the Fresnel equations with a  |complex_refractive_index|Refractive_Indexcomplex_Refractive_Index| . Whittaker, 1910, pp.177–9.     Four weeks before he presented his completed theory of total internal reflection and the rhomb, Fresnel submitted a memoir A. Fresnel, Mémoire sur la double réfraction que les rayons lumineux éprouvent en traversant les aiguilles de cristal de roche suivant les directions parallèles à laxe , signed & submitted 9  December 1822; reprinted in Fresnel, 1866, pp.731–51 , pp.719–29 . On the publication dates, see also Buchwald, 1989, p.462, ref.1822b. in which he introduced the needed terms  linear polarization ,  circular polarization , and  elliptical polarization , Buchwald, 1989, pp.230–31; Fresnel, 1866, p.744. and in which he explained  |optical_rotation|Optical_Rotation|  as a species of  |birefringence|Birefringence| 442; Fresnel, 1866, pp.737–9,749.   Cf.  Whewell, 1857, pp.356–8; Jenkins & White, 1976, pp.589–90.     Thus Fresnels interpretation of the complex values of his reflection coefficients marked the confluence of several streams of his research and, arguably, the essential completion of his reconstruction of physical optics on the transverse-wave hypothesis .         Here we systematically derive the above relations from electromagnetic premises.         In order to compute meaningful Fresnel coefficients, we must assume that the medium is  |linear|Linearity|  and  |homogeneous|Homogeneity| . If the medium is also  |isotropic|Isotropy| , the four field vectors  are  |related|Constitutive_Equationelectromagnetism|  by   :   :,   where ϵ and μ are scalars, known respectively as the  permittivity  and the  permeability  of the medium. For a vacuum, these have the values ϵ 0 and μ 0 , respectively. Hence we define the relative permittivity  , and the relative permeability .     In optics it is common to assume that the medium is non-magnetic, so that μ rel 1. For  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  materials at radio/microwave frequencies, larger values of μ rel must be taken into account. But, for optically transparent media, and for all other materials at optical frequencies , μ rel is indeed very close to 1; that is, μ≈μ 0 .     In optics, one usually knows the  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index|  n of the medium, which is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum  to the speed of light in the medium. In the analysis of partial reflection and transmission, one is also interested in the electromagnetic  |wave_impedance|Wave_Impedance|  , which is the ratio of the amplitude of  to the amplitude of . It is therefore desirable to express n and  in terms of ϵ and μ, and thence to relate  to n. The last-mentioned relation, however, will make it convenient to derive the reflection coefficients in terms of the wave admittance , which is the reciprocal of the wave impedance .     In the case of uniform plane sinusoidal  waves, the wave impedance or admittance is known as the intrinsic impedance or admittance of the medium. This case is the one for which the Fresnel coefficients are to be derived.         In a uniform plane sinusoidal  |electromagnetic_wave|Electromagnetic_Radiation| , the  |electric_field|Electric_Field|   has the form      where  is the complex amplitude vector,    is the  |imaginary_unit|Imaginary_Unit| ,    is the  |wave_vector|Wave_Vector|  ,    is the  |position_vector|Position| ,   ω is the  |angular_frequency|Angular_Frequency| ,    is time, and it is understood that the real part of the expression is the physical field. The above form  is typically used by physicists.  |Electrical_engineers|Electrical_Engineering|  typically prefer the form  that is, they not only use  instead of  for the imaginary unit, but also change the sign of the exponent, with the result that the whole expression is replaced by its  |complex_conjugate|Complex_Conjugate| , leaving the real part unchanged . The electrical engineers form and the formulas derived therefrom may be converted to the physicists convention by substituting  for .   The value of the expression is unchanged if the position  varies in a direction normal to ; hence  is normal to the wavefronts.     To advance the  |phase|Phase|  by the angle ϕ, we replace  by  , with the result that the field is multiplied by . So a phase advance is equivalent to multiplication by a complex constant with a negative  |argument|Argument| . This becomes more obvious when the field  is factored as  where the last factor contains the time-dependence. That factor also implies that differentiation w.r.t.  time corresponds to multiplication by . In the electrical engineering convention, the time-dependent factor is  so that a phase advance corresponds to multiplication by a complex constant with a positive argument, and differentiation w.r.t.  time corresponds to multiplication by . This article, however, uses the physics convention, whose time-dependent factor is . Although the imaginary unit does not appear explicitly in the results given here, the time-dependent factor affects the interpretation of any results that turn out to be complex.     If ℓ is the component of  in the direction of  the field  can be written .   If the argument of  is to be constant,   ℓ  must increase at the velocity   known as the  phase velocity  . This in turn is equal to c/n . Solving for  gives        As usual, we drop the time-dependent factor  which is understood to multiply every complex field quantity. The electric field for a uniform plane sine wave will then be represented by the location-dependent  phasor       For fields of that form,  |Faradays_law|Faradays_Law_Of_Induction|  and the  |Maxwell-Ampère_law|Ampères_Circuital_Law|  respectively reduce to Compare M.V. Berry and M.R. Jeffrey, , in E.

Taking the magnitude equations and substituting from , we obtain   :       cH & nE      cE & nH        where  and  are the magnitudes of  and . Multiplying the last two equations gives      Dividing the same two equations gives  where      This is the intrinsic admittance.     From  we obtain the phase velocity c/n1  . For a vacuum this reduces to c1  . Dividing the second result by the first gives   : n  .   For a non-magnetic medium , this becomes n  .                   In Cartesian coordinates , let the region  have refractive index  intrinsic admittance  etc. Then the  plane is the interface, and the  axis is normal to the interface . Let  and   be the unit vectors in the  and  directions, respectively. Let the plane of incidence be the  plane , with the angle of incidence  measured from  towards . Let the angle of refraction, measured in the same sense, be  where the subscript  stands for transmitted .     In the absence of  |Doppler_shifts|Doppler_Effect| , ω does not change on reflection or refraction. Hence, by , the magnitude of the wave vector is proportional to the refractive index.     So, for a given ω, if we redefine  as the magnitude of the wave vector in the reference medium , then the wave vector has magnitude  in the first medium .
