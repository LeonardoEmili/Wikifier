     The Kattegat  is a  sea area bounded by the  |Jutland|Jutland| ic peninsula in the west, the  |Danish_Straits|Danish_Straits|  islands of  |Denmark|Denmark|  to the south and the provinces of  |Västergötland|Västergötland| ,  |Scania|Scania| ,  |Halland|Halland|  and  |Bohuslän|Bohuslän|  in  |Sweden|Sweden|  in the east. The  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  drains into the Kattegat through the Danish Straits. The sea area is a continuation of the  |Skagerrak|Skagerrak|  and may be seen as a  |bay|Headlands_And_Bays|  of the Baltic Sea or the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  or, as in traditional  |Scandinavian|Scandinavia|  usage, neither of these.     The Kattegat is a rather shallow sea and can be very difficult and dangerous to navigate because of the many sandy and stony reefs and tricky currents, which often shift. In modern times, artificial seabed channels have been dug, many reefs have been  |dredged|Dredging|  by either sand pumping or stone fishing, and a well-developed  |light_signaling|Lighthouse|  network has been installed, to safeguard the very heavy international traffic of this small sea.     There are several large cities and major ports in the Kattegat, including  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg| ,  |Aarhus|Aarhus| ,  |Aalborg|Aalborg| ,  |Halmstad|Halmstad|  and  |Frederikshavn|Frederikshavn| , mentioned by descending size.          According to the definition established in a 1932 convention signed by Denmark,  |Norway|Norway|  and Sweden , the northern boundary between the Kattegat and Skagerrak is found at the northernmost point of  |Skagen|Skagen|  on Jutland, while the southern boundary towards  |Øresund|Øresund|  is found at the tip of  |Kullen|Kullen_Lighthouse|  Peninsula in Scania. . League of Nations Treaty Series 139, 1933–1934. Retrieved 27 December 2012.     Major  |waterways|Waterway|  that drain into the Kattegat are the rivers of  |Göta_älv|Göta_Älv|  at  |Gothenburg|Gothenburg| , together with the  |Lagan|Lagan_River| ,  |Nissan|Nissan| ,  |Ätran|Ätran|  and  |Viskan|Viskan|  in the province of  |Halland|Halland|  on the Swedish side, and the river of  |Gudenå|Gudenå|  in  |Jutland|Jutland| , in Denmark.     The main islands of the Kattegat are  |Samsø|Samsø| ,  |Læsø|Læsø|  and  |Anholt|Anholt| ; the latter two are, due to their relatively dry climate, situated in what is called the Danish  |desert|Desert|  belt .     A number of noteworthy coastal areas abut the Kattegat, including the  |Kullaberg_Nature_Reserve|Kullaberg_Nature_Reserve|  in Scania, Sweden, which contains a number of  |rare_species|Rare_Species|  and a scenic  |rocky_shore|Rocky_Shore| , the town of  |Mölle|Mölle| , which has a picturesque harbour and views into the Kullaberg, and Skagen at the northern tip of Denmark.     Since the 1950s, a bridge project usually referred to as Kattegatbroen  connecting Jutland and  |Zealand|Zealand|  across the Kattegat has been considered. Since the late 2000s, the project has seen a renewed interest from several influential politicians in Denmark. The bridge is usually envisioned as connecting Hov  with Samsø and  |Kalundborg|Kalundborg| .         The  |International_Hydrographic_Organization|International_Hydrographic_Organization|  defines the limits of the Kattegat, Sound and Belts  as follows:             According to  Den Store Danske Encyklopædi  and  Nudansk Ordbog , the name derives from the  |Dutch|Dutch_Language|  words  and  . It derives from late  |medieval|Medieval|  navigation jargon, in which captains of the  |Hanseatic|Hanseatic_League|  trading fleets would compare the  |Danish_Straits|Danish_Straits|  to a hole so narrow that even a cat would have difficulty squeezing its way through, on account of the many  |reefs|Reef|  and shallow waters. Den Store Danske Encyklopædi , CD-ROM edition, Copenhagen: Gyldendal, entry Kattegat. Nudansk Ordbog , 15th edition, 2nd reprint, Copenhagen: Politikens Forlag, entry Kattegat. At one point, the passable waters were a mere  wide. The name of the  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen|  street  Kattesundet  has a comparable etymological meaning, namely narrow passage .     An archaic name for both the  |Skagerrak|Skagerrak|  and Kattegat was the  Norwegian Sea  or Jutland Sea . Its ancient  |Latin|Latin_Language|  name was .        Control of the Kattegat, and access to it, have been important throughout the history of international seafaring. Until the completion of the  |Eider_Canal|Eider_Canal|  in 1784, the Kattegat was the only sea route into and out of the Baltic region.      Beginning in 1429 in the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , the Danish royal family – and later the state of Denmark – prospered greatly from the  |Sound_dues|Sound_Dues| , a toll charged for passage through the  |Øresund|Øresund| , while  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen|  provided shelter, trade and repair opportunities and protection from  |piracy|Piracy| . The dues were eventually lifted in 1857.         In the Kattegat, the  |salinity|Salinity|  has a pronounced two-layer structure. The upper layer has a salinity between 18‰ and 26‰ and the lower layer – separated by a strong  |halocline|Halocline|  at around  – has a salinity between 32‰ and 34‰. The lower layer consists of inflowing seawater from the Skagerrak, with a salinity on level with most other coastal seawaters, while the upper layer consists of inflowing seawater from the Baltic Sea and has a much lower salinity, comparable to  |brackish_water|Brackish_Water| , but still a great deal higher than the rest of the  |Baltic_sea|Baltic_Sea| . These two opposing flows transport a net surplus of  seawater from the Baltic to the Skagerrak every year.  During stronger winds, the layers in the Kattegat are completely mixed in some places, such as the  |Great_Belt|Great_Belt| , so the overall salinity is highly variable in this small sea. This sets some unique conditions for the  |sealife|Sealife|  here.       |Cold_seeps|Cold_Seep| , locally known as bubbling reefs , are found in the northern Kattegat. Unlike cold seeps in most other places , the Kattegat bubbling reefs are at relatively shallow depths, generally between  below the surface.   The seeps rely on methane deposited during the  |Eemian|Eemian|  period and during calm weather the bubbles can sometimes be seen on the water surface. Carbonate  |cementation|Cementation|  and  |lithification|Lithification|  form slaps or pillars up to  tall, and support a rich  |biodiversity|Biodiversity| . Because of their unique status, the Kattegat bubbling reefs receive a level of protection and are recognized as a  |Natura_2000|Natura_2000|  habitat by the  |European_Union|European_Union|  .        The Kattegat was one of the first marine  |dead_zones|Dead_Zone|  to be noted in the 1970s, when scientists began studying how intensive industrial activities affected the natural world.   Since then, studies and research has provided much insight into processes like  |eutrophication|Eutrophication| , and how to deal with it. Denmark and the EU have initiated costly and far-reaching domestic projects in order to stop, repair and prevent these environmentally destructive and economically damaging processes,  since the first Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment in 1985, and are now busy implementing the fourth Action Plan. The action plans sums up a broad range of initiatives and includes the so-called Nitrate Directives.  Danish Ministry of the Environment The action plans have generally been viewed as a success, although the work is not finished and all goals are not completely met yet.              Due to the very heavy sea traffic and many large coastal settlements, the Kattegat has been designated as a  |Sulphur_Emission_Control_Area|Sulphur_Emission_Control_Area|  as part of the Baltic Sea since 2006. The benchmark for sulphur in fuels was recently lowered to 0.1%, to be effectuated from 1 January 2015.      Several larger areas of the Kattegat are designated as  |Natura_2000|Natura_2000|  and under various bird protections such as the  |Ramsar_Convention|Ramsar_Convention| . The remaining larger shallow reefs are among the protections, as they are important spawning and feeding grounds for fish and marine mammals and they support a thriving but threatened  |biodiversity|Biodiversity| . Protected areas includes:     Denmark     |Grenen|Grenen| |Bay_of_Aalborg|Bay_Of_Aalborg| , comprising a  shallow sea area.    |Beach_meadows|Beach_Meadow|  on  |Læsø|Læsø|  and the stony  |reefs|Reef|  south of the island    |Anholt|Anholt|  and the sea north of the island.
