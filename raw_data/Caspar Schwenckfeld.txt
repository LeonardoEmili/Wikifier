   Caspar  Schwenkfeld von Ossig  was a  |German|Germans|  theologian, writer, and preacher who became a  |Protestant_Reformer|Protestant_Reformer|  and spiritualist. He was one of the earliest promoters of the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  in  |Silesia|Silesia| .     Schwenckfeld came to Reformation principles through  |Thomas_Müntzer|Thomas_Müntzer|  and  |Andreas_Karlstadt|Andreas_Karlstadt| . However, he developed his own principles and fell out with  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  over the eucharistic controversy . He had his own views on the sacraments - the Heavenly Flesh doctrine - developed in close association with his humanist colleague,  |Valentin_Crautwald|Valentin_Krautwald|  . His followers became a new sect , which was outlawed in Germany, but his ideas influenced  |Anabaptism|Anabaptist| ,  |Pietism|Pietism|  on mainland Europe, and  |Puritan|Puritan| ism in  |England|England| .     Many of his followers were persecuted in Europe and thus forced to either convert or flee. Because of this, there are  |Schwenkfelder_Church|Schwenkfelder_Church|  congregations in countries such as the  |United_States|United_States|  .           Schwenckfeld was born in  |Ossig|Ossig|  near Liegnitz,  |Silesia|Silesia|  now  |Osiek|Osiek,_Lubin_County| , near  |Legnica|Legnica| ,  |Poland|Poland| , to noble parents in 1489.   Some sources give 1490, but late in 1489 appears to be preferable.   From 1505 to 1507 he was a student in  |Cologne|Cologne| , and in 1507 enrolled at the  |University_of_Frankfurt_on_the_Oder|Viadrina_European_University| . Between 1511 and 1523, Schwenckfeld served the  |Duchy_of_Liegnitz|Duchy_Of_Liegnitz|  as an adviser to Duke Charles I , Duke George I , and Duke Frederick II .       In 1518 or 1519, Schwenckfeld experienced an awakening that he called a visitation of God. Luthers writings had a deep influence on Schwenckfeld, and he embraced the  |Lutheran|Lutheranism|  Reformation and became a student of the Scriptures. In 1521, Schwenckfeld began to preach the gospel, and in 1522 won Duke Friedrich II over to Protestantism. He organized a Brotherhood of his converts for the purpose of study and prayer in 1523. In 1525, he rejected Luthers idea of  |Real_Presence|Real_Presence|  and came to a spiritual interpretation of the  |Lords_Supper|Eucharist| , which was subsequently rejected by Luther. Schwenckfeld began to teach that the true believer ate the spiritual body of Christ. He pushed for reformation wherever he went, but also criticized reformers that he thought went to extremes. He emphasized that for one to be a true Christian, one must not change only outwardly but inwardly. Because of the communion and other controversies, Schwenckfeld broke with Luther and followed what some describe as a middle way . Because of his break from Luther and the  |Magisterial_Reformation|Magisterial_Reformation| , scholars typically categorize Schwenckfeld as a member of the  |Radical_Reformation|Radical_Reformation| . He voluntarily exiled himself from Silesia in 1529 in order to relieve pressure on and embarrassment of his duke. He lived in  |Strassburg|Strasbourg|  from 1529–1534 and then in  |Swabia|Swabia| .       Some of the teachings of Schwenckfeld included opposition to war, secret societies, and oath-taking, that the government had no right to command ones conscience, that regeneration is by grace through inner work of the Spirit, that believers feed on Christ spiritually, and that believers must give evidence of regeneration. He rejected  |infant_baptism|Infant_Baptism| , outward church forms, and denominations . His views on the Eucharist prompted Luther to publish several sermons on the subject in his 1526  The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics .       In 1540  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  expelled Caspar Schwenckfeld from  |Silesia|Silesia| . In 1541, Schwenckfeld published the Great Confession on the Glory of Christ. Many considered the writing to be heretical. He taught that Christ had two natures, divine and human, but that he became progressively more divine. He also published a number of works about interpreting the Scriptures during the 1550s, often responding to the rebuttals of the Lutheran Reformer  |Matthias_Flacius_Illyricus|Matthias_Flacius| . Arbeiten zur Geschichte und Theologie des Luthertums, Neue Folge, Band 5 .       In 1561, Schwenckfeld became sick with dysentery, and gradually grew weaker until he died in  |Ulm|Ulm|  on the morning of December 10, 1561. Because of his enemies, the fact of his death and the place of his burial were kept secret.          Schwenckfeld did not organize a separate church during his lifetime, but followers seemed to gather around his writings and sermons. In 1700 there were about 1,500 of them in Lower Silesia. Many fled Silesia under persecution of the Austrian emperor, and some found refuge on the lands of Count  |Nicolaus_Ludwig_Zinzendorf|Nicolaus_Ludwig_Zinzendorf|  and his  |Herrnhuter_Brüdergemeinde|Herrnhuter_Brüdergemeinde| . These followers became known as Schwenkfelders. A group arrived in Philadelphia in 1731, followed by five more migrations up to 1737. In 1782, the Society of Schwenkfelders was formed, and in 1909 the  |Schwenkfelder_Church|Schwenkfelder_Church|  was organized.     The Schwenkfelder Church has remained small, and currently there are five   For a number of years there were only five churches, but the Schwenkfelder Missionary Church was recently formed in Philadelphia.   churches with about 3,000 members in southeastern Pennsylvania.
