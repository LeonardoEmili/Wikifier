                  Glass is a non- |crystalline|Crystallinity| , often  |transparent|Transparency_And_Translucency| |_amorphous_solid|Amorphous_Solid| , that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative uses in, for example,  |window|Window|  panes,  |tableware|Tableware| ,  |optics|Optics| , and  |optoelectronics|Optoelectronic| . The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are silicate glasses based on the chemical compound  |silica|Silicon_Dioxide|  , the primary constituent of  |sand|Sand| . The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called  |soda_lime_glass|Soda_Lime_Glass| , composed of approximately 75%  |silicon_dioxide|Silicon_Dioxide|  ,  |sodium_oxide|Sodium_Oxide|  from  |sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate|  ,  |calcium_oxide|Calcium_Oxide|  , also called  |lime|Lime| , and several minor additives.     Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical  |transparency|Transparency_And_Translucency| , giving rise to their primary use as window panes. Glass will  |transmit|Transmission_Coefficientoptics| ,  |reflect|Reflection|  and  |refract|Refraction|  light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make  |optical_lenses|Lens| ,  |prisms|Prism| , fine glassware, and  |optical_fibers|Optical_Fiber|  for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts, and can also be painted and printed with  |vitreous_enamels|Vitreous_Enamel| . These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of  |art_objects|Art_Objects|  and in particular,  |stained_glass_windows|Stained_Glass| . Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels:  |bowls|Bowl| ,  |vases|Vase| ,  |bottles|Bottle| , jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for  |paperweights|Paperweight_Collecting| ,  |marbles|Marble| , and  |beads|Bead| . When extruded as  |glass_fiber|Glass_Fiber|  and matted as  |glass_wool|Glass_Wool|  so as to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer  |plastic|Plastic| , they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material  |fiberglass|Fiberglass| . Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material.     Scientifically, glass is often defined in a broader sense, encompassing every solid that possesses a non-crystalline structure at the atomic scale and that exhibits a  |glass_transition|Glass_Transition|  when heated towards the liquid state.  |Porcelains|Porcelain|  and many polymer  |thermoplastics|Thermoplastic|  familiar from everyday use are glasses. These sorts of glasses can be made of quite different kinds of materials than silica: metallic  |alloys|Alloy| , ionic melts,  |aqueous_solutions|Aqueous_Solution| , molecular liquids, and  |polymers|Polymer| . For many applications, like  |glass_bottles|Glass_Bottles|  or  |eyewear|Eyewear| , polymer glasses  are a lighter alternative to traditional glass.            |Silicon_dioxide|Silicon_Dioxide|  is a common fundamental constituent of glass.  In nature,  |vitrification|Vitrification|  of  |quartz|Quartz|  occurs when  |lightning|Lightning|  strikes  |sand|Sand| , forming hollow,  |branching_rootlike|Dendrite|  structures called  |fulgurites|Fulgurite| .       |Fused_quartz|Fused_Quartz|  is a glass made from chemically-pure silica. It has excellent resistance to  |thermal_shock|Thermal_Shock| , being able to survive immersion in water while red hot. However, its high melting temperature  and viscosity make it difficult to work with.  Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is  |sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate|  , which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass  |water_soluble|Sodium_Silicate| , which is usually undesirable, so  |lime|Lime|  , some  |magnesium_oxide|Magnesium_Oxide|  and  |aluminium_oxide|Aluminium_Oxide|  are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a  |soda_lime_glass|Soda_Lime_Glass| . B.H.W.S. de Jong, Glass ; in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry ; 5th edition, vol. A12, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1989, , pp. 365â€“432. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.       Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties.  |Lead_glass|Lead_Glass|  or  |flint_glass|Flint_Glass|  is more brilliant because the increased  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index|  causes noticeably more  |specular_reflection|Specular_Reflection|  and increased  |optical_dispersion|Dispersion| . Adding  |barium|Barium|  also increases the refractive index.  |Thorium_oxide|Thorium_Oxide|  gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its  |radioactivity|Radioactivity|  has been replaced by  |lanthanum_oxide|Lanthanum_Oxide|  in modern eyeglasses.  Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb  |infrared|Infrared|  radiation, for example in heat-absorbing filters for movie projectors, while  |cerium_oxide|Cerium_Oxide|  can be used for glass that absorbs  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  wavelengths.      The following is a list of the more common types of silicate glasses and their ingredients, properties, and applications:   Fused quartz,  also called fused-silica glass,  vitreous-silica glassSoda-lime-silica glass, window glass silica + sodium oxide + lime + magnesia + alumina .   Is transparent,  easily formed and most suitable for window glass .  It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat . It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware.   |Container_glass|Container_Glass|  is a soda-lime glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.   Sodium borosilicate glass, Pyrex |boron_trioxide|Boron_Trioxide|  + soda + alumina .  Stands heat expansion much better than window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car  |head_lamps|Head_Lamp| , etc.  |Borosilicate_glass|Borosilicate_Glass| es  have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low  |coefficients_of_thermal_expansion|Coefficient_Of_Thermal_Expansion|  , making them more dimensionally stable. The lower coefficient of thermal expansion also makes them less subject to  |stress|Stress|  caused by  |thermal_expansion|Thermal_Expansion| , thus less vulnerable to  |cracking|Crack_Propagation|  from  |thermal_shock|Thermal_Shock| . They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.   Lead-oxide glass, crystal glass, lead glass silica + lead oxide + potassium oxide + soda + zinc oxide + alumina. Because of its high density , it has a high refractive index, making the look of glassware more brilliant  . It also has a high elasticity, making glassware ring . It is also more workable in the factory, but cannot stand heating very well. This kind of glass is also more fragile than other glasses  and is easier to cut.   Aluminosilicate glass + barium oxide + boric oxide . Extensively used for  |fiberglass|Fiberglass| , used for making glass-reinforced plastics and for halogen bulb glass. Aluminosilicate glasses are also resistant to weathering and water erosion.    Germanium-oxide glass |germanium_dioxide|Germanium_Dioxide|  . Extremely clear glass, used for fiber-optic  |waveguides|Waveguide|  in communication networks.  Light loses only 5% of its intensity through 1  km of glass fiber.      Another common glass ingredient is crushed alkali glass or  |cullet|Cullet|  ready for  |recycled_glass|Glass_Recycling| . The recycled glass saves on raw materials and energy. Impurities in the cullet can lead to product and equipment failure. Fining agents such as  |sodium_sulfate|Sodium_Sulfate| ,  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride| , or  |antimony_oxide|Antimony_Trioxide|  may be added to reduce the number of air bubbles in the glass mixture.  |Glass_batch_calculation|Glass_Batch_Calculation|  is the method by which the correct raw material mixture is determined to achieve the desired glass composition.   |Moldavite|Moldavite| , a natural glass formed by  |meteorite|Meteorite|  impact, from  |Besednice|Besednice| ,  |Bohemia|Bohemia_Proper| |_Quartz_sand|Sand| |_Trinitite|Trinitite| , a glass made by the  |Trinity_nuclear_weapon_test|Trinity| |_Lead_glass|Lead_Glass| , a glass made by adding  |lead_oxide|Lead_Oxide| |_borosilicate_glass|Borosilicate_Glass| |_guitar_slide|Guitar_Slide|                 Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast,  |polycrystal|Polycrystal| line materials do not generally transmit visible light.  The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets  reflect or scatter light resulting in  |diffuse_reflection|Diffuse_Reflection| . Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow  |surface_tension|Surface_Tension| , which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing, i.e., colored.      Glass has the ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light following  |geometrical_optics|Geometrical_Optics| ,  without scattering it .  It is used in the manufacture of  |lenses|Lens|  and windows.  Common glass has a  |refraction_index|Refraction_Index|  around 1.5.  This may be modified by adding low-density materials  such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction ,  or increased with high-density materials such as lead oxide , or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of  |zirconium|Zirconium| ,  |titanium|Titanium| , or  |barium|Barium| . These high-index glasses cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized for their diamond-like optical properties.     According to  |Fresnel_equations|Fresnel_Equations| , the  |reflectivity|Reflectivity|  of a sheet of glass is about 4% per surface ,  and the  |transmissivity|Transmittance|  of one element is about 90%.  Glass with high  |germanium|Germanium|  oxide content also finds application in  |optoelectronics|Optoelectronics|   â€”e.g., for light-transmitting  |optical_fibers|Optical_Fiber| .   |magnifying_glass|Magnifying_Glass| |_glass_fiber|Glass_Fiber|          In the manufacturing process, silicate glass can be poured, formed, extruded and molded into forms ranging from flat sheets to highly intricate shapes.  The finished product is brittle  and will fracture, unless  |laminated|Laminated_Glass|  or specially treated,  but is extremely durable under most conditions.  It erodes very slowly  and can mostly withstand the action of water.  It is mostly resistant to chemical attack,  does not react with foods, and is an ideal material for the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs and most chemicals.  Glass is also a fairly inert substance.             Although glass is generally  |corrosion|Corrosion| -resistant  and more corrosion resistant than other materials, it still can be corroded. The materials that make up a particular glass composition have an effect on how quickly the glass corrodes. A glass containing a high proportion of alkalis  or alkali earths is less corrosion-resistant than other kinds of glasses.       |Glass_flakes|Glass_Flakes|  have applications as anti-corrosive coating.           Glass typically has a  |tensile_strength|Tensile_Strength|  of ,  however theoretically it can have a strength of  due to glasss strong chemical bonds. Several factors such as imperfections like scratches and bubbles  and the glasss chemical composition impact the tensile strength of glass.  Several processes such as  |toughening|Toughened_Glass|  can increase the strength of glass.             Following the  |glass_batch|Glass_Batch|  preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace.  |Soda_lime_glass|Soda_Lime_Glass|  for  |mass_production|Mass_Production|  is melted in  |gas_fired_units|Glass_Productionfurnace| . Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.   After melting, homogenization and  |refining|Refining|  , the glass is  |formed|Template_Glass_Forming| .  |Flat_glass|Flat_Glass|  for windows and similar applications is formed by the  |float_glass|Float_Glass|  process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir  |Alastair_Pilkington|Alastair_Pilkington|  and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UKs Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish.     |Container_glass|Container_Glass|  for common bottles and jars is formed by  |blowing_and_pressing|Glass_Container_Productionforming_Process|  methods.  This glass is often slightly modified chemically for greater water resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table  |Glass_forming_techniques|Template_Glass_Forming| .     Once the desired form is obtained, glass is usually  |annealed|Annealing|  for the removal of stresses and to increase the glasss hardness and durability.    Surface treatments, coatings or  |lamination|Lamination|  may follow to improve the chemical durability , strength , or optical properties .        Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions  that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles .    Ordinary  |soda_lime_glass|Soda_Lime_Glass|  appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  impurities of up to 0.1 wt%  produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and  |chromium_oxide|Chromium_Oxide|  additions may be used for the production of green bottles.  |Sulfur|Sulfur| , together with  |carbon|Carbon|  and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. David M Issitt.  1st.glassman.com. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere.   |Manganese_dioxide|Manganese_Dioxide|  can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron.   |Art_glass|Art_Glass|  and  |studio_glass|Studio_Glass|  pieces are colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and cook times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market, although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials.                           Naturally occurring glass, especially the  |volcanic_glass|Volcanic_Glass| |_obsidian|Obsidian| , was used by many  |Stone_Age|Stone_Age|  societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria,  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  or  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| .  The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of  |metal_working|Metalworking|   or during the production of  |faience|Egyptian_Faience| , a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing. True glazing over a ceramic body was not used until many centuries after the production of the first glass.     Glass remained a luxury material, and the  |disasters|Bronze_Age_Collapse|  that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. Indigenous development of glass technology in  |South_Asia|South_Asia|  may have begun in 1730 BCE.  In ancient China, though, glassmaking seems to have a late start, compared to ceramics and metal work. The term glass developed in the late  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| . It was in the  |Roman_glass|Roman_Glass| making center at  |Trier|Trier| , now in modern Germany, that the  |late_Latin|Late_Latin|  term glesum originated, probably from a  |Germanic|Germanic_Languages|  word for a  |transparent|Transparent_Materials| ,  |lustrous|Lustrous|  substance.  Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire  in domestic,  |funerary|Funerary| ,  and industrial contexts.  Examples of  |Roman_glass|Roman_Glass|  have been found outside of the former Roman Empire in  |China|China| ,  the  |Baltics|Baltic_Region| , the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  and  |India|India| .      Glass was used extensively during the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites.  Glass in the  |Anglo_Saxon_period|History_Of_Anglo_Saxon_England|  was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, windows,  beads,  and was also used in jewelry.  From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in  |stained_glass|Stained_Glass|  windows of churches and  |cathedrals|Cathedrals| , with famous examples at  |Chartres_Cathedral|Chartres_Cathedral|  and the  |Basilica_of_Saint_Denis|Basilica_Of_Saint_Denis| . By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as  |Sainte_Chapelle|Sainte_Chapelle| , Paris, Rene Hughe, Byzantine and Medieval Art, Paul Hamlyn, and the East end of  |Gloucester_Cathedral|Gloucester_Cathedral| . John Harvey, English Cathedrals, Batsford, Stained glass had a major revival with  |Gothic_Revival_architecture|Gothic_Revival_Architecture|  in the 19th century.  With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent.  The use of domestic stained glass increased  until most substantial houses had glass windows. These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets. This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings.     In the 20th century, new types of glass such as  |laminated_glass|Laminated_Glass| , reinforced glass and  |glass_bricks|Glass_Brick|   increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass.  Multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with  |curtain_walls|Curtain_Wall|  made almost entirely of glass.  Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens.  Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages.  The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers  as well as having other application in medicine and science.  Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many  |solar_energy|Solar_Energy|  collectors.      From the 19th century, there was a revival in many ancient glass-making techniques including  |cameo_glass|Cameo_Glass| , achieved for the first time since the Roman Empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a  |neo_classical|Neoclassicism|  style.  The  |Art_Nouveau|Art_Nouveau|  movement made great use of glass,  with  |RenÃ©_Lalique|RenÃ©_Lalique| ,  |Ã‰mile_GallÃ©|Ã‰mile_GallÃ©| , and  |Daum_of_Nancy|Daum|  producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using luster techniques.  |Louis_Comfort_Tiffany|Louis_Comfort_Tiffany|  in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps. The early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as  |Waterford|Waterford_Crystal|  and  |Lalique|Lalique| . From about 1960 onwards, there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part  |fine_arts|Fine_Art| .     In the 21st century, scientists observe the properties of ancient stained glass windows, in which suspended  |nanoparticles|Nanoparticle|  prevent UV light from causing chemical reactions that change image colors, are developing photographic techniques that use similar stained glass to capture true color images of  |Mars|Mars|  for the 2019  |ESA|Esa|  Mars Rover mission.        1226:  |Broad_Sheet|Broad_Sheet_Glass|  first produced in  |Sussex|Sussex| .    1330:  |Crown_glass|Crown_Glass|  for art work and vessels first produced in  |Rouen|Rouen| ,  |France|France| .  Broad Sheet also produced. Both were also supplied for export.   1500s: A method of making  |mirrors|Mirrors|  out of plate glass was developed by Venetian glassmakers on the island of  |Murano|Murano| , who covered the back of the glass with a mercury-tin  |amalgam|Amalgam| , obtaining near-perfect and undistorted reflection.   1620s:  |Blown_plate|Blown_Plate|  first produced in London. Used for mirrors and coach plates.    1678:  |Crown_glass|Crown_Glass|  first produced in London.  This process dominated until the 19th century.   1843: An early form of  |float_glass|Float_Glass|  invented by  |Henry_Bessemer|Henry_Bessemer| , pouring glass onto liquid tin. Expensive and not a commercial success.   1874:  |Tempered_glass|Tempered_Glass|  is developed by Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie of  |Paris|Paris| , France by quenching almost molten glass in a heated bath of oil or grease.   1888: Machine-rolled glass introduced, allowing patterns.    1898: Wired-cast glass first commercially produced by Pilkington  for use where safety or security was an issue.    1959: Float glass launched in UK. Invented by Sir  |Alastair_Pilkington|Alastair_Pilkington| . History of Glass Manufacture: London Crown Glass co.   |Sweden|Sweden| |_Kosta_Glasbruk|Kosta_Glasbruk| , with a  |pontil_mark|Pontil_Mark|  from the  |glassblowers|Glassblowing| |_Canterbury|Canterbury| ,  |England|England| |_Basilica_of_Saint_Denis|Basilica_Of_Saint_Denis|   Hardwick Hall , more glass than wall   Palacio de Cristal del Retiro  from  |Madrid|Madrid| |chemicals|Chemical|  are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment , or that the impurities are quantified .  Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g.,  |sodium_selenite|Sodium_Selenite|  may be preferred over easily evaporating  |selenium_dioxide|Selenium_Dioxide|  . Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively  |inert|Chemically_Inert|  ones, such as  |aluminum_hydroxide|Aluminium_Hydroxide|  over  |alumina|Aluminium_Oxide|  . Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass  |homogeneity|Homogeneous|  is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture , by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually  |annealed|Annealing|  to prevent breakage during processing.      To make glass from materials with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques are used to increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation triggers. Examples of these techniques include  |aerodynamic_levitation|Aerodynamic_Levitation|  ,  |splat_quenching|Splat_Quenching|  and roller quenching .              |Fiberglass|Fiberglass|   is a  |composite_material|Composite_Material|  made up of  |glass_fibers|Glass_Fiber|   embedded in a plastic  |resin|Resin| .   It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibers. These fibers are woven together into a cloth and left to set in a plastic resin.      Fiberglass filaments are made through a  |pultrusion|Pultrusion|  process in which the raw materials  are melted in a large furnace into a liquid which is extruded through very small orifices .      Fiberglass has the properties of being lightweight and corrosion resistant.   Fiberglass is also a good  |insulator|Insulator| ,  allowing it to be used to insulate buildings.  Most fiberglasses are not alkali resistant.  Fiberglass also has the property of becoming stronger as the glass ages.           Some types of glass that do not include silica as a major constituent may have physico-chemical properties useful for their application in  |fiber_optics|Fiber_Optics|  and other specialized technical applications.  These include  |fluoride_glass|Fluoride_Glass| ,  |aluminate|Aluminate|  and  |aluminosilicate|Aluminosilicate|  glass,  |phosphate_glass|Phosphate_Glass| ,  |borate_glass|Borate_Glass| , and  |chalcogenide_glass|Chalcogenide_Glass| .     There are three classes of components for oxide glass: network formers, intermediates, and modifiers.  The network formers form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds. The intermediates can act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition.  The modifiers alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge to compensate for the positive ion nearby.  Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network former , or as a modifier.      The presence of non-bridging oxygens lowers the relative number of strong bonds in the material and disrupts the network, decreasing the  |viscosity|Viscosity|  of the melt and lowering the melting temperature.     The alkali metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a degree of  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity| , especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glass types contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions , for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance.  Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by  |dealkalization|Dealkalization| , removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface  by reaction with sulfur or fluorine compounds.  Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the  |loss_tangent|Loss_Tangent|  of the glass,  and to its  |electrical_resistance|Electrical_Resistance| ; glass manufactured for electronics have to take this in account.     Addition of  |lead_oxide|Lead_Oxide|  lowers melting point, lowers  |viscosity|Viscosity|  of the melt, and increases  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index| . Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glass. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant ; this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in  |vitreous_enamels|Vitreous_Enamel|  and  |glass_solders|Glass_Solder| . The high  |ionic_radius|Ionic_Radius|  of the Pb 2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass . For more details, see  |lead_glass|Lead_Glass| .      Addition of  |fluorine|Fluorine|  lowers the  |dielectric_constant|Dielectric_Constant|  of glass. Fluorine is highly  |electronegative|Electronegative|  and attracts the electrons in the lattice, lowering the polarizability of the material. Such silicon dioxide-fluoride is used in manufacture of  |integrated_circuits|Integrated_Circuit|  as an insulator. High levels of fluorine doping lead to formation of volatile SiF 2 O and such glass is then thermally unstable. Stable layers were achieved with dielectric constant down to about 3.5â€“3.7.              In the past, small batches of  |amorphous_metals|Amorphous_Metal|  with high surface area configurations have been produced through the implementation of extremely rapid rates of cooling. This was initially termed splat cooling by doctoral student W. Klement at Caltech, who showed that cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become locked into a glassy state. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter. These are known as bulk metallic glasses .  |Liquidmetal_Technologies|Liquidmetal|  sell a number of zirconium-based BMGs. Batches of amorphous steel have also been produced that demonstrate mechanical properties far exceeding those found in conventional steel alloys.        In 2004,  |NIST|Nist|  researchers presented evidence that an  |isotropic|Isotropic|  non-crystalline metallic phase could be grown from the melt. This phase is the first phase, or primary phase , to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition.  |Transmission_electron_microscopy|Transmission_Electron_Microscopy|  images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The  |diffraction_pattern|X_Ray_Scattering_Techniques|  shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a  |nucleation|Nucleation|  barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity between the glass and the melt.          |Electrolytes|Electrolyte|  or molten  |salts|Salt|  are mixtures of different  |ions|Ion| . In a mixture of three or more ionic species of dissimilar size and shape, crystallization can be so difficult that the liquid can easily be supercooled into a glass.   The best-studied example is Ca 0.4 K 0.6 1.4 . Glass electrolytes in the form of Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba-doped Na-glass have been proposed as solutions to problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion battery cells.        Some  |aqueous_solutions|Aqueous_Solution|  can be supercooled into a glassy state,   for instance LiCl:RH 2 O  in the composition range 4  .
