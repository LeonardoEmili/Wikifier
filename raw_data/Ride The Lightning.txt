              Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music|  band  |Metallica|Metallica| , released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label  |Megaforce_Records|Megaforce_Records| . The album was recorded in three weeks with producer  |Flemming_Rasmussen|Flemming_Rasmussen|  at the  |Sweet_Silence_Studios|Sweet_Silence_Studios|  in  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen| , Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an  |electric_chair|Electric_Chair|  being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in  |Stephen_Kings|Stephen_King|  novel  The Stand . Although rooted in the  |thrash_metal|Thrash_Metal|  genre, the album showcased the bands musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist  |Cliff_Burton|Cliff_Burton|  introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying heavily on fast tempos as on its debut  Kill Em All , Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallicas European label  |Music_for_Nations|Music_For_Nations|  because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist  |Dave_Mustaine|Dave_Mustaine| , and the first to feature contributions from his replacement,  |Kirk_Hammett|Kirk_Hammett| .     Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesnt Bang European  |tour|Ridethelightningtour|  in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as  |Monsters_of_Rock|Monsters_Of_Rock|  and  |Day_on_the_Green|Day_On_The_Green|  later that year. Two months after its release,  |Elektra_Records|Elektra_Records|  signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200|  with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified  |6Ã—_platinum|Riaa_Certification|  by the  |Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|Recording_Industry_Association_Of_America|  in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on the genre.        |Metallica|Metallica|  released their debut album,  Kill Em All , on the independent label  |Megaforce_Records|Megaforce_Records|  on July 25, 1983. The album helped to establish  |thrash_metal|Thrash_Metal| , a  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music|  subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material, and from September, began performing the songs that were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans homes while playing at clubs across the United States. An incident occurred when part of Metallicas gear was stolen in  |Boston|Boston| , and  |Anthrax|Anthrax|  lent Metallica some of its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in  |El_Cerrito,_California|El_Cerrito,_California| , called the Metallica Mansion.  Frontman  |James_Hetfield|James_Hetfield|  felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar, so the band offered the job to  |Armored_Saint|Armored_Saint|  singer  |John_Bush|John_Bush| , who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at  |Sweet_Silence_Studios|Sweet_Silence_Studios|  in  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen| , Denmark. The album was produced by  |Flemming_Rasmussen|Flemming_Rasmussen| , the founder of Sweet Silence Studios. Drummer  |Lars_Ulrich|Lars_Ulrich|  chose Rasmussen, because he liked his work on  |Rainbows|Rainbow|   Difficult to Cure  , and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the bands talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallicas tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the albums material at  |Mercyful_Fates|Mercyful_Fate|  practice room in Copenhagen.          Before entering the studio, Metallica collected ideas on riff tape recordings of various jam sessions. Hetfield and Ulrich went through the tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with only Hetfield playing rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, with the support of drum  |roadie|Roadie|  Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of  |timing|Timing|  and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse at the back of the studio, which was not soundproof, and caused  |reverberation|Reverberation| . Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for Kill Em All.  |For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls|For_Whom_The_Bell_Tolls|  , Trapped Under Ice and Escape were written mostly in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on Fight Fire with Fire , Ride the Lightning ,  |Creeping_Death|Creeping_Death|  , and The Call of Ktulu , which were already performed live. Lead guitarist  |Kirk_Hammett|Kirk_Hammett|  took the albums name from a passage in  |Stephen_Kings|Stephen_King|  novel  The Stand .  The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had sound problems, because its gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. The band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night, because the studio was booked by other artists during the daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several  |A_&_R|Artists_And_Repertoire|  representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first, it seemed that Metallica was going to sign with  |Bronze_Records|Bronze_Records| , but the deal fell through, because Bronze executive  |Gerry_Bron|Gerry_Bron|  did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence Studios, and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer  |Eddie_Kramer|Eddie_Kramer| , and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Brons failure to share the bands artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, in spite of the fact that Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of their bands.     Metallica had to record quickly because of European shows scheduled 29 days after it entered the studio. Recording finished on March 14, and Megaforce released the album on July 27. Although the original album budget was $20,000, the final expense was above $30,000. Metallicas European label  |Music_for_Nations|Music_For_Nations|  paid the studio costs because Megaforce owner  |Jon_Zazula|Jon_Zazula|  could not afford them. Metallica was unhappy with the lack of promotion by Megaforce, and decided to part ways with Zazula. Major label  |Elektra_Records|Elektra_Records|  employee Michael Alago noticed Metallica at The Stone gig in San Francisco, and invited Elektras chairman and the head of promotion to see the August show in New York. The performance at  |Roseland_Ballroom|Roseland_Ballroom| , with Anthrax and Metallica opening for  |Raven|Raven| , pleased the Elektra staff, and the band was offered a contract the following morning. On September 12, Metallica signed with Elektra, who re-released the album on November 19. Cliff Burnstein and  |Peter_Mensch|Peter_Mensch|  of Q Prime were concurrently appointed as the bands new managers. Ride the Lightning was the last Metallica album to feature co-writing contributions from former lead guitarist  |Dave_Mustaine|Dave_Mustaine| , who received credit on the title track and the instrumental The Call of Ktulu . The album also represented the first time Hammett was given writing credits.       Music writers opine that Ride the Lightning exhibited greater musical maturity, with sonically broader songs than Kill Em All, which was noted for its one-dimensional sound. This was partially because of bassist  |Cliff_Burtons|Cliff_Burton|  knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony worked, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. Grinder magazines Kevin Fisher summarized the album as ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur that reminded him of the speed and power of Kill Em All. Music journalist  |Martin_Popoff|Martin_Popoff|  observed that Ride the Lightning offered sophistication and brutality in equal measure and was seen as something new at the time of its release. Discussing the albums lyrical content, philosopher  |William_Irwin|William_Irwin|  wrote: After Kill Em All, the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was deeply concerned about various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived. More precisely, they were highly critical of those in power .          The major-key acoustic introduction to Fight Fire with Fire displayed Metallicas evolution towards a more harmonically complex style of songwriting. The fastest Metallica song in terms of picking speed, it is driven by nimbly  |tremolo-picked|Tremolo_Picking|  riffs in the verses and chorus. The extended solo at the end dissolves in a sound effect of a vast nuclear explosion. The main riff was taped during the  |Kill_Em_All_Tour|Kill_Em_All_Tour|  and the acoustic intro was something Burton was playing on acoustic guitar at the time.  The song discouraged the  |eye_for_an_eye|Eye_For_An_Eye|  approach, and its lyrical themes focused on nuclear warfare and  |Armageddon|Armageddon| . Ride the Lightning was Metallicas first song to emphasize the misery of the criminal justice system. The lyrics were written from the perspective of someone who is anticipating execution by the electric chair. The song, one of the two album tracks that credited Mustaine, begins in a mid-tempo which gradually accelerates as the song progress. One of the riffs in this song, originally composed by Mustaine, was simplified because Hetfield and Hammett were unable to play it the way Mustaine had written it using more advanced left-hand fingering. It features an instrumental middle section highlighted by Hammetts soloing. According to Hetfield, the song was not a criticism of capital punishment, but a tale of a man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, as in the opening lyrics: Guilty as charged/But damn/It aint right .           For Whom the Bell Tolls begins with a bell tolling, followed by a marching riff and high-register bass melody. The chromatic introduction, which Burton wrote before he joined Metallica, is often mistaken for an electric guitar but is actually Burtons bass guitar augmented with  |distortion|Distortion|  and a  |wah-wah_pedal|Wah-Wah_Pedal| . The lyrics were inspired by  |Ernest_Hemingways|Ernest_Hemingway|  1940  |novel_of_the_same_name|For_Whom_The_Bell_Tolls| , which explores the horror and dishonor of modern warfare. For Whom the Bell Tolls was released as a promotional single in two versions, an edit on side A and the album version on side B.  |Fade_to_Black|Fade_To_Black|  is a  |power_ballad|Power_Ballad|  whose lyrics contemplate suicide. Hetfield wrote the words because he felt powerless after the bands equipment was stolen before the January 1984 show in Boston. Musically, the song begins with an acoustic guitar introduction overlaid with electric soloing. The song becomes progressively heavier and faster, ending with multi-layered guitar solos. The ballads  |arpeggiated_chords|Arpeggio|  and reserved singing was incongruous for thrash metal bands at the time and disappointed some of Metallicas fans. The songs structure foreshadows later Metallica ballads, Welcome Home ,  |One|One|  and  |The_Day_That_Never_Comes|The_Day_That_Never_Comes| . Fade to Black was released as a promotional single in 1984, in  |glow_in_the_dark|Phosphorescence|  green.     Trapped Under Ice is about a person who wakes from a cryonic state. Realizing there is nowhere to go, and no-one will come to the rescue, the person helplessly awaits impending doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the albums opener. It was inspired by a track Hammetts former band  |Exodus|Exodus|  had demoed called Impaler , which was later released on that bands 2004 album  Tempo of the Damned .  Escape was originally titled The Hammer and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard  |down-stroked|Downpicking|  riff. Escape is Hetfields most hated Metallica song, due to it being the result of their record company forcing Metallica to write something more radio friendly. Authors  |Mick_Wall|Mick_Wall|  and  |Malcolm_Dome|Malcolm_Dome|  felt the song was influenced by the  |album-oriented_rock|Album-Oriented_Rock|  of 1970s bands such as  |Journey|Journey|  and  |Foreigner|Foreigner| , but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay at rock radio. Metallica performed Escape live only once, at the 2012  |Orion_Music_+_More|Orion_Music_&_Nbsp;+_More|  festival, while performing Ride the Lightning in its entirety.      Creeping Death describes the  |Plague_of_the_Death_of_the_Firstborn|Plagues_Of_Egypt10._Death_Of_Firstborn_:_Ex._11:1â€“12:36|  . The lyrics deal with the ten plagues visited on  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ; four of them are mentioned throughout the song, as well as the  |Passover|Passover| . The title was inspired by a scene from  The Ten Commandments  while the band was watching the movie at Burtons house. The bridge, with its chant Die, by my hand! , was originally written by Hammett for the song Die by His Hand while he was playing in Exodus, who recorded it as a demo but did not feature it on a studio album. Journalist  |Joel_McIver|Joel_Mciver|  called the song a  |moshpit|Moshpit|  anthem due to its epic lyrical themes and dramatic atmosphere. Creeping Death was released as a single with a B-side titled Garage Days Revisited made up of covers of  |Diamond_Heads|Diamond_Head| |Am_I_Evil?|Am_I_Evil?|  and  |Blitzkriegs|Blitzkrieg|  Blitzkrieg .  The Call of Ktulu , tentatively titled When Hell Freezes Over , was inspired by  |H._P._Lovecrafts|H._&_Nbsp;P._Lovecraft|  book  The Shadow over Innsmouth , which was introduced to the rest of the band by Burton. The title was taken from one of Lovecrafts key stories featuring Cthulhu,  The Call of Cthulhu , although the original name was modified to Ktulu for easier pronunciation. The track begins with a D minor chord progression in the intro, written by Mustaine  followed by a two-minute bass solo over a rhythmic riff pattern. Conductor  |Michael_Kamen|Michael_Kamen|  rearranged the piece for Metallicas 1999  S & M  project and won a  |Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rock_Instrumental_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Rock_Instrumental_Performance|  in 2001.             Ride the Lightning received widespread acclaim from music critics. According to  |Q|Q|  magazine, the album confirmed Metallicas status as the leading heavy metal band of the modern era. The magazine credited the group for redefining the norms of thrash metal with Fade to Black , the genres first power ballad. British rock magazine  Kerrang!  stated that the albums maturity and musical intelligence helped Metallica expand heavy metals boundaries.  |Greg_Kot|Greg_Kot|  of the  Chicago Tribune  described Ride the Lightning as a more refined extension of the groups debut. In a retrospective review,  |Sputnikmusics|Sputnikmusic|  Channing Freeman named it as one of the few albums that can be charming and powerful at the same time. He praised Hetfields vocal performance and concluded that Metallica was firing on all cylinders .  |AllMusics|Allmusic|  Steve Huey saw the album as a more ambitious and remarkable effort than Kill Em All. He called Ride the Lightning an all-time metal classic because of the bands rich musical imagination and lyrics that avoided heavy metal cliches.  The Rolling Stone Album Guide  viewed the album as a great step forward for the band and as an album that established the concept for Metallicas following two records.  |Colin_Larkin|Colin_Larkin| , writing in the  Encyclopedia of Popular Music , singled out For Whom the Bell Tolls as an example of Metallicas growing music potential. Popoff regards Ride the Lightning as an album where  |extreme_metal|Extreme_Metal|  became art . This literally was the first album since   Sad Wings of Destiny  where the rulebook has changed. This was a new kind of heaviness; the soft, billowy but explosive production was amazing, the speed was superhuman , stated Popoff. Reviewing the 2016 reissue, Jason Anderson of  Uncut  considers Ride the Lightning the second best Metallica album which set the pace for metal in the years to come.      Megaforce initially pressed 75,000 copies of the album for the US market, while Music for Nations took care of the European market. By the autumn of 1984, Ride the Lightning had moved 85,000 copies in Europe, resulting in Metallicas first cover story for Kerrang! in its December issue. After signing Metallica, Elektra released the single Creeping Death in a sleeve depicting a bridge and a skull painted grey and green. The album peaked at number 100 on the  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200|  with no radio exposure. In 1984, the French record label Bernett Records misprinted the color of the album cover in green, rather than blue, and 400 copies with the green cover were produced. Because of their rarity, these green albums have become collectors items.  Ride the Lightning went gold by November 1987 and in 2012 was certified  |6Ã—_platinum|Riaa_Certification|  by the  |Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|Recording_Industry_Association_Of_America|  for shipping six million copies in the US. The album, along with Kill Em All, was reissued in 2016 as a boxed set including demos and live recordings.  Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists. The album placed fifth on  |IGN_Musics|Ign_Music|  Top 25 Metal Albums list.   Spin  listed it as a thrash metal essential, declaring it the thrashiest thrash ever .  According to  Guitar World , Ride the Lightning didnt just change the bands trajectoryâ€”it reset the course of metal itself . Corey Deiterman of the  Houston Press  considers Ride the Lightning the most influential Metallica album, saying it had a lasting impact on genres such as  |crossover_thrash|Crossover_Thrash|  and  |hardcore_punk|Hardcore_Punk| .  In 2017, it was ranked 11th on  Rolling Stone  list of 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time .             After recording was completed, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker wanted to arrange a triple bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with  |Exciter|Exciter| , Metallica, and  |The_Rods|The_Rods| . The Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote Ride the Lightning, Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesnt Bang European tour on November 16, in  |Rouen|Rouen| , France, with British  |NWOBHM|New_Wave_Of_British_Heavy_Metal|  band  |Tank|Tank|  as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, firstly as a co-headlining act with  |W.A.S.P.|W.A.S.P.|  and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting.  At a gig in  |Portland,_Oregon|Portland,_Oregon| , Metallica covered The Money Will Roll Right In by  |Fang|Fang| , with Armored Saint onstage. The American leg ended in May 1985, and the band spent the following two months working on the next studio album,  Master of Puppets , whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the  |Monsters_of_Rock|Monsters_Of_Rock|  festival held at  |Castle_Donington|Castle_Donington|  in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between  |Ratt|Ratt|  and  |Bon_Jovi|Bon_Jovi| , two  |glam_metal|Glam_Metal|  groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallicas. At the start of the set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: If you came here to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words oh baby in every fuckin song, this aint the fuckin band! Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the  |Day_on_the_Green|Day_On_The_Green|  festival in  |Oakland,_California|Oakland,_California| , before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the  |Loreley|Loreley|  Metal Hammer festival in Germany, headlined by  |Venom|Venom| . Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the  |Sacramento_Memorial_Auditorium|Sacramento_Memorial_Auditorium|  on December 29 opening for  |Y_&_T|Y_&_T| , and a New Years Eve concert at the  |Civic_Auditorium|Bill_Graham_Civic_Auditorium|  in San Francisco on a bill with  |Metal_Church|Metal_Church| ,  |Exodus|Exodus| , and  |Megadeth|Megadeth| , the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered  |Master_of_Puppets|Master_Of_Puppets|  and Disposable Heroes , songs from the then-upcoming third studio album.
