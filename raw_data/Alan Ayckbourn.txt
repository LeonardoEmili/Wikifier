Ayckbourn was born in  |Hampstead|Hampstead| , London. P. Allen, 2001, p. 9   accessed 17 April 2019 His mother Irene Worley was a writer of short stories who published under the name Mary James . P. Allen, 2001, p. 10 His father, Horace Ayckbourn , was an orchestral violinist, at one time deputy leader of the  |London_Symphony_Orchestra|London_Symphony_Orchestra| . P. Allen, 2001, p. 6 His parents, who separated shortly after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , never married, and Ayckbourns mother divorced her first husband to marry again in 1948.     Ayckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge  when he was about 10. P. Allen, 2001, p. 20 Whilst at prep school as a boarder, his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager. When he went home for the holidays, his new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfathers son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 17–19     Ayckbourn attended  |Haileybury_and_Imperial_Service_College|Haileybury_And_Imperial_Service_College| , in the village of  |Hertford_Heath|Hertford_Heath| , and whilst there toured Europe and America with the schools Shakespeare company. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 30–33         After leaving school at 17, Ayckbourns career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary job at the  |Scarborough_Library_Theatre|Stephen_Joseph_Theatre| , where he was introduced to the artistic director,  |Stephen_Joseph|Stephen_Joseph| . P. Allen, 2001, pp. 43–46 It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967, P. Allen, 2001, pp. 118–119 and he has consistently spoken highly of him. Ayckbourn, Alan . The Crafty Art of Playmaking, Faber,      Ayckbourns career was briefly interrupted when he was called for  |National_Service|National_Service| . He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 72–75 Although Ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, the house formerly owned by  |Stephen_Joseph|Stephen_Joseph| . P. Allen, 2001, pp. 145–146     In 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company,   accessed 5 January 2009 P. Allen, 2001, pp. 297–299 P. Allen, 2001, pp. 65–67 and indeed Ayckbourns first two plays were written jointly with her under the pseudonym of Roland Allen . P. Allen, 2001, pp. 67–72 They had two sons, Steven and Philip. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 69, 85 However, the marriage had difficulties which eventually led to their separation in 1971. Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Roland became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. Around this time, he started to share a home with Heather Stoney, P. Allen, 2001, p. 132 an actress he had first met ten years earlier. P. Allen, 2001, p. 88 Like his mother, neither he nor Roland sought a divorce for the next thirty years and it was only in 1997 that they formally divorced; Ayckbourn married Stoney. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 297–298 One side-effect of the timing is that, as Ayckbourn was awarded a  |knighthood|Knight_Bachelor|  a few months before the divorce, P. Allen, 2001, p. 295 both his first and second wife were entitled to take the title of Lady Ayckbourn.     In February 2006, he suffered a  |stroke|Stroke|  in Scarborough, and stated: I hope to be back on my feet, or should I say my left leg, as soon as possible, but I know it is going to take some time. In the meantime I am in excellent hands and so is the Stephen Joseph Theatre.  He left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months,  but the following year he announced he would step down as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.  Ayckbourn, however, continues to write and direct his own work at the theatre.         Since Ayckbourns plays started becoming established in the West End, interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is autobiographical. P. Allen, 2001, p. 123 There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre. P. Allen, 2001, Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in  Bedroom Farce  , he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play. P. Allen, 2001, p. 155 It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in  Woman in Mind  P. Allen, 2001, p. 3 .     What is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourns life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents relationships as well as those of some of his friends. Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allens biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in  A Chorus of Disapproval  . Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Stoney. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 209–210 But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allens view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.     It could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man, it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in Cosmopolitan that his plays were becoming autobiographical: If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasnt started.             On leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir  |Donald_Wolfit|Donald_Wolfit|  by his French master. P. Allen, 2001, p. 32 Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the  |Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe|Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe|  as an acting assistant stage manager for three weeks, P. Allen, 2001, pp. 36–38 with his first role on the professional stage being various parts in The Strong are Lonely by  |Fritz_Hochwälder|Fritz_Hochwälder| .  In the following year, Ayckbourn appeared in six other plays at the Connaught Theatre,  |Worthing|Worthing| , P. Allen, 2001, pp. 38–40 and the Thorndyke theatre,  |Leatherhead|Leatherhead| . P. Allen, 2001, pp. 41–43     In 1957, Ayckbourn was employed by the director  |Stephen_Joseph|Stephen_Joseph|  at the Library Theatre,  |Scarborough|Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire| , the predecessor to the modern  |Stephen_Joseph_Theatre|Stephen_Joseph_Theatre| . His role, again, was initially an acting stage manager. This employment led to Ayckbourns first professional script commission, in 1958. When he complained about the quality of a script he was performing, Joseph challenged him to write a better one. The result was The Square Cat, written under the pseudonym Roland Allen and first performed in 1959. P. Allen, 2001, p. 65 In this play, Ayckbourn himself played the character Jerry Watiss.     After thirty-four appearances in plays at the Library Theatre, including four of his own, in 1962 Ayckbourn moved to  |Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-On-Trent|  to help set up the Victoria Theatre, , P. Allen, 2001, pp. 87–88 where he appeared in a further eighteen plays. His final appearance in one of his own plays was as the Crimson Gollywog in the disastrous childrens play Christmas v Mastermind. P. Allen, 2001, p. 90 He left the Stoke company in 1964, officially to commit his time to the London production of Mr. Whatnot, but reportedly because was having trouble working with the artistic director,  |Peter_Cheeseman|Peter_Cheeseman| . P. Allen, 2001, pp. 98–99 By now, his career as a writer was coming to fruition, and his acting career was sidelined.     His final role on stage was as Jerry in  Two for the Seesaw  by  |William_Gibson|William_Gibson| , at the  |Civic_Theatre|Rotherham_Civic_Theatre_And_Arts_Centre|  in  |Rotherham|Rotherham| . He was left stranded on stage because Heather Stoney was unable to re-appear because the props had been left unpacked, and this led him to decide acting was more trouble than it was worth. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 99–100 The assistant stage manager on the production,  |Bill_Kenwright|Bill_Kenwright| , would become one of the UKs most successful producers.         Ayckbourns earliest plays were written and produced at a time when the Scarborough Library theatre, like most regional theatres, regularly commissioned work from their own actors to keep costs down .   on Samuel French website His first play, The Square Cat, was sufficiently popular locally to secure further commissions although not this or the following three plays had much impact beyond Scarborough. History of early plays on official Ayckbourn site     But, after his transfer to  |Victoria_Theatre|New_Vic_Theatre|  in  |Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-On-Trent| , there came Christmas v Mastermind, which flopped and is now universally regarded as Ayckbourns greatest disaster.   on official Ayckbourn site. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 89–90     His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with Mr. Whatnot, again premiering at the Victoria Theatre. This was the first play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow performances today, and the first play to receive a  |West_End|West_End_Theatre|  performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part down to misguided casting. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 96, 101–102  on official Ayckbourn site. After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, first writing a monologue for  |Tommy_Cooper|Tommy_Cooper| , and later with  |Ronnie_Barker|Ronnie_Barker| , who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of Mr Whatnot in 1964, for the scripts of for  |LWTs|London_Weekend_Television|   Hark at Barker . Ayckbourn used the pseudonym Peter Caulfield because he was under exclusive contract to the  |BBC|Bbc|  at the time. P. Allen, 2001, p. 108     Then, in 1965, back at the Scarborough Library Theatre, Meet my Father was produced, later retitled  Relatively Speaking . This time, the play was a massive success, both in Scarborough and the West End, making Alan Ayckbourn rich and earning him a congratulatory telegram from  |Noël_Coward|Noël_Coward| . P. Allen, 2001, pp. 109–113   on official Ayckbourn site This was not quite the end of Ayckbourns hit-and-miss record, because his following play,  The Sparrow  only ran for three weeks at Scarborough. P. Allen, 2001, p. 119  on official Ayckbourn site However, the following play,  How the Other Half Loves , secured his runaway success as a playwright. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 122–123  on official Ayckbourn site     The height of Ayckbourns commercial success included  Absurd Person Singular  ,  The Norman Conquests  trilogy ,  Bedroom Farce  and Just Between Ourselves , all plays that focused heavily on marriage in the British middle classes. The only failure during this period was a 1975 musical with  |Andrew_Lloyd_Webber|Andrew_Lloyd_Webber| ,  Jeeves , and even this did little to dent Ayckbourns popularity. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 146–148   on official Ayckbourn site Although his plays have received major West End productions almost from the beginning of his writing career, and hence have been reviewed in  |British_newspapers|United_Kingdom_Newspapers| , Ayckbourns work was for years routinely dismissed as being too slight for serious study. Recently, scholars have begun to view Ayckbourn as an important commentator on the lifestyles of the British  |suburb|Suburb| an  |middle_class|Middle_Class| , and as a stylistic innovator who experiments with theatrical styles within the boundaries set by popular tastes.     From the 1980s, Ayckbourn began to move away from the recurring themes of marriage and explore other contemporary themes, one example being  Woman in Mind , a play performed entirely from the perspective of a Woman going through a nervous breakdown. P. Allen, 2001, pp. 213–217  on official Ayckbourn site He also experimented with several more unconventional ways of writing plays, such as Intimate Exchanges, which has one beginning and sixteen possible endings, and  House & Garden , where two plays take place simultaneously of two different stages, as well as diversifying into childrens theatre                  .
