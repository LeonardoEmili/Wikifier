He is an extra-dimensional being of unknown origin who possesses immeasurable power over normal human notions of time, space, the laws of physics, and reality itself, being capable of altering it to his whim. Despite his vast knowledge and experience spanning untold eons , he is not above practical jokes for his own personal amusement, for a Machiavellian and manipulative purpose, or to prove a point. He is said to be almost  |omnipotent|Omnipotence| , and he is continually evasive regarding his true motivations.     The name Q applies to the names of the individuals portrayed , it also applies to the name of their race and to the Q Continuum itself – an  |alternate_dimension|Parallel_Universe|  accessible to only the Q and their invited guests.

Beginning with the pilot episode  |Encounter_at_Farpoint|Encounter_At_Farpoint|  of  The Next Generation , Q became a recurring character, with pronounced comedic and dramatic chemistry with  |Jean-Luc_Picard|Jean-Luc_Picard| . He serves as a major antagonist throughout The Next Generation, playing a pivotal role in both the first and final episodes. Q is initially presented as a cosmic force judging humanity to see if it is becoming a threat to the universe, but as the series progresses, his role morphs more into one of a teacher to Picard and the human race generally – albeit often in seemingly destructive or disruptive ways, subject to his own amusement. Other times, notably during  |Deja_Q|Deja_Q|  and Voyager, Q appears to the crew seeking assistance.      |Gene_Roddenberry|Gene_Roddenberry|  chose the letter  |Q|Q|  in honor of his friend, Janet Quarton.
