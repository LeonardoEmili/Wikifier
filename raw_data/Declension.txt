      In  |linguistics|Linguistics| , declension is the changing of the form of a  |word|Word| , generally to express its syntactic function in the sentence, by way of some  |inflection|Inflection| . The inflectional change of verbs is called  |conjugation|Grammatical_Conjugation| .     Declensions may apply to  |nouns|Noun| ,  |pronouns|Pronoun| ,  |adjectives|Adjective| ,  |adverbs|Adverb| , and  |articles|Article|  to indicate  |number|Grammatical_Number|  ,  |case|Grammatical_Case|  ,  |gender|Grammatical_Gender|  , and a number of other  |grammatical_categories|Grammatical_Categories| .     Declension occurs in many of the worlds languages. Declension is an important aspect of language families like  |American|Indigenous_Languages_Of_The_Americas|  ,  |Indo_European|Indo_European_Languages|  ,  |Bantu|Bantu_Languages|  ,  |Semitic|Semitic_Languages|  ,  |Finno_Ugric|Finno_Ugric_Languages|  ,  |Turkic|Turkic_Languages|  .      |Old_English|Old_English|  was an inflectional language, but greatly abandoned inflectional changes as it evolved into  |Modern_English|Modern_English| . Though traditionally classified as  |synthetic|Synthetic_Language| , Modern English has moved towards an  |analytic_language|Analytic_Language| .       It is agreed that  |Ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greeks|  had a vague idea of the forms of a noun in their language. A fragment of  |Anacreon|Anacreon|  seems to confirm this idea. Nevertheless, it cannot be concluded that the Ancient Greeks actually knew what the cases were. The  |Stoics|Stoics|  developed many basic notions that today are the rudiments of  |linguistics|Linguistics| . The idea of grammatical cases is also traced back to the Stoics, but its still not completely clear what the Stoics exactly meant with their notion of cases.            In  |Modern_English|Modern_English| , the system of declensions is very simple compared to some other languages, so much so that the term declension is rarely applied to English in practice. Most nouns in English have distinct singular and plural forms and have distinct plain and  |possessive|Possessive|  forms. Plurality is most commonly shown by the  |affix|Affix|  -s , whereas possession is always shown by the  |clitic|Clitic|  -s  attached to the noun. Consider, for example, the forms of the noun girl     Most speakers pronounce all of the forms other than the singular plain form  exactly the same . By contrast, a few nouns are slightly more complex in their forms. For example:          In that example, all four forms are pronounced in a distinct manner.     There can be other derivations from nouns that are not usually considered declensions. For example, the proper noun Britain has the associated descriptive adjective British and the demonym Briton. Though these words are clearly related and are generally considered cognates, they are not specifically treated as forms of the same word and thus not declensions.     Pronouns in English have even more complex declensions. For example:          Whereas nouns do not distinguish between the  |subjective_|Nominative_Case|  and  |_objective_|Oblique_Case|  cases, some pronouns do; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a  |verb|Verb|  or  |preposition|Preposition| , or  |case|Grammatical_Case| . Consider the difference between he and him , as in He saw it and It saw him ; similarly, consider  who , which is subjective, and the objective whom .     The one situation where gender is still clearly part of the English language is in the pronouns for the third person singular. Consider the following:          The distinguishing of neuter for persons and non-persons is somewhat peculiar to English. This has existed since the 14th century.   However, the use of the so-called singular they is often restricted to specific contexts, depending on the dialect or the speaker. It is most typically used to refer to a single person of unknown gender . Its use has expanded in recent years due to increasing social recognition of persons who do not identify themselves as male or female.  Note that the singular they still uses plural verb forms, reflecting its origins.     For nouns, in general, gender is not declined in Modern English, or at best one could argue there are isolated situations certain nouns may be modified to reflect gender, though not in a systematic fashion. Loan words from other languages, particularly Latin and the Romance languages, often preserve their gender-specific forms in English, e.g. alumnus and alumna . Similarly, names borrowed from other languages show comparable distinctions: Andrew and Andrea, Paul and Paula, etc. Additionally, suffixes such as -ess, -ette, and -er are sometimes applied to create overtly gendered versions of nouns, with marking for feminine being much more common than marking for masculine. Many nouns can actually function as members of two genders or even all three, and the gender classes of English nouns are usually determined by their agreement with pronouns, rather than marking on the nouns themselves.     Most adjectives are not declined. However, when used as nouns rather than adjectives, they do decline . Also, the demonstrative determiners this and that are declined for number, as these and those. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can be, declined for gender, at least in writing: blond and blonde . Adjectives are not declined for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The  |article|English_Articles|  is never regarded as declined in Modern English, although formally, the words that and possibly  she  correspond to forms of the predecessor of the  as it was declined in Old English.            Just as verbs in  |Latin|Latin|  are conjugated to indicate grammatical information, Latin nouns and adjectives that modify them are declined to signal their roles in sentences. There are five important cases for Latin nouns:  |nominative|Nominative_Case| ,  |genitive|Genitive_Case| ,  |dative|Dative_Case| ,  |accusative|Accusative_Case| , and  |ablative|Ablative| . Since the  |vocative|Vocative_Case|  case  |usually|Vocativecaselatin|  takes the same form as the nominative, it is seldom spelt out in grammar books. Yet another case, the  |locative|Locative_Case| , is limited to a small number of words.     The usual basic functions of these cases are as follows:   Nominative case indicates the  |subject|Subject| .   Genitive case indicates  |possession|Possessive|  and can be translated with ‘of’.   Dative case marks the  |indirect_object|Object|  and can be translated with ‘to’ or ‘for’.   Accusative case marks the  |direct_object|Object| .   Ablative case is used to modify verbs and can be translated as ‘by’, ‘with’, ‘from’, etc.   Vocative case is used to address a person or thing.     The genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative also have important functions to indicate the object of a preposition.     Given below is the declension paradigm of Latin puer ‘boy’ and puella ‘girl’:        From the provided examples we can see how cases work:     liber puerī → the book of the boy    puer puellae rosam dat → the boy gives the girl a rose           Sanskrit, another Indo-European language, has eight cases:  |nominative|Nominative| ,  |vocative|Vocative_Case| ,  |accusative|Accusative_Case| ,  |genitive|Genitive| ,  |dative|Dative_Case| ,  |ablative|Ablative_Case| ,  |locative|Locative_Case|  and  |instrumental|Instrumental_Case| .  |James_Clackson|James_Clackson|  , p.90 Some do not count vocative as a separate case, despite it having a distinctive ending in the singular, but consider it as a different use of the nominative.
