In this case, the freight and other expenses for outbound traffic are borne by the importer.   Carriage and freight : Insurance is payable by the importer, and the exporter pays all expenses incurred in transporting the cargo from its place of origin to the port/airport and ocean freight/air freight to the port/airport of destination. For example, C & F Los Angeles . Most of the governments ask their exporters to trade on these terms to promote their exports worldwide such as India and China. Many of the shipping carriers  offer guarantees on their delivery times. These are known as GSR guarantees or guaranteed service refunds ; if the parcels are not delivered on time, the customer is entitled to a refund.   Carriage, insurance and freight : Insurance and freight are all paid by the exporter to the specified location. For example, at CIF Los Angeles, the exporter pays the ocean shipping/air freight costs to Los Angeles including the insurance of cargo. This also states that responsibility of the shipper ends at the Los Angeles port.   The term best way generally implies that the shipper will choose the carrier who offers the lowest rate for the shipment.
