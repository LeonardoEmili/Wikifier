The plot follows Battra and Mothras attempts to stop Godzilla from attacking Yokohama.     Originally conceived as a standalone Mothra film entitled Mothra vs. Bagan, the film is notable for its return to a more  |fantasy|Fantasy| -based, family-oriented atmosphere, evocative of older Godzilla films. Although he did not return as director, Ōmori continued his trend of incorporating  |Hollywood|Cinema_Of_The_United_States|  elements into his screenplay, in this case nods to the  |Indiana_Jones_franchise|Indiana_Jones| .     Godzilla vs. Mothra was released theatrically in Japan on December 12, 1992, and was followed by  Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II  the following year. Godzilla vs. Mothra was released  |direct_to_video|Direct_To_Video|  in the United States in 1998 by  |Columbia_Tristar_Home_Video|Sony_Pictures_Home_Entertainment|  under the title Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth. The film was the second highest-grossing film in Japan in 1993, with  Jurassic Park  being the highest-grossing.           In mid-1992, following the events of  Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah , a  |meteoroid|Meteoroid|  crashes in the  |Ogasawara_Trench|Izu_Ogasawara_Trench|  and awakens  |Godzilla|Godzilla| . Six months later, explorer Takuya Fujito is detained after stealing an ancient artifact. Later, a representative of the  |Japanese_Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Japan|  offers to have Takuyas charges dropped if he explores  |Infant_Island|List_Of_Fictional_Locations_In_The_Godzilla_Filmsinfant_Island|  with his ex-wife, Masako Tezuka and Kenji Ando, the secretary of the rapacious Marutomo company. After the trio arrives on the island, they find a cave containing a depiction of two giant insects in battle. Further exploration leads them to a giant egg and a pair of diminutive humanoids called  |Cosmos|Mothramothras_Fairies| , who identify the egg as belonging to  |Mothra|Mothra| .     The Cosmos tell of an ancient civilization that tried to control the Earths climate, thus provoking the Earth into creating Battra, which became uncontrollable, and started to harm the very planet that created it. Mothra, another earth protector, fought an apocalyptic battle with Battra, who eventually lost. The Cosmos explain how the meteoroid uncovered Mothras egg, and may have awoken Battra, who is still embittered over humanitys interference in the Earths natural order.     The Marutomo company sends a freighter to Infant Island to pick up the egg, ostensibly to protect it. As they are sailing, Godzilla surfaces and heads toward the newly hatched Mothra larva. Battra, also as a larva, soon appears and joins the fight, allowing Mothra to retreat. The battle between Godzilla and Battra is eventually taken underwater, where the force of the battle causes a giant crack on the  |Philippine_Sea_Plate|Philippine_Sea_Plate|  that swallows the two.     Masako and Takuya later discover Andos true intentions when he kidnaps the Cosmos and takes them to Marutomo headquarters, where the  |CEO|Chief_Executive_Officer|  intends to use them for publicity purposes. Mothra enters Tokyo in an attempt to rescue the Cosmos, but is attacked by the  |JSDF|Japan_Self_Defense_Forces| . The wounded Mothra heads for the  |National_Diet_Building|National_Diet_Building|  and starts constructing a cocoon around herself. Meanwhile, Godzilla surfaces from  |Mount_Fuji|Mount_Fuji| .     Both Mothra and Battra attain their imago forms and converge at  |Yokohama_Cosmo_World|Yokohama_Cosmo_World| . Godzilla interrupts the battle and attacks Battra. The two moths decide to join forces against Godzilla. Eventually, Mothra and Battra overwhelm Godzilla and carry it over the ocean. Godzilla bites Battras neck and fires its atomic breath into the wound, killing Battra. A tired Mothra drops Godzilla and the lifeless Battra into the water below, sealing Godzilla below the surface by creating a mystical glyph with scales from her wings. The next morning, the Cosmos explain that Battra had been waiting many years to destroy an even larger meteoroid that would threaten the Earth in 1999. Mothra had promised she would stop the future collision if Battra were to die, and she and the Cosmos leave Earth as the humans bid farewell.              The idea of shooting a movie featuring a revamped  |Mothra|Mothra|  dated back to a screenplay written in 1990 by Akira Murao entitled Mothra vs. Bagan, which revolved around a vengeful dragon called Bagan who sought to destroy humanity for its abuse of the Earths resources, only to be defeated by Mothra, the goddess of peace. The screenplay was revised by  |Kazuki_Ōmori|Kazuki_Ōmori|  after the release of  Godzilla vs. Biollante , though the project was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that Mothra was a character born purely out of Japanese culture, and thus would have been difficult to market overseas unlike the more internationally recognized  |Godzilla|Godzilla| .      After the success of  Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah , producer  |Shōgo_Tomiyama|Shōgo_Tomiyama|  and Godzilla series creator  |Tomoyuki_Tanaka|Tomoyuki_Tanaka|  proposed resurrecting  |King_Ghidorah|King_Ghidorah|  in a film entitled Ghidorahs Counterattack, but relented when polls demonstrated that Mothra was more popular with women, who comprised the majority of Japans population. Tomiyama replaced Ōmori with  |Takao_Okawara|Takao_Okawara|  as director, but maintained Ōmori as screenwriter. Hoping to maintain as much of Mothra vs. Bagan as possible, Ōmori reconceptualized Bagan as Badora, a dark twin to Mothra. The character was later renamed Battra , as the first name was disharmonious in Japanese. Tomiyama had intended to feature  Mothra  star  |Frankie_Sakai|Frankie_Sakai| , but was unable to because of scheduling conflicts. The final battle between Godzilla, Mothra and Battra was originally meant to have a more elaborate conclusion; as in the final product, Godzilla would have been transported to sea, only to kill Battra and plunge into the ocean. However, the site of their fall would have been the submerged,  |Stonehenge|Stonehenge| -like ruins of the Cosmos civilization, which would have engulfed and trapped Godzilla with a forcefield activated by Mothra.      |Ishirō_Honda|Ishirō_Honda| , who directed the first  Godzilla  film and many others, visited the set shortly before dying.       Koichi Kawakita continued his theme of giving Godzillas opponents the ability to metamorphose, and had initially intended to have Mothra killed off, only to be reborn as the cybernetic moth MechaMothra, though this was scrapped early in production, thus making Godzilla vs. Mothra the first post-1984 Godzilla movie to not feature a  |mecha|Mecha|  contraption. The underwater scenes were filmed through an aquarium filled with fish set between the performers and the camera. Kawakitas team constructed a new Godzilla suit from previously used molds, though it was made slimmer than previous suits, the neck given more prominent ribbing, and the arrangement of the characters dorsal plates was changed so that the largest plate was placed on the middle of the back. The arms were more flexible at the biceps, and the face was given numerous cosmetic changes; the forehead was reduced and flattened, the teeth scaled down, and the eyes given a golden tint. The head was also electronically modified to allow more vertical mobility. Robert Biondi, The Evolution of Godzilla – G-Suit Variations Throughout the Monster King’s Twenty One Films , G-FAN 16 Filming the Godzilla scenes was hampered when the suit previously used for Godzilla vs. Biollante and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, which was needed for some stunt-work, was stolen from Toho studios, only to be recovered at  |Lake_Okutama|Lake_Okutama|  in bad condition. The remains of the suit were recycled for the first battle sequence. Godzillas roar was reverted to the high-pitched shriek from pre-1984 Godzilla films, while Battras sound effects were recycled from those of  |Rodan|Rodan| . In designing Battra, which the script described as a black Mothra , artist Shinji Nishikawa sought to distance its design from Mothras by making its adult form more similar to its larval one than is the case with Mothra, and combining Mothras two eyes into one. David Milner, , Kaiju Conversations davmil.org       Godzilla vs. Mothra was released in Japan on December 12, 1992 where it was distributed by  |Toho|Toho| . The film sold approximately 4,200,000 tickets in Japan, becoming the number one Japanese film on the domestic market in the period that included the year 1993. It made ¥2.22 billion in distribution income.      The film was released in the United States as Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth on April 28, 1998 on home video by  |Columbia_TriStar_Home_Video|Columbia_Tristar_Home_Video| .       Review aggregation website  |Rotten_Tomatoes|Rotten_Tomatoes|  has a 75% approval rating from critics, based on 8 reviews with an  |average_score|Weighted_Mean|  of 6.3/10.  Ed Godziszewski of Monster Zero said, Rushed into production but a few months after  Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah , this film is unable to hide its hurried nature effects-wise, the film makes up for the story’s shortcomings and then some. Ed Godziszewski, , Monster Zero  Japan Hero said, While this movie is not the best of the Heisei series, it is still a really interesting movie. The battles are cool, and Battra was an interesting idea. If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend it.       Stomp Tokyo said the film is one of the better Godzilla movies in that the scenes in which monsters do not appear actually make some sort of sense. And for once, they are acted with some gusto, so that we as viewers can actually come to like the characters on screen, or at least be entertained by them.  Mike Bogue of American Kaiju said the film not live up to its potential, but added that colorful and elaborate spectacle eventually won over and the main story thread dealing with the eventual reconciliation of the divorced couple adequately holds the human plot together.
