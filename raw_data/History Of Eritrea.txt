    Eritrea is an ancient name, associated its ancient  |Greek|Greek_Language|  form Erythraia, Ἐρυθραία, and its derived  |Latin|Latin|  form Erythræa. This name is based on the Greek name for the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea| , then called the Erythræan Sea, from the Greek for red , ἐρυθρός, erythros. The  |Italians|Italians|  created the colony of Eritrea in the late 19th century around  |Asmara|Asmara| . After  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  Eritrea became part of Ethiopia. In 1991 the  |Eritrean_Peoples_Liberation_Front|Eritrean_Peoples_Liberation_Front|  defeated the  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| n government forces.  |Eritrea|Eritrea|  officially celebrated its independence on 24 May 1991. Emperor Menelik gave Eritrea to the Italians. Eritrea used to be part of Ethiopia. colonised by the Italians. Menelik then defeated the Italians in war and claimed victory. After 30 year of war Eritrea was able to declare its independence from Ethiopia.          At Buya in Eritrea, one of the oldest  |hominids|Hominid|  representing a possible link between  Homo erectus  and an archaic  Homo sapiens  was found by Italian scientists. Dated to over 1 million years old, it is the oldest skeletal find of its kind and provides a link between hominids and the earliest  |anatomically_modern_humans|Anatomically_Modern_Humans| .  It is believed that the section of the  |Danakil_Depression|Danakil_Depression|  in Eritrea was also a major player in terms of human evolution, and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans.      During the last interglacial period, the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  coast of Eritrea was occupied by early anatomically modern humans.  It is believed that the area was on the route out of Africa that some scholars suggest was used by early humans to colonize the rest of the Old World.  In 1999, the Eritrean Research Project Team composed of Eritrean, Canadian, American, Dutch and French scientists discovered a  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  site with stone and obsidian tools dated to over 125,000 years old near the  |Bay_of_Zula|Gulf_Of_Zula|  south of  |Massawa|Massawa| , along the Red Sea littoral. The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources like clams and oysters.      According to linguists, the first  |Afroasiatic|Afroasiatic_Languages| -speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  era from the familys proposed  |urheimat|Afroasiatic_Urheimat|  in the  |Nile_Valley|Nile_Valley| , Zarins, Juris , Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia , or the  |Near_East|Near_East| . Diamond J, Bellwood P Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions SCIENCE 300,  Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.                  Together with  |Djibouti|Djibouti| ,  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| , northern  |Somalia|Somalia| , and the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  coast of  |Sudan|Sudan| ,  Eritrea is considered the most likely location of the land known to the  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ians as  Punt , whose first mention dates to the 25th century BC. Najovits, Simson Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2, Algora Publishing, p. 258, . The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with  |Pharaonic_Egypt|Pharaoh|  during the times of  |Pharaoh|Pharaoh| |_Sahure|Sahure|  and  |Queen|Queen_Regnant| |_Hatshepsut|Hatshepsut| .     In 2010, a genetic study was conducted on the mummified remains of  |baboons|Baboon|  that were brought back as gifts from Punt by the ancient Egyptians. Led by a research team from the  |Egyptian_Museum|Egyptian_Museum|  and the  |University_of_California_at_Santa_Cruz|University_Of_California_Santa_Cruz| , the scientists used oxygen  |isotope|Isotope|  analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the  |British_Museum|British_Museum| . One of the baboons had distorted isotopic data, so the others oxygen isotope values were compared to those of present-day baboon specimens from regions of interest. The researchers found that the mummies most closely matched modern baboon specimens in Eritrea and Ethiopia, which they suggested implied that Punt was likely a narrow region that included eastern Ethiopia, Somalia, and all of Eritrea. Owen Jarus ,          Excavations at  |Sembel|Sembel|  found evidence of an ancient pre- |Aksumite|Kingdom_Of_Aksum|  civilization in greater Asmara. This Ona urban culture is believed to have been among the earliest pastoral and agricultural communities in the Horn region. Artefacts at the site have been dated to between 800 BC and 400 BC, contemporaneous with other pre-Aksumite settlements in the Eritrean and Ethiopian highlands during the mid-first millennium BC.      Additionally, the Ona culture may have had connections with the ancient Land of Punt. In a tomb in  |Thebes|Thebes_Egypt|  dated to the reign of Pharaoh  |Amenophis_II|Amenhotep_Ii|  , long-necked pots similar to those made by the Ona people are depicted as part of the cargo in a ship from Punt.           Excavations in and near  |Agordat|Agordat|  in central Eritrea yielded the remains of an ancient pre-Aksumite civilization known as the Gash Group.  Ceramics were discovered that were related to those of the  |C_Group|Nubian_C_Group|  pastoral culture, which inhabited the  |Nile_Valley|Nile_Valley|  between 2500–1500 BC.  Sherds akin to those of the  |Kerma|Kerma|  culture, another community that flourished in the Nile Valley around the same period, were also found at other local archaeological sites in the Barka valley belonging to the Gash Group. According to Peter Behrens and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst , linguistic evidence indicates that the C-Group and Kerma peoples spoke  |Afro_Asiatic_languages|Afro_Asiatic_Languages|  of the  |Berber|Berber_Languages|  and  |Cushitic|Cushitic_Languages|  branches, respectively.                |Dmt|Dmt|  was a kingdom that encompassed most of Eritrea and the northern fringes of Ethiopia, it existed during the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Given the presence of a massive temple complex, its capital was most likely  |Yeha|Yeha_Ethiopia| .  |Qohaito|Qohaito| , often identified as the town Koloe in the  Periplus of the Erythraean Sea , G.W.B. Huntingford, Historical Geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704 , pp. 38f as well as  |Matara|Matara_Eritrea|  were important ancient Dmt kingdom cities in southern Eritrea.     The realm developed  |irrigation|Irrigation|  schemes, used  |plows|Plow| , grew  |millet|Millet| , and made  |iron|Iron|  tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BC, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms until the rise of one of these polities during the first century, the  |Kingdom_of_Aksum|Kingdom_Of_Aksum| , which was able to reunite the area. Pankhurst, Richard K.P. , Addis Tribune             The  |Kingdom_of_Aksum|Kingdom_Of_Aksum|  was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.  It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  period c. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD.     The Aksumites established bases on the northern highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and from there expanded southward. The  |Persia|Sassanid_Empire| n religious figure  |Mani|Mani|  listed Axum with  |Rome|Roman_Empire| , Persia, and  |China|China|  as one of the four great powers of his time. The origins of the Axumite Kingdom are unclear, although experts have offered their speculations about it. Even who should be considered the earliest known king is contested: although  |Carlo_Conti_Rossini|Carlo_Conti_Rossini|  proposed that  |Zoskales|Zoskales|  of Axum, mentioned in the  Periplus of the Erythraean Sea , should be identified with one Za Haqle mentioned in the Ethiopian King Lists ,  |G_W_B_Huntingford|G_W_B_Huntingford|  argued that Zoskales was only a sub-king whose authority was limited to  |Adulis|Adulis| , and that Conti Rossinis identification can not be substantiated. Expressed, for example, in his The Historical Geography of Ethiopia , p. 39.     According to the medieval Liber Axumae , Aksums first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.  Munro-Hay cites the Muslim historian  |Abu_Jafar_al_Khwarazmi|Abu_Jafar_Al_Khwarazmi| /Kharazmi as stating that the capital of the kingdom of Habash was  |Jarma|Jarma|  . Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, pp. 95–98. The capital was later moved to  |Aksum|Axum|  in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name Ethiopia as early as the 4th century.  Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia, 2005.     The Aksumites erected a number of large  |stelae|Stele| , which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, standing at 90 feet.  Under  |Ezana|Ezana_Of_Axum|  , Aksum later adopted  |Christianity|Christianity| .  In 615, during the lifetime of  |Muhammad|Muhammad| , the Aksumite King  |Sahama|Sahama|  provided asylum to early  |Muslims|Muslim|  from  |Mecca|Mecca|  fleeing persecution. Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, p.56. This journey is known in  |Islamic_history|Islamic_History|  as the  |First_Hijra|Migration_To_Abyssinia| . The area is also the alleged resting place of the  |Ark_of_the_Covenant|Ark_Of_The_Covenant|  and the purported home of the  |Queen_of_Sheba|Queen_Of_Sheba| .       The kingdom is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as an important market place for  |ivory|Ivory_Trade| , which was exported throughout the ancient world. Aksum was at the time ruled by Zoskales, who also governed the port of Adulis. , chs. 4, 5 The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own  |Aksumite_currency|Aksumite_Currency| .     The state also established its hegemony over the declining  |Kingdom_of_Kush|Kingdom_Of_Kush|  and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the  |Arabian_peninsula|Arabian_Peninsula| , eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the  |Himyarite_Kingdom|Himyarite_Kingdom| . Inscriptions have been found in  |Southern_Arabia|Southern_Arabia|  celebrating victories over one  |GDRT|Gdrt| , described as nagashi of  |Habashat|Habesha_People|  and of Axum. Other dated inscriptions are used to determine a floruit for GDRT around the beginning of the 3rd century. A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at  |Atsbi_Dera|Atsbi_Dera|  with in inscription mentioning GDR of Axum . Coins showing the royal portrait began to be minted under King  |Endubis|Endubis|  toward the end of the 3rd century.     Additionally, expeditions by  |Ezana|Ezana_Of_Axum|  into the  |Kingdom_of_Kush|Kingdom_Of_Kush|  at  |Meroe|Meroe|  in Sudan may have brought about the latter politys demise, though there is evidence that the kingdom was experiencing a period of decline beforehand. As a result of Ezanas expansions, Aksum bordered the Roman  |province_of_Egypt|Aegyptus| . The degree of Aksums control over Yemen is uncertain. Though there is little evidence supporting Aksumite control of the region at that time, his title, which includes king of Saba and Salhen, Himyar and Dhu-Raydan , along with gold Aksumite coins with the inscriptions, king of the  Habshat  or Habashite, indicate that Aksum might have retained some legal or actual footing in the area. Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 81.     Details of the Aksumite Kingdom, never abundant, become even more scarce after this point. The last king known to mint coins is  |Armah|Armah| , whose coinage refers to the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614. Stuart Munro-Hay believes that Axum had been abandoned as the capital by Sahamas reign. However, Kobishchanov suggests that Ethiopians retained hegemony over the Arabian ports until at least as late as 702. Kobishchanov, Axum, p. 116.                 From the late first to early second millennium Eritrea witnessed a period of migrations: Since the late 7th century, so with the decline of Aksum, large parts of Eritrea, including the highlands, were overrun by pagan  |Beja|Beja_People| , who supposedly founded several kingdoms on its soil, like  |Baqlin|Kingdom_Of_Belgin| ,  |Jarin|Kingdom_Of_Jarin|  and  |Qata|Kingdom_Of_Qitaa| .

Subsequently, the Beja were expelled from the highlands by Abyssinian settlers from the south. Kjetil Tronvoll : Mai Weini, a Highland Village in Eritrea: A Study of the People . p. 34-35 Another people, the  |Bellou|Bellou| , originated from a similar millieu as the Beja. They appeared first in the 12th century, from then on they dominated parts of northwestern Eritrea until the 16th century. Dan Connell, Tom Killion : Historical Dictionary of Eritrea . The Scarecrow. Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth. p. 120-121 After 1270, with the destruction of the  |Zagwe_Kingdom|Zagwe_Dynasty| , many  |Agaw|Agaw|  fled to what is now Eritrea.

Dan Connell, Tom Killion : Historical Dictionary of Eritrea . The Scarecrow. Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth. p. 54     Meanwhile, Eritrea witnessed a very slow, but steady intrusion of Islam. Muslims had already reached Eritrea in 613/615, during the  |First_Hijra|First_Hijra| . In 702, Muslim pirates conquered the  |Dahlak_islands|Dahlak_Archipelago| . In 1060, a Yemeni dynasty fled to Dahlak and proclaimed the  |Sultanate_of_Dahlak|Sultanate_Of_Dahlak| , which would last for almost 500 years. This sultanate also had sovereignty over the port town of  |Massawa|Massawa| . Dan Connell, Tom Killion : Historical Dictionary of Eritrea . The Scarecrow.

In southern Eritrea, the  |Aussa_Sultanate|Aussa_Sultanate|  succeeded the earlier  |Imamate_of_Aussa|Imamate_Of_Awsa| . The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when  |Muhammed_Jasa|Muhammed_Jasa|  moved his capital from  |Harar|Harar|  to  |Aussa|Asaita|  with the split of the  |Adal_Sultanate|Adal_Sultanate|  into Aussa and the  |Sultanate_of_Harar|Sultanate_Of_Harar| .
