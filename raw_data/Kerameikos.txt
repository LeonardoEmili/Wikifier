        Kerameikos  also known by its  |Latinized_form|Latinization_Of_Names|  Ceramicus, is an area of  |Athens|Athens| ,  |Greece|Greece| , located to the northwest of the  |Acropolis|Acropolis,_Athens| , which includes an extensive area both within and outside the ancient city walls, on both sides of the Dipylon Gate and by the banks of the  |Eridanos|Eridanos|  River. It was the potters quarter of the city, from which the English word ceramic is derived, and was also the site of an important cemetery and numerous funerary sculptures erected along the road out of the city towards  |Eleusis|Eleusis| .                        The area took its name from the city square or  |dēmos|Deme|  of the  |Kerameis|Kerameis|  , which in turn derived its name from the word κέραμος . Hans Rupprecht Goette, Athens, Attica and the Megarid: An Archaeological Guide, p. 59 The Inner Kerameikos was the former potters quarter within the city and Outer Kerameikos covers the cemetery and also the Dēmósion Sēma just outside the city walls, where  |Pericles|Pericles|  delivered his  |funeral_oration|Pericles_Funeral_Oration|  in 431 BC. The cemetery was also where the  |Ηiera_Hodos|Ηiera_Hodos|   began, along which the procession moved for the  |Eleusinian_Mysteries|Eleusinian_Mysteries| . The quarter was located there because of the abundance of clay mud carried over by the Eridanos River.     The area has undergone a number of archaeological excavations in recent years, though the excavated area covers only a small portion of the ancient dēmos. It was originally an area of marshland along the banks of the Eridanos river which was used as a cemetery as long ago as the 3rd millennium BC. It became the site of an organised cemetery from about 1200 BC; numerous  |cist|Cist|  graves and burial offerings from the period have been discovered by archaeologists. Houses were constructed on the higher drier ground to the south. During the  |Archaic_period|Archaic_Period_In_Greece|  increasingly large and complex grave mounds and monuments were built along the south bank of the Eridanos, lining the Sacred Way.     The building of  |the_new_city_wall|Themistoclean_Wall|  in 478 BC, following the  |Persia|Persia| n sack of Athens in 480 BC, fundamentally changed the appearance of the area. At the suggestion of  |Themistocles|Themistocles| , all of the funerary sculptures were built into the city wall and two large city gates facing north-west were erected in the Kerameikos. The Sacred Way ran through the Sacred Gate, on the southern side, to Eleusis. On the northern side a wide road, the Dromos, ran through the double-arched  |Dipylon_Gate|Dipylon_Gate|  and on to the  |Platonic_Academy|Platonic_Academy|  a few miles away. State graves were built on either side of the Dipylon Gate, for the interment of prominent personages such as notable warriors and statesmen, including  |Pericles|Pericles|  and  |Cleisthenes|Cleisthenes| .     After the construction of the city wall, the Sacred Way and a forking street known as the Street of the Tombs again became lined with imposing sepulchral monuments belonging to the families of rich Athenians, dating to before the late 4th century BC. The construction of such lavish mausolea was banned by decree in 317 BC, following which only small columns or inscribed square marble blocks were permitted as grave stones. The  |Roman|Roman_Empire|  occupation of Athens led to a resurgence of monument-building, although little is left of them today.     During the  |Classical_period|Classical_Greece|  an important public building, the  |Pompeion|Pompeion| , stood inside the walls in the area between the two gates. This served a key function in the procession  in honour of  |Athena|Athena|  during the  |Panathenaic_Festival|Panathenaic_Festival| . It consisted of a large courtyard surrounded by columns and banquet rooms, where the nobility of Athens would eat the sacrificial meat for the festival. According to ancient Greek sources, a  |hecatomb|Hecatomb|  was carried out for the festival and the people received the meat in the Kerameikos, possibly in the Dipylon courtyard; excavators have found heaps of bones in front of the city wall.     The Pompeion and many other buildings in the vicinity of the Sacred Gate were razed to the ground by the marauding army of the Roman dictator  |Sulla|Sulla| , during his  |sacking_of_Athens_in_86_BC|Siege_Of_Athens_And_Piraeus| ; an episode that  |Plutarch|Plutarch|  described as a bloodbath. During the 2nd century AD, a storehouse was constructed on the site of the Pompeion, but it was destroyed during the invasion of the  |Heruli|Heruli|  in 267 AD. The ruins became the site of potters workshops until about 500 AD, when two parallel colonnades were built behind the city gates, overrunning the old city walls. A new Festival Gate was constructed to the east with three entrances leading into the city. This was in turn destroyed in raids by the invading  |Avars|Pannonian_Avars|  and  |Slavs|Slavs|  at the end of the 6th century, and the Kerameikos fell into obscurity. It was not rediscovered until a Greek worker dug up a  |stele|Stele|  in April 1863.                  Archaeological excavations in the Kerameikos began in 1870 under the auspices of the  |Greek_Archaeological_Society|Greek_Archaeological_Society| . They have continued from 1913 to the present day under the  |German_Archaeological_Institute_at_Athens|German_Archaeological_Institute_At_Athens| .     During the construction of  |Kerameikos_station|Kerameikos_Station|  for the expanded  |Athens_Metro|Athens_Metro| , a plague pit and approximately 1,000 tombs from the 4th and 5th centuries BC were discovered. The Greek archaeologist  |Efi_Baziotopoulou-Valavani|Efi_Baziotopoulou-Valavani| , who excavated the site, has dated the grave to between 430 and 426 BC.  |Thucydides|Thucydides|  described the panic caused by the plague, possibly an epidemic of  |typhoid|Typhoid|  which struck the besieged city in 430 BC. The epidemic lasted for two years and killed an estimated one third of the population. He wrote that bodies were abandoned in temples and streets, to be subsequently collected and hastily buried. The disease reappeared in the winter of 427 BC.     Latest findings in the Kerameikos include the  of a 2.1 m tall  |Kouros|Kouros| ,  by the German Archaeological Institute at Athens under the direction of Professor Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier. This Kouros is the larger twin of  in the  |Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art|Metropolitan_Museum_Of_Art|  in  |New_York|New_York_City| , and both were made by the same anonymous sculptor called the Dipylon Master .     Large areas adjacent to those already excavated remain in to be explored, as they lie under the fabric of modern-day Athens. Expropriation of these areas has been delayed until funding is secured.          The area is enclosed and visitable through an entrance on the last block of Ermou Street, close to the intersection with Peiraios Street. The Kerameikos Museum is housed there, in a small neoclassical building that houses the most extensive collection of burial-related artifacts in Greece, varying from large-scale marble sculpture to funerary urns,  |stelae|Stela| , jewelry, toys etc. The original burial monument sculptures are displayed within the museum, having been replaced by plaster replicas in situ. The museum incorporates inner and outer courtyards, where the larger sculptures are kept. Down the hill from the museum, visitors can wander among the Outer Kerameikos ruins, the Demosion Sema, the banks of the Eridanos where some water still flows, the remains of the Pompeion and the Dipylon Gate, and walk the first blocks of the Sacred Way towards Eleusis and of the Panathenaic Way towards the Acropolis. The bulk of the area lies about 7–10 meters below modern street level, having in the past been inundated by centuries worth of sediment accumulation from the floods of the Eridanos.       As of spring 2007 Keramikos is the name given to the metro station which belongs to Line 3 of the Athens Metro is adjacent to the Technopolis of  |Gazi|Gazi,_Athens| .
