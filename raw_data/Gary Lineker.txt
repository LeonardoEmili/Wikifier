        Gary Winston Lineker   is an English former professional  |footballer|Association_Football|  and current  |sports_broadcaster|Sports_Broadcasting| . He holds  |Englands|England_National_Football_Team|  record for goals in the  |FIFA_World_Cup|Fifa_World_Cup|  finals, with 10 scored. Linekers media career began with the  |BBC|Bbc| , where he has presented the flagship football programme  Match of the Day  since the late 1990s. He has also worked for  |Al_Jazeera_Sports|Al_Jazeera_Sports| ,  |Eredivisie_Live|Eredivisie_Live| ,  |NBC_Sports_Network|Nbc_Sports_Network|  and currently hosts  |BT_Sports|Bt_Sport|  coverage of the  |UEFA_Champions_League|Uefa_Champions_League| .     Lineker began his football career at  |Leicester_City|Leicester_City_F_C_|  in 1978, and finished as the  |First_Divisions|Football_League_First_Division|  joint top goalscorer in 1984–85. He then moved to League Champions  |Everton|Everton_F_C_|  where he developed as a clinical finisher, scoring 30 goals in 41 games. His first team honours came at  |Barcelona|Fc_Barcelona| , where he won the  |Copa_del_Rey|Copa_Del_Rey|  in 1988 and the  |European_Cup_Winners_Cup|Uefa_Cup_Winners_Cup|  in 1989. He returned to England in 1989, joining  |Tottenham_Hotspur|Tottenham_Hotspur_F_C_| , and over three seasons he scored 67 goals in 105 games and won the  |FA_Cup|Fa_Cup| . Linekers final club was  |Nagoya_Grampus_Eight|Nagoya_Grampus|  and he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.     Lineker made his England debut in 1984, earning 80  |caps|Cap|  and scoring 48 goals over an eight-year international career, and is Englands third highest scorer, behind  |Bobby_Charlton|Bobby_Charlton|  and  |Wayne_Rooney|Wayne_Rooney| . His international goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country and he is regarded as one of the all-time best English  |strikers|Forward_Striker| . He was top scorer in the  |1986_World_Cup|1986_Fifa_World_Cup|  and received the  |Golden_Boot|World_Cup_Golden_Boot| , the only time an Englishman had done so until  |Harry_Kane|Harry_Kane|  in the  |2018_World_Cup|2018_Fifa_World_Cup| . He is also the only player to have been the top scorer in England with three clubs .     Even though he enjoyed a long career, Lineker never received a  |yellow|Caution|  or  |red_card|Dismissal| .   As a result, he was honoured in 1990 with the  |FIFA_Fair_Play_Award|Fifa_Fair_Play_Award| . In a senior career which spanned 16 years and 567 competitive games, Lineker scored a total of 330 goals, including 282 goals at club level. After his retirement from football he was inducted into the  |English_Football_Hall_of_Fame|English_Football_Hall_Of_Fame| . A keen supporter of Leicester City, he led a consortium that invested in his old club, saving it from bankruptcy, and was appointed honorary vice-president.       Lineker was born in  |Leicester|Leicester| , the son of Margaret P. and Barry Lineker.  His middle name came from  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| , with whom he shares his birthday.  He has one brother, Wayne, who is two years his junior. Lineker grew up with his family in the city, playing football with his brother Wayne. Linekers father was a greengrocer, as was his grandfather William and great-grandfather, George,  in Leicester. His father ran Linekers fruit and veg stall in  |Leicester_Market|Leicester_Market|  and as a child and a young player he regularly helped out on the stall.      Lineker first attended Caldecote Road School  ,  |Braunstone|Braunstone_Park_Rowley_Fields|  in Leicester although he lived outside the borough. He went to the City of Leicester Boys Grammar School  on Downing Drive in  |Evington|Evington| , inside the borough of Leicester due to his preference for football rather than rugby, which was the main sport of most schools near his home. As a result, he lived with his grandmother, who lived in the city, while attending school. Lineker was equally talented at both football and  |cricket|Cricket| . From the ages of 11 to 16 he captained the Leicestershire Schools cricket team, and had felt that he had a higher chance of succeeding at it rather than football.  He later stated on  They Think Its All Over  that as a teenager he idolised former  |England|England_Cricket_Team|  captain  |David_Gower|David_Gower| , who was playing for  |Leicestershire|Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club|  at the time.  During his youth he played for  |Aylestone_Park_Youth|Aylestone_Park_F_C_| , later becoming the clubs president.  BBC News, 10 March 2009     Lineker left school with four  |O_Levels|O_Level| . One of his teachers wrote on his report card that he concentrates too much on football and that he would never make a living at that . He then joined the youth academy at  |Leicester_City|Leicester_City_F_C_|  in 1976.           Lineker began his career at his home town club  |Leicester_City|Leicester_City_F_C_|  after leaving school in 1977, turning professional in the  |1978–79|1978–79_In_English_Football|  season and making his senior debut on New Years Day 1979 in a 2–0 win over  |Oldham_Athletic|Oldham_Athletic_A_F_C_|  in the  |Second_Division|Football_League_Second_Division|  at  |Filbert_Street|Filbert_Street| . He earned a Second Division title medal a year later with 19 appearances, but played just nine league games in  |1980–81|1980–81_In_English_Football|  as Leicester went straight back down.     However, he became a regular player in  |1981–82|1981–82_In_English_Football| , scoring 19 goals in all competitions that season. Although Leicester missed out on promotion, they reached the semi-finals of the  |FA_Cup|Fa_Cup| , and clinched promotion a year later as Lineker scored 26 times in the Second Division. In  |1983–84|1983–84_In_English_Football| , he enjoyed regular First Division action for the first time and was the divisions second highest scorer with 22 goals, although Leicester failed to finish anywhere near the top of the league. He was the First Divisions joint top scorer in  |1984–85|1984–85_In_English_Football|  with 24 goals, and was enjoying a prolific partnership with  |Alan_Smith|Alan_Smith| . However, by this stage, he was attracting the attention of bigger clubs, and a move from  |Filbert_Street|Filbert_Street|  was looking certain.       In the 1985 close season, defending league champions  |Everton|Everton_F_C_|  signed Lineker for £800,000; he scored 40 goals in 57 games for his new team in the  |1985–86|1985–86_In_English_Football|  season. He was again the First Divisions leading goal scorer, this time with 30 goals , and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the  |FA_Cup|Fa_Cup|  final for the third consecutive year but lost 3–1 to  |Liverpool|Liverpool_F_C_| , despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced  |Alan_Hansen|Alan_Hansen|  to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points.   I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career, he says.   I still have an affinity towards Everton.     Lineker scored three  |hat_tricks|Hat_Tricks|  for Everton; at home to  |Birmingham_City|Birmingham_City_F_C_|  in a 4–1 league win on 31 August 1985, at home to  |Manchester_City|Manchester_City_F_C_|  in a 4–0 home win on 11 February 1986, and then in the penultimate league game of the season on 3 May 1986, when they kept their title hopes alive with a 6–1 home win over  |Southampton|Southampton_F_C_| . On his final league appearance, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win over  |West_Ham_United|West_Ham_United_F_C_|  whose own title hopes had just disappeared. However, he and his colleagues were denied title glory as Liverpool also won their final league game of the season at Chelsea.    Lineker has consistently stated since retiring from football that this Everton team was the best club side he ever played in.       After winning the  |Golden_Boot|World_Cup_Golden_Boot|  at the  |1986_World_Cup|1986_Fifa_World_Cup|  in Mexico, Lineker was signed by  |Barcelona|Fc_Barcelona|  for £2.8  million. Barcelona were being managed by former  |Queens_Park_Rangers|Queens_Park_Rangers_F_C_|  manager  |Terry_Venables|Terry_Venables| , who had also brought in  |Manchester_United|Manchester_United_F_C_|  and  |Wales|Wales_National_Football_Team|  striker  |Mark_Hughes|Mark_Hughes| . Barcelona gave Lineker his first chance of European football, as Leicester had never qualified for Europe while he played for them, and Everton were denied a place in the  |European_Cup|European_Cup|  for 1985–86 due to the commencement of the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the  |Heysel_disaster|Heysel_Disaster| .     His Golden Boot-winning performance at the finals generated much anticipation of success at the  |Camp_Nou|Camp_Nou| , and he did not disappoint, scoring 21 goals in 41 games during his first season, including a  |hat_trick|Hat_Trick|  in a 3–2 win over archrivals  |Real_Madrid|Real_Madrid_C_F_| .  Barcelona went on to win the  |Copa_del_Rey|Copa_Del_Rey|  in 1988 and the  |European_Cup_Winners_Cup|Uefa_Cup_Winners_Cup|  in 1989. Lineker played in Barcelonas shock home and away defeats to  |Dundee_United|Dundee_United_F_C_| . Barcelona manager  |Johan_Cruyff|Johan_Cruyff|  decided to play Lineker on the right of the midfield and he was eventually no longer an automatic choice in the team.     With 42 goals in 103 La Liga appearances, Lineker became the highest scoring British player in the competitions history, but was later surpassed by  |Gareth_Bale|Gareth_Bale|  in March 2016.          |Manchester_United|Manchester_United|  manager  |Alex_Ferguson|Alex_Ferguson|  attempted to sign Lineker to partner his ex-Barcelona teammate  |Mark_Hughes|Mark_Hughes|  in attack, but Lineker instead signed for  |Tottenham_Hotspur|Tottenham_Hotspur_F_C_|  in July 1989 for £1.1  million. Over three seasons, he scored 67 goals in 105 league games and won the FA Cup while playing for the club. He finished as top scorer in the  |First_Division|Football_League_First_Division|  in the  |1989–90|1989–90_In_English_Football|  season, scoring 24 goals as Spurs finished third.     He finally collected an English trophy when he won the  |1991_FA_Cup_Final|1991_Fa_Cup_Final|  with Spurs, who beat  |Nottingham_Forest|Nottingham_Forest_F_C_|  2–1. This was despite Lineker having a goal controversially disallowed for offside and also having a penalty saved by goalkeeper  |Mark_Crossley|Mark_Crossley| .  Lineker had contributed to Tottenhams run to the final. In the semi-final he scored twice in a 3–1 win over  |North_London_rivals|North_London_Derby| |_Arsenal|Arsenal_F_C_| .      He was the top divisions second-highest goalscorer in  |1991–92|1991–92_In_English_Football|  with 28 goals from 35 games, behind  |Ian_Wright|Ian_Wright| , who scored 29 times in 42 games. Despite Linekers personal performance, Tottenham finished this final pre- |Premier_League|Premier_League|  season in 15th place. His last goal in English football came on the last day of the season in a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United at  |Old_Trafford|Old_Trafford| .       In November 1991, Lineker accepted an offer of a two-year contract from  |J1_League|J1_League|  club  |Nagoya_Grampus_Eight|Nagoya_Grampus| . The transfer fee paid to  |Tottenham_Hotspur|Tottenham_Hotspur_F_C_|  was £2  million. He officially joined Nagoya Grampus Eight after playing his final game for Spurs on 2 May 1992, when he scored the consolation goal in a 3–1 defeat by  |Manchester_United|Manchester_United_F_C_|  on the last day of the season.  Shortly before accepting the offer from Nagoya Grampus Eight, Tottenham had rejected an offer from ambitious Second Division club  |Blackburn_Rovers|Blackburn_Rovers_F_C_| , who had recently been taken over by steel baron  |Jack_Walker|Jack_Walker| .      Having scored 9 goals in 23 appearances over two injury impacted  seasons for Nagoya Grampus Eight, he announced his retirement from playing in September 1994. The English national media had previously reported that he would be returning to England to complete his playing career at  |Middlesbrough|Middlesbrough_F_C_|  or  |Southampton|Southampton_F_C_| .        Lineker was  |capped|Cap|  once by the  |England_B_national_team|England_National_Football_B_Team| , playing in a 2–0 home win over New Zealands B team on 13 November 1984.  He first played for the full  |England_team|England_National_Football_Team|  against  |Scotland|Scotland_National_Football_Team|  in 1984. He played five games in the  |1986_World_Cup|1986_Fifa_World_Cup|  and was top scorer of the tournament with six goals, winning the  |Golden_Boot|World_Cup_Golden_Boot| , making him the first English player to have done so. He scored the second quickest hat-trick ever at a FIFA World Cup tournament against  |Poland|Poland_National_Football_Team| , the second English player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup, and scored two goals against  |Paraguay|Paraguay_National_Football_Team|  in the second round. He played most of the tournament wearing a lightweight cast on his forearm. He scored for England in the World Cup quarter-final against  |Argentina|Argentina_National_Football_Team| , but the game ended in defeat as  |Diego_Maradona|Diego_Maradona|  scored twice for the opposition . In 1988, Lineker played in  |Euro_88|Uefa_Euro_1988| , but failed to score as England lost all three Group games. It was later established that he had been suffering from  |hepatitis|Hepatitis| . C. Malam, p. 100. The first was against  |Spain|Spain_National_Football_Team|  18 February 1987 and the second time against  |Malaysia|Malaysia_National_Football_Team|  12 June 1991.     In the  |1990_World_Cup|1990_Fifa_World_Cup| , he scored four goals to help England reach the semi-finals after a string of draws and narrow victories. He was unwell during the tournament, and accidentally defecated during the opening group game against the  |Republic_of_Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland_National_Football_Team| .  After  |Andreas_Brehme|Andreas_Brehme|  sent England 1–0 down in the semi-final, Lineker received a pass from  |Paul_Parker|Paul_Parker|  and escaped two  |West_German|Germany_National_Football_Team|  defenders on his way to scoring the equaliser, but the West Germans triumphed in the penalty shoot-out and went on to win the trophy. Later he said: Football is a simple game; 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans win.  Linekers equaliser appears in the popular England national team anthem, “ |Three_Lions|Three_Lions| ”, with the lyric When Lineker scored .      He retired from international football with eighty  |caps|Cap|  and forty-eight goals, one fewer goal than  |Sir_Bobby_Charltons|Bobby_Charlton|  England record . In what proved to be his last England match, against  |Sweden|Sweden_National_Football_Team|  at  |Euro_92|Uefa_Euro_1992| , he was substituted by England coach  |Graham_Taylor|Graham_Taylor|  in favour of Arsenal striker  |Alan_Smith|Alan_Smith| , ultimately denying him the chance to equal—or even better—Charltons record.  He had earlier missed a  |penalty|Penalty_Kick|  that would have brought him level, in a pre-tournament friendly against  |Brazil|Brazil_National_Football_Team| .  He was visibly upset at the decision, not looking at Taylor as he took the bench.     He scored four  |goals|Scoring_In_Association_Football|  in an England match on two occasions and is one of very few players never to have been given a yellow card or a red card in any type of game. Malam, pp. 140, 141.       Following retirement from professional football, he developed a career in the media, initially on  |BBC_Radio_5_Live|Bbc_Radio_5_Live|  and as a football pundit before replacing  |Des_Lynam|Des_Lynam|  as the  |BBCs|British_Broadcasting_Corporation|  anchorman for football coverage, including their flagship football television programme  Match of the Day , and as a team captain on the sports game show  They Think Its All Over  from 1995 to 2003. Following the departure of  |Steve_Rider|Steve_Rider|  from the BBC, Lineker, who is a keen recreational golfer with a  |handicap|Golf_Handicap|  of four, became the new presenter for the  |BBCs|Bbc|  golf coverage. Also, he presented  Grandstand  in the London studio while then-presenter  |Desmond_Lynam|Desmond_Lynam|  was in  |Aintree|Aintree|  when the  |Grand_National|Grand_National|  was abandoned because of a bomb alert at the racecourse in 1997.

He also appeared in the 1991 play  An Evening with Gary Lineker  by  |Arthur_Smith|Arthur_Smith|  and  |Chris_England|Chris_England| , which was adapted for television in 1994.

However, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. It transpired in the case that the article had actually been  |ghost_written|Ghostwriter|  by a journalist at the Sunday Telegraph following a telephone interview with Lineker.      In 2006, Lineker took on an acting role as the voice of  Underground Ernie  on the BBCs childrens channel,  |CBeebies|Cbeebies| .

Triesman resigned as chairman of the bid and the FA on 16 May 2010 after the publication of a secret recording of a conversation between the peer and a former ministerial aide, during which he claimed that Spain and Russia were planning to bribe referees at the  |World_Cup|2010_Fifa_World_Cup|  in South Africa.    Lineker then began working as an anchor for the English language football coverage for  |Al_Jazeera_Sport|Bein_Sports| , which is broadcast throughout most of the Middle East.

On 18 October 2016, Lineker tweeted a rebuttal to a statement made by MP  |David_Davies|David_Davies|  where Davies suggested refugees entering the UK should undergo dental checks to verify their age.  Lineker posted The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. Whats happening to our country?  This led The Sun to call for Linekers sacking from Match of the Day, claiming that he had breached BBC impartiality guidelines.  Lineker described the controversy as a spanking but continued to advocate for refugees.      In July 2018, Lineker announced his support for  |Peoples_Vote|Peoples_Vote| , a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final  |Brexit|Brexit|  deal between the UK and the European Union.          Lineker has appeared in a number of adverts for the Leicester-based snack company  |Walkers|Walkers| . Originally signing a £200,000 deal in 1994, his first advert was 1995s “Welcome Home” .

In May 2006, Michelle filed for divorce on the grounds of Garys alleged unreasonable behaviour, with documents submitted to the court claiming that Linekers actions in their marriage had caused her stress and anxiety. Lineker and Michelle have four sons, George, Harry, Tobias and Angus. The couple subsequently stated that the situation was amicable.      In the early 1990s, George, Linekers eldest son, survived a rare form of  |leukaemia|Leukemia|  whilst he was a baby, treated at  |Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital|Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital|  in London. Lineker now supports childrens cancer charity  |CLIC_Sargent|Clic_Sargent|  and has appeared in promotional clips encouraging people to give blood.
