         Serpens  is a  |constellation|Constellation|  of the  |northern_hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| . One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| , it remains one of the 88  |modern_constellations|Modern_Constellations|  defined by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union| . It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput to the west and Serpens Cauda to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of  |Ophiuchus|Ophiuchus| , the Serpent-Bearer . In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between  |Mu_Serpentis|Mu_Serpentis|  in Serpens Caput and  |Nu_Serpentis|Nu_Serpentis|  in Serpens Cauda.     The brightest  |star_in_Serpens|List_Of_Stars_In_Serpens|  is the  |red_giant|Red_Giant|  star  |Alpha_Serpentis|Alpha_Serpentis| , or Unukalhai, in Serpens Caput, with an  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  of 2.63. Also located in Serpens Caput are the naked-eye  |globular_cluster|Globular_Cluster| |_Messier_5|Messier_5|  and the naked-eye  |variables|Variable_Star| |_R_Serpentis|R_Serpentis|  and  |Tau_4_Serpentis|Tau4_Serpentis| . Notable extragalactic objects include  |Seyferts_Sextet|Seyferts_Sextet| , one of the densest galaxy clusters known;  |Arp_220|Arp_220| , the prototypical  |ultraluminous_infrared_galaxy|Ultraluminous_Infrared_Galaxy| ; and  |Hoags_Object|Hoags_Object| , the most famous of the very rare class of galaxies known as  |ring_galaxies|Ring_Galaxy| .     Part of the Milky Ways  |galactic_plane|Galactic_Plane|  passes through Serpens Cauda, which is therefore rich in galactic  |deep_sky_objects|Deep_Sky_Object| , such as the  |Eagle_Nebula|Eagle_Nebula|  and its associated star cluster  |Messier_16|Messier_16| . The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the  |Pillars_of_Creation|Pillars_Of_Creation| , three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope| . Other striking objects include the  |Red_Square_Nebula|Red_Square_Nebula| , one of the few objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and  |Westerhout_40|Westerhout_40| , a massive nearby  |star_forming_region|Star_Formation|  consisting of a  |molecular_cloud|Molecular_Cloud|  and an  |H_II_region|H_Ii_Region| .          In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Serpens represents a  |snake|Snake|  held by the healer  |Asclepius|Asclepius| . Represented in the sky by the constellation  |Ophiuchus|Ophiuchus| , Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, but the majority of atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus body or between his legs.     In some ancient atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were depicted as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown as a single constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was  |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer| ; thus, Serpens stars are cataloged with separate  |Bayer_designations|Bayer_Designation|  from those of Ophiuchus. When  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Delporte|  established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed the problem of how to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.      In  |Chinese_astronomy|Chinese_Astronomy| , most of the stars of Serpens represented part of a wall surrounding a marketplace, known as  |Tianshi|Tianshi| , which was in Ophiuchus and part of  |Hercules|Hercules| . Serpens also contains a few  |Chinese_constellations|Chinese_Constellations| . Two stars in the tail represented part of  |Shilou|Shilou| , the tower with the market office. Another star in the tail represented  |Liesi|Liesi| , jewel shops. One star in the head  marked  |Tianru|Tianru| , the  |crown_princes|Crown_Prince|  wet nurse, or sometimes  |rain|Rain| .     There were two serpent constellations in  |Babylonian_astronomy|Babylonian_Astronomy| , known as Mušḫuššu and Bašmu. It appears that Mušḫuššu was depicted as a hybrid of a dragon, a lion and a bird, and loosely corresponded to  |Hydra|Hydra| . Bašmu was a  |horned_serpent|Horned_Serpent|   and roughly corresponds to the Ὄφις constellation of  |Eudoxus_of_Cnidus|Eudoxus_Of_Cnidus|  on which the Ὄφις  of Ptolemy is based.        Serpens is the only one of the  |88_modern_constellations|88_Modern_Constellations|  to be split into two disconnected regions in the sky: Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda . The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.      Serpens Caput is bordered by  |Libra|Libra|  to the south,  |Virgo|Virgo|  and  |Boötes|Boötes|  to the east,  |Corona_Borealis|Corona_Borealis|  to the north, and Ophiuchus and  |Hercules|Hercules|  to the west; Serpens Cauda is bordered by  |Sagittarius|Sagittarius|  to the south,  |Scutum|Scutum|  and  |Aquila|Aquila|  to the east, and Ophiuchus to the north and west. Covering 636.9  |square_degrees|Square_Degree|  total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemispheres summer.  Its main  |asterism|Asterism|  consists of 11 stars, and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5, the traditional limit for naked-eye visibility.     Serpens Caputs boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a 15-sided polygon, while Serpens Caudas are defined by a 25-sided polygon. In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of Serpens Caputs borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between  and . Serpens Caudas boundaries lie between right ascensions of  and  and declinations of  and .  The  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  adopted the three-letter abbreviation Ser for the constellation in 1922.                      Marking the heart of the serpent is the constellations brightest star,  |Alpha_Serpentis|Alpha_Serpentis| . Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a  |red_giant|Red_Giant|  of  |spectral_type|Spectral_Type|  K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual  |magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  of 2.630 ± 0.009,  meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star,  although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is  |Lambda_Serpentis|Lambda_Serpentis| , a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun  positioned only 12 parsecs away.  Another  |solar_analog|Solar_Analog|  in Serpens is the primary of  |Psi_Serpentis|Psi_Serpentis| , a binary star  located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.       |Beta|Beta_Serpentis| ,  |Gamma|Gamma_Serpentis| , and  |Iota_Serpentis|Iota_Serpentis|  form a distinctive triangular shape marking the head of the snake, with  |Kappa_Serpentis|Kappa_Serpentis|   being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant.  It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star  is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain.  The  |Mira_variable|Mira_Variable| |_R_Serpentis|R_Serpentis| , situated between Beta and Gamma, is visible to the naked eye at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14.  Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type  |subgiant|Subgiant|  located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05.  The star is known to show  |solar_like_oscillations|Solar_Like_Oscillations| .       |Delta_Serpentis|Delta_Serpentis| , forming part of the body of the snake between the heart and the head, is a multiple star system  positioned around 70 parsecs from Earth. Consisting of four stars, the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3.79 as viewed from Earth,  although two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.80, provide nearly all the light.  The primary, a white subgiant, is a  |Delta_Scuti_variable|Delta_Scuti_Variable|  with an average apparent magnitude of 4.23.  Positioned very near Delta, both in the night sky and likely in actual space at an estimated distance of around 70 parsecs,  is the  |barium_star|Barium_Star| |_16_Serpentis|16_Serpentis| .  Another notable variable star visible to the naked eye is  |Chi_Serpentis|Chi_Serpentis| , an  |Alpha²_Canum_Venaticorum_variable|Alpha²_Canum_Venaticorum_Variable|  situated midway between Delta and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5.33 by 0.03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1.5 days.      The two stars in Serpens Caput that form part of the Snakes body below the heart are  |Epsilon|Epsilon_Serpentis|  and  |Mu_Serpentis|Mu_Serpentis| , both third-magnitude  |A_type_main_sequence_stars|A_Type_Main_Sequence_Star| .   Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an  |Am_star|Am_Star| ,  while Mu is a binary.  Located slightly northwest of Mu is  |36_Serpentis|36_Serpentis| , another A-type main-sequence star. This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a  |Lambda_Boötis_star|Lambda_Boötis_Star| , meaning that it has solar-like amounts of  |carbon|Carbon| ,  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| , and  |oxygen|Oxygen| , while containing very low amounts of  |iron_peak|Iron_Peak|  elements.   |25_Serpentis|25_Serpentis| , positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a  |spectroscopic_binary|Spectroscopic_Binary|   consisting of a hot  |B_type_giant|Blue_Giant|  and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a  |slowly_pulsating_B_star|Slowly_Pulsating_B_Star| , which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.      Serpens Caput contains many  |RR_Lyrae_variables|Rr_Lyrae_Variable| , although most are too faint to be seen without professional photography. The brightest is  |VY_Serpentis|Vy_Serpentis| , only of 10th magnitude. This stars period has been increasing by approximately 1.2 seconds per century.  A variable star of a different kind is  |Tau_4_Serpentis|Tau4_Serpentis| , a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days.  This star has been found to display an inverse  |P_Cygni_profile|P_Cygni_Profile| ,  where cold infalling gas on to the star creates  |redshift|Redshift| ed hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.      Several stars in Serpens have been found to have  |planets|Exoplanet| . The brightest,  |Omega_Serpentis|Omega_Serpentis| , located between Epsilon and Mu, is an  |orange_giant|Orange_Giant|  with a planet of at least 1.7  |Jupiter|Jupiter| -masses.   |NN_Serpentis|Nn_Serpentis| , an eclipsing  |post_common_envelope_binary|Common_Envelope|  consisting of a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  and a  |red_dwarf|Red_Dwarf| ,  is very likely to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses.  Although it does not have a planet, the solar analog  |HD_137510|Hd_137510|  has been found to have a  |brown_dwarf|Brown_Dwarf|  companion within the  |brown_dwarf_desert|Brown_Dwarf_Desert| .       |PSR_B1534_11|Psr_B1534_11|  is a system consisting of two  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star|  orbiting each other, one of which is a  |pulsar|Pulsar|  with a period of 37.9 milliseconds. Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant, the system was used to test  |Albert_Einsteins|Albert_Einstein|  theory of  |general_relativity|General_Relativity| , validating the systems relativistic parameters to within 0.2% of values predicted by the theory.  The  |X_ray|X_Ray|  emission from the system has been found to be present when the non-pulsar star intersects the equatorial  |pulsar_wind|Pulsar_Wind|  of the pulsar, and the systems orbit has been found to vary slightly.           The brightest star in the tail,  |Eta_Serpentis|Eta_Serpentis| , is similar to Alpha Serpentis primary in that it is a red giant of spectral class K. This star, however, is known to exhibit solar-like oscillations over a period of approximately 2.16 hours.  The other two stars in Serpens Cauda forming its asterism are  |Theta|Theta_Serpentis|  and  |Xi_Serpentis|Xi_Serpentis| . Xi, where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head, is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away.  Two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of around 3.5, form a spectroscopic binary with an  |angular_separation|Angular_Separation|  of only 2.2 milli |arcseconds|Arcseconds| ,  and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment. The primary is a  |white_giant|White_Giant|  with an excess of  |strontium|Strontium| . Theta, forming the tip of the tail, is also a multiple system, consisting of two A-type main-sequence stars with a combined apparent magnitude of around 4.1 separated by almost half an arcminute.     Lying near the boundary with Ophiuchus are  |Zeta|Zeta_Serpentis| ,  |Nu|Nu_Serpentis| , and  |Omicron_Serpentis|Omicron_Serpentis| . All three are 4th-magnitude main-sequence stars, with Nu and Omicron being of spectral type A   and Zeta being of spectral type F.  Nu is a single star with a 9th-magnitude visual companion,  while Omicron is a Delta Scuti variable with amplitude variations of 0.01 magnitudes.  In 1909, the  |symbiotic_nova|Symbiotic_Nova| |_RT_Serpentis|Rt_Serpentis|  appeared near Omicron, although it only reached a maximum magnitude of 10.      The star system  |59_Serpentis|59_Serpentis| , also known as d Serpentis, is a triple star system  consisting of a spectroscopic binary containing an A-type star and an orange giant  and an orange giant secondary.  The system shows  |irregular_variations_in_brightness|Irregular_Variable|  between magnitudes 5.17 and 5.2.  In 1970, the nova  |FH_Serpentis|Fh_Serpentis|  appeared just slightly north of 59 Serpentis, reaching a maximum brightness of 4.5.  Also near 59 Serpentis in the  |Serpens_Cloud|Serpens_Cloud|  are several  |Orion_variables|Orion_Variable| .  |MWC_297|Mwc_297|  is a  |Herbig_Be_star|Herbig_Ae_Be_Star|  that in 1994 exhibited a large  |X_ray|X_Ray|  flare and increased in X-ray luminosity by five times before returning to the quiescent state.  The star also appears to possess a  |circumstellar_disk|Circumstellar_Disk| .  Another Orion variable in the region is  |VV_Serpentis|Vv_Serpentis| , a Herbig Ae star that has been found to exhibit Delta Scuti pulsations.  VV Serpentis has also, like MWC 297, been found to have a dusty disk surrounding it,  and is also a  |UX_Orionis_star|Ux_Orionis_Star| ,  meaning that it shows irregular variations in its brightness.      The star  |HR_6958|Hr_6958| , also known as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha 2 Canum Venaticorum variable that is faintly visible to the naked eye.  The stars metal abundance is ten times higher than the Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess  |silicon|Silicon| .  Barely visible to the naked eye is  |HD_172365|Hd_172365| ,  a likely post- |blue_straggler|Blue_Straggler|  in the open cluster  |IC_4756|Ic_4756|  that contains a large excess of  |lithium|Lithium| .   |HD_172189|Hd_172189| , also located in IC 4756, is an  |Algol_variable|Algol_Variable|  eclipsing binary  with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.      As the  |galactic_plane|Galactic_Plane|  passes through it, Serpens Cauda contains many massive  |OB_stars|Ob_Star| . Several of these are visible to the naked eye, such as  |NW_Serpentis|Nw_Serpentis| , an early  |Be_star|Be_Star|  that has been found to be somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between  |Beta_Cephei_variables|Beta_Cephei_Variable|  and slowly pulsating B stars.  Although not visible to the naked eye,  |HD_167971|Hd_167971|  is a  |Beta_Lyrae_variable|Beta_Lyrae_Variable|  triple system consisting of three very hot  |O_type_stars|O_Type_Star| . A member of the cluster  |NGC_6604|Ngc_6604| ,  the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or  |supergiant|Blue_Supergiant|  of a late O or early B spectral type.  Also an eclipsing  binary, the  |HD_166734|Hd_166734|  system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other.  Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is  |HD_161701|Hd_161701| , a spectroscopic binary consisting of a  |B_type|B_Type_Star|  primary and an  |Ap|Ap_Star|  secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of  |mercury|Mercury|  and  |manganese|Manganese|  and an Ap star.      South of the  |Eagle_Nebula|Eagle_Nebula|  on the border with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary  |W_Serpentis|W_Serpentis| , whose primary is a white giant that is interacting with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an  |accretion_disk|Accretion_Disk| , and was one of the first discovered  |Serpentids|Serpentid| , which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong  |far_ultraviolet|Far_Ultraviolet|  spectral lines.  It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase, and will evolve first into  |double_periodic_variables|Double_Periodic_Variable|  and then classical Algol variables.    Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing  |Wolf–Rayet|Wolf–Rayet_Star|  binary  |CV_Serpentis|Cv_Serpentis| , consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped  |nebula|Nebula| , likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary.  The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.      Serpens Cauda contains a few  |X_ray_binaries|X_Ray_Binary| . One of these,  |GX_17_2|Gx_17_2| , is a  |low_mass_X_ray_binary|Low_Mass_X_Ray_Binary|  consisting of a neutron star and, as in all low-mass X-ray binaries, a low-mass star. The system has been classified as a  |Sco_like_Z_source|Z_Source| , meaning that its accretion is near the  |Eddington_limit|Eddington_Limit| .  The system has also been found to approximately every 3 days brighten by around 3.5  |K_band|Apparent_Magnitudestandard_Reference_Values|  magnitudes, possibly due to the presence of a  |synchrotron_jet|Synchrotron_Radiation| .  Another low-mass X-ray binary,  |Serpens_X_1|Serpens_X_1| , undergoes occasional X-ray bursts. One in particular lasted nearly four hours, possibly explained by the burning of carbon in a heavy element ocean .               As the galactic plane does not pass through this part of Serpens, a view to many galaxies beyond it is possible. However, a few structures of the Milky Way Galaxy are present in Serpens Caput, such as  |Messier_5|Messier_5| , a  |globular_cluster|Globular_Cluster|  positioned approximately 8° southwest of α Serpentis, next to the star  |5_Serpentis|5_Serpentis| . Barely visible to the naked eye under good conditions,  and is located approximately 25,000  ly distant.  Messier 5 contains a large number of known RR Lyrae variable stars,  and is receding from us at over 50  km/s.  The cluster contains two  |millisecond_pulsars|Millisecond_Pulsar| , one of which is in a binary, allowing the  |proper_motion|Proper_Motion|  of the cluster to be measured. The binary could help our understanding of  |neutron_degenerate_matter|Neutron_Degenerate_Matter| ; the current median mass, if confirmed, would exclude any soft  |equation_of_state|Equation_Of_State|  for such matter.  The cluster has been used to test for  |magnetic_dipole_moments|Magnetic_Dipole_Moment|  in neutrinos, which could shed light on some hypothetical particles such as the  |axion|Axion| .  Another globular cluster is  |Palomar_5|Palomar_5| , found just south of Messier 5. Many stars are leaving this globular cluster due to the Milky Ways gravity, forming a  |tidal_tail|Tidal_Tail|  over 30000 light-years long.      The  |L134|L134| / |L183|L183|  is a  |dark_nebula|Dark_Nebula|  complex that, along with a third cloud, is likely formed by fragments of a single original cloud located 36 degrees away from the galactic plane, a large distance for dark nebulae.  The entire complex is thought to be around 140 parsecs distant.  L183, also referred to as L134N, is home to several infrared sources, indicating pre-stellar sources  thought to present the first known observation of the contraction phase between cloud cores and prestellar cores.  The core is split into three regions,  with a combined mass of around 25 solar masses.      Outside of the Milky Way, there are no bright deep-sky objects for amateur astronomers in Serpens Caput, with nothing else above 10th magnitude. The brightest is  |NGC_5962|Ngc_5962| , a  |spiral_galaxy|Spiral_Galaxy|  positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant  with an apparent magnitude of 11.34.  Slightly fainter is  |NGC_5921|Ngc_5921| , a  |barred_spiral_galaxy|Barred_Spiral_Galaxy|  with a  |LINER|Liner| -type  |active_galactic_nucleus|Active_Galactic_Nucleus|  situated somewhat closer at a distance of 21 megaparsecs.  A  |type_II_supernova|Type_Ii_Supernova|  was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN 2001X.  Fainter still are the spirals  |NGC_5964|Ngc_5964|   and  |NGC_6118|Ngc_6118| , with the latter being host to the  |supernova|Supernova| |_SN_2004dk|Sn_2004Dk| .          |Hoags_Object|Hoags_Object| , located 600 million light-years from Earth, is a member of the very rare class of galaxies known as  |ring_galaxies|Ring_Galaxy| . The outer ring is largely composed of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxys coherence and therefore detached.  |Arp_220|Arp_220|  is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical  |ultraluminous_infrared_galaxy|Ultraluminous_Infrared_Galaxy| , Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoags Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of  |colliding|Galactic_Collision|  with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive  |star_formation|Star_Formation|  throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies  |NGC_5953_and_NGC_5954|Ngc_5953_5954| . In this case, both are  |active_galaxies|Active_Galaxy| , with the former a  |Seyfert_2_galaxy|Seyfert_2_Galaxy|  and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.       |Seyferts_Sextet|Seyferts_Sextet|  is a  |group|Galaxy_Group|  of six galaxies, four of which are  |interacting_gravitationally|Interacting_Galaxy|  and two of which simply appear to be a part of the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound  |cluster|Galaxy_Cluster|  lies at a distance of 190 million  |light_years|Light_Year|  from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyferts Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually  |merge|Galactic_Merger|  to form a large  |elliptical_galaxy|Elliptical_Galaxy| .  The radio source  |3C_326|3C_326|  was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north.  This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.      A much larger galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354  |Abell_2063|Abell_2063| .  The cluster is thought to be interacting with the nearby galaxy group  |MKW_3s|Mkw_3S| , based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the  |cD_galaxy|Cd_Galaxy|  at the center of Abell 2063.  The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s— |NGC_5920|Ngc_5920| —appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity.  Near the 5th-magnitude star  |Pi_Serpentis|Pi_Serpentis|  lies  |AWM_4|Awm_4| , a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy,  |NGC_6051|Ngc_6051| , is a  |radio_galaxy|Radio_Galaxy|  that is probably responsible for this enrichment.  Similar to AWM 4, the cluster  |Abell_2052|Abell_2052|  has central cD radio galaxy,  |3C_317|3C_317| . This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago.  The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.         Consisting of two quasars with a separation of less than 5  |arcseconds|Arcsecond| , the quasar pair  |4C_11_50|4C_11_50|  is one of the visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated.  The foreground member of the pair does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component enough to produce a  |lensed|Gravitational_Lensing|  image, although it does have a true companion of its own.  An even stranger galaxy pair is  |3C_321|3C_321| . Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and are in the process of merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the formers jet driving material onto the latters  |supermassive_black_hole|Supermassive_Black_Hole| .      An example of  |gravitational_lens|Gravitational_Lens| ing is found in the radio galaxy  |3C_324|3C_324| . First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z    1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z    0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered,  the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a  |dust_lane|Dust_Lane|  obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus.  In even shorter wavelengths, the  |BL_Lac_object|Bl_Lac_Object| |_PG_1553_113|Pg_1553_113|  is a heavy emitter of  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray| . This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the  |TeV|Electronvolt|  range as of 2007.  The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.  In 2012, the object flared in the gamma-ray spectrum, tripling in luminosity for two nights, allowing the redshift to be accurately measured as z    0.49.      Several  |gamma_ray_bursts|Gamma_Ray_Burst|  have been observed in Serpens Caput, such as  |GRB_970111|Grb_970111| , one of the brightest GRBs observed. An optical transient event associated with this GRB has not been found, despite its intensity. The host galaxy initially also proved elusive, however it now appears that the host is a  |Seyfert_I_galaxy|Seyfert_Galaxytype_I_Seyfert_Galaxies|  located at redshift z    0.657.  The X-ray afterglow of the GRB has also been much fainter than for other dimmer GRBs.  More distant is  |GRB_060526|Grb_060526|  , from which X-ray and optical afterglows were detected. This GRB was very faint for a long-duration GRB.           Part of the galactic plane passes through the tail, and thus Serpens Cauda is rich in deep-sky objects within our own galaxy. The  |Eagle_Nebula|Eagle_Nebula|  and its associated star cluster,  |Messier_16|Messier_16|  lie 7,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the galactic center. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the  |Pillars_of_Creation|Pillars_Of_Creation| , three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope| . The stars being born in the Eagle Nebula, added to those with an approximate age of 5 million years have an average temperature of 45,000  |kelvins|Kelvin|  and produce prodigious amounts of radiation that will eventually  |destroy|Photoevaporation|  the dust pillars. Despite its fame, the Eagle Nebula is fairly dim, with an integrated magnitude of approximately 6.0. The star-forming regions in the nebula are often  |evaporating_gaseous_globules|Evaporating_Gaseous_Globule| ; unlike  |Bok_globules|Bok_Globule|  they only hold one  |protostar|Protostar| .      North of Messier 16, at a distance of approximately 2000 parsecs, is the  |OB_association|Ob_Association| |_Serpens_OB2|Serpens_Ob2| , containing over 100 OB stars. Around 5 million years old, the association appears to still contain star-forming regions, and the light from its stars is illuminating the  |HII_region|Hii_Region| |_S_54|Sh2_54| .  Within this HII region is the open cluster  |NGC_6604|Ngc_6604| , which is the same age as the surrounding OB association,  and the cluster is now thought to simply be the densest part of it.  The cluster appears to be producing a thermal chimney of ionized gas, caused by the interaction of the gas from the  |galactic_disk|Galactic_Disk|  with the  |galactic_halo|Galactic_Halo| .     Another open cluster in Serpens Cauda is  |IC_4756|Ic_4756| , containing at least one naked-eye star, HD 172365  . Positioned approximately 440 parsecs distant,  the cluster is estimated to be around 800 million years old, quite old for an open cluster.  Despite the presence of the Milky Way in Serpens Cauda, one globular cluster can be found:  |NGC_6535|Ngc_6535| , although invisible to the naked eye, can be made out in small telescopes just north of Zeta Serpentis. Rather small and sparse for a globular cluster,  this cluster contains no known RR Lyrae variables, which is unusual for a globular cluster.       |MWC_922|Mwc_922|  is a star surrounded by a  |planetary_nebula|Planetary_Nebula| . Dubbed the  |Red_Square_Nebula|Red_Square_Nebula|  due to its similarities to the  |Red_Rectangle_Nebula|Red_Rectangle_Nebula| , the planetary nebula appears to be a nearly perfect square with a dark band around the equatorial regions. The nebula contains concentric rings, which are similar to those seen in the supernova  |SN_1987A|Sn_1987A| .  MWC 922 itself is an  |FS_Canis_Majoris_variable|Fs_Canis_Majoris_Variable| ,  meaning that it is a Be star containing exceptionally bright  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| |emission_lines|Emission_Line|  as well as select  |forbidden_lines|Forbidden_Line| , likely due to the presence of a close binary.  East of Xi Serpentis is another planetary nebula,  |Abell_41|Abell_41| , containing the binary star  |MT_Serpentis|Mt_Serpentis|  at its center. The nebula appears to have a bipolar structure, and the axis of symmetry of the nebula has been found to be within 5° of the line perpendicular to the orbital plane of the stars, strengthening the link between binary stars and bipolar planetary nebulae.  On the other end of the stellar age spectrum is  |L483|L483| , a dark nebula which contains the protostar  |IRAS_18418_0440|Iras_18418_0440| . Although classified as a  |class_0_protostar|Protostarclasses_Of_Protostars| , it has some unusual features for such an object, such as a lack of high-velocity  |stellar_winds|Stellar_Wind| , and it has been proposed that this object is in transition between class 0 and  |class_I|Protostarclasses_Of_Protostars| .  A  |variable_nebula|Variable_Nebula|  exists around the protostar, although it is only visible in infrared light.         The  |Serpens_cloud|Serpens_Cloud|  is a massive star-forming  |molecular_cloud|Molecular_Cloud|  situated in the southern part of Serpens Cauda. Only two million years old  and 420 parsecs distant,  the cloud is known to contain many protostars such as  |Serpens_FIRS_1|Serpens_Firs_1|   and  |Serpens_SVS_20|Serpens_Svs_20| .  The  |Serpens_South|Serpens_South|  protocluster was uncovered by NASAs  |Spitzer_Space_Telescope|Spitzer_Space_Telescope|  in the southern portion of the cloud,  and it appears that star formation is still continuing in the region.  Another site of star formation is the  |Westerhout_40|Westerhout_40|  complex, consisting of a prominent HII region adjacent to a molecular cloud.  Located around 500 parsecs distant,  it is one of the nearest massive regions of star formation, but as the molecular cloud obscures the HII region, rendering it and its embedded cluster tough to see visibly, it is not as well-studied as others.  The embedded cluster likely contains over 600 stars above 0.1 solar masses,  with several massive stars, including at least one O-type star, being responsible for lighting the HII region and the production of a  |bubble|Stellar_Wind_Bubble| .     Despite the presence of the Milky Way, several active galaxies are visible in Serpens Cauda as well, such as  |PDS_456|Pds_456| , found near Xi Serpentis. The most intrinsically luminous nearby active galaxy,  this AGN has been found to be extremely variable in the  |X_ray_spectrum|X_Ray_Spectrum| . This has allowed light to be shed on the nature of the supermassive black hole at the center, likely a  |Kerr_black_hole|Kerr_Black_Hole| .  It is possible that the quasar is undergoing a transition from an ultraluminous infrared galaxy to a classical radio-quiet quasar, but there are problems with this theory, and the object appears to be an exceptional object that does not completely lie within current classification systems. Nearby is  |NRAO_530|Nrao_530| , a  |blazar|Blazar|  that has been known to flare in the X-rays occasionally. One of these flares was for less than 2000 seconds, making it the shortest flare ever observed in a blazar as of 2004.  The blazar also appears to show periodic variability in its  |radio_wave|Radio_Wave|  output over two different periods of six and ten years.        There are two daytime  |meteor_showers|Meteor_Shower|  that  |radiate|Radiant|  from Serpens, the  |Omega_Serpentids|Omega_Serpentids|  and the  |Sigma_Serpentids|Sigma_Serpentids| . Both showers peak between December 18 and December 25.
