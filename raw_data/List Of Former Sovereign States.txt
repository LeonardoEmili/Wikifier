     A historical sovereign state is a state that once existed, but has since been dissolved due to conflict, war, rebellion, annexation, or uprising.     This page lists  |sovereign_states|Sovereign_States| ,  |countries|Country| ,  |nations|Nation| , or  |empires|Empire|  that have ceased to exist as political entities, grouped geographically and by constitutional nature.               The criteria for inclusion in this list is similar to that of the  |List_of_states_with_limited_recognition|List_Of_States_With_Limited_Recognition| . To be included here, a polity must have claimed statehood and either:   had de facto control over a territory, a population, a government, a capacity to enter into relations with other states, or   have been recognised as a state by at least one other state.     For purposes of this list, the cutoff between medieval and early modern states is the  |Fall_of_Constantinople|Fall_Of_Constantinople|  in 1453.        |List_of_sovereign_states_in_the_35th_century_BC|List_Of_Sovereign_States_In_The_35Th_Century_Bc| |_List_of_Bronze_Age_states|List_Of_Bronze_Age_States| |_List_of_Classical_Age_states|List_Of_Classical_Age_States| |_List_of_Iron_Age_states|List_Of_Iron_Age_States| |_List_of_states_during_Late_Antiquity|List_Of_States_During_Late_Antiquity| |_List_of_states_during_the_Middle_Ages|List_Of_States_During_The_Middle_Ages| |_Saadi_principality_of_Sus_and_Tagmadert|Tagmadert| |_Naqsid_principality_of_Tetouan|Tetouan| |_Republic_of_Salé|Republic_Of_Salé|                                        .
