           Pong is one of the earliest  |arcade_video_games|Arcade_Gamearcade_Video_Games| . It is a  |table_tennis|Table_Tennis|  sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by  |Atari|Atari,_Inc| , which released it in 1972.  |Allan_Alcorn|Allan_Alcorn|  created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder  |Nolan_Bushnell|Nolan_Bushnell| . Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the  |Magnavox_Odyssey|Magnavox_Odyssey| ; Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement. Bushnell and Atari co-founder  |Ted_Dabney|Ted_Dabney|  were surprised by the quality of Alcorns work and decided to manufacture the game.     Pong was the first commercially successful video game, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied its gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. The company released several sequels which built upon the originals gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through  |Sears|Sears,_Roebuck_And_Company|  retail stores. It also was a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong is part of the permanent collection of the  |Smithsonian_Institution|Smithsonian_Institution|  in Washington, D.C. due to its cultural impact.          Pong is a  |two-dimensional|2D_Computer_Graphics| |sports_game|Sports_Game|  that simulates  |table_tennis|Table_Tennis| . The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.                  Pong was the first game developed by  |Atari|Atari,_Inc| .   After producing  Computer Space , Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with  |Bally_Manufacturing_Corporation|Bally_Manufacturing_Corporation|  for a driving game.  Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired  |Allan_Alcorn|Allan_Alcorn|  because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at  |Ampex|Ampex| . Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games.  To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm-up exercise.  Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with  |General_Electric|General_Electric|  for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a  |PDP-1|Pdp-1|  computer in 1964 while attending college.  However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnells viewing of the Magnavox Odysseys Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the  |Magnavox|Magnavox|  Profit Caravan in  |Burlingame,_California|Burlingame,_California|  where he played the  |Magnavox_Odyssey|Magnavox_Odyssey|  demonstration, specifically the table tennis game.   Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.     Alcorn first examined Bushnells schematics for Computer Space, but found them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of  |transistor–transistor_logic|Transistor–Transistor_Logic|  and Bushnells game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the balls angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of the screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.     Three months into development, Bushnell told Alcorn he wanted the game to feature realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd.  Dabney wanted the game to boo and hiss when a player lost a round. Alcorn had limited space available for the necessary electronics and was unaware of how to create such sounds with  |digital_circuits|Digital_Electronics| . After inspecting the  |sync_generator|Video_Signal_Generatorsync_Pulse_Generators| , he discovered that it could generate different tones and used those for the games sound effects. To construct the prototype, Alcorn purchased a $75  |Hitachi|Hitachi| |black-and-white|Black-And-White|  television set from a local store, placed it into a  wooden  |cabinet|Arcade_Cabinet| , and soldered the wires into boards to create the necessary circuitry. The prototype impressed Bushnell and Dabney so much that they felt it could be a profitable product and decided to test its marketability.          In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn installed the Pong prototype at a local bar, Andy Capps Tavern.     They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bars owner and manager, Bill Gaddis;  Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype on one of the tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at  |Bally|Bally_Manufacturing|  and  |Midway_Manufacturing|Midway_Games| ; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.     After hearing about the games success, Bushnell decided there would be more profit for Atari to manufacture the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnells comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a  |line_of_credit|Line_Of_Credit|  from  |Wells_Fargo|Wells_Fargo|  that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line.  The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972.   Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.           After the success of Pong, Bushnell pushed his employees to create new products.  In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the designs logic during the day, while Alcorn  |debugged|Debugging|  the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a  |single_chip|Integrated_Circuit|  designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip had yet to be tested and built before the prototype was constructed. The chip was finished in the latter half of 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a  |consumer_product|Consumer_Product| .     Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Ataris vice-president of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt the product was too expensive and would not interest consumers.  Atari contacted the  |Sears_Sporting_Goods|Sears,_Roebuck_And_Company|  department after noticing a  |Magnavox_Odyssey|Magnavox_Odyssey|  advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed the game with a representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Ataris executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy  |trade_fair|Trade_Fair|  in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders due to the fact that they did not know that they needed a private showing.     While at the show, they met Quinn again, and, a few days later, set up a meeting with him to obtain a sales order. In order to gain approval from the Sporting Goods department, Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago. Alcorn and Lipkin traveled to the  |Sears_Tower|Sears_Tower|  and, despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game, obtained approval. Bushnell told Quinn he could produce 75,000  units in time for the  |Christmas_season|Christmas_And_Holiday_Season| ; however, Quinn requested double the amount. Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150,000  units, he agreed. Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by  |venture_capital|Venture_Capital| ist  |Don_Valentine|Don_Valentine| . Supervised by Jimm Tubb, the factory fulfilled the Sears order.  The first units manufactured were branded with Sears Tele-Games name. Atari later released a version under its own brand in 1976.           The success of Pong attracted the attention of  |Ralph_Baer|Ralph_H._Baer| , the inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey, and his employer,  |Sanders_Associates|Sanders_Associates| . Sanders had an agreement with Magnavox to handle the Odysseys sublicensing, which included dealing with infringement on its  |exclusive_rights|Exclusive_Right| . However, Magnavox had not pursued legal action against Atari and numerous other companies that released Pong clones.  Sanders continued to apply pressure, and in April 1974 Magnavox filed suit against Atari, Allied Leisure,  |Bally_Midway|Midway_Games|  and  |Chicago_Dynamics|Chicago_Coin| .  Magnavox argued that Atari had infringed on Baers patents and his concept of electronic ping-pong based on detailed records Sanders kept of the Odysseys design process dating back to 1966. Other documents included depositions from witnesses and a signed guest book that demonstrated Bushnell had played the Odysseys table tennis game prior to releasing Pong.  In response to claims that he saw the Odyssey, Bushnell later stated that, The fact is that I absolutely did see the Odyssey game and I didnt think it was very clever.      After considering his options, Bushnell decided to settle with Magnavox out of court. Bushnells lawyer felt they could win; however, he estimated legal costs of  |US$|United_States_Dollar| 1.5 million, which would have exceeded Ataris funds. Magnavox offered Atari an agreement to become a licensee for US$700,000. Other companies producing Pong clones —Ataris competitors—would have to pay royalties. In addition, Magnavox would obtain the rights to Atari products developed over the next year. Magnavox continued to pursue legal action against the other companies, and proceedings began shortly after Ataris settlement in June 1976. The first case took place at the  |district_court|United_States_District_Court_For_The_Northern_District_Of_Illinois|  in Chicago, with Judge John Grady presiding.  To avoid Magnavox obtaining rights to its products, Atari decided to delay the release of its products for a year, and withheld information from Magnavoxs attorneys during visits to Atari facilities.               The Pong arcade games manufactured by Atari were a great success. The prototype was well received by Andy Capps Tavern patrons; people came to the bar solely to play the game. Following its release, Pong consistently earned four times more revenue than other coin-operated machines.  Bushnell estimated that the game earned US$35–40 per day, which he described as nothing hed ever seen before in the coin-operated entertainment industry at the time. The games earning power resulted in an increase in the number of orders Atari received. This provided Atari with a steady source of income; the company sold the machines at three times the  |cost_of_production|Cost-Of-Production_Theory_Of_Value| . By 1973, the company had filled 2,500  orders, and, at the end of 1974, sold more than 8,000  units. The arcade cabinets have since become collectors items with the  |cocktail-table_version|Arcade_Cabinetcocktail_Or_Table_Cabinets|  being the rarest.  Soon after the games successful testing at Andy Capps Tavern, other companies began visiting the bar to inspect it. Similar games appeared on the market three months later, produced by companies like Ramtek and  |Nutting_Associates|Nutting_Associates| .  Atari could do little against the competitors as they had not initially filed for patents on the  |solid_state|Solid_State|  technology used in the game. When the company did file for patents, complications delayed the process. As a result, the market consisted primarily of Pong clones ; author Steven Kent estimated that Atari had produced less than a third of the machines.  Bushnell referred to the competitors as Jackals because he felt they had an unfair advantage. His solution to competing against them was to produce more innovative games and concepts.     Home Pong was an instant success following its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000  units were sold that holiday season.   The game became Sears most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones to capitalize on the home consoles success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions.  |Coleco|Coleco|  entered the video game market with their  |Telstar_console|Telstar| ; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the  |Color_TV_Game_6|Color_Tv_Game|  in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendos entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Ataris Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics  |TV_Fun|Apf_Tv_Fun|  consoles are moderately rare.  Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.     Several publications consider Pong the game that launched the  |video_game_industry|Video_Game_Industry|  as a lucrative enterprise.  Video game author David Ellis sees the game as the cornerstone of the video game industrys success, and called the arcade game one of the most historically significant titles. Kent attributes the arcade phenomenon to Pong and Ataris games that followed it, and considers the release of the home version the successful beginning of home  |video_game_consoles|Video_Game_Console| . Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of  |Gamasutra|Gamasutra|  referred to the games release as the start of a new entertainment medium, and commented that its simple, intuitive gameplay made it a success. In 1996  Next Generation  named it one of the Top 100 Games of All Time , recounting that Next Generation staff ignor hundreds of thousands of dollars of 32-bit software to play Pong for hours when the Genesis version was released.   Entertainment Weekly  named Pong one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013.  Many of the companies that produced their own versions of Pong eventually became well known within the industry.  |Nintendo|Nintendo|  entered the video game market with clones of Home Pong. The revenue generated from them—each system sold over a million units—helped the company survive a difficult financial time, and spurred them to pursue video games further.  After seeing the success of Pong,  |Konami|Konami|  decided to break into the arcade game market and released its first title, Maze. Its moderate success drove the company to develop more titles.      Bushnell felt that Pong was especially significant in its role as a  |social_lubricant|Social_Lubricant| , since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, Id like to play Pong and theres nobody to play. It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, there are a lot of people who have come up to me over the years and said, I met my wife playing Pong, and thats kind of a nice thing to have achieved.           Bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the originals release: Pong Doubles, Super Pong, Ultra Pong, Quadrapong, and Pin-Pong. The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new gameplay elements; for example, Pong Doubles allows four players to compete in pairs, while Quadrapong—also released by  |Kee_Games|Kee_Games|  as Elimination—has them compete against each other in a four way field.   Bushnell also conceptualized a  |free-to-play|Free-To-Play|  version of Pong to entertain children in a Doctors office. He initially titled it Snoopy Pong and fashioned the cabinet after  |Snoopys|Snoopy|  doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to  Puppy Pong  and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of  |Chuck_E._Cheeses|Chuck_E._Cheeses|  restaurants.     In 1976, Atari released  Breakout , a single-player variation of Pong where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ball.  Like Pong, Breakout was followed by  |numerous_clones|Breakout_Clone|  that copied the gameplay, such as  Arkanoid ,  Alleyway , and  Break Em All .      Atari remade the game on numerous platforms. In 1977, Pong and several variants of the game were featured in  Video Olympics , one of the original release titles for the  |Atari_2600|Atari_2600| . Pong has also been included in several Atari compilations on platforms including the  |Sega_Genesis|Sega_Genesis| ,  |PlayStation_Portable|Playstation_Portable| ,  |Nintendo_DS|Nintendo_Ds| , and  |personal_computer|Personal_Computer| .      Through an agreement with Atari,  |Bally_Gaming_and_Systems|Bally_Technologies|  developed a  |slot_machine|Slot_Machine|  version of the game.  The Atari published  TD Overdrive  includes Pong as an extra game which is played during the loading screen.   A  |3D|3D_Computer_Graphics| |platform_game|Platform_Game|  with  |puzzle|Puzzle|  and  |shooter|Shooter_Game|  elements was reportedly in development by  |Atari_Corporation|Atari_Corporation|  for the  |Atari_Jaguar|Atari_Jaguar|  in September 1995 under the title Pong 2000, as part of their series of arcade game updates for the system and was set to have an original storyline for it,   but it was never released. In 1999, the game was  |remade|Pong:_The_Next_Level|  for home computers and the  |PlayStation|Playstation|  with  |3D_graphics|3D_Computer_Graphics|  and  |power-ups|Power-Up| .   In 2012, Atari celebrated the 40th anniversary of Pong by releasing Pong World.          The game is featured in episodes of television series including  That 70s Show ,   King of the Hill   and  Saturday Night Live .  In 2006, an  |American_Express|American_Express|  commercial featured  |Andy_Roddick|Andy_Roddick|  in a tennis match against the white, in-game paddle.  Other video games have also referenced and parodied Pong; for example  |Neuromancer|Neuromancer|  for the  |Commodore_64|Commodore_64|  and  Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts  for the  |Xbox_360|Xbox_360| .   The concert event  |Video_Games_Live|Video_Games_Live|  has performed audio from Pong as part of a special retro Classic Arcade Medley .   |Frank_Blacks|Black_Francis|  song Whatever Happened to Pong? on the album  Teenager of the Year  references the games elements.      Dutch design studio Buro Vormkrijgers created a Pong-themed clock as a fun project within their offices. After the studio decided to manufacture it for retail, Atari took legal action in February 2006. The two companies eventually reached an agreement in which Buro Vormkrijgers could produce a limited number under license.  In 1999, French artist  |Pierre_Huyghe|Pierre_Huyghe|  created an installation titled Atari Light , in which two people use handheld gaming devices to play Pong on an illuminated ceiling. The work was shown at the  |Venice_Biennale|Venice_Biennale|  in 2001, and the  |Museo_de_Arte_Contemporáneo_de_Castilla_y_León|Museo_De_Arte_Contemporáneo_De_Castilla_Y_León|  in 2007.  The game was included in the  |London|London| |Barbican_Art_Gallerys|Barbican_Art_Gallery|  2002  |Game_On_exhibition|Game_On|  meant to showcase the various aspects of video game history, development, and culture.
