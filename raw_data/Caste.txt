            Caste is a form of  |social_stratification|Social_Stratification|  characterized by  |endogamy|Endogamy| , hereditary transmission of a style of life which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution.    Quote: caste ranked groups based on heredity within rigid systems of social stratification, especially those that constitute Hindu India. Some scholars, in fact, deny that true caste systems are found outside India. The caste is a closed group whose members are severely restricted in their choice of occupation and degree of social participation. Marriage outside the caste is prohibited. Social status is determined by the caste of ones birth and may only rarely be transcended.    Quote: caste, any of the ranked, hereditary, endogamous social groups, often linked with occupation, that together constitute traditional societies in South Asia, particularly among Hindus in India. Although sometimes used to designate similar groups in other societies, the “caste system” is uniquely developed in Hindu societies.    Quote: Caste Quote: Caste Quote: Castes A pure caste system is rooted in the religious order and may be thought of as a hierarchy of hereditary, endogamous, occupational groups with positions fixed and mobility barred by ritual distances between each caste. Empirically, the classical Hindu system of India approximated most closely to pure caste. The system existed for some 3,000 years and continues today despite many attempts to get rid of some of its restrictions. It is essentially connected with Hinduism.   1569HinduismHinduismscholars and yajna priestsrulers and warriorsfarmers, merchants and artisansworkmen/service providersHinduismbirth groups20121838Ramesh 1984, p. 15200119781934conceptual classification based on occupationgroupscommunity19863CPCC |Hindui|Hindui| |ngd|Ngd| 1382–1395Gellner 20011506–15751603–1636thrice borntwice bornonce born  |maginoo]]c._15|Maginoo]]C._15| |z|Z|  mangayaw  |vassals|Vassal| , lit. those under the power of another  |Visayan|Visayan_People|  kadatoan  babaiyon Visayan:  tumao ;  |Tagalog|Tagalog_People|  maginoo ;  |Kapampangan|Kapampangan_People|  ginu;  |Tausug|Tausug_People| bangsa mataasVisayan:  babaylan ; Tagalog:  katalonan Visayan:  timawa ; Tagalog:  maharlika Visayan,  |Maguindanao|Maguindanao_People|  ulipon ; Tagalog:  alipin ; Tausug: kiapangdilihan;  |Maranao|Maranao_People| kakatamokan in the northern areas of Chinapeople of the former Southern  |Song_dynasty|Song_Dynasty| |Tokugawa_shogunate|Tokugawa_Shogunate| 身分制 |kuge|Kuge| 백정munbanmuban중인-中人: literally middle people . This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the sangmin , farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a  |serf|Serf|  population known as the nobi. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population.  In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated,  and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea.  The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the  |Gabo_Reform|Gabo_Reform|  of 1894, but traces remained until 1930.     The opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the baekjeong. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate baekjeong into worship, with non-baekjeong finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage. Around the same time, the baekjeong began to resist open social discrimination.  They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an  |egalitarian|Egalitarianism|  Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and commoners , and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.      With the  |Gabo_reform|Gabo_Reform|  of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the  |Gabo_government|Enlightenment_Party| , the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal  |social_equality|Social_Equality| , which was implemented by the loyalists cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.

Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894–1910     While most Koreans by then had surnames and even  |bongwan|Bongwan| , although still substantial number of  |cheonmin|Cheonmin| , mostly consisted of  |serfs|Serfs|  and slaves, and  |untouchables|Untouchability|  did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term inmin and later, kungmin .            The  |Committee_for_Human_Rights_in_North_Korea|Committee_For_Human_Rights_In_North_Korea|  reported that Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.

Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202.             has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticize a supposedly egalitarian ancient Tibetan society.             |Yezidi|Yezidi|  society is hierarchical. The secular leader is a hereditary  |emir|Emir|  or prince, whereas a chief  |sheikh|Sheikh|  heads the religious hierarchy. The Yazidi are strictly  |endogamous|Endogamy| ; members of the three Yazidi castes, the  |murids|Murid| , sheikhs and  |pirs|Islam_Pir| , marry only within their group.

Estimates put their number at over 3.5 million residents who are discriminated, out of a total Yemeni population of around 22 million.             Various sociologists have reported caste systems in Africa.   The specifics of the caste systems have varied in ethnically and culturally diverse Africa, however the following features are common – it has been a closed system of social stratification, the social status is inherited, the castes are hierarchical, certain castes are shunned while others are merely endogamous and exclusionary.  In some cases, concepts of purity and impurity by birth have been prevalent in Africa. In other cases, such as the Nupe of Nigeria, the Beni Amer of East Africa, and the Tira of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.           Among the Igbo of  |Nigeria|Nigeria|  – especially  |Enugu|Enugu_State| ,  |Anambra|Anambra_State| ,  |Imo|Imo_State| ,  |Abia|Abia_State| ,  |Ebonyi|Ebonyi_State| ,  |Edo|Edo_State|  and  |Delta|Delta_State|  states of the country – Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by ones birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.     The osu class systems of eastern  |Nigeria|Nigeria|  and southern  |Cameroon|Cameroon|  are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the Osus people as owned by deities and outcasts.     The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.      In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in  |Ivory_Coast|Ivory_Coast| , with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.      Similarly, the  |Mandé|Mandé_Peoples|  societies in  |Gambia|Gambia| ,  |Ghana|Ghana| ,  |Guinea|Guinea| ,  |Ivory_Coast|Ivory_Coast| ,  |Liberia|Liberia| ,  |Senegal|Senegal|  and  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone|  have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the jonow slaves as inferior. Similarly, the  |Wolof|Wolof_People|  in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the geer , jaam and the underclass neeno. In various parts of West Africa,  |Fulani|Fula_People|  societies also have class divisions. Other castes include Griots, Forgerons, and Cordonniers.     Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the Malinke people no later than 14th century, and was present among the Wolof and Soninke, as well as some Songhay and Fulani populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the Sosso-Malinke war described in the Sunjata epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.     As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.             Ethel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in  |Central_Africa|Central_Africa|  were caste-like social stratification systems.  Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in  |Rwanda|Rwanda|  and  |Burundi|Burundi|  can be best described as castes.  The  |Tutsi|Tutsi| , noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous  |Hutu|Hutu|  and the least numerous  |Twa|Twa|  regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.           In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the  |Gurage|Gurage_People|  and  |Konso|Konso_People| . He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.   |Alula_Pankhurst|Alula_Pankhurst|  has published a study of caste groups in SW Ethiopia. Pankhurst, Alula. 1999. Caste in Africa: the evidence from south-western Ethiopia reconsidered . Africa 69, pp. 485–509.     Among the  |Kafa|Kingdom_Of_Kafa| , there were also traditionally groups labeled as castes. Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths , weavers , bards , potters, and tanners . In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves. p. 299. Sayuri Yoshida. Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant?

The  |Borana_Oromo|Borana_Oromo|  of southern  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia|  in the  |Horn_of_Africa|Horn_Of_Africa|  also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the  |Oromo_language|Oromo_Language| , they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.      The traditionally nomadic  |Somali_people|Somali_People|  are divided into clans, wherein the  |Rahanweyn|Rahanweyn|  agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the  |Madhiban|Madhiban|  were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts. I. M. Lewis, A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa , pp. 13–14 As Gabboye, the Madhiban along with the  |Yibir|Yibir|  and Tumaal  have since obtained political representation within  |Somalia|Somalia| , and their general social status has improved with the expansion of urban centers.                 For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded  |Cagots|Cagot|  who lived primarily in the Basque region of France and Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.         In July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the  |Equality_Act_2010|Equality_Act_2010| , to introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law . Government Equalities Office, , accessed 2 June 2016 Section 9 of the Equality Act 2010 provides that a  |Minister|Minister|  may by  |order|Statutory_Order|  amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste .     From September 2013 to February 2014,  |Meena_Dhanda|Meena_Dhanda|  led a project on Caste in Britain for the UK  |Equality_and_Human_Rights_Commission|Equality_And_Human_Rights_Commission|  .           In  |W._Lloyd_Warners|W._Lloyd_Warner|  view, the historic relationship between  |Blacks|African_Americans|  and  |Whites|White_Americans|  in the US showed many caste-like features such as residential segregation and marriage restrictions.  Discrimination based upon socio-economic factors are historically prevalent within the country.     According to Gerald D. Berreman, in the two systems, there are rigid rules of avoidance and certain types of contacts are defined as contaminating. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis for differentiation. The caste systems in India and the United States have higher groups which desire to retain their positions for themselves and thus perpetuate the two systems.      The process of creating a homogenized society by social engineering in both India and the US has created other institutions that have made class distinctions among different groups evident. Anthropologist James C. Scott elaborates on how “global  |capitalism|Capitalism|  is perhaps the most powerful force for homogenization, whereas the state may be the defender of local difference and variety in some instances.”  The caste system further emphasizes differences between the socio-economic classes that arise as a product of capitalism, which makes social mobility more difficult. Parts of the United States are sometimes divided by race and class status despite the national narrative of integration.
