         A skinhead is a member of a subculture originated among  |working_class|Working_Class|  youths in  |London|London| ,  |England|England| , in the 1960s and soon spread to other parts of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , with a second working class skinhead movement emerging worldwide in the 1980s. Motivated by  |social_alienation|Social_Alienation|  and  |working_class_solidarity|Solidarity| , skinheads are defined by their close-cropped or  |shaven_heads|Head_Shaving|  and working-class clothing such as  |Dr._Martens|Dr._Martens|  and  |steel_toe|Steel_Toe|  work boots,  |braces|Suspenders| , high rise and varying length straight-leg  |jeans|Jeans| , and button-down collar shirts, usually slim fitting in check or plain. The movement reached a peak during the 1960s, experienced a revival in the 1980s, and, since then, has endured in multiple contexts worldwide.     The rise to prominence of skinheads came in two waves, with the first wave taking place in the late 1960s and the second wave originating in the mid 1970s to early 1980s. The first skinheads were working class youths motivated by an expression of  |alternative_values|Alternative_Culture|  and working class pride, rejecting both the austerity and  |conservatism|Conservatism|  of the 1950s-early 1960s and the more  |middle_class|Middle_Class|  or  |bourgeois|Bourgeois| |hippie_movement|Hippie_Movement|  and  |peace_and_love|Hippie|  ethos of the mid to late 1960s. Skinheads were instead drawn towards more working class outsider  |subcultures|Subculture| , incorporating elements of early working class  |mod|Mod|  fashion and black  |Jamaica|Jamaica| n music and fashion, especially from Jamaican  |rude_boys|Rude_Boy| .  In the earlier stages of the movement, a considerable overlap existed between early skinhead subculture,  |mod_subculture|Mod_Subculture| , and the  |rude_boy_subculture|Rude_Boy|  found among  |Jamaican_British|Jamaican_British|  and  |Jamaican_immigrant|Jamaican_Diaspora|  youth, as these three groups interacted and fraternized with each other within the same working class and poor neighbourhoods in Britain.  As skinheads adopted elements of mod subculture and Jamaican British and Jamaican immigrant rude boy subculture, both first and second generation skins were influenced by the heavy, repetitive rhythms of  |dub|Dub_Music|  and  |ska|Ska| , as well as  |rocksteady|Rocksteady| ,  |reggae|Reggae| ,  |bluebeat|Blue_Beat_Records| , and  |African-American|African_Americans| |soul_music|Soul_Music| .       Members of the second generation in the 1980s were often  |ex-punks|Punk_Subculture| . However, many of these second generation ex-punk skinheads, though fans of ska and reggae like the previous generation of skinheads, continued to listen to and create  |punk_music|Punk_Music|  and were heavily involved in the  |punk_movement|Punk_Movement| . Skinhead subculture has remained closely connected with and has overlapped with punk subculture ever since. 1980s skins were closely aligned with  |first_wave_punk|1970S_Punk_Rock| , working class  |Oi!|Oi!|  and  |street_punk|Street_Punk| ,  |ska|Ska| ,  |reggae|Reggae| ,  |2_Tone_ska|2_Tone| ,  |ska_punk|Ska_Punk| ,  |dub|Dub_Music| ,  |anarchists|Anarchists|  and  |anarcho-punks|Anarcho-Punk| , and  |hardcore_punk|Hardcore_Punk| . Contemporary skinhead fashions range from clean-cut 1960s mod-influenced styles to less-strict  |punk|Punk_Subculture| - and  |hardcore|Hardcore_Punk| -influenced styles.      During the early 1980s, political affiliations grew in significance and split the subculture, distancing the  |far_right|Far-Right_Politics|  and  |far_left|Far-Left_Politics|  strands, although many skins describe themselves as  |apolitical|Apoliticism| . As a pro-working class movement that was initially highly regionalised and excluded by societys moral norms, skinhead culture sometimes attracted some violent and hard-line political elements and was eventually tainted in the mid-1980s by the tabloid hysteria of fringe and violent racial elements representing extreme  |racism|Racism| . Sims, Josh  . telegraph.co.uk, 20 Aug 2014 From the 1990s, disaffected,  |Neo-Fascist|Neo-Fascist|  or  |Neo-Nazi|Neo-Nazi|  youths in the former nation of  |East_Germany|East_Germany| ,  |Spain|Spain| ,  |Finland|Finland| ,  |Central|Central_Europe|  and  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| an countries such as  |Russia|Russia|  adopted the style. However, many skinheads remain influenced by dissident, pro-working class  |left-wing|Left-Wing_Politics| ,  |syndicalist|Syndicalist| , or  |center-left|Centre-Left_Politics|  type politics or otherwise  |independent|Independent_Voter|  pro-working class politics that have been part of the movement since the beginning, particularly in the U.K. and the U.S., while others continue to embrace the subculture as a largely apolitical working class movement.              In the late 1950s the post-war  |economic_boom|Boom_And_Bust|  led to an increase in  |disposable_income|Disposable_Income|  among many young people. Some of those youths spent that income on new fashions popularised by American  |soul|Soul_Music|  groups, British  |R_&_B|Rhythm_And_Blues|  bands, certain film actors, and  |Carnaby_Street|Carnaby_Street|  clothing merchants.   These youths became known as  |mods|Mod| , a youth subculture noted for its  |consumerism|Consumerism|  and devotion to fashion, music and  |scooters|Scooter| .      Working class mods chose practical clothing styles that suited their lifestyle and employment circumstances: work  |boots|Boot|  or  |army_boots|Combat_Boot| , straight-leg  |jeans|Jeans|  or  |Sta-Prest|Sta-Prest| |trousers|Trousers| , button-down shirts and braces. When possible, these working class mods spent their money on suits and other sharp outfits to wear at dancehalls, where they enjoyed  |soul|Soul_Music| ,  |ska|Ska| ,  |bluebeat|Blue_Beat_Records|  and  |rocksteady|Rocksteady|  music.      Around 1966, a  |schism|Schism|  developed between the peacock mods , who were less violent and always wore the latest expensive clothes, and the hard mods , who were identified by their shorter hair and more working class image.  Hard mods became commonly known as skinheads by about 1968.  Their short hair may have come about for practical reasons, since long hair could be a liability in industrial jobs and streetfights. Skinheads may also have cut their hair short in defiance of the more middle class  |hippie|Hippie|  culture.      In addition to retaining many mod influences, early skinheads were very interested in  |Jamaica|Jamaica| n  |rude_boy|Rude_Boy|  styles and culture, especially the music: ska, rocksteady, and early  |reggae|Reggae|  .       Skinhead culture became so popular by 1969 that even the rock band  |Slade|Slade|  temporarily adopted the look as a marketing strategy.    The subculture gained wider notice because of a series of violent and sexually explicit novels by  |Richard_Allen|James_Moffat| , notably Skinhead and Skinhead Escapes.   Due to largescale British migration to  |Perth|Perth| ,  |Western_Australia|Western_Australia| , many British youths in that city joined skinhead/ |sharpies|Sharpies|  gangs in the late 1960s and developed their own Australian style.        By the early 1970s, the skinhead subculture started to fade from popular culture, and some of the original skins dropped into new categories, such as the  suedeheads  , smoothies , and bootboys .   Some fashion trends returned to the mod roots, with  |brogues|Brogues| ,  |loafers|Loafers| , suits, and the  |slacks|Trousers| -and- |sweater|Sweater|  look making a comeback.       In the late 1970s, the skinhead subculture was revived to a notable extent after the introduction of  |punk_rock|Punk_Rock| .  Most of these revivalist skinheads reacted to the commercialism of punk by adopting a look that was in line with the original 1969 skinhead style. This revival included Gary Hodges and  |Hoxton_Tom_McCourt|Hoxton_Tom_Mccourt|   and  |Suggs|Suggs| , later of the band  |Madness|Madness| . Around this time, some skinheads became affiliated with  |far_right|Far-Right_Politics|  groups such as the  |National_Front|National_Front|  and the  |British_Movement|British_Movement| .  From 1979 onwards,  |punk-influenced|Punk_Fashion|  skinheads with shorter hair, higher boots and less emphasis on traditional styles grew in numbers and grabbed media attention, mostly due to  |football_hooliganism|Football_Hooliganism| . There still remained, however, skinheads who preferred the original mod-inspired styles.  In 2011  |Symond_Lawes|Symond_Lawes|  created The Great Skinhead Reunion The Great Skinhead Reunion www.subcultz.com in  |Brighton|Brighton|  to celebrate the subculture, which brings Skinheads together from all over the world. Bands and DJs play  |Ska|Ska|  and  |Oi!|Oi!| . The event is strictly apolitical.     Eventually different interpretations of the skinhead subculture expanded beyond Britain and continental Europe. In the United States, certain segments of the  |hardcore_punk|Hardcore_Punk|  scene embraced skinhead styles and developed their own version of the subculture.       Bill Osgerby has argued that skinhead culture more broadly grows strength from specific economic circumstances. He has remarked to the BBC, In the late 70s and early 80s, working class culture was disintegrating through unemployment and inner city decay and there was an attempt to recapture a sense of working class solidarity and identity in the face of a tide of social change. Geoghegan, Tom.  . BBC News Magazine, 12 April 2007         By the 1980s street fights regularly broke out in  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  between skinheads and members of the  |anti-fascist|Anti-Fascist| ,  |left_wing|Left_Wing|  youth movement called  |Antifa|Antifa_Movements| . German  |neo-nazis|Neo-Nazism| , led by  |Michael_Kühnen|Michael_Kühnen| , sought to expand their ranks with new young members from the burgeoning skinhead scene. With the support of these young voters right wing parties in Germany performed well in the 1989 elections. On the other side of the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall| , in  |East_Germany|East_Germany| , the skinhead youth movement had developed two different styles: one was more focused on rebellious youth fashion styles while the other camp often dressed in regular clothes and focused more heavily on political activity. These groups were infiltrated by agents of the  |Stasi|Stasi|  and did not last long in East Germany. After a group of skinheads attacked a punk concert at Zions Church in 1987, many skinhead leaders fled to West Germany to avoid arrest.            Most first wave skinheads used a  |No._2_or_No._3_grade_clip_guard|Buzz_Cut|  cuts . From the late 1970s, male skinheads typically shaved their heads with a No. 2 grade clip or shorter. During that period, side partings were sometimes shaved into the hair. Since the 1980s, some skinheads have clipped their hair with no guard, or even shaved it with a razor. Some skinheads sport  |sideburns|Sideburns|  of various styles, usually neatly trimmed, but most skinheads do not have moustaches or beards.     By the 1970s, most female skins had mod-style haircuts. During the 1980s skinhead revival, many female skinheads had feathercuts . A feathercut is short on the crown, with  |fringes|Fringe|  at the front, back and sides. Some female skinheads have a shorter punk-style version of the hairstyle, called a Chelsea cut, which is almost entirely shaved, leaving only bangs and fringes at the front.          Skinheads wear long-sleeve or short-sleeve  |button-down_shirts|Dress_Shirt|  or  |polo_shirts|Tennis_Shirt|  by brands such as  |Ben_Sherman|Ben_Sherman| ,  |Fred_Perry|Fred_Perry| ,  |Brutus|Brutus_Jeans| , Warrior or Jaytex;  |Lonsdale|Lonsdale|  or  |Everlast|Everlast|  shirts or  |sweatshirts|Sweatshirts| ;  |Grandfather_shirts|Grandfather_Shirt| ; V-neck  |sweaters|Sweater| ;  |sleeveless_sweaters|Sleeveless_Sweater|  ;  |cardigan_sweaters|Cardigan|  or  |T-shirts|T-Shirt|  . They may wear fitted  |blazers|Blazer| ,  |Harrington_jackets|Harrington_Jacket| ,  |bomber_jackets|Flight_Jacket| ,  |denim|Denim|  jackets ,  |donkey_jackets|Donkey_Jacket| ,  |Crombie|Crombie| -style overcoats,  |sheepskin|Sheepskin|  ¾-length coats, short  |macs|Mackintosh| ,  |monkey_jackets|Monkey_Jackets|  or  |parkas|Anorak| . Traditional skinheads sometimes wear suits, often of two-tone tonic fabric , or in a  |Prince_of_Wales|Glen_Plaid|  or  |houndstooth|Houndstooth|  check pattern.     Many skinheads wear  |Sta-Prest|Sta-Prest|  flat-fronted slacks or other dress  |trousers|Trousers| ;  |jeans|Jeans|  ; or combat trousers . Jeans and slacks are worn deliberately short to show off boots, or to show off socks when wearing loafers or brogues. Jeans are often blue, with a parallel leg design, hemmed or with clean and thin rolled cuffs , and are sometimes splattered with  |bleach|Bleach|  to resemble  |camouflage|Camouflage|  trousers .     Many traditionalist skinheads wear braces, in various colours, usually no more than 1 in width, clipped to the trouser waistband. In some areas, braces much wider than that may identify a skinhead as either unfashionable or as a  |white_power_skinhead|White_Power_Skinhead| . Traditionally, braces are worn up in an X shape at the back, but some Oi!-oriented skinheads wear their braces hanging down. Patterned braces — often black and white check, or vertical stripes — are sometimes worn by traditional skinheads. In a few cases, the colour of braces or flight jackets have been used to signify affiliations. The particular colours chosen have varied regionally, and have had totally different meanings in different areas and time periods. Only skinheads from the same area and time period are likely to interpret the colour significations accurately. The practice of using the colour clothing items to indicate affiliations has become less common, particularly among traditionalist skinheads, who are more likely to choose their colours simply for fashion.     Hats common among skinheads include:  |Trilby|Trilby|  hats;  |pork_pie_hats|Pork_Pie_Hat| ;  |flat_caps|Flat_Cap|  ,  |winter_woollen_hats|Tuque|  . Less common have been  |bowler_hats|Bowler_Hat|  .     Traditionalist skinheads sometimes wear a silk handkerchief in the breast pocket of a Crombie-style overcoat or tonic suit jacket, in some cases fastened with an ornate stud. Some wear pocket flashes instead. These are pieces of silk in contrasting colours, mounted on a piece of cardboard and designed to look like an elaborately folded handkerchief. It was common to choose the colours based on ones favourite football club. Some skinheads wear button badges or sewn-on fabric patches with designs related to affiliations, interests or beliefs. Also popular are woollen or printed rayon scarves in football club colours, worn knotted at the neck, wrist, or hanging from a belt loop at the waist. Silk or faux-silk scarves with  |paisley|Paisley|  patterns are also sometimes worn. Some suedeheads carried closed umbrellas with sharpened tips, or a handle with a pull-out blade. This led to the nickname brollie boys.        Female skinheads generally wear the same clothing items as men, with addition of skirts, stockings, or dress suits composed of a ¾-length jacket and matching short skirt. Some skingirls wear fishnet stockings and mini-skirts, a style introduced during the punk-influenced skinhead revival.       Most skinheads wear  |boots|Boots| ; in the 1960s  |army_surplus|Combat_Boot|  or generic workboots, later  |Dr._Martens|Dr._Martens|  boots and shoes. In 1960s Britain, steel-toe boots worn by skinheads and hooligans were called  |bovver_boots|Bovver_Boot| ; whence skinheads have themselves sometimes been called bovver boys. Skinheads have also been known to wear  |brogues|Brogues| ,  |loafers|Loafers|  or Dr. Martens low shoes.     In recent years, other brands of boots, such as  |Solovair|Solovair| ,  |Tredair|Tredair|  and Grinders, have become popular among skinheads, partly because most Dr. Martens are no longer made in England.  |Football|Association_Football| -style  |athletic_shoes|Athletic_Shoe| , by brands such as  |Adidas|Adidas|  or  |Gola|Gola| , have become popular with many skinheads. Female or child skinheads generally wear the same footwear as men, with the addition of monkey boots. The traditional brand for monkey boots was Grafters, but nowadays they are also made by Dr. Martens and Solovair.     In the early days of the skinhead subculture, some skinheads chose boot lace colours based on the football team they supported. Later, some skinheads began to use lace colour to indicate beliefs or affiliations. The particular colours chosen have varied regionally, and have had totally different meanings in different areas and time periods. Only skinheads from the same area and time period are likely to interpret the colour significations accurately. This practice has become less common, particularly among traditionalist skinheads, who are more likely to choose their colours simply for fashion purposes.      |Suedeheads|Suedehead|  sometimes wore coloured socks. de Konigh, Michael, Suedehead Reggae Box Set liner notes.          The skinhead subculture was originally associated with  |black|Black_People|  music genres such as  |soul|Soul_Music| , ska,  |rocksteady|Rocksteady| , and early  |reggae|Reggae| .  The link between skinheads and  |Jamaican_music|Music_Of_Jamaica|  led to the UK popularity of groups such as  |Desmond_Dekker|Desmond_Dekker| ,  |Derrick_Morgan|Derrick_Morgan| ,  |Laurel_Aitken|Laurel_Aitken| ,  |Symarip|Symarip|  and  |The_Pioneers|The_Pioneers| . In the early 1970s, some reggae songs began to feature themes of  |black_nationalism|Black_Nationalism| , which many white skinheads could not relate to. Brown, 2004 This shift in reggaes lyrical themes created some tension between black and white skinheads, who otherwise got along fairly well. Hebdige, 1979, pg 58 Around this time, some  |suedeheads|Suedehead|  started listening to British  |glam_rock|Glam_Rock|  bands such as  |Sweet|The_Sweet| ,  |Slade|Slade|  and  |Mott_the_Hoople|Mott_The_Hoople| .      The most popular music style for late-1970s skinheads was  |2_Tone|2_Tone| , a fusion of ska, rocksteady, reggae, pop and  |punk_rock|Punk_Rock| .  The 2 Tone genre was named after  |2_Tone_Records|2_Tone_Records| , a  |Coventry|Coventry| |record_label|Record_Label|  that featured bands such as  |The_Specials|The_Specials| ,  |Madness|Madness|  and  |The_Selecter|The_Selecter| .  Moskowitz, David V. . Caribbean Popular Music. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 270.    Some late-1970s skinheads also liked certain punk rock bands, such as  |Sham_69|Sham_69|  and Menace.     In the late 1970s, after the first wave of punk rock, many skinheads embraced  |Oi!|Oi!| , a working class punk subgenre. Dalton, Stephen, Revolution Rock , Vox, June 1993 Musically, Oi! combines standard punk with elements of  |football_chants|Football_Chant| ,  |pub_rock|Pub_Rock|  and British glam rock.   The Oi! scene was partly a response to a sense that many participants in the early punk scene were, in the words of  |The_Business|The_Business|  guitarist Steve Kent, trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic ... and losing touch .  |Robb,_John|John_Robb|  . Punk Rock: An Oral History .  The term Oi! as a musical genre is said to come from the band  |Cockney_Rejects|Cockney_Rejects|  and journalist  |Garry_Bushell|Garry_Bushell| , who championed the genre in  |Sounds_magazine|Sounds| . Turner, Jeff; Garry Bushell . Cockney Reject. London: John Blake Publishing Ltd.   Not exclusively a skinhead genre, many Oi! bands included skins,  |punks|Punk_Subculture|  and people who fit into neither category . Notable Oi! bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s include  |Angelic_Upstarts|Angelic_Upstarts| ,  |Blitz|Blitz| , the Business, Last Resort,  |The_Burial|The_Burial| ,  |Combat_84|Combat_84|  and  |the_4-Skins|The_4-Skins| .     American Oi! began in the 1980s, with bands such as  |U.S._Chaos|U.S._Chaos| ,  |The_Press|The_Press| ,  |Iron_Cross|Iron_Cross| ,  |The_Bruisers|The_Bruisers|  and  |Anti-Heros|Anti-Heros| .    American skinheads created a link between their subculture and  |hardcore_punk|Hardcore_Punk|  music, with bands such as  |Warzone|Warzone| ,  |Agnostic_Front|Agnostic_Front| , and  |Cro-Mags|Cro-Mags| . The Oi! style has also spread to other parts of the world, and remains popular with many skinheads. Many later Oi! bands have combined influences from early American hardcore and 1970s British  |streetpunk|Street_Punk| .     Among some skinheads,  |black_metal|Black_Metal|  is popular. Bands such as the Canadian act  |Blasphemy|Blasphemy| , whose guitarist is black, has been known to popularise and merchandise the phrase black metal skinheads . As the groups vocalist recounts, a lot of black metal skinheads from the other side of Canada would join in on the  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia| n black metal underground. I remember one guy... who had Black Metal Skins tattooed on his forehead. We didnt hang out with white power skinheads, but there were some Oi skinheads who wanted to hang out with us. Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult , p. 73  |National_Socialist_black_metal|National_Socialist_Black_Metal|  has an audience among white power skinheads. There was a record label called Satanic Skinhead Propaganda that was known to specialize in neo-Nazi black metal and death metal bands.  Black metal pioneer and right-wing extremist  |Varg_Vikernes|Varg_Vikernes|  was known to adopt a skinhead look and wear a belt with the SS insignia while serving time in prison for the  |arson_of_several_stave_churches|Varg_Vikernesarson_Of_Churches|  and the murder of  |Øystein_Aarseth|Øystein_Aarseth| . Lords of Chaos , p. 362     Although many  |white_power_skinheads|White_Power_Skinhead|  listened to Oi! music, they developed a separate genre more in line with their politics:  |Rock_Against_Communism|Rock_Against_Communism|  .  The most notable RAC band was  |Skrewdriver|Skrewdriver| , which started out as a non-political punk band but evolved into a  |neo-Nazi|Neo-Nazism|  band after the first lineup broke up and a new lineup was formed.    RAC started out musically similar to Oi! and punk, but has since adopted elements from other genres. White power music that draws inspiration from  |hardcore_punk|Hardcore_Punk|  is sometimes called  |hatecore|Hatecore| .              The early skinheads were not necessarily part of any political movement, but as the 1970s progressed, the skinheads became more politically active and acts of  |racially-motivated|Racism|  skinhead violence began to occur in the United Kingdom. As a result of this change within the skinheads, far right groups such as the  |National_Front|National_Front|  and the  |British_Movement|British_Movement|  saw a rise in the number of  |white_power_skinheads|White_Power_Skinhead|  among their ranks. By the late 1970s, the mass media, and subsequently the general public, had largely come to view the skinhead subculture as one that promotes racism and  |neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazism| . The white power and neo-Nazi skinhead subculture eventually spread to  |North_America|North_America| ,  |Europe|Europe|  and other areas of the world. The mainstream media started using the term skinhead in reports of racist violence ; this has played a large role in skewing public perceptions about the subculture. Osgerby, 1998, 65 Three notable groups that formed in the 1980s and which later became associated with white power skinheads are  |White_Aryan_Resistance|White_Aryan_Resistance| ,  |Blood_and_Honour|Blood_And_Honour|  and  |Hammerskins|Hammerskins| .     During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, many skinheads and  |suedeheads|Suedehead|  in the United Kingdom rejected both the far left and the far right. This anti-extremist attitude was musically typified by  |Oi!|Oi!|  bands such as  |Cockney_Rejects|Cockney_Rejects| ,  |The_4-Skins|The_4-Skins| ,  |Toy_Dolls|Toy_Dolls| , and  |The_Business|The_Business| . Two notable groups of skinheads that spoke out against neo-Nazism and political extremism—and instead spoke out in support of  |traditional_skinhead|Trojan_Skinhead|  culture—were the Glasgow Spy Kids in Scotland , and the publishers of the Hard As Nails  |zine|Zine|  in England.      In the late 1960s, some skinheads in the United Kingdom  had engaged in violence against  |South_Asian_immigrants|British_Asian|  . Marshall, George. Skinhead Nation. ST Publishing, 1996. , .  There had, however, also been  |anti-racist|Anti-Racism|  skinheads since the beginning of the subculture, especially in  |Scotland|Scotland|  and  |Northern_England|Northern_England| .      On the far left of the skinhead subculture,  |redskins|Redskin|  and  |anarchist|Anarchism|  skinheads take a militant  |anti-fascist|Anti-Fascism|  and pro-working class stance.  In the United Kingdom, two groups with significant numbers of leftist skinhead members were  |Red_Action|Red_Action| , which started in 1981, and  |Anti-Fascist_Action|Anti-Fascist_Action| , which started in 1985. Internationally, the most notable left-wing skinhead organisation is  |Skinheads_Against_Racial_Prejudice|Skinheads_Against_Racial_Prejudice| , which formed in the New York City area in 1987 and then spread to other countries.
