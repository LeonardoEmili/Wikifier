            The Muppets are an  |ensemble_cast|Ensemble_Cast|  of  |puppet|Puppet|  characters known for their  |absurdist|Surreal_Humor| ,  |burlesque|Burlesque| , and  |self-referential|Self-Referential_Humor|  style of  |variety|Variety_Show| - |sketch_comedy|Sketch_Comedy| . Created by  |Jim|Jim_Henson|  and  |Jane_Henson|Jane_Henson|  in 1955, they are the namesake for the  |Disney|The_Walt_Disney_Company| |media_franchise|Media_Franchise|  that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.     The Muppets originated in the short-form television series  Sam and Friends , which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on  Sesame Street  in 1969. The Muppets attained  |celebrity_status|Celebrity|  and international recognition through  The Muppet Show  , which received four  |Primetime_Emmy_Award|Primetime_Emmy_Award|  wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run.     During the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical  |films|Film| , including  The Muppet Movie  ;  The Great Muppet Caper  ; and  The Muppets Take Manhattan  . The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell  |The_Jim_Henson_Company|The_Jim_Henson_Company| . The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with television series  The Jim Henson Hour  and  Muppets Tonight  , both of which were similar in format to The Muppet Show, and three films:  The Muppet Christmas Carol  ,  Muppet Treasure Island  , and  Muppets from Space  .     Disney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years.    Under Disney, subsequent projects included two films:  The Muppets  and  Muppets Most Wanted  ; a short-lived  |primetime_series|The_Muppets|  on  |ABC|American_Broadcasting_Company| ;     and a  |reboot|Muppet_Babies|  of the  Muppet Babies  animated series.     In their six-decade career, the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture|  in the United States and English-speaking area generally, being recognized by various cultural institutions and organizations, including the  |American_Film_Institute|American_Film_Institute| ,  |Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences|Academy_Of_Motion_Picture_Arts_And_Sciences| ,  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress| , and the  |Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|Hollywood_Walk_Of_Fame| .            The Muppets were created by puppeteer  |Jim_Henson|Jim_Henson|  in the 1950s; among his earliest creations was  |Kermit_the_Frog|Kermit_The_Frog| , who would become Hensons most recognizable character. Originally conceived for an  |adult|Adult_Puppeteering|  audience,  Henson claimed, and later recanted, that he coined the term Muppet as a portmanteau of the words  |marionette|Marionette|  and  |puppet|Puppet|  .  In 1955, the Muppets were introduced in  Sam and Friends , a short-form television series produced for  |WRC-TV|Wrc-Tv|  in  |Washington_D.C.|Washington_D.C.|   Developed by Henson and his future wife  |Jane_Nebel|Jane_Henson| , the series was the first form of puppet media not to incorporate a physical  |proscenium_arch|Proscenium_Arch|  typical of such works, relying instead on the natural framing of the  |television_set|Television_Set|  through which it was viewed.      During the 1960s, the characters—in particular, Kermit and  |Rowlf_the_Dog|Rowlf_The_Dog| —appeared in skits on several  |late-night_talk_shows|Late-Night_Talk_Show|  and on television commercials, including  The Ed Sullivan Show . Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with  |Jimmy_Dean|Jimmy_Dean|  on  The Jimmy Dean Show . In 1966,  |Joan_Ganz_Cooney|Joan_Ganz_Cooney|  and  |Lloyd_Morrisett|Lloyd_Morrisett|  began developing a childrens  |educational_television|Educational_Television|  program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the  |Childrens_Television_Workshop|Sesame_Workshop| , the program debuted as  Sesame Street  in 1969.     Henson and his creative team became closely involved with Sesame Street during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. Sesame Street garnered a positive response, and the Muppets involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an effective and pleasurable viewing method of presentation for its educational curriculum. Morrow, p. 93 Davis, p.163     The Muppet Show and foray into film The Land of Gorch  segments during the first season of  Saturday Night Live . As his involvement with Sesame Street continued, Henson began developing a network television series focusing on the Muppets; Finch, p.5 as opposed to Sesame Street, however, this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on  |sketch_comedy|Sketch_Comedy| . Two  |television_pilots|Pilot| ,  The Muppets Valentine Show  and  The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence , aired on  |ABC|American_Broadcasting_Company|  in 1974 and 1975, respectively.     After ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer  |Lew_Grade|Lew_Grade,_Baron_Grade|  approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for  |Associated_Television|Associated_Television| . Debuting in 1976,  The Muppet Show  introduced new characters such as  |Miss_Piggy|Miss_Piggy| ,  |Fozzie_Bear|Fozzie_Bear| ,  |Gonzo|Gonzo| , and  |Animal|Animal|  alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in  |first-run_syndication|Broadcast_Syndicationfirst-Run_Syndication_In_The_U.S.|  in the United States, The Muppet Show became increasingly popular due to its sketch- |variety|Variety_Show|  format, unique form of humor, and prolific roster of  |guest_stars|Guest_Appearance| . It was nominated for twenty-one  |Primetime_Emmy_Awards|Primetime_Emmy_Award|  during its run, winning four, including  |Outstanding_Variety_Series|Primetime_Emmy_Award_For_Outstanding_Variety_Series|  in 1978. The success of The Muppet Show allowed  |Henson_Associates|The_Jim_Henson_Company|  to diversify into theatrical  |films|Film| , the first of which,  The Muppet Movie , was released in 1979.       Following The Muppet Movie were  The Great Muppet Caper  and  The Muppets Take Manhattan , released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four  |Academy_Award|Academy_Awards|  nominations. In 1983, Henson debuted  Fraggle Rock , which aired on  |HBO|Hbo|  in the United States until 1987.      In 1989, Henson entered negotiations with  |Michael_Eisner|Michael_Eisner|  and  |The_Walt_Disney_Company|The_Walt_Disney_Company| , in which the latter would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets. Disney expressed interest in purchasing the company for $150 million.  Eisner was also interested in acquiring the Sesame Street Muppet characters. Henson declined the proposal, however, considering it a non-starter for the deal. Jones, p. 455 As discussions continued, Henson and  |Walt_Disney_Imagineering|Walt_Disney_Imagineering|  preemptively began developing Muppets-themed attractions for the  |Disney-MGM_Studios|Disneys_Hollywood_Studios|  at  |Walt_Disney_World|Walt_Disney_World| .     However, the proposed merger was canceled after Hensons death in 1990. Nevertheless, Disney initiated a  |licensing|License|  agreement with Henson to continue developing Muppets attractions.  The following year,  |MuppetVision_3D|Muppetvision_3D|  debuted at Disney-MGM Studios, the only attraction successfully developed from the original plans. Disney also co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppets films,  The Muppet Christmas Carol  and  Muppet Treasure Island , with Henson in 1992 and 1996, respectively. The characters subsequently starred in  Muppets Tonight , which aired from 1996 to 1998; and a sixth film,  Muppets from Space , released by  |Columbia_Pictures|Columbia_Pictures|  in 1999.     In 2000, Henson was sold to  |EM.TV_&_Merchandising_AG|Constantin_Medien|  for $680 million.  However, EM.TVs stock collapsed and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003, with the exception of the Sesame Street characters, which were in the interim sold to  |Sesame_Workshop|Sesame_Workshop| .       Fourteen years after initial negotiations began, Disney acquired the Muppets  |intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  from Henson for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquisition consisted of most of the Muppets film and television library, as well as the  Bear in the Big Blue House  television series. Exceptions included the Sesame Street  |characters|List_Of_Sesame_Street_Muppets| , which were previously sold to Sesame Workshop;  the Fraggle Rock  |characters|List_Of_Fraggle_Rock_Characters| , which were retained by Henson; and the  |distribution_rights|Film_Distribution|  to four films: The Muppets Take Manhattan, Muppets from Space, and  Kermits Swamp Years , which were retained by  |Sony_Pictures_Entertainment|Sony_Pictures_Entertainment| ; and  Its a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie , retained by  |NBCUniversal_Television_Distribution|Nbcuniversal_Television_Distribution| .  Following the acquisition, Disney formed  |The_Muppets_Studio|The_Muppets_Studio|  , a wholly owned subsidiary responsible for managing the characters and franchise. As a result, the term Muppet became a legal  |trademark|Trademark|  of Disney; under license from Disney, Sesame Workshop continues to use the term for their characters, as well archival footage of Kermit the Frog.     Henson retains the rights to several productions featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including  Emmet Otters Jug-Band Christmas ;  The Christmas Toy ;  Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting ; Hensons Place; Billy Bunnys Animal Songs; the original  Dog City  special; and Donnas Day. While some of these have since been released uncut, most current releases of Emmet Otters Jug-Band Christmas and The Christmas Toy omit the appearances by Kermit the Frog.     Disney gradually began reintroducing the franchise to the mainstream in 2008. As a method of regaining a wider audience, Disney produced a series of vignettes for  |YouTube|Youtube| . A  |Bohemian_Rhapsody|Bohemian_Rhapsody| |cover_version|List_Of_Bohemian_Rhapsody_Cover_Versions|  was among these projects and immediately went  |viral|Viral_Video| , ultimately amassing 50 million views and won two  |Webby_Awards|Webby_Award| .  In 2010, the Muppets starred in  The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora , which co-starred  |Cat_Cora|Cat_Cora|  and showcased cooking demonstrations.  A television special,  A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa , premiered on  |NBC|Nbc|  on December 17, 2008; and was released on DVD on September 29, 2009.       In 2010, Disney used the Muppets to promote their  |volunteerism_program|Give_A_Day,_Get_A_Disney_Day|  at the companys theme parks. A Halloween special featuring the Muppets was developed during that time and expected to air on ABC that October, but was canceled.        In 2011, the Muppets were featured in an  |eponymous_seventh_film|The_Muppets| , intended to serve as a creative  |reboot|Reboot|  for the characters. Disney had been furthering development on a Muppets film since 2008, when it considered adapting an unused screenplay by  |Jerry_Juhl|Jerry_Juhl| . Directed by  |James_Bobin|James_Bobin| ; written by  |Jason_Segel|Jason_Segel|  and  |Nicholas_Stoller|Nicholas_Stoller| ; and starring Segel,  |Amy_Adams|Amy_Adams| ,  |Chris_Cooper|Chris_Cooper| , and  |Rashida_Jones|Rashida_Jones| , the film was a critical and commercial success, and won an  |Academy_Award|Academy_Awards|  for  |Best_Original_Song|Academy_Award_For_Best_Original_Song| .  During the films publicity campaign, the Muppets appeared in promotional advertisements and effusive marketing efforts by Disney and were also featured in a promotional video for  |Google+|Google+| .  In March 2012, the Muppets received a collective star on the  |Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|Hollywood_Walk_Of_Fame| .  That year, the Muppets hosted a  Just for Laughs  comedy gala in  |Montreal|Montreal| .      Following the successful performance of The Muppets, Disney announced an eighth film in 2012, with Bobin and Stoller returning to direct and write, respectively.   Muppets Most Wanted  was released in 2014, and starred  |Ricky_Gervais|Ricky_Gervais| ;  |Tina_Fey|Tina_Fey| ; and  |Ty_Burrell|Ty_Burrell| .       |Disney_Theatrical_Productions|Disney_Theatrical_Productions|  announced in 2013 that a live show based on the Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by  |Thomas_Schumacher|Thomas_Schumacher|  to see how the technical components would work.  Muppet Moments, an interstitial television series, premiered on  |Disney_Junior|Disney_Junior|  in April 2015. The short-form series features conversations between the Muppets and young children.      After the release of Muppets Most Wanted, Disney was interested in expanding the Muppets presence across various media platforms, particularly in television.  Discussions for a new  |primetime_series|Prime_Time|  began internally within The Muppets Studio.  By April 2015,  |Bill_Prady|Bill_Prady|  was commissioned to write a script for a pilot with the working title Muppets 2015.  In May 2015, ABC commissioned an  |eponymous_mockumentary_series|The_Muppets| , co-developed by Prady and  |Bob_Kushell|Bob_Kushell|  and directed by  |Randall_Einhorn|Randall_Einhorn| .   The Muppets premiered on September 22, 2015 in the United States, and ended on March 1, 2016.   In September 2017, the Muppets performed a series of live shows at the  |Hollywood_Bowl|Hollywood_Bowl| , hosted by  |Bobby_Moynihan|Bobby_Moynihan| .  Two  |web_television|Web_Television|  series have been in development, both for  |Disney+|Disney+| Muppets Live Another Day, intended to star  |Josh_Gad|Josh_Gad| , was announced in February 2018 and entered active development the following year;   in September 2019, Gad confirmed the projects cancellation.  Muppets Now, a short-form  |improvisational_comedy|Improvisational_Theatreimprovisational_Comedy|  series, was announced in August 2019; it is scheduled for a 2020 debut.  In July 2018, the cast performed a series of live shows at Londons  |O2_Arena|The_O2_Arena| , their first outside of the United States.              The principal characters of  The Muppet Show  and subsequent media include  |Kermit_the_Frog|Kermit_The_Frog| ;  |Miss_Piggy|Miss_Piggy| ;  |Fozzie_Bear|Fozzie_Bear| ;  |Gonzo|Gonzo| ;  |Rowlf_the_Dog|Rowlf_The_Dog| ;  |Scooter|Scooter| ;  |Rizzo_the_Rat|Rizzo_The_Rat| ;  |Pepe_the_King_Prawn|Pepe_The_King_Prawn| ;  |Dr._Bunsen_Honeydew|Bunsen_Honeydew| ;  |Beaker|Beaker| ;  |Statler_and_Waldorf|Statler_And_Waldorf| ; the  |Swedish_Chef|Swedish_Chef| ;  |Sam_Eagle|Sam_Eagle| ;  |Walter|Walter| ; and  |the_Electric_Mayhem|Dr._Teeth_And_The_Electric_Mayhem| , fronted by  |Dr._Teeth|Dr._Teeth_And_The_Electric_Mayhemdr._Teeth|  and consisting of  |Animal|Animal|  ,  |Floyd_Pepper|Dr._Teeth_And_The_Electric_Mayhemfloyd_Pepper|  ,  |Janice|Dr._Teeth_And_The_Electric_Mayhemjanice|  ,  |Zoot|Dr._Teeth_And_The_Electric_Mayhemzoot|  , and occasionally  |Lips|Dr._Teeth_And_The_Electric_Mayhemlips|  .     As well as The Muppet Show, the characters are popular for their appearances on  Sesame Street  and  Fraggle Rock ; and also feature in  The Jimmy Dean Show ,  The Jim Henson Hour ,  Muppets Tonight ,  Bear in the Big Blue House ,  Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony , and  The Muppets . An adult-oriented segment,  The Land of Gorch , was a regular feature in the first season of  Saturday Night Live . Guest stars on Saturday Night Live occasionally include both the Muppets and Sesame Street characters, as well as Muppet likenesses of real people; these likenesses appear recurrently in early episodes of The Muppet Show and on Sesame Street, and appear occasionally on other series such as  30 Rock .     Following Disneys acquisition of the Muppets, puppets created by The Jim Henson Company are no longer referred to as Muppets. Puppets created by  |Jim_Hensons_Creature_Shop|Jim_Hensons_Creature_Shop| , including those in  Labyrinth  and  The Dark Crystal , have never been considered Muppets,  as they are generally more complex in design and performance than regular Muppets. At Hensons suggestion, the  Star Wars  character  |Yoda|Yoda|  was originally performed by  |Frank_Oz|Frank_Oz| , Finch, p.176 and has been loosely described as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, and Henson otherwise had no involvement in the characters conception.              At the start of the Muppets formation, Jim and Jane Henson were the groups only performers. In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with  |Frank_Oz|Frank_Oz|  that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested  |Jerry_Juhl|Jerry_Juhl| , who worked with Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in  |Oakland,_California|Oakland,_California| . Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time The Muppet Show began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz;  |Dave_Goelz|Dave_Goelz| ;  |Jerry_Nelson|Jerry_Nelson| ;  |Richard_Hunt|Richard_Hunt| ; and later,  |Steve_Whitmire|Steve_Whitmire| , while Juhl became head writer for the series. From The Muppet Show onward,  |Kevin_Clash|Kevin_Clash| ;  |Kathryn_Mullen|Kathryn_Mullen| ;  |Louise_Gold|Louise_Gold| ;  |Karen_Prell|Karen_Prell| ;  |Fran_Brill|Fran_Brill| ,  |Caroll_Spinney|Caroll_Spinney| ; and  |Brian_Henson|Brian_Henson|  performed several minor characters and assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and other Henson-related projects.     Henson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire, Goelz, and  |Bill_Barretta|Bill_Barretta| , who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Hensons characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunts characters were left without a stable performer until  |David_Rudman|David_Rudman|  was cast in those roles in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000;  |Eric_Jacobson|Eric_Jacobson|  assumed his characters beginning in 2002. At Nelsons behest,  |Matt_Vogel|Matt_Vogel|  gradually began performing his characters in 2008.     Whitmire was  |dismissed|Dismissal|  from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and most of Whitmires other characters assumed by the remainder of the cast.  The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and  |Peter_Linz|Peter_Linz| .            The majority of the Muppets are designed as  |hand_puppets|Hand_Puppets| , with several characters utilizing  |rods|Hand_Puppetrod_Puppets| . Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans;  |anthropomorphic|Anthropomorphism|  characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or other forms of abstract characters.     The Muppets are distinguished from  |ventriloquist|Ventriloquism|  dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a Muppet peformer , who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point. Christopher Finch Jim Henson: The Works 1993, .     Since 2006, Disney has contracted  |Puppet_Heap|Puppet_Heap|  to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets.  During most performances, the performer holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or – in the case of live-hand Muppets – wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.     For more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors,  |remote_manipulators|Remote_Manipulators| , and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.     In his book  Street Gang , author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop organically , alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match .  When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.                    On September 17, 2002,  |Rhino_Records|Rhino_Entertainment|  released  The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More , a compilation album of music from The Muppet Show and subsequent film releases. With  |John_Denver|John_Denver| ,  John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together  was produced and released in 1979.     Under Disney ownership, The Muppets album releases have been issued by  |Walt_Disney_Records|Walt_Disney_Records| ; as well as new album releases, some albums have been re-released, including  The Muppet Christmas Carol  in 2005 and  The Muppet Movie  in 2013.

It is notable as Hensons final directorial effort. MuppetVision 3D subsequently opened at  |Disney_California_Adventure|Disney_California_Adventure| , on February 8, 2001; this version closed in 2014.
