                     James Gordon Brown  is a British politician who was  |prime_minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and  |leader_of_the_Labour_Party|Leader_Of_The_Labour_Party|  from  |2007|2007_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  to  |2010|2010_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . He served as  |chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer|  from  |1997|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  to  |2007|2007_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election| . Brown was a  |member_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  from  |1983|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  to  |2015|2015_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , first for  |Dunfermline_East|Dunfermline_East|  and later for  |Kirkcaldy_and_Cowdenbeath|Kirkcaldy_And_Cowdenbeath| .     A doctoral graduate of the  |University_of_Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh| , Brown spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a  |further_education|Further_Education|  college and a television journalist. He entered Parliament in  |1983|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  as the MP for Dunfermline East. He joined the  |shadow_cabinet|Official_Opposition_Shadow_Cabinet|  in 1989 as  |shadow_secretary_of_State_for_Trade|Department_For_Business_Innovation_And_Skills| , and was later promoted to become  |shadow_chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Shadow_Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer|  in 1992. After Labours victory in  |1997|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history.     Browns time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britains monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting powers to the  |Bank_of_England|Bank_Of_England| , by a wide extension of the powers of the  |Treasury|Hm_Treasury|  to cover much domestic policy and by transferring responsibility for banking supervision to the  |Financial_Services_Authority|Financial_Services_Authority| . Controversial moves included the abolition of  |advance_corporation_tax|Advance_Corporation_Tax|  relief in his first budget,   and the removal in his final budget of the  |10_starting_rate_|10P_Tax_Rate|  of personal income tax which he had introduced in 1999.   |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  resigned as Prime Minister and Labour Leader in 2007, and Brown was chosen to replace him in  |an_uncontested_election|2007_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election| .     After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labours popularity declined with the onset of a  |recession_in_2008|Great_Recession| , leading to poor results in the  |local|2009_United_Kingdom_Local_Elections|  and  |European_elections_in_2009|2009_European_Parliament_Election_In_The_United_Kingdom| .    A year later, Labour lost 91 seats in the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  at the  |2010_general_election|2010_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , the partys biggest loss of seats in a single general election since  |1931|1931_United_Kingdom_General_Election| ,  making the  |Conservatives|Conservative_Party|  the largest party in a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament| . Brown remained in office as Labour negotiated to form a coalition government with the  |Liberal_Democrats|Liberal_Democrats| . On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the Labour Party, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. Labours attempts to retain power failed and on 11 May, he officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| , and as Leader of the Labour Party by  |Ed_Miliband|Ed_Miliband| .     Later, Brown played a prominent role in the campaign to maintain the union during the  |2014_Scottish_independence_referendum|2014_Scottish_Independence_Referendum| .        Brown was born at the Orchard Maternity Nursing Home in  |Giffnock|Giffnock| ,  |Renfrewshire|Renfrewshire| , Scotland.  Birth certificate of James Gordon Brown, 20 February 1951, Newton Mearns District, Renfrewshire 571/02 0053  – General Register Office for Scotland His father was John Ebenezer Brown , a  |minister_of_the_Church_of_Scotland|Ministers_And_Elders_Of_The_Church_Of_Scotland|  and a strong influence on Brown.  His mother was Jessie Elizabeth Bunty Brown .  She was the daughter of John Souter, a timber merchant.  The family moved to  |Kirkcaldy|Kirkcaldy|  – then the largest town in  |Fife|Fife| , across the  |Firth_of_Forth|Firth_Of_Forth|  from  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh|   – when Gordon was three.  Brown was brought up there with his elder brother John and younger brother  |Andrew_Brown|Andrew_Brown|  in a  |manse|Manse| ; he is therefore often referred to as a son of the manse , an idiomatic Scottish phrase.        Brown was educated first at Kirkcaldy West Primary School where he was selected for an experimental  |fast_stream|Ability_Grouping|  education programme, which took him two years early to  |Kirkcaldy_High_School|Kirkcaldy_High_School|  for an academic  |hothouse_education|Hothousing|  taught in separate classes.  Aged 16, he wrote that he loathed and resented this ludicrous experiment on young lives.      He was accepted by the  |University_of_Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh|  to study history at the same early age of 16. During an end-of-term  |rugby_union|Rugby_Union|  match at his old school, he received a kick to the head and suffered a  |retinal_detachment|Retinal_Detachment| .  This left him  |blind|Blindness|  in his left eye, despite treatment including several operations and weeks spent lying in a darkened room. Later at Edinburgh, while playing tennis, he noticed the same symptoms in his right eye. Brown underwent experimental surgery at the  |Edinburgh_Royal_Infirmary|Edinburgh_Royal_Infirmary|  and his right eye was saved by a young eye surgeon, Hector Chawla.   Brown graduated from Edinburgh with a  |First_Class_Honours|First_Class_Honours| |_MA|Master_Of_Arts|  degree in history in 1972, and stayed on to obtain his  |PhD|Doctor_Of_Philosophy|  in history  , titled The Labour Party and Political Change in Scotland 1918–29.       In his youth at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was involved in a romantic relationship with  |Margarita_Crown_Princess_of_Romania|Princess_Margareta_Of_Romania| . Margarita said about it: It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didnt seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing. An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other.      In 1972, while still a student, Brown was elected  |Rector_of_the_University_of_Edinburgh|Rector_Of_The_University_Of_Edinburgh| , the convener of the  |University_Court|University_Court| .  He served as Rector until 1975, and also edited the document The Red Paper on Scotland.        From 1976 to 1980 Brown was employed as a lecturer in politics at  |Glasgow_College_of_Technology|Glasgow_Caledonian_University| .  He also worked as a tutor for the  |Open_University|Open_University| .  In the  |1979_general_election|1979_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Brown stood for the  |Edinburgh_South|Edinburgh_South|  constituency, losing to the  |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  candidate,  |Michael_Ancram|Michael_Ancram| .     From 1980, he worked as a journalist at  |Scottish_Television|Scottish_Television| , later serving as current affairs editor until his election to Parliament in 1983.         Brown was elected to Parliament as a Labour MP at his second attempt, for  |Dunfermline_East|Dunfermline_East|  in the  |1983_general_election|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency,  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair| . Brown became an  |opposition|Opposition|  spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the  |Independent_Labour_Party|Independent_Labour_Party|  politician  |James_Maxton|James_Maxton| , the subject of his doctoral thesis. Brown was  |Shadow|Shadow_Cabinet| |_Chief_Secretary_to_the_Treasury|Chief_Secretary_To_The_Treasury|  from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow  |Secretary_of_State_for_Trade_and_Industry|Secretary_Of_State_For_Trade_And_Industry| , before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992. Having led the Labour Movement Yes campaign, refusing to join the cross-party Yes for Scotland campaign, during the  |1979_Scottish_devolution_referendum|1979_Scottish_Devolution_Referendum| , while other senior Labour politicians – including  |Robin_Cook|Robin_Cook| ,  |Tam_Dalyell|Tam_Dalyell|  and  |Brian_Wilson|Brian_Wilson|  – campaigned for a No vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the  |Scottish_Constitutional_Convention|Scottish_Constitutional_Convention| , signing the  |Claim_of_Right_for_Scotland|Claim_Of_Right_1989|  in 1989.      Labour leader  |John_Smith|John_Smith|  died suddenly in May 1994. Brown did not contest the leadership after  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  became the favourite, deciding to make way for Blair to avoid splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ballot.      It has long been rumoured  |a_deal|Blair–Brown_Deal|  was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita restaurant in  |Islington|A1_In_Londonislington| , in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the  |leadership_election|1994_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election| .    Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the fortunes of  |New_Labour|New_Labour| , and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.      As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting was seen as a good choice by business and the middle class. While he was Chancellor inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target causing the  |Governor_of_the_Bank_of_England|Governor_Of_The_Bank_Of_England|  to write several letters to the Chancellor, each time inflation exceeded three per cent.   Following a reorganisation of  |Westminster_constituencies|Scottish_Westminster_Constituencies_From_2005|  in Scotland in 2005, Brown became MP for  |Kirkcaldy_and_Cowdenbeath|Kirkcaldy_And_Cowdenbeath|  at the  |general_election|2005_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .            In the  |1997_general_election|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Labour defeated the Conservatives by a landslide to end their 18-year exile from government, and when  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair| , the new Prime Minister, announced his  |ministerial_team|Blair_Ministry|  on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| . Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history. The Prime Ministers website highlights some achievements from Browns decade as Chancellor: making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the  |G8|G8|  summit in 2005.          On taking office as  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer|  Brown gave the  |Bank_of_England|Bank_Of_England|  operational independence in  |monetary_policy|Monetary_Policy| , and thus responsibility for setting  |interest_rates|Interest_Rate|  through the Banks  |Monetary_Policy_Committee|Monetary_Policy_Committee| .  At the same time, he also changed the  |inflation_measure|Inflation_Rate|  from the  |Retail_Price_Index|Retail_Price_Index|  to the  |Consumer_Price_Index|Consumer_Price_Index|  and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the  |Financial_Services_Authority|Financial_Services_Authority| .   Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.        In the 1997 election and subsequently, Brown pledged not to increase the basic or higher rates of  |income_tax|Income_Tax| . Over his Chancellorship, he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%. However, in all but his final budget, Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, resulting in  |fiscal_drag|Fiscal_Drag| .  |Corporation_tax|Corporation_Tax|  fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for  |small_business|Small_Business| es. Adam, S. and J. Browne:    ,  |Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies|Institute_For_Fiscal_Studies| ,  |Briefing_note|Briefing_Note|  No. 9, March 2006 In 1999, he introduced a lower  |tax_band_of_10_|10P_Tax_Rate| . He abolished this 10% tax band in  |his_last_budget|Alistair_Darling10_Income_Tax_Band|  in 2007 to reduce the basic rate from 22% to 20%, increasing tax for 5 million people  and, according to the calculations of the  |Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies|Institute_For_Fiscal_Studies| , leaving those earning between £5,000 and £18,000 as the biggest losers.  To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners at a cost of £3bn a year, I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non savings income .      According to the  |OECD|Oecd|  UK taxation increased from a 39.3% share of gross domestic product in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than that of Germany. OECD:    This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing  |stealth_tax|Stealth_Tax| es . A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way  |corporation_tax|Corporation_Tax|  is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the  |dividends|Dividend|  on  |stock|Stock|  investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK.  The Treasury contends that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth.     Browns 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of  |government_spending|Government_Spending| , particularly on health and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased  |National_Insurance|National_Insurance|  to pay for health spending. He also introduced  |working_tax_credits|Working_Tax_Credit| ,   Blundell, R., M. Brewer and A. Shepherd,  |Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies|Institute_For_Fiscal_Studies| , Briefing Note No. 52, 2004 and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3  billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1  billion of support for increases in the child tax credit. Whatever it Takes: The Real Story of Gordon Brown and New Labour     Under Brown, the tax code, the standard guide to tax, doubled in length to 17,000 pages.         In October 1997, Brown announced that the Treasury would set  |five_economic_tests|Five_Economic_Tests|   to determine whether the economic case had been made for the United Kingdom to adopt the European single currency. The  |Treasury|Hm_Treasury|  indicated that the tests had not been passed in June 2003.        In 2000, Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education  when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures, describing its decision not to offer a place to  |state_school|State_School|  pupil Laura Spence as absolutely outrageous .   |Lord_Jenkins|Roy_Jenkins| , then Oxford  |Chancellor|Chancellor|  and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, said nearly every fact he used was false.      Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UKs  |gold_reserves|Gold_Reserve|  shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as the  |Brown_Bottom|Brown_Bottom|  or Browns Bottom.    The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the  |portfolio_risk|Financial_Risk|  of the UKs reserves by diversifying away from gold.  The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5  billion. a b c Gold: Does Gordon Browns regret selling half of Britains gold reserves 10 years ago?, The Daily Telegraph, 8 May 2009 By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Browns decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.      As Chancellor, Brown argued against  |renationalising_the_railways|Renationalisation_Of_British_Rail| , saying at the Labour conference in 2004 that it would cost £22 billion.      During his time as Chancellor, Brown reportedly believed that it was appropriate to remove most, but not all, of the unpayable  |Third_World_debt|Third_World_Debt| .  On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a  |Green|Green_Politics|  view of global development.           In October 2004,  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  announced he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term.  Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the  |2005_election|2005_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , which Labour won with a reduced  |majority|Majority_Government|  and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year.  Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; he was the only  |candidate|2007_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and  |global_change|Global_Change| . This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a  |Fabian_Society|Fabian_Society|  conference on The Next Decade in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities , renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities.                 Brown ceased to be Chancellor and became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 27 June 2007.  Like all modern Prime Ministers, Brown concurrently served as the  |First_Lord_of_the_Treasury|First_Lord_Of_The_Treasury|  and the  |Minister_for_the_Civil_Service|Minister_For_The_Civil_Service| , and was a member of the  |Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom| . Until his resignation from the post in May 2010 he was  |Leader_of_the_Labour_Party|Leader_Of_The_Labour_Party| . He was Member of Parliament for the constituency of  |Kirkcaldy_and_Cowdenbeath|Kirkcaldy_And_Cowdenbeath|  until he stepped down in 2015. He was the sixth post-war Prime Minister, of a total of 13, to assume the role without having won a general election.  Brown was the first Prime Minister from a Scottish constituency since the  |Conservative|Conservative_Party| |_Sir_Alec_Douglas_Home|Alec_Douglas_Home|  in 1964. Not all British prime ministers have been university graduates, but, of those that were, Brown was one of only five that had not attended either Oxford or Cambridge. The others were  |Lord_Bute|John_Stuart_3Rd_Earl_Of_Bute|  ,  |Lord_John_Russell|John_Russell_1St_Earl_Russell|  ,  |Bonar_Law|Bonar_Law|  , and  |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain|   He proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by  |royal_prerogative|Royal_Prerogative|  to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight into the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form citizens juries , easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the  |loans_for_peerages|Cash_For_Honours|  scandal.      There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a  |snap_general_election|Snap_Election| . Indeed, the party launched the  |Not_Flash_Just_Gordon|Not_Flash_Just_Gordon|  advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October  that there would be no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives  in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in  |Crewe|Crewe|  and  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  did himself and the government no favours either.      His political opponents accused him of being indecisive, which Brown denied.  In July 2008 Brown supported a  |new_bill_extending_the_pre_charge_detention_period_to_42_days|Counter_Terrorism_Act_2008| . The bill was met with opposition on both sides of the House and backbench rebellion. In the end the bill passed by just 9 votes.   The House of Lords defeated the bill, with Lords characterising it as fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary , stating that it seeks to further erode fundamental legal and civil rights .      Brown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner. However, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.         During his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives, which he called the manifesto for change.       The manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new  |Ministerial_Code|Ministerial_Code| , which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers.  He also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wants a better constitution that is clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today . He planned to set up an all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between  |Whitehall|Whitehall|  and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops were sent into action in future.     He said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal to build new  |eco_towns|Eco_Towns| , each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 home-owners – up to 100,000 new homes in total.   Brown also said he wanted to have doctors surgeries open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary  |John_Reid|John_Reid_Baron_Reid_Of_Cardowan| , which awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Brown also stated in the manifesto that the NHS was his top priority.     On 5 June 2007, just three weeks before he was due to take the post of Prime Minister, Brown made a speech promising British Jobs for British workers .  Brown reiterated that promise at the Labour Partys annual conference in September, which caused controversy as he coupled this with a commitment to crack down on migrant workers.   The Conservative Party, led by  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| , promptly pointed out that such a commitment was illegal under EU law.             Brown was committed to the  |Iraq_War|Iraq_War| , but said in a speech in June 2007 that he would learn the lessons from the mistakes made in Iraq.  Brown said in a letter published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold an inquiry into the war.      Brown went to great lengths to empathise with those who lost family members in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. He has often said War is tragic , echoing Blairs quote, War is horrible .  Nonetheless, in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the  |Military_Covenant|Military_Covenant| , a convention within British politics ensuring adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government.      Brown did not attend the opening ceremony of the  |2008_Summer_Olympics|2008_Summer_Olympics|  on 8 August 2008 in Beijing; instead, he attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to send a message to China, concerning the  |2008_Tibetan_unrest|2008_Tibetan_Unrest| . His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.      In a speech in July 2007, Brown clarified his position regarding Britains relationship with the USA  We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America in dealing with the common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  did, very closely with the American administration.     Brown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the EU  |Treaty_of_Lisbon|Treaty_Of_Lisbon| . On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary  |David_Miliband|David_Miliband|  attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the  |EU_Reform_Treaty|Eu_Reform_Treaty| . Browns opponents on both sides of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labours 2005 manifesto had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original  |EU_Constitution|Eu_Constitution| .   Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.        During Browns premiership, in October 2008, the  |Advisory_Council_on_the_Misuse_of_Drugs|Advisory_Council_On_The_Misuse_Of_Drugs|  recommended to the then  |Home_Secretary|Home_Secretary| |_Jacqui_Smith|Jacqui_Smith|  that  |cannabis|Cannabis|  remain classified as a  |Class_C_drug|Class_C_Drugs| .  Acting against the advice of the Council, she chose to reclassify it as  |Class_B|Drugs_Controlled_By_The_Uk_Misuse_Of_Drugs_Actclass_B_Drugs| . After Professor  |David_Nutt|David_Nutt| , the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary  |Alan_Johnson|Alan_Johnson| .  Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had made up his mind to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary.  Brown had argued, I dont think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable .   Professor Nutts predecessor at the ACMD,  |Sir_Michael_Rawlins|Michael_Rawlins| , later said, Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view  ... When that happens, then the government should explain why its ignoring the particular advice .        Browns premiership coincided with the  |global_recession|Great_Recession| , during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. Domestically, Browns administration introduced measures including a  |bank_rescue_package|2008_United_Kingdom_Bank_Rescue_Package|  worth around £500  billion , a temporary 2.5 percentage point cut in  |value_added_tax|Value_Added_Tax|   and a car scrappage scheme.        In mid-2008, Browns leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the Lancashire Plot, as two backbenchers from  |_Lancashire|Local_Government_Act_1972|  urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as  |Jacqui_Smith|Jacqui_Smith|  and  |Bill_Rammell|Bill_Rammell| , suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis.  In the autumn,  |Siobhain_McDonagh|Siobhain_Mcdonagh| , a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government,  spoke of the need for discussion over Browns position. While she did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour Party to hold a leadership election. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterward, on 12 September.  She was supported in making clear her desire for a contest by  |Joan_Ryan|Joan_Ryan|  ,  |Jim_Dowd|Jim_Dowd| ,  |Greg_Pope|Greg_Pope| , and a string of others who had previously held positions in government.  In the face of this speculation over Browns future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and  |Harriet_Harman|Harriet_Harman|  and  |David_Miliband|David_Miliband|  denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the  |Glasgow_East_by_election|2008_Glasgow_East_By_Election|  in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the solution , not the problem ; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary  |Jack_Straw|Jack_Straw| , Schools Secretary  |Ed_Balls|Ed_Balls|  and Cabinet Office Minister  |Ed_Miliband|Ed_Miliband|  all re-affirmed their support for Brown.  The deputy Prime Minister under Blair,  |John_Prescott|John_Prescott| , also pledged his support.  Foreign Secretary  |David_Miliband|David_Miliband|  then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in  The Guardian  was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the partys future, but neglected to mention the Prime Minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the  |fatalism|Fatalism|  in the party since the loss of Glasgow-East.  Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September, as did Business Secretary  |John_Hutton|John_Hutton_Baron_Hutton_Of_Furness| , Environment Secretary  |Hilary_Benn|Hilary_Benn| , and Chief Whip  |Geoff_Hoon|Geoff_Hoon| .      On 6 January 2010,  |Patricia_Hewitt|Patricia_Hewitt|  and Geoff Hoon jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Browns leadership.  The call received little support, and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was over . Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a form of silliness .           In the local elections on 1 May 2008, Labour suffered its worst results in 40 years, finishing in third place with a projected 24% share of the national vote.  Subsequently, the party saw the loss of by-elections in  |Nantwich_and_Crewe|2008_Crewe_And_Nantwich_By_Election|  and  |Henley|2008_Henley_By_Election|  as well as slumps in the polls. A  |by_election_in_Glasgow_East|2008_Glasgow_East_By_Election|  triggered by the resignation of  |David_Marshall|David_Marshall|  saw Labour struggle to appoint a candidate, eventually settling for  |Margaret_Curran|Margaret_Curran| , a sitting MSP in the  |Scottish_Parliament|Scottish_Parliament| . The SNP, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all derided Labour for their disorganised nature, with  |Alex_Salmond|Alex_Salmond|  commenting This is their lost weekend—they dont have a leader in Scotland, they dont have a candidate in Glasgow East, and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency .  Labour lost the constituency to the  |Scottish_National_Partys|Scottish_National_Party| |_John_Mason|John_Mason|  who took 11,277 votes, with Labour just 365 behind. The seat experienced a swing of 22.54%.      In the  |European_elections|2009_European_Parliament_Election_In_The_United_Kingdom| , Labour polled 16% of the vote, finishing in third place behind the Conservatives and  |UK_Independence_Party|Uk_Independence_Party|  . Voter apathy was reflected in the historically low turnout of around thirty three percent. In Scotland voter turnout was only twenty eight per cent. In the  |local_elections|2009_United_Kingdom_Local_Elections| , Labour polled 23% of the vote, finishing in third place behind  |Conservatives|Conservative_Party|  and  |Liberal_Democrats|Liberal_Democrats| , with Labour losing control of the four councils it had held prior to the election.  In a vote widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal, the share of the votes was down for all the major parties; Labour was down one percent, the Conservative share was down five percent. The beneficiary of the public backlash was generally seen to be the minor parties, including the  |Green_Party|Green_Party_Of_England_And_Wales|  and UKIP. These results were Labours worst since World War II. Brown was quoted in the press as having said that the results were a painful defeat for Labour , and that too many good people doing so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own.              In April 2010, Brown asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament. The general election campaign included the first televised leadership debates in Britain. The result of the election on 6 May was a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament| .  Brown was re-elected as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath with 29,559 votes.            Brown announced on 10 May 2010 that he would stand down as Labour Leader, with a view to a successor being chosen before the next  |Labour_Party_Conference|Labour_Party_Conference|  in September 2010.  The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii|  and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition,  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| , to form a government.  He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.              On 13 May 2010, in his first public appearance since leaving  |10_Downing_Street|10_Downing_Street| , two days after resigning as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party, Brown confirmed he intended to stay on in Parliament, serving as a Labour  |backbencher|Backbencher| , to serve the people of his  |Kirkcaldy_and_Cowdenbeath_constituency|Kirkcaldy_And_Cowdenbeath| .      Towards the end of May 2010, Brown began writing  Beyond the Crash , completing it after 14 weeks. The book discusses the 2007–08 financial crisis and Browns recommendations for future co-ordinated global action.       He played a prominent role in the lead-up to, and the aftermath of, the  |2014_Scottish_independence_referendum|2014_Scottish_Independence_Referendum| , campaigning for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom.      On 1 December 2014, Brown announced that he would not be seeking re-election to parliament. He stood down at the general election in May 2015.        In April 2011, media reports linked Brown with the role as the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of  |Dominique_Strauss_Kahn|Dominique_Strauss_Kahn| . Browns successor and Leader of the Opposition,  |Ed_Miliband|Ed_Miliband| , supported Brown for the role while the Prime Minister,  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| , voiced opposition to this.  Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced.  Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported  |Christine_Lagarde|Christine_Lagarde|  – the eventual successful candidate – for the post.          |Sir_Tim_Berners_Lee|Tim_Berners_Lee| , who had worked with the government during Browns premiership to publish government data on the internet in the  |data_gov_uk|Data_Gov_Uk|  project, subsequently invited Brown to become a board director of the  |World_Wide_Web_Foundation|World_Wide_Web_Foundation|  to advise the Web Foundation on ways to involve disadvantaged communities and global leaders in the development of sustainable programs that connect humanity and affect positive change .  On 22 April 2011 it was announced that Brown would be taking on an unpaid advisory role at the  |World_Economic_Forum|World_Economic_Forum| .  Brown was also appointed as the inaugural Distinguished Leader in Residence by  |New_York_University|New_York_University|  and has already taken part in discussions and lectures relating to the  |global_financial_crisis|Financial_Crisis_Of_2007–08|   and globalisation.      In July 2012 Brown was named by Secretary-General  |Ban_Ki_moon|Ban_Ki_Moon|  as a  |United_Nations|Unesco| |_Special_Envoy|Special_Envoy_Of_The_Secretary_General|  on Global Education. He chaired the  |International_Commission_on_Financing_Global_Education_Opportunity|International_Commission_On_Financing_Global_Education_Opportunity| . The position is unpaid.      In December 2015, Brown took his first large-scale role in the private sector since standing down as prime minister in 2010, becoming an advisor to  |PIMCO|Pimco| . Any money earned from the role is to go to the Gordon and Sarah Brown Foundation to support charitable work.        Brown is concerned about child poverty and poverty in general. He said: It makes me angry. Im seeing poverty I didn’t think I would ever see again in my lifetime. Slum housing was a feature of my childhood in the 1950s and 1960s, and I thought we had finally got over the worst of child poverty. Tax credits were the key to that. He also said, “You cant solve child poverty with the existing system.  |Universal_credit|Universal_Credit|  is completely underfunded and every time they move people on to it you see more poverty. Minimum wage jobs dont pay enough to keep a family with two or three children out of poverty. Brown said further, The government is trying to analyse this as people who are too lazy to get into work. But the problem is that people can’t earn enough to stay out of poverty.  The Guardian        The Deal , a TV movie from 2003, followed Tony Blairs rise to power, and his friendship and rivalry with Brown. In the 2015  |Channel_4|Channel_4|  television film  Coalition , Brown was portrayed by  |Ian_Grieve|Ian_Grieve| .          Browns early girlfriends included journalist  |Sheena_McDonald|Sheena_Mcdonald|  and  |Princess_Margarita|Princess_Margareta_Of_Romania| , the eldest daughter of exiled  |King_Michael_of_Romania|Michael_I_Of_Romania| . At the age of 49, Brown married  |Sarah_Macaulay|Sarah_Jane_Brown|  in a private ceremony at his home in  |North_Queensferry|North_Queensferry| , Fife, on 3 August 2000.  A daughter, Jennifer Jane, was born prematurely on 28 December 2001; she died on 7 January 2002, one day after suffering a  |brain_haemorrhage|Brain_Haemorrhage| .  The couple have two sons, John Macaulay  and Fraser . In November 2006, Fraser was diagnosed with  |cystic_fibrosis|Cystic_Fibrosis| .   The Sun  had learned of the situation in 2006 and published the story. In 2011 Brown stated he had wanted the details of his sons condition kept private and that the publication had left him in tears .  The Sun said they approached Brown and that discussion occurred with his colleagues who provided quotes to use in the article.      Sarah Brown rarely made official appearances, whether with or without her husband.  She is patron of several charities and has written articles for national newspapers related to this.  At the 2008 Labour Party Conference, Sarah caused surprise by taking to the stage to introduce her husband for his keynote address.  Since then her public profile has increased.      Brown has two brothers, John Brown and  |Andrew_Brown|Andrew_Brown| . Andrew has been Head of Media Relations in the UK for the French-owned utility company  |EDF_Energy|Edf_Energy|  since 2004.  Brown is also the brother-in-law of environmental journalist  |Clare_Rewcastle_Brown|Clare_Rewcastle_Brown| ; he wrote a piece for The Independent supporting Clares current environmental efforts on behalf of  |Sarawak|Sarawak| .      Whilst Prime Minister, Brown spent some of his spare time at  |Chequers|Chequers| , the house often being filled with friends. The Browns have entertained local dignitaries like Sir Leonard Figg.  Brown is also a friend of Harry Potter author  |J_K_Rowling|J_K_Rowling| , who says of Brown: I know him as affable, funny and gregarious, a great listener, a kind and loyal friend.      Brown is a strong supporter of the NHS, partly due to both the experimental surgery that saved the sight in his right eye after his retina became detached, and the care he and Sarah Brown received when their premature firstborn baby died. Blindness in his left eye resulting in his lack of peripheral vision contributed to Browns supposed antisocial nature and awkward public manner. For example, both on a podium and before a camera, while reading he needs to look slightly to one side of the paper in order to focus; when speaking to an audience or into a camera lens, he must remember to correct what would normally be an automatic tendency to look slightly askew in order to see clearly with his good eye . Browns papers were prepared in capital letters and in extremely large type, resulting in his stack of papers at the dispatch box being noticeably bulky due to fewer words per page. Former staffers often attributed Browns outbursts of temper in Downing Street to his frustration with his physical limitations.      Brown is a noted supporter of Kirkcaldy-based football club  |Raith_Rovers|Raith_Rovers_F_C_|  and has written articles about his relationship with the club.           The son of a  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland| |_minister|Minister| , Brown has talked about what he calls his  |moral_compass|Moral_Compass|   and of his parents being his inspiration .  He has, at least ostensibly, been keen to keep his religion a private matter.  According to The Guardian, he is a member of the Church of Scotland.         |Honorary_Degree|Honorary_Degree|  from  |Brunel_University|Brunel_University| |_Doctor_Honoris_Causa|Doctor_Honoris_Causa|  from  |University_of_Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh|     Honorary  |Doctor_of_Laws|Doctor_Of_Laws|  from  |Robert_Gordon_University|Robert_Gordon_University|     Honorary  |Doctor_of_Humane_Letters|Doctor_Of_Humane_Letters|  from  |New_York_University|New_York_University|     Honorary  |Doctor_of_Civil_Law|Doctor_Of_Civil_Law|  from  |Newcastle_University|Newcastle_University|     Honorary  |Doctor_of_Letters|Doctor_Of_Letters|  from  |University_of_Delhi|University_Of_Delhi| |_Doctor_Honoris_Causa|Doctor_Honoris_Causa|  from  |University_of_Glasgow|University_Of_Glasgow|     Elected an Honorary Fellow of the  |Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh|Royal_Society_Of_Edinburgh|       In March 2009, Brown was named  |World_Statesman_of_the_Year|Appeal_Of_Conscience_Foundationworld_Statesman_Of_The_Year|  by the  |Appeal_of_Conscience_Foundation|Appeal_Of_Conscience_Foundation| , an American organisation dedicated to promoting peace, human rights and understanding between  |religious_faiths|Religion| . The award was presented by  |Rabbi|Rabbi| |_Arthur_Schneier|Arthur_Schneier|  who praised Browns compassionate leadership in dealing with the challenging issues facing humanity, his commitment to freedom, human dignity and the environment, and for the major role he has played in helping to stabilise the worlds financial system .
