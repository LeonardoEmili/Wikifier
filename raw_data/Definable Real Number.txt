Informally, a definable real number is a  |real_number|Real_Number|  that can be uniquely specified by its description. The description may be expressed as a construction or as a formula of a  |formal_language|Formal_Language| . For example, the positive square root of 2,   , can be defined as the unique positive solution to the equation x2 2 , and it can be constructed with a compass and straightedge.     Different choices of a formal language or its interpretation can give rise to different notions of definability. Specific varieties of definable numbers include the  |constructible_numbers|Constructible_Number|  of geometry, the  |algebraic_numbers|Algebraic_Numbers| , and the  |computable_numbers|Computable_Number| .       One way of specifying a real number uses geometric techniques. A real number r is a  |constructible_number|Constructible_Number|  if there is a method to construct a line segment of length r using a compass and straightedge, beginning with a fixed line segment of length 1.     Each positive integer, and each positive rational number, is constructible. The positive square root of 2 is constructible. However, the cube root of 2 is not constructible; this is related to the impossibility of  |doubling_the_cube|Doubling_The_Cube| .            A real number r is called an  |algebraic_number|Algebraic_Number|  if there is a polynomial p, with only integer coefficients, so that r is a root of p, that is, p0.   Each algebraic number can be defined individually using the order relation on the reals. For example, if a polynomial q has 5 roots, the third one can be defined as the unique r such that q 0 and such that there are two distinct numbers less than r for which q is zero.     All rational numbers are algebraic, and all constructible numbers are algebraic. There are numbers such as the cube root of 2 which are algebraic but not constructible.     The algebraic numbers form a  |subfield|Field_Extension|  of the real numbers. This means that 0 and 1 are algebraic numbers and, moreover, if a and b are algebraic numbers, then so are a+b, a−b, ab and, if b is nonzero, a/b.     The algebraic numbers also have the property, which goes beyond being a subfield of the reals, that for each positive integer n and each algebraic number a, all of the nth roots of a that are real numbers are also algebraic.     There are only  |countably_many|Countable_Set|  algebraic numbers, but there are uncountably many real numbers, so in the sense of  |cardinality|Cardinality|  most real numbers are not algebraic. This  |nonconstructive_proof|Nonconstructive_Proof|  that not all real numbers are algebraic was first published by   Georg Cantor in his 1874 paper  |On_a_Property_of_the_Collection_of_All_Real_Algebraic_Numbers|Georg_Cantors_First_Set_Theory_Article|  .     Non-algebraic numbers are called  |transcendental_numbers|Transcendental_Numbers| . Specific examples of transcendental numbers include & pi; and  |Eulers_number|Eulers_Number|  e.       A real number is a  |computable_number|Computable_Number|  if there is an algorithm that, given a natural number n, produces a decimal expansion for the number accurate to n decimal places. This notion was introduced by  |Alan_Turing|Alan_Turing|  in 1936.     The computable numbers include the algebraic numbers along with many transcendental numbers including & pi; and  e. Like the algebraic numbers, the computable numbers also form a subfield of the real numbers, and the positive computable numbers are closed under taking nth roots for each positive  n.     Not all real numbers are computable. The entire set of computable numbers is countable, so most reals are not computable. Specific examples of noncomputable real numbers include the limits of  |Specker_sequences|Specker_Sequence| , and  |algorithmically_random_real_numbers|Algorithmically_Random_Sequence|  such as  |Chaitins_Omega_numbers|Chaitins_Constant| .       Another notion of definability comes from the formal theories of arithmetic, such as  |Peano_arithmetic|Peano_Arithmetic| . The  |language_of_arithmetic|Peano_Arithmetic|  has symbols for 0, 1, the successor operation, addition, and multiplication, intended to be interpreted in the usual way over the  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number| . Because no variables of this language range over the  |real_numbers|Real_Number| , a different sort of definability is needed to refer to real numbers. A real number a is definable in the language of arithmetic  if its  |Dedekind_cut|Dedekind_Cut|  can be defined as a  |predicate|Predicate|  in that language; that is, if there is a first-order formula φ in the language of arithmetic, with three free variables, such that   :   m     n     p    .
