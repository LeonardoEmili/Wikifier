   A constitutional monarchy is a form of  |monarchy|Monarchy|  in which the  |sovereign|Sovereignty|  exercises authority in accordance with a written or unwritten  |constitution|Constitution| . Constitutional monarchy differs from  |absolute_monarchy|Absolute_Monarchy|  in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as  |Monaco|Monaco| ,  |Morocco|Morocco| ,  |Jordan|Jordan| ,  |Kuwait|Kuwait|  and  |Bahrain|Bahrain| , where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| ,  |Spain|Spain| ,  |Belgium|Belgium| ,  |Sweden|Sweden|  and  |Japan|Japan| , where the monarch retains no formal authorities.     Constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  under the  |constitution|Constitution| , whether written or  |unwritten|Uncodified_Constitution| . While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarchs name, in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets  |public_policy|Public_Policy|  or chooses political leaders. Political scientist  |Vernon_Bogdanor|Vernon_Bogdanor| , paraphrasing  |Thomas_Macaulay|Thomas_Macaulay| , has defined a constitutional monarch as A sovereign who reigns but does not rule .     In addition to acting as a visible symbol of  |national_unity|National_Unity| , a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as  |dissolving_parliament|Dissolving_Parliament|  or giving  |royal_assent|Royal_Assent|  to legislation. However, the exercise of such powers is largely strictly in accordance with either written constitutional principles or unwritten constitutional conventions, rather than any personal political preference imposed by the sovereign. In  The English Constitution , British political theorist  |Walter_Bagehot|Walter_Bagehot|  identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch may freely exercise: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. Many constitutional monarchies still retain significant authorities or political influence however, such as through certain  |reserve_powers|Reserve_Power| , and may also play an important political role.     The  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  and the other  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realms|  are all constitutional monarchies in the  |Westminster_system|Westminster_System|  of constitutional governance. Two constitutional monarchies  –  |Malaysia|Monarchy_Of_Malaysia|  and  |Cambodia|Monarchy_Of_Cambodia|   – are  |elective_monarchies|Elective_Monarchies| , wherein the ruler is periodically selected by a small  |electoral_college|Electoral_College| .     Strongly limited constitutional monarchies can be called  |crowned_republics|Crowned_Republic| .     The concept of  |semi-constitutional_monarchy|Semi-Constitutional_Monarchy|  identifies constitutional monarchies with less parliamentary powers.  Because of this, constitutional monarchies are also called parliamentary monarchies to differentiate them from semi-constitutional monarchies.        The oldest constitutional monarchy dating back to ancient times was that of the  |Hittites|Hittites| . They were an  |ancient_Anatolian_people|Ancient_Anatolian_People|  that lived during the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  whose king or queen had to share their authority with an assembly, called the  Panku , which was the equivalent to a modern-day deliberative assembly or a legislature. Members of the Panku came from scattered noble families who worked as representatives of their subjects in an adjutant or subaltern federal-type landscape.               In the  |Kingdom_of_England|Kingdom_Of_England| , the  |Glorious_Revolution|Glorious_Revolution|  of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the  |Bill_of_Rights_1689|Bill_Of_Rights_1689|  and the  |Act_of_Settlement_1701|Act_Of_Settlement_1701| , although limits on the power of the monarch are much older than that . At the same time, in  |Scotland|Kingdom_Of_Scotland| , the  |Convention_of_Estates|Convention_Of_Estates|  enacted the  |Claim_of_Right_Act_1689|Claim_Of_Right_Act_1689| , which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy.     Although  |Queen_Anne|Anne,_Queen_Of_Great_Britain|  was the last monarch to veto an Act of Parliament when, on 11 March 1708, she blocked the  |Scottish_Militia_Bill|Scottish_Militia_Bill| , Hanoverian monarchs continued to selectively dictate government policies. For instance  |King_George_III|King_George_Iii|  constantly blocked  |Catholic_Emancipation|Catholic_Emancipation_In_Britain| , eventually precipitating the resignation of  |William_Pitt_the_Younger|William_Pitt_The_Younger|  as prime minister in 1801.  The sovereigns influence on the choice of prime minister gradually declined over this period,  |King_William_IV|King_William_Iv|  being the last monarch to dismiss a prime minister, when in 1834 he removed  |Lord_Melbourne|Lord_Melbourne|  as a result of Melbournes choice of  |Lord_John_Russell|Lord_John_Russell,_1St_Earl_Russell|  as Leader of the House of Commons.    |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria|  was the last monarch to exercise real personal power, but this diminished over the course of her reign. In 1839, she became the last sovereign to keep a prime minister in power against the will of Parliament when the  |Bedchamber_crisis|Bedchamber_Crisis|  resulted in the retention of Lord Melbournes administration.  By the end of her reign, however, she could do nothing to block the unacceptable premierships of  |William_Gladstone|William_Ewart_Gladstone| , although she still exercised power in appointments to the Cabinet, for example in 1886 preventing Gladstones choice of  |Hugh_Childers|Hugh_Childers|  as War Secretary in favor of  |Sir_Henry_Campbell-Bannerman|Sir_Henry_Campbell-Bannerman| .      Today, the role of the British monarch is by convention effectively ceremonial. Instead, the  |British_Parliament|British_Parliament|  and the  |Government|Government_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  – chiefly in the office of  |Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  – exercise their powers under  |Royal_Prerogative|Royal_Prerogative|      No person may accept significant public office without swearing an  |oath_of_allegiance_to_the_Queen|Oath_Of_Allegiance| . With few exceptions, the monarch is bound by  |constitutional_convention|Constitutional_Conventions_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  to act on the  |advice|Advice|  of the Government.       Constitutional monarchy originated in continental Europe, with Poland developing the first constitution for a monarchy with the  |Constitution_of_May_3,_1791|Constitution_Of_May_3,_1791| ; it was the third single-document constitution in the world just after the first republican  |Constitution_of_the_United_States|Constitution_Of_The_United_States| . Constitutional monarchy also occurred briefly in the early years of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| , but much more widely afterwards.  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte|  is considered the first monarch proclaiming himself as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. German philosopher  |Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel| , in his work  Elements of the Philosophy of Right  , gave the concept a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the  |Protestant|Protestantism|  Christian view of natural law. Hegels forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan.       As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was head of the  |executive_branch|Executive_Branch|  and quite a powerful figure even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the U.S. Constitution may have envisioned the president as an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was then understood, following  |Montesquieus|Baron_De_Montesquieu|  account of the separation of powers.     The present-day concept of a constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister| , exercise power, with the monarchs having ceded power and remaining as a titular position. In many cases the monarchs, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of servants of the people to reflect the new, egalitarian position. In the course of  |Frances|France| |July_Monarchy|July_Monarchy| ,  |Louis-Philippe_I|Louis-Philippe_I|  was styled King of the French rather than King of France.     Following the  |Unification_of_Germany|Unification_Of_Germany| ,  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  rejected the British model. In the constitutional monarchy established under the  |Constitution_of_the_German_Empire|Constitution_Of_The_German_Empire|  which Bismarck inspired, the  |Kaiser|Kaiser|  retained considerable actual executive power, while the  |Imperial_Chancellor|Reichskanzler|  needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germanys defeat in the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . Later,  |Fascist_Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy_Under_Fascism|  could also be considered a constitutional monarchy, in that there was a  |king|King_Of_Italy|  as the titular head of state while actual power was held by  |Benito_Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini|  under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.     Nowadays a  |parliamentary_democracy|Parliamentary_Democracy|  that is a constitutional monarchy is considered to differ from one that is a  |republic|Republic|  only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected  |Members_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament| .     However, three important factors distinguish monarchies such as the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with  |Parliament|Parliament| . These are: the  |Royal_Prerogative|Royal_Prerogative|  under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited circumstances;  |Sovereign_Immunity|Sovereign_Immunity|  under which the monarch may do no wrong under the law because the  |responsible_government|Responsible_Government|  is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use restrictions as most citizens. Other privileges may be nominal or ceremonial .     Today slightly more than a quarter of constitutional monarchies are  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe| an countries, including the  |United_Kingdom|Monarchy_Of_The_United_Kingdom| ,  |Spain|Monarchy_Of_Spain| , the  |Netherlands|Monarchy_Of_The_Netherlands| ,  |Belgium|Monarchy_Of_Belgium| ,  |Norway|Monarchy_Of_Norway| ,  |Denmark|Monarchy_Of_Denmark| ,  |Luxembourg|Monarchy_Of_Luxembourg| ,  |Monaco|Monarchy_Of_Monaco| ,  |Liechtenstein|Monarchy_Of_Liechtenstein|  and  |Sweden|Monarchy_Of_Sweden| . However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia:  |Japan|Monarchy_Of_Japan|  and  |Thailand|Monarchy_Of_Thailand| . In these countries the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister|  holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the monarch retains residual powers. The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a  |coalition_government|Coalition_Government|  following a parliamentary election, while in Norway the King chairs special meetings of the  |cabinet|Cabinet| .     In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the Cabinet. Only a few monarchies  have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.     There are sixteen constitutional monarchies under Queen  |Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii| , which are known as  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realm| . Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant reserve or prerogative powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises, usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor-General exercising such power occurred during the  |1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis|1975_Australian_Constitutional_Crisis| , when the Australian Prime Minister,  |Gough_Whitlam|Gough_Whitlam| , was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Governments  |budget|Budget|  by refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills. On November 11, 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he sought the Governor-Generals approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition  |Malcolm_Fraser|Malcolm_Fraser|  in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a  |double_dissolution|Double_Dissolution|  election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlams supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-Generals reserve powers was appropriate, and whether  |Australia_should_become_a_republic|Republicanism_In_Australia| . Among supporters of constitutional monarchy, however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by the constitution, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.     In Thailands constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The immediate former King,  |Bhumibol_Adulyadej|Bhumibol_Adulyadej| , was the longest-reigning monarch in the world and in all of Thailands history, before passing away on 13 October 2016.  Bhumibol reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents.  Among the powers retained by the Thai monarch under the constitution,  |lèse_majesté|Lèse_Majesté_In_Thailand|  protects the image of the monarch and enables him to play a role in politics. It carries strict criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people were reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence arose from this reverence and from the socioeconomic improvement efforts undertaken by the royal family.     In the United Kingdom, a frequent debate centers on when it is appropriate for a British monarch to act. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favor of a  |partisan|Partisan|  goal, while some  |political_scientists|Political_Scientist|  champion the idea of an interventionist monarch as a check against possible illegal action by politicians. For instance, the monarch of the United Kingdom can theoretically exercise an absolute veto over legislation by withholding royal assent. However, no monarch has done so since 1708, and it is widely believed that this and many of the monarchs other political powers are  |lapsed_powers|Lapsed_Power| .     There are currently 43 monarchies worldwide.                   |Anglo-Corsican_Kingdom|Anglo-Corsican_Kingdom|  was a brief period in the  |history_of_Corsica|History_Of_Corsica|  when the island broke with  |Revolutionary_France|Revolutionary_France|  and sought military protection from  |Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain| . Corsica became an independent kingdom under  |George_III|George_Iii|  of the United Kingdom, but with its own elected parliament and a written constitution guaranteeing local autonomy and democratic rights.    |Brazil|Brazil|  from 1822, with the proclamation of independence and rise of the  |Empire_of_Brazil|Empire_Of_Brazil|  by  |Pedro_I_of_Brazil|Pedro_I_Of_Brazil|  to 1889, when  |Pedro_II|Pedro_Ii_Of_Brazil|  was deposed by a military coup.    |Kingdom_of_Bulgaria|Kingdom_Of_Bulgaria|  until 1946 when  |Tsar_Simeon|Simeon_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|  was deposed by the communist assembly.   Many  |Commonwealth_republics|Commonwealth_Republic|  were constitutional monarchies for some period after their independence, including  |Ceylon|Dominion_Of_Ceylon|  from 1948 to 1972 ,  |Fiji|Monarchy_Of_Fiji|  ,  |Gambia|Queen_Of_The_Gambia|  ,  |Ghana|Queen_Of_Ghana|  ,  |Guyana|Queen_Of_Guyana|  , and  |Trinidad_and_Tobago|Queen_Of_Trinidad_And_Tobago|  .   The  |Grand_Principality_of_Finland|Grand_Principality_Of_Finland|  was a constitutional monarchy though its ruler,  |Alexander_I|Alexander_I_Of_Russia| , was simultaneously an  |autocrat|Autocracy|  and  |absolute_ruler|Absolute_Monarchy|  in Russia.    |France|France| , several times during the 19th century.  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte|  proclaimed himself Emperor of the French in what was ostensibly a constitutional monarchy, though modern historians often call his reign as an absolute monarchy. The  |Bourbon_Restoration|Bourbon_Restoration|  , the  |July_Monarchy|July_Monarchy|  , and the  |Second_Empire|Second_French_Empire|   were also constitutional monarchies, although the power of the monarch varied considerably between them.   The  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  from 1871 to 1918, was also a constitutional monarchy—see  |Constitution_of_the_German_Empire|Constitution_Of_The_German_Empire| .    |Greece|Greece|  until 1973 when  |Constantine_II|Constantine_Ii_Of_Greece|  was deposed by the  |military_government|Greek_Military_Junta_Of_1967–74| . The decision was formalized by a  |plebiscite|Greek_Plebiscite,_1974|  December 8, 1974.    |Hawaii|Kingdom_Of_Hawaii| , which was an absolute monarchy from its founding in 1810, transitioned to a constitutional monarchy in 1840 when  |King_Kamehameha_III|King_Kamehameha_Iii|  promulgated the kingdoms  |first_constitution|1840_Constitution_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_Hawaii| . This constitutional form of government continued until the monarchy was overthrown in an 1893  |coup|Overthrow_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_Hawaiicoup_D.27État| .   The  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| . In 1848–1849 and 1867–1918 as part of  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary| . In the interwar period  |Hungary|Hungary|  remained a constitutional monarchy without a reigning monarch.    |Iceland|Iceland| . The Act of Union, a December 1, 1918 agreement with Denmark, established Iceland as a  |sovereign_kingdom|Monarchy_Of_Iceland|  united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland abolished the monarchy and became a republic on June 17, 1944 after the Icelandic constitutional referendum, May 24, 1944.    |India|India|  was a constitutional monarchy, with  |George_VI|George_Vi|  as head of state and  |the_Earl_Mountbatten|Louis_Mountbatten,_1St_Earl_Mountbatten_Of_Burma|  as  |governor-general|Governor-General_Of_India| , for a brief period between gaining its independence from the British on  |August_15,_1947|Independence_Day|  and becoming a republic when it adopted  |its_constitution|Constitution_Of_India|  on January 26, 1950, henceforth celebrated as  |Republic_Day|Republic_Day| .    |Iran|Iran|  under  |Mohammad_Reza_Shah_Pahlavi|Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi|  was a constitutional monarchy, which had been originally established during the  |Persian_Constitutional_Revolution|Persian_Constitutional_Revolution|  in 1906.    |Italy|Italy|  until June 2, 1946, when a referendum proclaimed the end of the Kingdom and the beginning of the Republic.   The  |Kingdom_of_Laos|Kingdom_Of_Laos|  was a constitutional monarchy until 1975, when  |Sisavang_Vatthana|Savang_Vatthana|  was forced to abdicate by the communist  |Pathet_Lao|Pathet_Lao| .    |Malta|Malta|  was a constitutional monarchy with  |Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii|  as Queen of Malta, represented by a Governor-General appointed by her, for the first ten years of independence from 21 September 1964 to the declaration of the Republic of Malta on 13 December 1974.    |Mexico|Mexico|  was twice an Empire. The  |First_Mexican_Empire|First_Mexican_Empire|  was from May 19, 1822, to March 19, 1823, with  |Agustín_de_Iturbide|Agustín_De_Iturbide|  serving as emperor. Then, with the help of the Austrian and Spanish crowns,  |Napoleon_III_of_France|Napoleon_Iii_Of_France|  installed  |Maximilian_of_Austria|Maximilian_Of_Mexico|  as  |Emperor_of_Mexico|Emperor_Of_Mexico| . This attempt to create a European-style monarchy lasted three years, from 1864 to 1867.    |Montenegro|Kingdom_Of_Montenegro|  until 1918 when it merged with  |Serbia|Kingdom_Of_Serbia|  and other areas to form  |Yugoslavia|Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia| .    |Nepal|Nepal|  until May 28, 2008, when  |King_Gyanendra|King_Gyanendra|  was deposed, and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal was declared.    |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  from 1876 until 1878 and again from 1908 until the dissolution of the empire in 1922.   The  |Kingdom_of_Afghanistan|Kingdom_Of_Afghanistan|  was a constitutional monarchy under  |Mohammad_Zahir_Shah|Mohammad_Zahir_Shah|  until 1973.   The  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth| , formed after the  |Union_of_Lublin|Union_Of_Lublin|  in 1569 and lasting until the final partition of the state in 1795, operated much like many modern European constitutional monarchies . The legislators of the unified state truly did not see it as a monarchy at all, but as a republic under the presidency of the King. Poland–Lithuania also followed the principle of Rex regnat et non gubernat , had a bicameral parliament, and a collection of entrenched legal documents amounting to a constitution along the lines of the modern  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| . The King was elected, and had the duty of maintaining the peoples rights.    |Kingdom_of_Albania|Albanian_Kingdom|  from 1928 until 1939, Albania was a Constitutional Monarchy ruled by the  |House_of_Zogu|House_Of_Zogu| ,  |King_Zog_I|King_Zog_I| .    |Portugal|Portugal|  was a monarchy since 1139 and a constitutional monarchy from 1822 to 1828, and again from 1834 until 1910, when  |Manuel_II|Manuel_Ii_Of_Portugal|  was overthrown by a military coup. From 1815 to 1825 it was part of the  |United_Kingdom_of_Portugal,_Brazil_and_the_Algarves|United_Kingdom_Of_Portugal,_Brazil_And_The_Algarves|  which was a constitutional monarchy for the years 1820–23.    |Kingdom_of_Romania|Kingdom_Of_Romania|  From its establishment in 1881 until 1947 when  |Michael_I|Michael_I_Of_Romania|  was forced to abdicate by the communists.    |Kingdom_of_Serbia|Kingdom_Of_Serbia|  from 1882 until 1918, when it merged with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into the unitary Yugoslav Kingdom, that was led by the Serbian  |Karadjordjevic|Karadjordjevic|  dynasty.    |Yugoslavia|Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia|  from 1918  until 1929 and from then  until 1944 when under pressure from the Allies  |Peter_II|Peter_Ii_Of_Yugoslavia|  recognized the communist government.        |Andorra|Andorra|  is the only monarchy where the head of state is vested  |jointly_in_two_individuals|Coregency|  : the  |Bishop_of_Urgell|Bishop_Of_Urgell|  and the  |President_of_France|President_Of_France| .    |Andorra|Andorra| ,  |Monaco|Monaco|  and  |Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein|  are the only countries with a reigning  |prince|Prince| .    |Belgium|Belgium|  is the only explicit  |popular_monarchy|Popular_Monarchy| , the formal title of its  |King|Monarchy_Of_Belgium|  being King of the Belgians rather than King of Belgium.    |Japan|Japan|  is the only country remaining with an  |emperor|Emperor_Of_Japan|   , whose position functions as a symbol of the state  .    |Luxembourg|Luxembourg|  is the only country with a  |grand_duke|Grand_Duke| .    |Malaysia|Malaysia|  is the only  |federal|Federation|  country with an  |elective_monarchy|Elective_Monarchy| , the  |Yang_di-Pertuan_Agong|Yang_Di-Pertuan_Agong| , being selected from among nine  |state|States_And_Federal_Territories_Of_Malaysia|.
