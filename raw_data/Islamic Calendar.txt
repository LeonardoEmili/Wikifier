            The Islamic, Muslim, or Hijri calendar  is a  |lunar_calendar|Lunar_Calendar|  consisting of 12  |lunar_months|Lunar_Month|  in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used to determine the proper days of  |Islamic_holidays|Islamic_Holiday|  and rituals, such as the  |annual_period_of_fasting|Ramadan|  and the proper time for the  |pilgrimage_to_Mecca|Hajj| . The  |civil_calendar|Civil_Calendar|  of almost all countries where the religion is predominantly Muslim is the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , with  |Syriac_month_names|Assyrian_Calendar|  used in the  |Levant_and_Mesopotamia|Arabic_Names_Of_Calendar_Monthslevant_And_Mesopotamia|  . Notable exceptions to this rule are Iran and Afghanistan, which use the  |Solar_Hijri_calendar|Solar_Hijri_Calendar| . Rents, wages and similar regular commitments are generally paid by the civil calendar.     The Islamic calendar employs the  |Hijri_era|Hijri_Era|  whose  |epoch|Epoch|  was established as the  |Islamic_New_Year|Islamic_New_Year|  of 622  |AD|Anno_Domini| / |CE|Common_Era| .  Paul Lunde, Saudi Aramco World Magazine , retrieved 1/1/2019 During that year,  |Muhammad|Muhammad|  and his followers migrated from  |Mecca|Mecca|  to  |Medina|Medina|  and established the first Muslim community , an event commemorated as the  |Hijra|Hijra| . In the West, dates in this era are usually denoted AH  in parallel with the  |Christian|Christian_Era|  ,  |Common|Common_Era|  and  |Jewish_eras|Jewish_Era|  . In Muslim countries, it is also sometimes denoted as H  from its Arabic form . In English, years prior to the Hijra are reckoned as BH . .     The current Islamic year is 1441  AH. In the Gregorian calendar, 1441  AH runs from approximately 1  September  2019 to 20  August  2020.                For central Arabia, especially  |Mecca|Mecca| , there is a lack of epigraphical evidence but details are found in the writings of Muslim authors of the  |Abbasid|Abbasid|  era. Inscriptions of the ancient  |South_Arabia|South_Arabia| n calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the  |lunisolar_system|Lunisolar_Calendar| . Both  |al_Biruni|Al_Biruni|  and  |al_Masudi|Al_Masudi|  suggest that the ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.     The Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of  |Tihamah|Tihamah| ,  |Hejaz|Hejaz| , and  |Najd|Najd|  distinguished between two types of months, permitted  and forbidden  months. The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the  |pilgrimage|Hajj|  season, Dhu al-Qa‘dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram. Information about the forbidden months is also found in the writings of  |Procopius|Procopius| , where he describes an armistice with the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir which happened in the summer of 541 AD/CE. However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The  |Quran|Quran|  links the four forbidden months with Nasī’, a word that literally means postponement . According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of  |Kinanah|Kinanah| , by a man known as the al-Qalammas of Kinanah and his descendants .     Different interpretations of the concept of Nasī’ have been proposed. For an overview of the various theories and a discussion of the problem of hindsight chronology in early and pre-Islamic sources, see . Some scholars, both Muslim Mahmud Effendi , as discussed in Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars , pp. 460–470. According to Tradition , repeatedly cited by F.C. De Blois. and Western, F.C. De Blois, TA’RĪKH : I.1.iv. Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula , The Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edition, XThe Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd, VII: 977. maintain that the  |pre_Islamic|Pre_Islamic_Arabia|  calendar used in central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, Nasī’ is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like  |Ibn_Hisham|Ibn_Hisham| ,  |Ibn_Manzur|Ibn_Manzur| , and the corpus of  |Quranic_exegesis|Tafsir| .      This is corroborated by an early  |Sabaic|Sabaic|  inscription, where a religious ritual was postponed  due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ns’ has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Quran suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Quranic meaning of Nasī’. The  Encyclopaedia of Islam  concludes  The Arabic system of can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.  The Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, Index, p. 441. The term fixed calendar is generally understood to refer to the non-intercalated calendar.     Others concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the  |Hijra|Hijra|  it was transformed into a  |lunisolar_calendar|Lunisolar_Calendar|  containing an  |intercalary_month|Intercalation|  added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer  |Abu_Mashar_al_Balkhi|Abu_Mashar_Al_Balkhi| , and later by  |al_Biruni|Al_Biruni| ,  |Abu_Mashar_al_Balkhi|Jafar_Ibn_Muhammad_Abu_Mashar_Al_Balkhi|  , http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k93171b.image.f166.langFR Kitab al-Uluf, Journal Asiatique, series 5, xi 168+.
