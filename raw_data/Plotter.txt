         A plotter is a  |computer|Computer| |printer|Printer_Plotters|  for printing  |vector_graphics|Vector_Graphics| . Plotters draw pictures on paper using a  |pen|Pen| . In the past, plotters were used in applications such as  |computer-aided_design|Computer-Aided_Design| , as they were able to produce line drawings much faster and of a higher quality than contemporary conventional printers, and small desktop plotters were often used for business graphics. Although they retained a niche for producing very large drawings for many years, plotters have now largely been replaced by  |wide-format_conventional_printers|Wide-Format_Printer| .     OverviewXY-writers used as output devices for  |measurement_instruments|Measurement_Instrument|  and  |analog_computers|Analog_Computer| .     Pen plotters print by moving a pen or other instrument across the surface of a piece of paper. This means that plotters are  |vector_graphics|Vector_Graphics|  devices, rather than  |raster_graphics|Raster_Graphics|  as with other  |printers|Computer_Printer| . Pen plotters can draw complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently creating a solid region of color, but can  |hatch|Hatching|  an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.     Plotters offered the fastest way to efficiently produce very large drawings or color high-resolution vector-based artwork when  |computer_memory|Computer_Memory|  was very expensive and processor power was very limited, and other types of printers had limited graphic output capabilities.     Pen plotters have essentially become obsolete, and have been replaced by  |large-format|Wide-Format_Printer| |inkjet_printers|Inkjet_Printer|  and LED  |toner|Toner| -based printers. Such devices may still understand vector languages originally designed for plotter use, because in many uses, they offer a more efficient alternative to raster data.        |Electrostatic_plotters|Electrostatic_Plotter|  used a  |dry_toner_transfer_process|Xerography|  similar to that in many  |photocopiers|Photocopier| . They were faster than pen plotters and were available in large formats, suitable for reproducing engineering drawings. The quality of image was often not as good as contemporary pen plotters. Electrostatic plotters were made in both flat-bed and drum types. The electrostatic plotter uses the pixel as a drawing means, like a  |raster_graphics|Raster_Graphics|  display device. The plotter head consists of a large number of tiny styluses embedded in it. This head traverses over the width of the paper as it rolls past the head to make a drawing. The resolutions available may be 100 to 508 dots per inch. Electrostatic plotters are very fast with plotting speed of 6 to 32  mm/s, depending on the plotter resolution.
