      Terbium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Tb and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  65. It is a silvery-white,  |rare_earth|Rare_Earth_Element| |metal|Metal|  that is  |malleable|Malleable| ,  |ductile|Ductile| , and soft enough to be cut with a knife. The ninth member of the  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  series, terbium is a fairly  |electropositive|Electropositive|  metal that reacts with water, evolving  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  gas. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many  |minerals|Mineral| , including  |cerite|Cerite| ,  |gadolinite|Gadolinite| ,  |monazite|Monazite| ,  |xenotime|Xenotime| , and  |euxenite|Euxenite| .     Swedish chemist  |Carl_Gustaf_Mosander|Carl_Gustaf_Mosander|  discovered terbium as a chemical element in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in  |yttrium_oxide|Yttrium_Oxide| , Y 2 O 3 . Yttrium and terbium are named after the village of  |Ytterby|Ytterby|  in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange|  techniques.     Terbium is used to  |dope|Dopant| |calcium_fluoride|Calcium_Fluoride| , calcium  |tungstate|Tungstate|  and  |strontium|Strontium| |molybdate|Molybdate| , materials that are used in  |solid-state_devices|Solid-State_Device| , and as a crystal stabilizer of  |fuel_cells|Fuel_Cell|  which operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of  |Terfenol-D|Terfenol-D|  , terbium is of use in  |actuators|Actuator| , in naval  |sonar|Sonar|  systems and in  |sensors|Sensor| .     Most of the worlds terbium supply is used in green phosphors. Terbium  |oxide|Oxide|  is in  |fluorescent_lamps|Fluorescent_Lamp|  and television and monitor  |cathode_ray_tubes|Cathode_Ray_Tube|  . Terbium green  |phosphors|Phosphor|  are combined with divalent  |europium|Europium|  blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide  |trichromatic|Trichromatic|  lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting.           Terbium is a silvery-white  |rare_earth|Rare_Earth_Element| |metal|Metal|  that is  |malleable|Malleable| ,  |ductile|Ductile|  and soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is relatively stable in air compared to the earlier, more reactive lanthanides in the first half of the lanthanide series.  Terbium exists in two crystal  |allotropes|Allotropy|  with a transformation temperature of 1289  °C between them. The 65 electrons of a terbium atom are arranged in the  |electron_configuration|Electron_Configuration|  f 9 6s 2 ; normally, only three electrons can be removed before the nuclear charge becomes too great to allow further ionization, but in the case of terbium, the stability of the half-filled f 7 configuration allows further ionization of a fourth electron in the presence of very strong oxidizing agents such as  |fluorine|Fluorine|  gas.     The terbium cation is brilliantly  |fluorescent|Fluorescence| , in a bright lemon-yellow color that is the result of a strong green  |emission_line|Emission_Line|  in combination with other lines in the orange and red. The  |yttrofluorite|Yttrofluorite|  variety of the mineral  |fluorite|Fluorite|  owes its creamy-yellow fluorescence in part to terbium. Terbium easily oxidizes, and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research. Single terbium atoms have been isolated by implanting them into  |fullerene|Fullerene|  molecules.      Terbium has a simple  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  ordering at temperatures below 219 K. Above 219 K, it turns into a helical  |antiferromagnetic|Antiferromagnetic|  state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular  |basal_plane|Basal_Plane|  layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  state at 230 K.        Terbium metal is an electropositive element and oxidizes in the presence of most acids , all of the halogens, and even water.   :2  Tb + 3  H 2 SO 4 → 2  Tb 3+ + 3   + 3  H 2 ↑   :2  Tb + 3  X 2 → 2  TbX 3    :2  Tb + 6  H 2 O → 2 Tb 3 + 3  H 2 ↑   Terbium also oxidizes readily in air to form a mixed  |terbium_oxide|Terbium_Oxide|    :8  Tb + 7  O 2 → 2  Tb 4 O 7     The most common oxidation state of terbium is +3 , such as . In the solid state, tetravalent terbium is also known, in compounds such as TbO 2 and TbF 4 .  In solution, terbium typically forms trivalent species, but can be oxidized to the tetravalent state with  |ozone|Ozone|  in highly basic aqueous conditions.
