              A call centre  or call center  is a centralised office used for receiving or transmitting a large volume of enquiries by  |telephone|Telephone| . An inbound call center is operated by a  |company|Company|  to administer incoming product or service support or information enquiries from consumers. Outbound call centers are operated for  |telemarketing|Telemarketing| , for solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection,  |market_research|Market_Research| , emergency notifications, and urgent/critical needs  |blood_banks|Blood_Banks| . A contact center, further extension to call centers administers centralized handling of individual communications, including  |letters|Letter| ,  |fax|Fax| es,  |live_support_software|Live_Support_Software| ,  |social_media|Social_Media| ,  |instant_message|Instant_Message| , and  |e_mail|E_Mail| .      A call center has an open workspace for  |call_centre_agents|Customer_Representative| , with work stations that include a computer and display for each agent, a  |telephone|Telephone|  set/ |headset|Headphones|  connected to a  |telecom_switch|Telecom_Switch|  or to an inbound/outbound call management system, and one or more supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate  |computer_network|Computer_Network| , including  |mainframes|Mainframe_Computer| ,  |microcomputer_servers|Microcomputer_Server|  and  |LANs|Local_Area_Network| . Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called  |computer_telephony_integration|Computer_Telephony_Integration| .     The contact centre is a central point from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of companys  |customer_relationship_management|Customer_Relationship_Management|  infrastructure. The majority of large companies use contact centres as a means of managing their customer interactions. These centres can be operated by either an in house department responsible or outsourcing customer interaction to a third party agency .          The origins of call centres dates back to the 1960s with the UK-based Birmingham Press and Mail, which installed Private Automated Business Exchanges to have rows of agents handling customer contacts.  |Science_and_invention_in_Birminghamcite_note_45|Science_And_Invention_In_Birminghamcite_Note_45|   By 1973, call centres received mainstream attention after Rockwell International patented its Galaxy Automatic Call Distributor for a telephone booking system as well as the popularization of telephone headsets as seen on televised  |NASA_Mission_Control_Center|Christopher_C_Kraft_Jr_Mission_Control_Center|  events.       During the late 1970s, call centre technology expanded to include telephone sales, airline reservations and banking systems. The term call centre was first published and recognized by the  Oxford English Dictionary  in 1983. The 1980s experienced the development of  |toll_free_telephone_numbers|Toll_Free_Telephone_Number|  to increase the efficiency of agents and overall call volume. Call centres increased with the deregulation of  |long_distance_calling|Long_Distance_Calling|  and growth in information dependent industries.      As call centres expanded, unionisation occurred in  |North_America|North_America|  to gain members  including the  |Communications_Workers_of_America|Communications_Workers_Of_America|   and the  |United_Steelworkers|United_Steelworkers| . In  |Australia|Australia| , the  |National_Union_of_Workers|National_Union_Of_Workers|  represents unionised workers; their activities form part of the Australian labour movement.  In  |Europe|Europe| , Uni Global Union of  |Switzerland|Switzerland|  is involved in assisting unionisation in this realm  and in Germany  |Vereinte_Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft|Vereinte_Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft|  represents call centre workers.     During the 1990s, call centres expanded internationally and developed into two additional subsets of communication, contact centres and outsourced bureau centres. A contact centre is defined as a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and strategies that provides access to information, resources, and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organisation.  |Cleveland_Brad|Brad_Cleveland| , Call Center Management on Fast Forward , ICMI Press, 2012  In contrast to in-house management, outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a pay per use model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients, thereby supporting a very cost effective model, especially for low volumes of calls. The modern contact center includes automated call blending of inbound and outbound calls as well as predictive dialing capabilities dramatically increasing agents productivity. Latest implementations with more complex systems, require highly skilled operational and management staff that can use  |multichannel|Multichannel_Marketing|  online and offline tools to improve customer interactions.                Call centre technologies include: Caller ID a method that instantly displays callers identity including customer information and  |speech_recognition|Speech_Recognition|  software which allowed Interactive Voice Response systems to handle first levels of  |customer_support|Customer_Support| ,  |text_mining|Text_Mining| ,  |natural_language_processing|Natural_Language_Processing|  to allow better customer handling, agent training via interactive scripting and automatic mining using  |best_practices|Best_Practices|  from past interactions,  |support_automation|Support_Automation|  and many other technologies to improve agent productivity and  |customer_satisfaction|Customer_Satisfaction| . Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies,  both for inbound and outbound campaigns. This allows inbound calls to be directly routed to the appropriate agent for the task, whilst minimising wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in.   Outbound Predictive Dialing introduced in mid 80s  .
