Martin Waldseemüller  was a German  |cartographer|Cartography| .     He and  |Matthias_Ringmann|Matthias_Ringmann|  are credited with the first recorded usage of the word  America , on the 1507 map  Universalis Cosmographia  in honour of the Italian explorer  |Amerigo_Vespucci|Amerigo_Vespucci| .       Waldseemüller was born in  |Wolfenweiler|Wolfenweiler|  near  |Freiburg_im_Breisgau|Freiburg_Im_Breisgau|   and he studied at the  |University_of_Freiburg|Albert_Ludwigs_University_Of_Freiburg| .          On 25 April 1507, as a member of the  |Gymnasium|Gymnasium|  Vosagense at Saint Diey in the  |Duchy_of_Lorraine|Duchy_Of_Lorraine|  , he produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map using the information from Columbus and Vespuccis travels , both bearing the first use of the name America . The globular and wall maps were accompanied by a book  Cosmographiae Introductio , an introduction to  |cosmography|Cosmography| . The book, first printed in the city of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, includes in its second part, a translation to Latin of the Quattuor Americi Vespuccij navigationes , which is apparently a letter written by  |Amerigo_Vespucci|Amerigo_Vespucci| , although some historians consider it to have been a forgery written by its supposed recipient in Italy.     In the seventh chapter of the Cosmographiæ Introduction, written by  |Matthias_Ringmann|Matthias_Ringmann| , it is explained why the name America was proposed for the then New World, or the Fourth Part of the World:     Atque in sexto climate Antarcticum versus et pars extrema Africæ nuper reperta. . . . et quarta orbis pars sitae sunt     Translation:   And in the sixth climate toward the Antarctic, the recently discovered farther part of Africa . . . and a fourth part of the world  are situated       In the ninth chapter of the same book the reasons for the name America are given in more detail:     Nunc vero et hæ partes sunt latius lustratæ et alia quarta pars per Americum Vesputium inventa est, quam non video cur quis jure vetet ab Americo Inventore sagacis ingenii viro, Amerigen quasi Americi terram sive Americam dicendam; cum et Europa et Asia a mulieribus sua sortita sunt nomina.     Translation:     But now these parts have been more widely explored, and also another fourth part has been discovered by Americus Vesputius , and I do not see why anyone should justifiably forbid it to be called Amerige, as if Americus Land , or America, from its discoverer Americus, a man of perceptive character; since both Europa and Asia have received their names from women.       In 1513, Waldseemüller appears to have had second thoughts about the name, probably due to contemporary protests about Vespucci’s role in the discovery and naming of America, or just carefully waiting for the official discovery of the whole northwestern coast of what is now called North America, as separated from East Asia. In his reworking of the  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  atlas, the continent is labelled simply Terra Incognita . Despite the revision, 1,000 copies of the world maps had since been distributed, and the original suggestion took hold. While  |North_America|North_America|  was still called Indies in documents for some time, it was eventually called America as well.     The wall map was lost for a long time, but a copy was found in  |Schloss_Wolfegg|Schloss_Wolfegg|  in southern Germany by  |Joseph_Fischer|Joseph_Fischer|  in 1901. It is still the only copy known to survive, and it was purchased by the United States  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress|  in May 2003  after an agreement was reached in 2001.  Five copies of the globular map survive in the form of gores : printed maps that were intended to be cut out and pasted onto a wooden globe. Only one of these lies in the  |Americas|Americas|  today, residing at the  |James_Ford_Bell_Library|James_Ford_Bell_Library| |_University_of_Minnesota|University_Of_Minnesota| ; three copies are in Germany , and one is in London, UK, in private hands.     Waldseemüller died  |intestate|Intestate|  16 March 1520 in Sankt Didel, then a canon of the collegiate Church of  |Saint_Dié|Saint_Dié_Des_Vosges| .
