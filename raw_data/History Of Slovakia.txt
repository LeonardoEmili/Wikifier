     This article discusses the history of the territory of  |Slovakia|Slovakia| .            Discovery of ancient tools made by the  |Clactonian_technique|Clactonian|  near  |Nové_Mesto_nad_Váhom|Nové_Mesto_Nad_Váhom|  attests that Slovakias territory was inhabited in the  |Palaeolithic|Palaeolithic| . Other prehistoric discoveries include the  |Middle_Palaeolithic|Middle_Palaeolithic|  stone tools found near  |Bojnice|Bojnice| , and a  |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  discovery at a site near  |Gánovce|Gánovce| . The  |Gravettian|Gravettian|  culture was present principally in the river valleys of  |Nitra|Nitra_River| ,  |Hron|Hron| ,  |Ipeľ|Ipeľ| ,  |Váh|Váh|  and as far as the city of  |Žilina|Žilina| , and near the foot of the  |Vihorlat|Vihorlat| ,  |Inovec|Inovec| , and  |Tribeč|Tribeč|  mountains, as well as in the  |Myjava|Myjava|  Mountains. The best known artifact is the  |Venus_of_Moravany|Venus_Of_Moravany|  from  |Moravany_nad_Váhom|Moravany_Nad_Váhom| .      |Neolithic|Neolithic|  habitation was found in  |Želiezovce|Želiezovce| ,  |Gemer|Gemer| , and the Bukové hory massif, the  |Domica|Domica|  cave, and at  |Nitriansky_Hrádok|Nitriansky_Hrádok| .  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  was marked by the Čakany and  |Velatice|Velatice|  cultures, and then the  |Lusatian_culture|Lusatian_Culture| , followed by the Calenderberg culture and the  |Hallstatt_culture|Hallstatt_Culture| .             The  |Celts|Celts|  were the first population in the territory of present-day Slovakia who can be identified on the basis of written sources. The first Celtic groups came from the West around . Settlements of the  |La_Tène_culture|La_Tène_Culture|  indicate that the Celts colonized the lowlands along the river  |Danube|Danube|  and its tributaries. The local population was either subjected by the Celts or withdrew to the mountainous northern territory. New Celtic groups arrived from Northern Italy during the . The Celts initially lived in tiny huts in sizewhich either formed small villages or were scattered across the countryside.     Some of the small hill forts which were built in the  developed into important local economic and administrative centers. For example, the hill fort at Zemplín was a center of iron-working; glass works were unearthed at  |Liptovská_Mara|Liptovská_Mara| ; and local coins were struck at Bratislava and Liptovská Mara. Coins from Bratislava bore inscriptions like  |Biatec|Biatec|  and Nonnos. The fort at Liptovská Mara was also an important center of the cult of the bearers of the  |Púchov_culture|Púchov_Culture|  of the Northern Carpathians.      |Burebista|Burebista| , King of the  |Dacians|Dacians| , invaded the Middle Danube region and subjugated the majority of the local  |Celtic_tribes|Celtic_Tribes|   around . Burebistas empire collapsed after he died about 16 years later. Archaeological sites yielding painted ceramics and other artefacts of Dacian provenance suggest that Dacian groups settled among the local Celts in the region of the rivers  |Bodrog|Bodrog| ,  |Hron|Hron|  and  |Nitra|Nitra| . The spread of the Púchov culture , associated with the Celtic  |Cotini|Cotini| , shows that the bearers of that culture started a northward expansion during the same period.     The  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  and the  |Germanic_tribes|Germanic_Peoples|  launched their first invasions against the territories along the Middle Danube in the last decade of the . Roman legions crossed the Danube near Bratislava under the command of  |Tiberius|Tiberius|  to fight against the Germanic  |Quadi|Quadi|  in , but the local tribes rebellion in Pannonia forced the Romans to return. Taking advantage of internal strifes, the Romans settled a group of Quadi in the lowlands along the Danube between the rivers  |Morava|Morava|  and  |Váh|Váh|  in 21, making  |Vannius|Vannius|  their king. The Germans lived in rectangular houses, rather than square ones, and cremated their dead, placing the ashes in an urn.     Although the Danube formed the frontier between the Roman Empire and the  |Barbaricum|Barbaricum|  , the Romans built small outposts along the left bank of the Danube, for instance, at  |Iža|Iža|  and  |Devín|Devín| . During the same period, the Germanic tribes were expanding to the north along the rivers Hron,  |Ipeľ|Ipeľ|  and Nitra. Roman troops crossed the Danube several times during the  |Marcomannic_Wars|Marcomannic_Wars|  between 160 and 180. Emperor  |Marcus_Aurelius|Marcus_Aurelius|  accomplished the first chapter of his  Meditations  during a campaign against the Quadi in the region of the Hron River in 172. The  |Miracle_of_the_Rain|History_Of_Christianity_In_Slovakiaantiquity|  a storm which saved an exhausted Roman armyoccurred in the land north of the Danube in 173; Christian authors attributed it to a Christian soldiers prayer. Roman troops crossed the Danube for the last time in 374, during Emperor  |Valentinian_Is|Valentinian_I|  campaign against the Quadi who had allied with the  |Sarmatians|Sarmatians|  and invaded the Roman province of  |Pannonia|Pannonia| .                In the 4th century AD, the Roman Empire could no longer resist the attacks by the neighboring peoples. The empires frontier started to collapse along the Danube in the 370s. The development of the  |Hunnic_Empire|Hunsbefore_Attila|  in the  |Eurasian_Steppes|Eurasian_Steppes|  forced large groups of Germanic peoples, including the Quadi and the  |Vandals|Vandals| , to leave their homelands by the Middle Danube and along the upper course of the river  |Tisza|Tisza|  in the early . Their lands were occupied by the  |Heruli|Heruli| ,  |Scirii|Scirii| ,  |Rugii|Rugii|  and other Germanic peoples. However, the  |Carpathian_Basin|Carpathian_Basin|  was dominated by the nomadic  |Huns|Huns|  from the early  and the Germanic peoples became subjects to  |Attila_the_Hun|Attila_The_Hun| .     Disputes among Attilas sons caused the disintegration of his empire shortly after his death in 453. The Germanic peoples either regained their independence or left the Carpathian Basin . Warriors graves from the next century yielded large number of swords, spears, arrow heads, axes and other weapons. Other archaeological finds, including a glass  |beaker|Beaker|  from  |Zohor|Zohor| , shows that the local inhabitants had close contacts with the  |Frankish_Empire|Frankish_Empire|  and  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia| .               Regarding the early history of Slavs, Slavic texts or a record written by a Slav dating from before the late 9th century are not known. The foreign sources about Slavs are very inconsistent. According to a scholarly theory, the first Slavic groups settled in the eastern region of present-day Slovakia already in the . The 6th-century Byzantine historian  |Jordanes|Jordanes|  wrote that the funeral feast at Attilas burial was called strava. Scholars who identify that word as a  |Slavic|Slavic_Languages|  expression say that Jordanes report proves that Slavs inhabited the Carpathian Basin in the middle of the . However, according to a concurrent scholarly theory, strava may have been a  |Hunnic|Hunnic_Language|  term, because no primary source mentioned that the Slavs were present in Attilas court.     Settlements which represented a new  |archaeological_horizon|Archaeological_Horizon| the so-called  |Prague-Korchak_cultural_horizon|Prague-Korchak_Cultural_Horizon|  appeared along the northernmost fringes of the Carpathian Mountains around 500. Similar settlements, which are dated to the second half of the , were also excavated in the region of the confluence of the Danube and the Morava. Prague-Korchak settlements consisted of about 10 semi-sunken huts, each with a stone oven in a corner. The local inhabitants used handmade pottery and cremated the dead. Most historians associate the spread of the Prague-Korchak settlements with the expansion of the early Slavs.     According to historian Gabriel Fusek, written sources also evidence the presence of Slavs in the Central Europe in the first half of the . The 6th-century Byzantine historian,  |Procopius|Procopius| , wrote of a group of the Heruli who had passed through the territory of all of the  |Sclavenes|Sclavenes|  , or Slavs, during their migration towards the northern  |Thule|Thule|  . Procopiuss report implies that the Slavs inhabited the region of the river Morava, but its credibility is suspect. Procopius also wrote of an exiled  |Longobard|Longobard|  prince, Hildigis, who first fled to the Sclaveni and then to the  |Gepids|Gepids| , taking with him not only those of the Longobards who had followed him, but also many of the Sclaveni Procopius: History of the Wars , pp.  461–463. in the 540s. According to a scholarly theory, Hildigis most probably mustered his Slavic warriors in the region of the Middle Danube.     The Germanic Longobards were expanding towards the Middle Danube in the early . Archaeological research shows that Longobard expansion bypassed virtually the entire territory of Slovakia and they settled only in the most north-western part of the country . Unlike neighbouring Moravia, Slovakia  did not belong to any German empire in this time. The Longobards and the local Slavs remained separated by the natural border formed by  |Little|Little_Carpathians|  and  |White_Carpathians|White_Carpathians| , respected by both sides according to  |Ján_Steinhübel|Ján_Steinhübel| . He also writes that the Slavs, who remained an independent third party in strained Longobard-Gepid relations, were not interested in conflicts with their Germanic neighbours, but made raids in the faraway Byzantine Empire.             The Longobards left the Carpathian Basin for Northern Italy after the invasion of the territory by the  |Avars|Pannonian_Avars|  in 568. The Avars were a group of nomadic warriors of mixed origin. They conquered the Carpathian Basin, subjugated the local peoples and launched plundering expeditions against the neighboring powers during the next decades. By the time of the Avars arrival, the Slavs had settled in most lands that now form Slovakia, according to historian Stanislav Kirschbaum. Further migration waves strengthened the local Slavic population because new Slavic groups, pressed by the Avars, crossed the Eastern Carpathians, seceding from the Slavs who continued their expansion to the Balkan Peninsula. Dialects of the Slovak language still reflects that the Slavs came from different directions already in the Early Middle Ages, according to a widely accepted scholarly theory. The Czech and Slovak languages share some features with the  |South_Slavic_languages|South_Slavic_Languages| , distinguishing them from the other  |West_Slavic_languages|West_Slavic_Languages| . According to archaeologist P. M. Barford, these features suggest that the Carpathian Mountains and the  |Sudetes|Sudetes|  separated the ancestors of the  |Slovaks|Slovaks|  and the  |Czechs|Czechs|  from the Slavs living to the north of those mountains. Especially the dialects of Central Slovakia, which stand out from the continuous chain between the western and eastern dialects , preserved South Slavic features.     The 7th-century Frankish  Chronicle of Fredegar  wrote that the Avars employed the Slavs, or Wends, as  Befulci , showing that the Slavs formed special military units in the  |Avar_Khaganate|Avar_Khaganate| . According to the same chronicle, the Wends rose up in rebellion against their Avar masters and elected a Frankish merchant,  |Samo|Samo| , their king in the fortieth year of  |Clothars|Clothar_Ii|  reign , that is in 623 or 624. Modern historians agree that the Avars defeat during the  |siege_of_Constantinople_in_626|Siege_Of_Constantinople|  enabled Samo to consolidate his rule. He routed the invading army of  |Dagobert_I|Dagobert_I| ,  |King_of_the_Franks|King_Of_The_Franks| , in the  |Battle_of_Wogastisburg|Battle_Of_Wogastisburg|  in 631 or 632. The realm of Samo, who ruled for 35 years, collapsed soon after his death. Its exact borders cannot be determined, but it must have been located near the confluence of the Danube and the Morava rivers. Historian Richard Marsina puts its centre to  |Lower_Austria|Lower_Austria| .     A new horizon of mostly hand-made potterythe so-called Devínska Nová Ves pottery appeared between the Middle Danube and the Carpathians before the end of the . Large inhumation cemeteries yielding such pottery were unearthed at Bratislava,  |Holiare|Holiare| ,  |Nové_Zámky|Nové_Zámky|  and other places, suggesting that cemeteries were located near stable settlements. For instance, the cemetery at  |Devínska_Nová_Ves|Devínska_Nová_Ves| , which contained about a thousand inhumation graves and thirty cremations, was used up until the end of the .     In the 670s, the new population of the griffin and tendril  |archaeological_culture|Archaeology|  appeared in the Pannonian Basin expelling  |Kubers|Kuber| |Bulgars|Bulgars|  south out of  |Sirmium|Sirmium|  . Shortly afterwards the new Avar-Slav alliance could expand their territories even also over the  |Vienna_Basin|Vienna_Basin| . The political and cultural development in Slovakia continued in two separate lines. Lowland areas in the southern Slovakia got under the direct military control of the Avars. The Avars held strategic centers in  |Devín|Devín|  and  |Komárno|Komárno|  which belonged to the most important centers of the khaganate. The Avars from Devín controlled Moravia and from Komárno they controlled southern Slovakia. In this time, the Avars already began to adopt a more settled lifestyle. The new period introduced Slavo-Avaric symbiosis and multi-ethnic Slavo-Avaric culture. The Slavs in southern Slovakia adopted new burial rite , jewelry, fashion and used also common cemeteries with the Avars. Large Slavo-Avaric cemeteries can be found in  |Devínska_Nová_Ves|Devínska_Nová_Ves|  and  |Záhorská_Bystrica|Záhorská_Bystrica|  near  |Bratislava|Bratislava|  and similar cemeteries, the proof of direct Avar power, south of the line  |Devín|Devín| - |Nitra|Nitra| - |Levice|Levice| - |Želovce|Želovce| - |Košice|Košice| - |Šebastovce|Šebastovce| . North of this line, the Slavs preserved previous burial rite . Natural increase of the population together with immigration from the south led to the settlement also in mountain areas.     In the 8th century, the Slavs increased their agricultural productivity along with further development of crafts. Higher productivity initiated changes in the Slavic society, released a part of human resources previously required for farming and allowed to form groups of professional warriors. The Slavs began to build heavily fortified settlements  protected by strong walls and trenches . Among the oldest belong  |Pobedim|Pobedim| ,  |Nitra|Nitra| -Martinský Vrch,  |Majcichov|Majcichov| ,  |Spišské_Tomášovce|Spišské_Tomášovce|  and  |Divinka|Divinka| . The neighborhood with Avars raised unification process and probably also formation of local military alliances. The archaeological findings from this period  support the formation of a  |Slavic|Slavic_Peoples|  upper class on the territory that later became the nucleus of Great Moravia.      A series of  |Frankish|Franks| - |Avar|Avar_Khaganate|  wars led to the political fall of the  |khaganate|Khanate| .  In 805, the Slavs attacked again. Their offensive aimed mainly on the centers of Avar power -  |Devín|Devín|  and  |Komárno|Komárno| . The Avars were not able to resist attack and they were expelled to the right bank of  |Danube|Danube| . The Slavs from Slovakia probably participated also in further conflicts between small Slavic dukes and remaining Avar  |tarkhans|Tarkhan| .               The  Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum , written around 870, narrates that  |Moimir|Mojmir_I_Of_Moravia| , the leader of the  |Moravians|Great_Moravia| , expelled one  |Pribina|Pribina| , forcing him to cross the Danube and join  |Radbod|Radbod,_Prefect_Of_The_Ostmark| , who was the head of the  |March_of_Pannonia|March_Of_Pannonia|  in the  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire|  from around 830. Radbod presented Pribina to King  |Louis_the_German|Louis_The_German|  who ordered that Pribina be instructed in the Christian faith and baptised. Three of the eleven extant copies of the Conversio also contain an out of context statement which says that Adalram, who was  |Archbishop_of_Salzburg|Archbishop_Of_Salzburg|  between 821 and 836, had once consecrated a church on Pribinas estate at a place over the Danube called Nitrava . According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, Nitrava was identical with  |Nitra|Nitra|  in present-day Slovakia and the forced unification of Pribinas  |Principality_of_Nitra|Principality_Of_Nitra|  with Mojmirs Moravia gave rise to the development a new state  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia|  .     Between 800-832, a group of Slavic forthills in Slovakia quickly arose and disappeared. Archaeological research confirmed the fall of several important central forthills approximately around the time when Pribina was expelled, e.g.  |Pobedim|Pobedim|  or  |Čingov|Čingov| . The lack of written sources does not allow to finally conclude if these events were caused by internal changes or by Moravian expansion. Pribina could be a ruler of an independent unity   or in the case that Moravian expansion preceded his expulsion, he was a member of Moravian aristocracy.     Other historians write that  |Pribinas_Nitrava_cannot_be_identified_with_Nitra|Principality_Of_Nitraon_The_Location_Of_Pribina.27S_Nitrava| . Charles Bowlus says that a letter, written by  |Theotmar|Dietmar_I,_Archbishop_Of_Salzburg| ,  |Archbishop_of_Salzburg|Archbishop_Of_Salzburg|  and his  |suffragan_bishops|Suffragan_Bishop|  in about 900, strongly suggests that Nitra was only conquered by  |Svatopluk_I_of_Moravia|Svatopluk_I_Of_Moravia|  only in the 870s. However, according to Třeštík, this information can be explained as a reasonable mistake of the Frankish bishops who knew that the territory was in the past a separate regnum different from Moravia and because it was ruled by  |Svatopluk_I|Svatopluk_I_Of_Moravia| , they incorrectly assumed that he also conquered it. According to archaeologist Béla Miklós Szőke, no source substantiates either the theory that Pribina was the head of an independent polity or the identification of Nitrava with Nitra.      Richard Marsina writes that the Slovak nation emerged in that principality during Pribinas reign. Regarding the 9th century, the archaeological researches successfully established a distinction between 9th-century Slavic-Moravian and steppe burial horizons in Slovakia.                 Moravia emerged along the borders of the Avars territory. Great Moravia arose around 830 when  |Mojmír_I|Mojmir_I_Of_Moravia|  unified the Slavic tribes settled north of the Danube and extended the Moravian supremacy over them.  When Mojmír I endeavoured to secede from the supremacy of the king of  |East_Francia|East_Francia|  in 846, King  |Louis_the_German|Louis_The_German|  deposed him and assisted Mojmírs nephew,  |Rastislav|Rastislav_Of_Moravia|  in acquiring the throne.     The new monarch pursued an independent policy: after stopping a Frankish attack in 855, he also sought to weaken influence of Frankish priests preaching in his realm. Rastislav asked the  |Byzantine_Emperor|Byzantine_Empire| |Michael_III|Michael_Iii|  to send teachers who would interpret Christianity in the Slavic vernacular. Upon Rastislavs request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries  |Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius|Saints_Cyril_And_Methodius|  came in 863.  |Cyril|Saint_Cyril_The_Philosopher|  developed the  |first_Slavic_alphabet|Glagolitic_Alphabet|  and translated the Gospel into the  |Old_Church_Slavonic|Old_Church_Slavonic|  language. Rastislav was also preoccupied with the security and administration of his state. Numerous fortified castles built throughout the country are dated to his reign and some of them       are also mentioned in connection with Rastislav by Frankish chronicles. .     During Rastislavs reign, the Principality of Nitra was given to his nephew Svätopluk as an appanage. The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870. Similarly to his predecessor, Svätopluk I assumed the title of the king . During his reign, the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, when not only present-day Moravia and Slovakia but also present-day northern and central Hungary, Lower Austria, Bohemia, Silesia, Lusatia, southern Poland and northern Serbia belonged to the empire, but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors.  Svätopluk also withstood attacks of the seminomadic  |Hungarian|Hungarians|  tribes and the  |Bulgarian_Empire|First_Bulgarian_Empire| , although sometimes it was he who hired the Hungarians when waging war against East Francia.     In 880,  |Pope_John_VIII|Pope_John_Viii|  set up an independent ecclesiastical province in Great Moravia with Archbishop  |Methodius|Saint_Methodius_Of_Thessaloniki|  as its head. He also named the German cleric  |Wiching|Wiching|  the Bishop of  |Nitra|Nitra| .     After the death of King Svätopluk in 894, his sons  |Mojmír_II|Mojmir_Ii_Of_Moravia|  and  |Svatopluk_II|Svatopluk_Ii|  succeeded him as the King of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively. However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire. Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with Eastern Francia, Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories.     In the meantime, the Hungarian tribes, having suffered a defeat from the nomadic  |Pechenegs|Pechenegs| , left their territories east of the Carpathian Mountains, invaded the Pannonian Basin and started to occupy the territory gradually around 896. Their armies advance may have been promoted by continuous wars among the countries of the region whose rulers still hired them occasionally to intervene in their struggles.     Both Mojmír II and Svätopluk II probably died in battles with the Hungarians between 904 and 907 because their names are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In  |three_battles|Battle_Of_Bratislava|  near  |Brezalauspurc|Battle_Of_Pressburglocation|   , the Hungarians routed  |Bavaria|Bavaria| n armies. Historians traditionally put this year as the date of the breakup of the Great Moravian Empire.     Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The  |Glagolitic_script|Glagolitic_Script|  and its successor  |Cyrillic|Cyrillic|  were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their cultural development. The administrative system of Great Moravia may have influenced the development of the administration of the  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| . Kurhajcová, A. . The representation of great moravia and its fall in Hungarian/Magyar historiography during the period of dualism. Codrul Cosminului, 21, 169-188.                      From 895 to 902,  the  |Hungarians|Hungarians|  progressively imposed their authority on the  |Pannonian_Basin|Pannonian_Basin| . Although some contemporary sources mention that Great Moravia disappeared without trace and its inhabitants left, archaeological research and  |toponyms|Toponymy|  suggest the continuity of Slavic population in the river valleys of the  |Inner_Western_Carpathians|Carpathian_Mountains| .      The oldest Hungarian graves in Slovakia are dated to the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century . These findings document only a relatively short stay, without direct continuation in the settlement.  Further findings elewhere, in the most southern parts of Slovakia, are dated to 920-925 and consist mainly of graves of warrior type . Between 930-940, larger groups of Magyars began to migrate to the southern parts of todays Slovakia, but did not cross the line  |Bratislava|Bratislava| ,  |Hlohovec|Hlohovec| ,  |Nitra|Nitra| ,  |Levice|Levice| ,  |Lučenec|Lučenec| ,  |Rimavská_Sobota|Rimavská_Sobota| . The territory affected by this early migration covers about 15% of todays Slovakia . Hungarian settlements from these first two waves are not documented in the most fertile regions of  |Trnava_Board|Trnava_Board| ,  |Považie|Považie|  north of  |Hlohovec|Hlohovec| ,  |Ponitrie|Ponitrie|  north of  |Nitra|Nitra|  and the  |Eastern_Slovak_Lowland|Eastern_Slovak_Lowland| . The initial confrontation did not have a permanent character, and during the 10th century both populations coexisted. In southern Slovakia, the Hungarians frequently founded their villages close to the older Slavic settlements as they changed their nomadic lifestyle and settled; they occasionally joined them and used the same cemeteries.  In the 11th century, the differences between Slavic and Magyar graves disappeared. The archaeological research has also significantly changed the view on the settlement of the northern parts of the country.  In addition to the southern parts and river valleys of  |Nitra|Nitra|  and  |Váh|Váh| , a relative high population density is notable particularly for the  |Spiš|Spiš|  region with the  |Poprad_river|Poprad|  valley and the  |Turiec_Basin|Turiec_Basin| .  |Liptov|Liptov|  and the  |Zvolen_Basins|Zvolen_Basin| ,  |Žilina_Basin|Žilina_Basin| , Central  |Orava|Orava|  and northern  |Šariš|Šariš|  were rather sparsely populated.     After the fall of the state, some non-landholding noblemen joined the Hungarian forces and participated in their raids in other parts of Europe. The chroniclers of the early history of the Kingdom of Hungary recorded that the prominent noble families of the kingdom descended either from leaders of the Hungarian tribes or from immigrants, and they did not connect any of them to Great Moravia. Archeological evidence proves that to the north of the line mentioned above, not only did the older settlement structures survive, but so also did the territorial administration led by native magnates. The Great Moravian or potential Great Moravian origin of the clan  |Hunt-Pázmán|Hont-Pázmány|   has been advanced by some modern scholars.       The territory of the present-day Slovakia became progressively integrated into the developing state  in the early 10th century. The  Gesta Hungarorum  mentions that Huba, head of one of the seven Hungarian tribes, received possessions around  |Nitra|Nitra|  and the  |Žitava_River|Žitava_River| ; while according to the  Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum  another tribal leader,  |Lél|Lehel| , settled down around  |Hlohovec|Hlohovec|   and following the Hungarian victory over the Moravians, he usually stayed around Nitra. Modern authors also claim that the north-western parts of the Pannonian Basin were occupied by one of the Hungarian tribes.     Tercia pars regni or Principality of Nitra            The development of the future Kingdom of Hungary started during the reign of Grand Prince  |Géza|Géza,_Grand_Prince_Of_The_Hungarians|  who expanded his rule over the territories of present-day Slovakia west of the River  |Garam|Hron|  /  |Hron|Hron| . Although, he was baptised in or after 972, he never became a convinced Christian – in contrast to his son,  |Stephen|Stephen_I_Of_Hungary|  who followed him in 997. Some authors claim that following his marriage with  |Giselle_of_Bavaria|Giselle_Of_Bavaria| , Stephen received the Duchy of Nitra in appanage from his father.      When Géza died, a member of the Árpád dynasty, the pagan  |Koppány|Koppány|  claimed the succession, but Stephen defeated him with the assistance of his wifes German retinue. A Slovak folk song mentions that Štefan kral  could only overcome his pagan opponent with the assistance of Slovak warriors around  |Bíňa|Bíňa|  . According to István Bóna the Slovak song may be a translation of a Hungarian folk song, because in 1664, none of the inhabitants of Bíňa was Slovak. Following his victory, Stephen received a crown from  |Pope_Silvester_II|Pope_Silvester_Ii|  and he was crowned as the first  |King_of_Hungary|King_Of_Hungary|  in 1000 or 1001.     The Kingdom of Hungary integrated elements of the former Great Moravian state organization.  On the other hand, historians have not reached a consensus on this subject; e.g., it is still being debated whether the formation of the  |basic_unit_of_the_administration|County|   in the kingdom followed foreign patterns or it was an internal innovation.      |Stephen|Stephen_I_Of_Hungary|  established at least eight counties  on the territories of present-day Slovakia:  |Abov|Abov|  ,  |Boršod|Borsod|  ,  |Esztergom|Esztergom| ,  |Hont|Hont_County| ,  |Komárno|Komárno|  ,  |Nitra|Nitra|  ,  |Tekov|Bars_County|   and  |Zemplín|Zemplén_County|   were probably founded by him. The scarcely populated northern and north-eastern territories of today Slovakia became the kings private forests. King Stephen also set up several dioceses in his kingdom; in the 11th century, present-day Slovakias territories were divided between the  |Archdiocese_of_Esztergom|Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_Of_Esztergom-Budapest|  and its suffragan, the  |Diocese_of_Eger|Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_Of_Eger|  .     Around 1015, Duke  |Boleslaw_I_of_Poland|Boleslaw_I_Of_Poland|  took some territories of present-day Slovakia east of the River  |Morava|Morava| , with Hungarian King Stephen recapturing these territories in 1018.     Following King Stephens death, his kingdom got involved in internal conflicts among the claimants for his crown and  |Henry_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Henry_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  also intervened in the struggles. In 1042, the Emperor Henry captured some parts of today Slovakia east of the River Hron and granted them to King Stephens cousin,  |Béla|Béla_I_Of_Hungary| , but following the withdrawal of the Emperors armies, King  |Samuel_Abas|Samuel_Aba_Of_Hungary|  troops recaptured the territories.     In 1048, King  |Andrew_I_of_Hungary|Andrew_I_Of_Hungary|  conceded  |one-third_of_his_kingdom|Tercia_Pars_Regni|   in appanage to his brother, Duke Béla. The dukes domains were centered around  |Nitra|Nitra|  and  |Bihar|Bihar|  . During the following 60 years, the Tercia pars regni were governed separately by members of the Árpád dynasty . The dukes accepted the kings supremacy, but some of them rebelled against the king in order to acquire the crown and allied themselves with the rulers of the neighbouring countries .     The history of the Tercia pars regni ended in 1107, when King  |Coloman_of_Hungary|Coloman_Of_Hungary|  occupied its territories taking advantage of the pilgrimage of Duke Álmos to the Holy Land. Although, Duke Álmos, when returned to the kingdom, tried to reoccupy his former duchy with the military assistance of  |Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Henry_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , but he failed and was obliged to accept the  status quo .          In 1241, the  |Mongols|Mongols| |invaded_and_devastated|Mongol_Invasion_Of_Europe|  the north-western parts of the kingdom. In April 1241, the Mongolian army crossed the border with  |Moravia|Moravia|  near  |Hrozenkov|Starý_Hrozenkov| .  |Trenčín_Castle|Trenčín_Castle|  resisted the attack, but nearby places were plundered and some of them have never been restored. Mongols turned to the south and devastated regions along rivers  |Váh|Váh|  and  |Nitra|Nitra| . Only the strong castles, e.g.,  |Trenčín|Trenčín| ,  |Nitra|Nitra| ,  |Fiľakovo|Fiľakovo|   and fortified towns could resist attack. A part of the unprotected population escaped to the mountains and rough terrain where they built hill forts and camps. Most affected areas were the southwest Slovakia, Lower  |Pohronie|Pohronie|  to  |Zvolen|Zvolen|  and  |Zemplín|Zemplín| . It is estimated that at least a third of population died from famine and epidemics.     Following the withdrawal of the Mongol army,  |Frederick_II,_Duke_of_Austria|Frederick_Ii,_Duke_Of_Austria|  invaded the country. In July 1242 his army reached  |Hlohovec|Hlohovec|  but the Hungarian army, mainly thank to troops from Trenčín and Nitra counties repelled the attack.  |Bohumír|Bogomer_Ludány|  , the  |župa|Župa| n of Trenčín who played an important role in the suppression of Austrian units, later led the army send to help  |Bolesław_V_the_Chaste|Bolesław_V_The_Chaste|  attacked by Konrad I of Masovia. The army consisted mainly of soldiers from the ethnic Slovak counties.       The royal administration of the territory was developing gradually during the 11-13th centuries: new counties were established with the partition of existing ones or central counties of the kingdom expanded their territory northward todays  |Bratislava|Pozsony_County|  ,  |Trenčín|Trencsén_County| , Gemer-Malohont  and  |Novohrad|Nógrád|  , while the kings private forests were organised into forest counties around  |Zvolen|Zvolen|  and  |Šariš|Šariš|  Castle . Following the occupation of his brothers duchy, King Coloman set up the third bishopric in present-day Slovakia.     Some of the towns in present-day Slovakia were granted special privileges already prior to the Mongol invasion:  |Trnava|Trnava|  ,  |Starý_Tekov|Starý_Tekov|  ,  |Zvolen|Zvolen|  and  |Krupina|Krupina|  . Following the withdrawal of the Mongol troops , several castles were built or strengthened  on the order of King Béla IV. In addition to a relatively developed network of castles, agglomerations of an urban character became more important. Medieval towns should serve both to economic and defensive purposes.     The territory of present-day Slovakia was rich in raw materials like gold, silver, copper, iron and salt and therefore the mining industry developed gradually in the region. The development of the mining industry and commerce enstrengthened the position of some settlements and they received privileges from the kings.   The list of towns with the earliest charters contains  |Spišské_Vlachy|Spišské_Vlachy|  ,  |Košice|Košice|  ,  |Nitra|Nitra|  ,  |Banská_Štiavnica|Banská_Štiavnica|  ,  |Nemecká_Ľupča|Nemecká_Ľupča|  ,  |Komárno|Komárno|  ,  |Gelnica|Gelnica|  ,  |Bratislava|Bratislava|  and  |Prešov|Prešov| ,  |Veľký_Šariš|Veľký_Šariš|  and  |Sabinov|Sabinov|  . The  |Saxons|Saxons|  in  |Spiš|Spiš|   were granted a collective charter by King  |Stephen_V_of_Hungary|Stephen_V_Of_Hungary| .     The colonisation of the northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary continued during the period;  |Walloon|Walloons| ,  |German|Germans| ,  |Hungarian|Hungarians|  and  |Slavic|Slavs|  guests  arrived to the scarcely populated lands and settled down there. The contemporary documents mention that settlers from  |Moravia|Moravia|  and  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  arrived to the western parts of present-day Slovakia, while on the northern and eastern parts,  |Polish|Poles|  and  |Ruthenian|Ruthenians|  guests settled down.     German guests had an important but not exclusive role in the development of towns. Smaller groups of Germans were present already prior the Mongol invasion, but their immigration took a significant rate in the 13th-14th century. In that time, there already existed settlements with a relatively highly developed economy in the territory of present-day Slovakia, but Germans who came from economically and administrative more advanced regions introduced new forms of production and management, new legal system and culture. The German guests settled in Upper and Lower  |Spiš|Spiš| , mining towns in Central Slovakia, their wide surroundings and many localities in Western Slovakia:  |Bratislava|Bratislava| ,  |Trnava|Trnava|  and wine-growing towns in  |Malé_Karpaty|Malé_Karpaty| .     In the Middle Ages, present-day Slovakia belonged to the most urbanized regions of the Kingdom of Hungary and it was an important cultural and economic base. According to the decree of the King Vladislaus II Jagiello six of the ten most important towns in the kingdom were located in the present-day Slovakia:  |Košice|Košice| ,  |Bratislava|Bratislava| ,  |Bardejov|Bardejov| ,  |Prešov|Prešov| ,  |Trnava|Trnava|  and  |Levoča|Levoča| . In 1514, more than half of the royal towns and free mining towns of the kingdom were located in Slovakia. At the end of the Middle Ages, about two hundred other settlements had an urban character from a functional point of view. The first written mention prior 1500 is available for 2.476 settlements. The mining towns in Slovakia significantly contributed to the economy of the Kingdom of Hungary. Around the middle of the 14th century,  |Kremnica|Kremnica|  alone produced 400  kg of gold per year.  |Banská_Štiavnica|Banská_Štiavnica|  and  |Banská_Bystrica|Banská_Bystrica|  produced a substantial proportion of silver of the whole kingdom. During the second half of the 14th century, the Kingdom of Hungary produced cca 25% of Europes total output.     The towns formed unions and associations to defend their privileges and common interests. The most important unions were the Community of Saxons of Spiš  , the Lower Hungarian Mining Towns , Pentapolis and the Upper Hungarian Mining Towns .     The inhabitants of the privileged towns were mainly of German origin, followed by Slovaks and smaller number of Hungarians. Royal privileges prove that several families of the developing local nobility  were of Slavic origin. The presence of  |Jews|Jew|  in several towns  is also documented at least from the 13th century; the Jews special status was confirmed by a charter of King  |Béla_IV_of_Hungary|Béla_Iv_Of_Hungary|  in 1251, but decisions of local  |synods|Synods|  limited the participation of Jews . The  |Muslims|Böszörmény| , living in the region of  |Nitra|Nitra| , also faced similar limitations; they disappeared by the end of the 13th century.          The last decades of the 13th century were characterized by discords within the royal family and among the several groups of the aristocracy. The decay of the royal power and the rise of some powerful aristocrats gave rise to the transformation of the administrative system: the counties that had been the basic units of the royal administration  transformed gradually into autonomous administrative units of the local nobility ; however, the local nobility was not able to stop the rise of oligarchs.     Following the Mongol invasion of the kingdom, a competition started among the landowners: each of them endeavored to build a castle with or without the permission of the king. The competition started a process of differentiation among the noble families, because the nobles who were able to build a castle could also expand their influence over the neighbouring landowners. The conflicts among the members of the royal family also strengthened the power of the aristocrats and resulted in the formation of around eight huge territories in the kingdom, governed by powerful aristocrats in the 1290s.     In present-day Slovakia, most of the castles were owned by two powerful aristocrats  or their followers. Following the extinction of the Árpád dynasty , both of them pretended to follow one of the claimants for the throne, but, in practice, they governed their territories independently. Amade Aba governed the eastern parts of present-day Slovakia from his seat in  |Gönc|Gönc| . He was killed by Charles Robert of Anjous assassins at the south gate in  |Košice|Košice|  in 1311.     Matthew III Csák was the de facto ruler of the western territories of present-day Slovakia, from his seat at  |Trenčín|Trenčín| . He allied himself with the murdered Amade Abas sons against Košice, but King  |Charles_I_of_Hungary|Charles_I_Of_Hungary| , who had managed to acquire the throne against his opponents, gave military assistance to the town and the royal armies defeated him at the  |Battle_of_Rozgony_/_Rozhanovce|Battle_Of_Rozgony|  in 1312. However, the north-western counties remained in his power until his death in 1321 when the royal armies occupied his former castles without resistance.     Pressburg county was de facto ruled by the  |Dukes_of_Austria|List_Of_Rulers_Of_Austriadukes_Of_Austriahabsburg_Dukes_And_Archdukes_Of_Austria|  from 1301 to 1328 when King  |Charles_I_of_Hungary|Charles_I_Of_Hungary|  reoccupied it.       King Charles I strengthened the central power in the kingdom following a 20-year-long period of struggles against his opponents and the oligarchs. He concluded commercial  |agreements|Congress_Of_Visegrád|  with Kings  |John_of_Bohemia|John_Of_Bohemia|  and  |Casimir_III_of_Poland|Casimir_Iii_Of_Poland|  in 1335 which increased the trade on the commercial routes leading from Košice to  |Kraków|Kraków|  and from  |Žilina|Žilina|   to  |Brno|Brno| .     The king confirmed the privileges of the 24  |Saxon|Carpathian_Germans|  towns in Spiš, strengthened the special rights of  |Prešov|Prešov|  and granted town privileges to  |Smolník|Smolník,_Gelnica_District|   The towns of present-day Slovakia were still dominated by its German citizens. However, the  Privilegium pro Slavis , dated to 1381, attests notably to  |nation-building|Nation-Building|  in the wealthy towns: King  |Louis_I|Louis_I_Of_Hungary|  gave the Slavs half of the seats in the municipal council of Žilina. Many of the towns  received the status of  |free_royal_cities|Free_Royal_Cities|   and they were entitled to send deputies to the assemblies of the  |Estates_of_the_Kingdom|Estates_Of_The_Realm|  from 1441.     In the first half of the 14th century, the population of the regions of the former forest counties increased and their territories formed new counties such as Orava, Liptov,  |Turiec|Turiec| ,  |Zvolen|Zvolen|  in the northern parts of present-day Slovakia. In the region of Spiš, some elements of the population received special privileges: the 24 Saxon towns formed an autonomous community, independent of  |Spiš_county|Szepes_County| , and the nobles with ten lances were organised into a special autonomous administrative unit . In 1412, King  |Sigismund|Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  mortgaged 13 of the Saxon towns to King  |Władysław_II_of_Poland|Jogaila|  so they de facto belonged to Poland until 1769.     From the 1320s, most of the lands of present-day Slovakia were owned by the kings, but  |prelates|Prelate|  and aristocratic families  also hold properties on the territory.  In December 1385, the future King Sigismund, who was Queen Mary of Hungarys  |prince_consort|Prince_Consort|  at that time, mortgaged the territories of present-day Slovakia west of the Váh River to his cousins, the  |Jobst|Jobst_Of_Moravia|  and  |Prokop_of_Moravia|Prokop_Of_Moravia| ; and the former held his territories until 1389, while the latter could maintain his rule over some of the territories until 1405. King Sigismund granted vast territories to his followers  during his reign; one of his principal advisers, the Polish  |Stibor_of_Stiboricz|Stibor_Of_Stiboricz|  styled himself Lord of the whole Váh referring to his 15 castles around the river.     Following the death of King  |Albert|Albert_Ii_Of_Germany|  , civil war broke out among the followers of the claimants for the throne. The Dowager Queen  |Elisabeth|Elizabeth_Of_Luxembourg|  hired  |Czech|Czechs| |mercenaries|Mercenary|  led by  |Jan_Jiskra|Jan_Jiskra|  who captured several towns on the territory of present-day Slovakia  and maintained most of them until 1462 when he surrendered to King  |Matthias_Corvinus|Matthias_Corvinus_Of_Hungary| .                     The  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  conquered the central part of the Kingdom of Hungary, and set up several Ottoman provinces there .   Transylvania became an  |Ottoman_protectorate_vassal|Principality_Of_Transylvania|  and a base which gave birth to all the anti-Habsburg revolts led by the nobility of the Kingdom of Hungary during the period 1604 to 1711.   The remaining part of the former Kingdom of Hungary, which included much of present-day territory of Slovakia , northwestern present-day Hungary, northern Croatia and present-day Burgenland, resisted Ottoman conquest and subsequently became a province of the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy| . It remained to be known as the Kingdom of Hungary, but it is referred to by some modern historians as the  |Royal_Hungary|Royal_Hungary|  .        Ferdinand I, prince of Austria was elected king of Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. After the conquest of Buda in 1541 by the Ottomans, Pressburg  became, for the period between 1536 and 1784/1848 the capital and the coronation city of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.   From 1526 to 1830, nineteen Habsburg sovereigns went through coronation ceremonies as Kings and Queens of the Kingdom of Hungary in  |St._Martins_Cathedral|St._Martins_Concathedral| .     After the Ottoman invasion, the territories that had been administered by the Kingdom of Hungary became, for almost two centuries, the principal battleground of the  |Turkish_wars|Turkish_Wars| . The region suffered due to the wars against the Ottoman expansion. A lot of loss of life and property occurred during the wars and the region also practically lost all of its natural riches, especially gold and silver, which went to pay for the costly and difficult combats of an endemic war. In addition, the  |double_taxation|Double_Taxation|  of some areas was a common practice, which further worsened the living standards of the declining population of local settlements.     During Ottoman administration, parts of the territory of present-day Slovakia were included into Ottoman provinces known as the  |Budin_Eyalet|Budin_Eyalet| ,  |Eğri_Eyalet|Eğri_Eyalet|  and  |Uyvar_Eyalet|Uyvar_Eyalet| . Uyvar Eyalet had its administrative center in the territory of present-day Slovakia, in the town of  |Uyvar|Nové_Zámky|  . In the second half of the 17th century, Ottoman authority was expanded to eastern part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, where a vassal Ottoman principality led by prince  |Imre_Thököly|Imre_Thököly|  was established.     After the ousting of the Ottomans from Budin  in 1686, it became the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. Despite living under Hungarian, Habsburg and Ottoman administration for several centuries, the Slovak people succeeded in keeping their language and their culture.           During the 18th century the Slovak National Movement emerged, partially inspired by the broader  |Pan-Slavic_movement|Pan-Slavism|  with the aim of fostering a sense of national identity among the Slovak people.  Sándor Kostya: Pan-Slavism  Jelena Milojkovic-Djuric: Panslavism and National Identity in the Balkans, 1830–1880  Advanced mainly by Slovak religious leaders, the movement grew during the 19th century. At the same time, the movement was divided along the confessional lines and various groups had different views on everything from quotidian strategy to linguistics. Moreover, the Hungarian control remained strict after 1867 and the movement was constrained by the official policy of  |magyarization|Magyarization| .     The first codification of a Slovak  |literary_language|Literary_Language|  by  |Anton_Bernolák|Anton_Bernolák|  in the 1780s was based on the dialect from western Slovakia. It was supported by mainly  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholicism|  intellectuals, with the center in  |Trnava|Trnava| . The Lutheran intellectuals continued to use a Slovakized form of the Czech language. Especially  |Ján_Kollár|Ján_Kollár|  and  |Pavel_Jozef_Šafárik|Pavel_Jozef_Šafárik|  were adherents of Pan-Slavic concepts that stressed the unity of all  |Slavic_peoples|Slavic_People| . They considered  |Czechs|Czechs|  and  |Slovaks|Slovaks|  members of a single nation and they attempted to draw the languages closer together.     In the 1840s, the Protestants split as  |Ľudovít_Štúr|Ľudovít_Štúr|  developed a literal language based on the dialect from central Slovakia. His followers stressed the separate identity of the Slovak nation and uniqueness of its language. Štúrs version was finally approved by both the Catholics and the Lutherans in 1847 and, after several reforms, it remains the official  |Slovak_language|Slovak_Language| .            In the  |Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848|Hungarian_Revolution_Of_1848| , Slovak nationalist leaders took the side of the Austrians in order to promote their separation from the Kingdom of Hungary within the Austrian monarchy. The  |Slovak_National_Council|Slovak_National_Council|  even took part in the Austrian military campaign by setting up auxiliary troops against the rebel government of the  |Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848|Hungarian_Revolution_Of_1848| . In September, 1848, it managed to organize a short-lived administration of the captured territories. However, the Slovak troops were later disbanded by the Vienna Imperial Court. On the other hand, tens of thousands of volunteers from the current territory of Slovakia, among them a great number of Slovaks, fought in the Hungarian Army.     After the defeat of the Hungarian Revolution, the Hungarian political elite was oppressed by the Austrian authorities and many participants of the Revolution were executed, imprisoned, or forced to emigrate. In 1850, the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into five military districts or provinces, two of which had administrative centers in the territory of present-day Slovakia: the Military District of Pressburg and the Military District of Košice.     The Austrian authorities abolished both provinces in 1860. The Slovak political elite made use of the period of  |neo-absolutism|Neo-Absolutism|  of the Vienna court and the weakness of the traditional Hungarian elite to promote their national goals. Turz-Sankt Martin  became the foremost center of the Slovak National Movement with foundation of the nationwide cultural association  |Matica_slovenská|Matica_Slovenská|  , the  |Slovak_National_Museum|Slovak_National_Museum| , and the  |Slovak_National_Party|Slovak_National_Party|  .       The heyday of the movement came to the sudden end after 1867, when the  |Habsburg|Habsburg|  domains in central Europe underwent a  |constitutional_transformation|Ausgleich|  into the dual monarchy of  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary|  as a result of the  |Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867|Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_Of_1867| . The territory of present-day Slovakia was included into the Hungarian part of dual Monarchy dominated by the Hungarian political elite which distrusted the Slovak elite due to its Pan-Slavism, separatism and its recent stand against the  |Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848|Hungarian_Revolution_Of_1848| . Matica was accused of Pan-Slavic separatism and was dissolved by the authorities in 1875 and other Slovak institutions shared the same fate.     New signs of national and political life appeared only at the very end of the 19th century. Slovaks became aware that they needed to ally themselves with others in their struggle. One result of this awareness, the Congress of Oppressed Peoples of the Kingdom of Hungary, held in Budapest in 1895, alarmed the government. In their struggle Slovaks received a great deal of help from the Czechs. In 1896, the concept of Czecho-Slovak Mutuality was established in Prague to strengthen Czecho-Slovak cooperation and support the secession of Slovaks from the Kingdom of Hungary.     At the beginning of the 20th century, growing democratization of political and social life threatened to overwhelm the monarchy. The call for  |universal_suffrage|Universal_Suffrage|  became the main rallying cry. In the Kingdom of Hungary, only 5 percent of inhabitants could vote. Slovaks saw in the trend towards representative democracy a possibility of easing ethnic oppression and a break-through into renewed political activity.     The Slovak political camp, at the beginning of the century, split into different factions. The leaders of the Slovak National Party based in Martin, expected the international situation to change in the Slovaks favor, and they put great store by Russia. The Roman Catholic faction of Slovak politicians led by Father  |Andrej_Hlinka|Andrej_Hlinka|  focused on small undertakings among the Slovak public and, shortly before the war, established a political party named the  |Slovak_Peoples_Party|Slovak_Peoples_Party| . The liberal  |intelligentsia|Intelligentsia|  rallying around the journal Hlas , followed a similar political path, but attached more importance to Czecho-Slovak cooperation. An independent  |Social_Democratic_Party|Slovak_Social_Democratic_Party_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  emerged in 1905.          The Slovaks achieved some results. One of the greatest of these occurred with the election success in 1906, when, despite continued oppression, seven Slovaks managed to get seats in the Assembly. This success alarmed the government, and increased what was regarded by Slovaks as its oppressive measures.  |Magyarization|Magyarization|  achieved its climax with a new education act known as the Apponyi Act, named after education minister Count  |Albert_Apponyi|Albert_Apponyi| . The new act stipulated that the teaching of the Hungarian language, as one of the subjects, must be included in the curriculum of non-state owned four years elementary schools in the frame-work of the compulsory schooling, as a condition for the non-state owned schools to receive state-financing. Non-government organizations such as the  |Upper_Hungary_Magyar_Educational_Society|Upper_Hungary_Magyar_Educational_Society|  supported Magyarization at a local level.     Ethnic tension intensified when 15 Slovaks were killed during a riot on occasion of the consecration of a new church at Černová / Csernova near  |Rózsahegy|Rózsahegy|  /  |Ružomberok|Ružomberok|  . The local inhabitants wanted the popular priest and nationalist politician Andrej Hlinka to consecrate their new church. Hlinka contributed significantly to the construction of the church, but his bishop  |Alexander_Párvy|Alexander_Párvy|  suspended him from his office and from exercising all clerical functions because of Hlinkas involvement in the national movement. This raised a wave of solidarity with Hlinka from across all todays Slovakia. The villagers tried to achieve a compromise solution and to cancel the suspensions or to postpone consecration until the  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  decides about the Hlinkas case. Párvy refused to consent and appointed ethnic Slovak dean Martin Pazúrik for the task. Pazúrik, as well as Hlinka, was active in the election campaign but supported Hungarian and Magyarone politicians and continuously adopted anti-Slovak attitude.  The church had to be consecrated by force with the police assistance. Given where the event occurred, all 15 local gendarmes who participated in the subsequent tragedy had Slovak origin. In the stress situation, the gendarmes shot dead 15 protesters among a crowd of app. 300–400 villagers who tried to avoid the priests convoy to enter their village.  All this added to Slovak estrangement from and resistance to Hungarian rule, and the incident raised international attention on violation of national rights of non-Hungarian minorities.     Before the outbreak of World War I, the idea of Slovak autonomy became part of  |Archduke_Franz_Ferdinands|Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_Of_Austria|  plan of federalization of the monarchy, developed with help of the Slovak journalist and politician  |Milan_Hodža|Milan_Hodža| . This last realistic attempt to tie Slovakia to Austria-Hungary was abandoned because of the  |Archdukes_assassination|Assassination_Of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand| , which in turn triggered World War I.              After the outbreak of  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  the Slovak cause took firmer shape in resistance and in determination to leave the  |Dual_Monarchy|Dual_Monarchy|  and to form an independent republic with the Czechs. The decision originated amongst people of Slovak descent in foreign countries. Slovaks in the United States of America, an especially numerous group, formed a sizable organization. These, and other organizations in Russia and in neutral countries, backed the idea of a Czecho-Slovak republic. Slovaks strongly supported this move.     The most important Slovak representative at this time,  |Milan_Rastislav_Štefánik|Milan_Rastislav_Štefánik| , a French citizen of Slovak origin, served as a French general and as leading representative of the Czecho-Slovak National Council based in Paris. He made a decisive contribution to the success of the Czecho-Slovak cause. Political representatives at home, including representatives of all political persuasions, after some hesitation, gave their support to the activities of  |Masaryk|Tomáš_Masaryk| ,  |Beneš|Edvard_Beneš|  and Štefánik.     During the war the Hungarian authorities increased harassment of Slovaks, which hindered the nationalist campaign among the inhabitants of the Slovak lands. Despite stringent censorship, news of moves abroad towards the establishment of a Czech-Slovak state got through to Slovakia and met with much satisfaction.     During  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  Czechs, Slovaks, and other national groups of Austria-Hungary gained much support from Czechs and Slovaks living abroad in campaigning for an independent state. In the turbulent final year of the war, sporadic protest actions took place in Slovakia; politicians held a secret meeting at  |Liptószentmiklós|Liptószentmiklós|  /  |Liptovský_Mikuláš|Liptovský_Mikuláš|  on 1 May 1918.      |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  on 28 October, and, two days later, the  |Slovak_National_Council|Slovak_National_Council|  at  |Martin|Martin,_Slovakia|  acceded to the Prague proclamation. The new republic was to include the Czech lands , a small part of  |Silesia|Silesia| , Slovakia, and  |Subcarpathian_Ruthenia|Subcarpathian_Ruthenia| . The new state set up a parliamentary democratic government and established a capital in the Czech city of  |Prague|Prague| .     As a result of the counter-attack of the  |Hungarian_Red_Army|Hungarian_Red_Army|  in May–June, 1919, Czech troops were ousted from central and eastern parts of present Slovakia, where a puppet short-lived  |Slovak_Soviet_Republic|Slovak_Soviet_Republic|  with its capital in  |Prešov|Prešov|  was established. However, the Hungarian army stopped its offensive and later the troops were withdrawn on the Ententes diplomatic intervention.  Ignác Romsics: Magyarország története a XX. században, 2004, p. 134      In the  |Treaty_of_Trianon|Treaty_Of_Trianon|  signed in 1920, the  |Paris_Peace_Conference|Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919|  set the southern border of Czechoslovakia further south from the Slovak-Hungarian language border due to strategic and economic reasons. Consequently, some fully or mostly Hungarian-populated areas were also included into Czechoslovakia. According to the 1910 census, which had been manipulated by the ruling Hungarian bureaucracy,  population of the present territory of Slovakia numbered 2,914,143 people, including 1,688,413 speakers of  |Slovak_language|Slovak_Language| , 881,320 speakers of  |Hungarian_language|Hungarian_Language| , 198,405 speakers of German language, 103,387 speakers of  |Ruthenian|Rusyn_Language|  and 42,618 speakers of other languages.     In addition, in  |Subcarpathian_Ruthenia|Subcarpathian_Ruthenia| , which was also included into Czechoslovakia in this time period, the 1910 manipulated Hungarian census recorded 605,942 people, including 330,010 speakers of  |Ruthenian|Rusyn_Language| , 185,433 speakers of  |Hungarian_language|Hungarian_Language| , 64,257 speakers of German language, 11,668 speakers of  |Romanian_language|Romanian_Language| , 6,346 speakers of  |Slovak|Slovak_Language| / |Czech_language|Czech_Language| , and 8,228 speakers of other languages. The Czechoslovak census of 1930 recorded in Slovakia 3,254,189 people, including 2,224,983  |Slovaks|Slovaks| , 585,434  |Hungarians|Hungarians| , 154,821  |Germans|Germans| , 120,926  |Czechs|Czechs| , 95,359  |Rusyns|Rusyns|  and 72,666 others.        Slovaks, whom the Czechs outnumbered in the Czechoslovak state, differed in many important ways from their Czech neighbors. Slovakia had a more agrarian and less developed economy than the Czech lands, and the majority of Slovaks practised Catholicism while fewer Czechs adhered to established religions. The Slovak people had generally less education and less experience with self-government than the Czechs. These disparities, compounded by centralized governmental control from Prague, produced discontent with the structure of the new state among the Slovaks.     Although Czechoslovakia, alone among the east-central European countries, remained a  |parliamentary_democracy|Parliamentary_Democracy|  from 1918 to 1938, it continued to face minority problems, the most important of which concerned the countrys large German population. A significant part of the new Slovak political establishment sought autonomy for Slovakia. The movement toward autonomy built up gradually from the 1920s until it culminated in independence in 1939.      In the period between the two world wars, the Czechoslovak government attempted to industrialize Slovakia. These efforts did not meet with success, partially due to the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , the worldwide economic slump of the 1930s. Slovak resentment over perceived economic and political domination by the Czechs led to increasing dissatisfaction with the republic and growing support for ideas of independence. Many Slovaks joined with Father  |Andrej_Hlinka|Andrej_Hlinka|  and  |Jozef_Tiso|Jozef_Tiso|  in calls for equality between Czechs and Slovaks and for greater autonomy for Slovakia.          In September 1938, France, Italy, United Kingdom and  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  concluded the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement| , which forced Czechoslovakia to cede the predominantly German region known as the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|  to Germany. In November, by the  |First_Vienna_Award|First_Vienna_Award| , Italy and Germany compelled Czechoslovakia to cede primarily Hungarian-inhabited Southern Slovakia to Hungary. They did this in spite of pro-German official declarations of Czech and Slovak leaders made in October.     On 14 March 1939, the  |Slovak_Republic|Slovak_Republic|   declared its independence and became a nominally independent state in Central Europe under  |Nazi_German|Nazi_Germany|  control of foreign policy and, increasingly, also some aspects of domestic policy.  |Jozef_Tiso|Jozef_Tiso|  became Prime Minister and later President of the new state.     On 15 March, Nazi Germany invaded what remained of  |Bohemia|Bohemia| ,  |Moravia|Moravia| , and  |Silesia|Silesia|  after the Munich agreement. The Germans established a protectorate over them which was known as the  |Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia|Protectorate_Of_Bohemia_And_Moravia| . On the same day,  |Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpatho-Ukraine|  declared its independence. But Hungary immediately invaded and annexed the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine. On 23 March, Hungary then occupied some additional disputed parts of territory of the present-day Eastern-Slovakia. This caused the brief  |Slovak-Hungarian_War|Slovak-Hungarian_War| .               The nominally independent  |Slovak_Republic|Slovak_Republic|  went through the early years of the war in relative peace. As an  |Axis|Axis_Powers|  ally, the country took part in the  |wars_against_Poland|Slovak_Invasion_Of_Poland|  and the Soviet Union. Although its contribution was symbolic in the German war efforts, the number of troops involved was rather significant in proportion to the population .     Soon after independence, under the authoritarian government of Jozef Tiso, a series of measures aimed against the 90,000 Jews in the country were initiated. The  |Hlinka_Guard|Hlinka_Guard|  began to attack Jews, and the  |Jewish_Code|Jewish_Code|  was passed in September 1941. Resembling the Nuremberg Laws, the Code required that Jews wear a yellow armband, and were banned from intermarriage and many jobs. More than 64.000 Jews lost their livelihood. Between March and October 1942, the state deported approximately 57,000 Jews to the German-occupied part of Poland, where almost all of them were killed in  |Extermination_camps|Extermination_Camp| . The Slovak Parliament accepted a bill that retroactively legalized the deportation in May 1942. The deportation of the remaining Jewish population was stopped when the government resolved social problem caused by its own policy. However, 12,600 more Jews were deported by the German forces occupying Slovakia after the  |Slovak_National_Uprising|Slovak_National_Uprising|  in 1944. Around a half of them were killed in concentration camps. , . Other Jews were rounded up and massacred in the country by Slovak collaborators under German command, at  |Kremnička_and_Nemecká|Kremnička_And_Nemecká_Massacres| .  Some 10,000 Slovak Jews survived in Slovakia.     On 29 August 1944, 60,000 Slovak troops and 18,000 partisans, organized by various underground groups and the  |Czechoslovak_government-in-exile|Czechoslovak_Government-In-Exile| , rose up against the Nazis. The insurrection later became known as the  |Slovak_National_Uprising|Slovak_National_Uprising| . Slovakia was devastated by the fierce German counter-offensive and occupation, but the guerrilla warfare continued even after the end of organized resistance. Although ultimately quelled by the German forces, the uprising was an important historical reference point for the Slovak people. It allowed them to end the war as a nation which had contributed to the Allied victory.     Later in 1944 the Soviet attacks intensified. Hence the  |Red_Army|Red_Army| , helped by Romanian troops, gradually routed out the German army from Slovak territory. On 4 April 1945, Soviet troops marched into the capital city of the Slovak Republic, Bratislava.            The victorious Powers restored Czechoslovakia in 1945 in the wake of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , albeit without  |Carpathian_Ruthenia|Carpathian_Ruthenia| , which Prague ceded to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . The  |Beneš_decrees|Beneš_Decrees| , adopted as a result of the events of the war, led to disenfranchisement and persecution of the Hungarian minority in southern Slovakia. The local  |German_minority|Carpathian_Germans|  was  |expelled|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans| , with only the population of some villages such as  |Chmeľnica|Chmeľnica|  evading expulsion but suffering discrimination against use of their language.      The Czechs and Slovaks held elections in 1946. In Slovakia, the Democratic Party won the elections , but the  |Czechoslovak_Communist_Party|Czechoslovak_Communist_Party|  won in the Czech part of the republic, thus winning 38% of the total vote in Czechoslovakia, and eventually seized power in February 1948, making the country effectively a  |satellite_state|Satellite_State|  of the Soviet Union.     Strict  |Communist|Communist|  control characterized the next four decades, interrupted only briefly in the so-called  |Prague_Spring|Prague_Spring|  of 1968 after  |Alexander_Dubček|Alexander_Dubček|  became First Secretary of the Central Committee of the  |Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|Communist_Party_Of_Czechoslovakia| . Dubček proposed political, social, and economic reforms in his effort to make  |socialism_with_a_human_face|Socialism_With_A_Human_Face|  a reality. Concern among other  |Warsaw_Pact|Warsaw_Pact|  governments that Dubček had gone too far led to the invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968, by Soviet, Hungarian, Bulgarian, East German, and Polish troops. Another Slovak,  |Gustáv_Husák|Gustáv_Husák| , replaced Dubček as Communist Party leader in April 1969.        The 1970s and 1980s became known as the period of  |normalization|Normalization|  , in which the apologists for the 1968 Soviet invasion prevented as best they could any opposition to their conservative régime. Political, social, and economic life stagnated. Because the reform movement had had its center in Prague, Slovakia experienced normalization less harshly than the Czech lands. In fact, the Slovak Republic saw comparatively high economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s relative to the Czech Republic .     The 1970s also saw the development of a dissident movement, especially in the Czech Republic. On 1 January 1977, more than 250  |human_rights|Human_Rights|  activists signed a manifesto called  |Charter_77|Charter_77| , which criticized the Czechoslovak government for failing to meet its human rights obligations.         On 17 November 1989, a series of public protests known as the  |Velvet_Revolution|Velvet_Revolution|  began and led to the downfall of Communist Party rule in Czechoslovakia. A transition government formed in December 1989, and the first free elections in Czechoslovakia since 1948 took place in June 1990. In 1992, negotiations on the new federal constitution deadlocked over the issue of Slovak autonomy. In the latter half of 1992, agreement emerged to dissolve Czechoslovakia peacefully. On 1 January 1993, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic each simultaneously and peacefully proclaimed their existence. Both states attained immediate recognition from the United States of America and from their European neighbors.     In the days following the Velvet Revolution, Charter 77 and other groups united to become the  |Civic_Forum|Civic_Forum| , an umbrella group championing bureaucratic reform and  |civil_liberties|Civil_Liberties| . Its leader, the playwright and former dissident  |Václav_Havel|Václav_Havel|  won election as President of Czechoslovakia in December 1989. The Slovak counterpart of the Civic Forum,  |Public_Against_Violence|Public_Against_Violence| , expressed the same ideals.     In the June 1990 elections, Civic Forum and Public Against Violence won landslide victories. Civic Forum and Public Against Violence found, however, that although they had successfully completed their primary objective — the overthrow of the communist régime — they proved less effective as governing parties. In the 1992 elections, a spectrum of new parties replaced both Civic Forum and Public Against Violence.              In an  |election_held_in_June_1992|Slovak_Parliamentary_Election,_1992| ,  |Václav_Klauss|Václav_Klaus|  Civic Democratic Party won in the Czech lands on a platform of economic reform, and  |Vladimír_Mečiars|Vladimír_Mečiar| |Movement_for_a_Democratic_Slovakia|Movement_For_A_Democratic_Slovakia|  emerged as the leading party in Slovakia, basing its appeal on the fairness of Slovak demands for autonomy. Mečiar and Klaus negotiated the  |agreement_to_divide_Czechoslovakia|Dissolution_Of_Czechoslovakia| , and Mečiars party — HZDS — ruled Slovakia for most of its first five years as an independent state, except for a 9-month period in 1994 after a vote of no-confidence, during which a reformist government under Prime Minister  |Jozef_Moravčík|Jozef_Moravčík|  operated.     The first president of newly independent Slovakia,  |Michal_Kováč|Michal_Kováč| , promised to make Slovakia the Switzerland of Eastern Europe . The first prime minister, Mečiar, had served as the prime minister of the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia since 1992.      |Rudolf_Schuster|Rudolf_Schuster|  won  |the_presidential_election_in_May_1999|Slovak_Presidential_Election,_1999| . Mečiars semi-authoritarian government allegedly breached democratic norms and the  |rule_of_law|Rule_Of_Law|  before its replacement after the parliamentary elections of 1998 by a coalition led by  |Mikuláš_Dzurinda|Mikuláš_Dzurinda| .     The first Dzurinda government made numerous political and economic reforms that enabled Slovakia to enter the  |Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development|Organisation_For_Economic_Co-Operation_And_Development|  , close virtually all chapters in  |European_Union|European_Union|  negotiations, and make itself a strong candidate for accession to  |North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|  . However, the popularity of the governing parties declined sharply, and several new parties that earned relatively high levels of support in public opinion polls appeared on the political scene. Mečiar remained the leader of the HZDS, which continued to receive the support of 20% or more of the population during the first Dzurinda government.     In the September 2002 parliamentary election, a last-minute surge in support for Prime Minister Dzurindas  |Slovak_Democratic_and_Christian_Union|Slovak_Democratic_And_Christian_Union|  gave him a mandate for a second term. He formed a government with three other center-right parties: the  |Party_of_the_Hungarian_Coalition|Party_Of_The_Hungarian_Coalition|  , the  |Christian_Democrats|Christian_Democratic_Movement|  and the  |Alliance_of_the_New_Citizen|Alliance_Of_The_New_Citizen|  . The coalition won a narrow majority in the parliament.  |Dzurindas_Second_Cabinet|Dzurindas_Second_Cabinet|  announced strong NATO and EU integration and stated to continue the democratic and free market-oriented reforms begun by the first Dzurinda government.     The new coalition had as its main priorities—gaining of NATO and EU invitations, attracting foreign investment, and reforming social services such as the health-care system. Vladimír Mečiars Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, which received about 27% of the vote in 1998 received only 19.5% in 2002 and again went into opposition, unable to find coalition partners. The opposition comprised the HZDS,  |Smer|Direction_–_Social_Democracy|  , and the  |Communists|Communist_Party_Of_Slovakia| , who obtained about 6% of the popular vote.     Initially, Slovakia experienced more difficulty than the Czech Republic in developing a modern  |market_economy|Market_Economy| . Slovakia  |joined_NATO_on_29_March_2004|Enlargement_Of_Nato|  and  |the_EU_on_1_May_2004|2004_Enlargement_Of_The_European_Union| . Slovakia was, on 10 October 2005, for the first time elected to a two-year term on the  |UN_Security_Council|Un_Security_Council|  .     The next election took place on 17 June 2006, where leftist Smer got 29.14% of the popular vote and formed coalition with Slotas  |Slovak_National_Party|Slovak_National_Party|  and Mečiars Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Their opposition comprised the former ruling parties: the SDKÚ, the SMK and the KDH.        The  |election_in_June_2010|Slovak_Parliamentary_Election,_2010|  was won by Smer with 34.8% but Fico wasnt able to form a government, so a coalition of SDKU, KDH, SaS and Most-Hid took over, with as first women Prime Minister. This government fell after the vote of the European Financial Stability Fund was connected with a no confidence vote, as SaS argued, that Slovakia, shouldnt bail out much richer countries.     Smer won the  |election_in_2012|Slovak_Parliamentary_Election,_2012|  with 44,42%.   Fico formed  |his_Second_Cabinet|Ficos_Second_Cabinet| . It was a single party government claiming 83 out of the 150 seats.   It officially supported the position of the EU during the  |Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine|Russian_Military_Intervention_In_Ukraine|  but sometimes doubted the efficiency of EU sanctions against Russia. In autumn 2015, during the  |European_migrant_crisis|European_Migrant_Crisis| , the leaders of the four  |Visegrád_Group|Visegrád_Group|  states rejected EUs proposal to reallocate 120.000 refugees.   The  |election_2016|Slovak_Parliamentary_Election,_2016|  took place in March 2016; somde days later Fico formed his  |Third_Cabinet|Ficos_Third_Cabinet| , composed of four parties.     Slovakias Prime Minister  |Robert_Fico|Robert_Fico|  has resigned in March 2018 following the largest street protests in decades over the  |murder_of_Ján_Kuciak|Murder_Of_Ján_Kuciak| , an investigative journalist who was investigating high-level political corruption linked to the organized crime. .
