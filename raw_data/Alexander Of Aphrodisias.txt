Alexander of Aphrodisias  was a  |Peripatetic|Peripatetic_School|  philosopher and the most celebrated of the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek| |commentators|Commentaries_On_Aristotle|  on the writings of  |Aristotle|Aristotle| . He was a native of  |Aphrodisias|Aphrodisias|  in  |Caria|Caria| , and lived and taught in  |Athens|Athens|  at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the  |Peripatetic_school|Peripatetic_School| . He wrote many commentaries on the works of  |Aristotle|Aristotle| , extant are those on the  Prior Analytics ,  Topics ,  Meteorology ,  Sense and Sensibilia , and  Metaphysics . Several original treatises also survive, and include a work On Fate, in which he argues against the  |Stoic|Stoicism|  doctrine of necessity; and one On the Soul. His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, the commentator .       Alexander was a native of  |Aphrodisias|Aphrodisias|  in  |Caria|Caria|   A. Chaniotis, Epigraphic evidence for the philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias, in Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, , v.47 pp. 79-81 and came to  |Athens|Athens|  towards the end of the 2nd century. He was a student of the two  |Stoic|Stoicism| , J.P. Lynch, Aristotles School, Berkeley, 1972, p. 215.

Pierre Thillet, in his 1984  |Budé|Collection_Budé|  edition of On Fate, has argued against Morauxs identification  of Aristotle of Mytilene as Alexanders teacher, pointing out that the text that has been taken to mean this  could refer instead to Alexanders learning from the texts of Aristotle the Stagirite. See R.W. Sharples, , Classical Review, n.s., 36 , p. 33.  |Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria| , Against Julian 2.38, may name  |Aristocles_of_Messene|Aristocles_Of_Messene| , but the text edited by Burguière and Évieux  reads . At Athens he became head of the  |Peripatetic_school|Peripatetic_School|  and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy. Alexanders dedication of On Fate to  |Septimius_Severus|Septimius_Severus|  and  |Caracalla|Caracalla| , in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209. A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as Titus Aurelius Alexander. His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor  |Antoninus_Pius|Antoninus_Pius| , while proconsul of Asia. The inscription honours his father, also called Alexander and also a philosopher. This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of Alexanders corpus should be ascribed to his father. R. Sharples, Implications of the new Alexander of Aphrodisias inscription, in Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies  48 pp. 47-56.             Alexander composed several  |commentaries_on_the_works_of_Aristotle|Commentaries_On_Aristotle| , in which he sought to escape a  |syncretistic|Syncretism|  tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of Aristotle.  His extant commentaries are on  Prior Analytics  ,  Topics ,  Meteorology ,  Sense and Sensibilia , and  Metaphysics  . Donald J. Zeyl, Daniel Devereux, Phillip Mitsis, , Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy, page 20. The commentary on the  Sophistical Refutations  is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the Metaphysics. William W. Fortenbaugh, R. W. Sharples, , Theophrastus of Eresus, sources for his life, writings, thought and Influence, page 22. BRILL The lost commentaries include works on the  De Interpretatione ,  Posterior Analytics ,  Physics ,  On the Heavens ,  On Generation and Corruption ,  On the Soul , and  On Memory .  |Simplicius_of_Cilicia|Simplicius_Of_Cilicia|  mentions that Alexander provided commentary on the  |quadrature_of_the_lunes|Quadrature_Of_The_Lune| , and the corresponding problem of  |squaring_the_circle|Squaring_The_Circle| . Dunham, William. Journey through Genius, Penguin, 1991 In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on Aristotles  Categories  in the  |Archimedes_Palimpsest|Archimedes_Palimpsest| , and  |Robert_Sharples|Robert_Sharples|  suggested Alexander as the most likely author.        There are also several extant original writings by Alexander. These include: On the Soul, Problems and Solutions, Ethical Problems, On Fate, and On Mixture and Growth. Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: Medical Questions, Physical Problems, and On Fevers. Additional works by Alexander are preserved in  |Arabic|Arabic_Language|  translation, these include: On the Principles of the Universe, Charles Genequand, , Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos. BRILL On Providence, and Against Galen on Motion. N. Rescher, M. E. Marmura, , The Refutation by Alexander of Aphrodisias of Galens Treatise on the Theory of Motion. Islamic Research Institute     On the Soul  is a treatise on the  |soul|Soul|  written along the lines suggested by Aristotle in his own  De anima . Gerd Van Riel, 2010, Ancient Perspectives on Aristotles de Anima, page 174. Leuven University Press Alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material  and inseparable from the body. He argued strongly against the doctrine of the souls immortality. He identified the active intellect , through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with  |God|God| . A second book is known as the Supplement to On the Soul . The Mantissa is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with  |psychology|Psychology| . Robert B. Todd, , Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary, page 18. BRILL The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in  |physics|Physics|  and  |ethics|Ethics| , of which the largest group deals with questions of  |vision|Visual_Perception|  and  |light|Light| , and the final four with  |fate|Destiny|  and  |providence|Divine_Providence| . The Mantissa was probably not written by Alexander in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his. The two books of the De Anima differ markedly in form and content, and they were not originally a single work. Book I is generally recognized as authentic. Book II is almost certainly not by Alexander of Aphrodisias in its present form, though much of the material may be his or from his school.      Problems and Solutions  consists of three books which, although termed problems and solutions of physical questions, treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems. Robert B. Todd, , Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary, page 19. BRILL Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with  |logic|Logic|  and  |metaphysics|Metaphysics| , and six with questions of fate and providence. It is unlikely that Alexander wrote all of the Quaestiones, some may be Alexanders own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students. R. W. Sharples, 1992, Alexander of Aphrodisias: Quaestiones 1.1-2.15, pages 3-4. Duckworth.     Ethical Problems was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the Quaestiones. The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on Aristotle, and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from Alexanders school. Miira Tuominen, , The ancient commentators on Plato and Aristotle, page 237. University of California Press It is likely that the work was not written by Alexander himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving Alexander.     On Fate is a treatise in which Alexander argues against the  |Stoic|Stoicism|  doctrine of necessity. In On Fate Alexander denied three things - necessity , the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and  |determinism|Determinism|  in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand  or predetermined by antecedents . He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call  |libertarianism|Libertarianism|  today.      On Mixture and Growth discusses the topic of  |mixture|Mixture|  of physical bodies. Robert B. Todd, , Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary, page ix. BRILL It is both an extended discussion on  |Stoic_physics|Stoic_Physics| , and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.     On the Principles of the Universe is preserved in Arabic translation. This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived. Charles Genequand, , Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos, page 1. BRILL The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school. Charles Genequand, , Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos, page 4. BRILL Alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical. Charles Genequand, , Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos, page 6. BRILL The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the  |sublunar_world|Sublunary_Sphere|  of generation and decay. His principal sources are the  Physics  ,  Metaphysics  , and the  |Pseudo-Aristotelian|Pseudo-Aristotle|   On the Universe .     On Providence survives in two Arabic versions. Robert W. Sharples, The Peripatetic school , in David Furley , , From Aristotle to Augustine, pages 159-160. Routledge In this treatise, Alexander opposes the Stoic view that  |divine_Providence|Divine_Providence|  extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods. Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.       By the 6th century Alexanders commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as the commentator . Cf.  |Simplicius|Simplicius_Of_Cilicia| , in Phys. 707, 33; 1170, 13; 1176, 32;  |Philoponus|John_Philoponus| , in An. Pr. 126, 21;  |Olympiodorus|Olympiodorus_The_Younger| , in Meteor. 263, 21. But see  |Jonathan_Barnes|Jonathan_Barnes|  et al., , Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Aristotle Prior Analytics 1.1-7, page 4, who argue: In all these texts Alexander is indeed referred to by phrases such as the commentator or Aristotles commentator; but these phrases are not honorific titles - they are ordinary referring expressions. If, at the end of a book review, you read The author deserves our thanks, you will rightly take this for praise - but you will not think that the author has been honoured as The Author par excellence. His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the  |Arabs|Arab| , who translated many of them, and he is heavily quoted by  |Maimonides|Maimonides| .     In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued  |a_condemnation|Condemnations_Condemnation_Of_1210| , which probably targeted the writings of Alexander among others. G. Théry, Autour du décret de 1210: II, Alexandre dAphrodise. Aperçu sur linfluence de sa noétique, Kain, Belgium, 1926, pp. 7 ff.     In the early  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  his doctrine of the souls mortality was adopted by  |Pietro_Pomponazzi|Pietro_Pomponazzi|  , and by his successor  |Cesare_Cremonini|Cesare_Cremonini| . This school is known as  |Alexandrists|Alexandrists| .      |Alexanders_band|Alexanders_Band| , an  |optical_phenomenon|Optical_Phenomenon| , is named after him.       Several of Alexanders works were published in the  |Aldine|Aldine_Press|  edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495–1498; his De Fato and De Anima were printed along with the works of  |Themistius|Themistius|  at Venice ; the former work, which has been translated into  |Latin|Latin|  by  |Grotius|Grotius|  and also by  |Schulthess|Schulthess| , was edited by  |J._C._Orelli|Johann_Caspar_Von_Orelli| ,  |Zürich|Zürich| , 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by  |H._Bonitz|H._Bonitz| ,  |Berlin|Berlin| , 1847.
