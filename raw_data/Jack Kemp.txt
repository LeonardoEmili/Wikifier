That year, he led the Chargers to a division title, passing for 2,686  yards and 15  touchdowns. Years later, Kemps 1961 Chargers roommate,  |Ron_Mix|Ron_Mix| , recalled that Kemp needed ten or so shots of  |painkillers|Painkillers|  before each game and commented that it sounds weird, but he could play football and not be fit to serve in the Army.      In  |1962|1962_San_Diego_Chargers_Season| , Kemp broke his middle finger two games into the season and was unable to play. He persuaded his doctors to set his broken finger around a football, so that his grip would not be affected once the finger healed. Chargers coach  |Sid_Gillman|Sid_Gillman|  put Kemp on  |waivers|Waivers|  to try to hide him. Gruver, pp. 82–83.  |Buffalo_Bills|1962_Buffalo_Bills_Season|  coach  |Lou_Saban|Lou_Saban|  noticed that Kemp was available and claimed him for a $100 waiver fee on September 25, 1962, Maiorana , p. 86. in what sportswriter Randy Schultz has called one of the biggest bargains in professional football history.  The  |Dallas_Texans|1962_Dallas_Texans_Season|  and  |Denver_Broncos|1962_Denver_Broncos_Season|  also attempted to claim Kemp, but he was awarded to Buffalo by AFL commissioner  |Joe_Foss|Joe_Foss| . Gruver, p. 83.       According to  |Billy_Shaw|Billy_Shaw| , Kemps acquisition solved the Bills quarterback problem, but Kemp was not excited about coming to Buffalo. According to  |Van_Miller|Van_Miller| , Jacks a skier, and he wanted to go to Denver and play for the Broncos. He hated the thought of coming to Buffalo.  In Buffalo, he would become known for his love of reading a broad range of books including those by  |Henry_Thoreau|Henry_Thoreau| , which led to chidings from Saban.     Injuries, including the broken finger, kept Kemp from playing for most of 1962. That season, Kemp received a  |military_draft|Military_Draft|  notice for service in the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  but was granted a draft  |waiver|Waiver|  because of a knee problem. The injuries healed, and Kemp debuted for Buffalo on November 18, 1962, by directing the only touchdown drive in a 10–6 win over the  |Oakland_Raiders|Oakland_Raiders| . He played only four games for Buffalo in 1962, but made the  |AFL_All_Star|American_Football_League_All_Star_Games|  team. The Bills won three of their last four games to finish 7–6–1. Maiorana , p. 93–94.     On December 14, 1962, the Bills outbid the  |Green_Bay_Packers|Green_Bay_Packers|  for  |Notre_Dame|Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_Football|  quarterback  |Daryle_Lamonica|Daryle_Lamonica| . In  |1963|1963_American_Football_League_Season| , a four-season  |starting_quarterback_battle|Quarterback_Controversy|  began that continued until Lamonica left for the Raiders. Lamonica felt he ...  learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking. And I truly believe that we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills. In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record. Maiorana , p. 104. Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate  |Cookie_Gilchrist|Cookie_Gilchrist|  in rushing touchdowns.  The Bills played the  |Boston_Patriots|1963_Boston_Patriots_Season|  in an  |Eastern_Division_playoff_game|1963_American_Football_League_Playoffs|  to determine the division title on December 28 at  |War_Memorial_Stadium|War_Memorial_Stadium|  in  |Buffalo_New_York|Buffalo_New_York| , in  weather. During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8. Gruver, p. 115.     Kemp was said to be the clubhouse lawyer for the Bills because of his role in mediating conflicts. In  |1964|1964_Buffalo_Bills_Season| , he managed personalities such as Gilchrist, who walked off the field when plays were not being called for him, and Saban, whom he kept from cutting Gilchrist the following week. He also managed the politics of his quarterback battle with Lamonica, who engineered four winning touchdown drives in the Bills first seven games.  Kemp was the first and only  |Professional_Football|Professional_Football|  player to pass for three touchdowns in the first quarter of a season-opening game, against the  |Kansas_City_Chiefs|1964_Kansas_City_Chiefs_Season|  in  |1964|1964_American_Football_League_Season| , until the record was tied but not broken, 47 years later in  |2011|2011_Green_Bay_Packers_Season|  by  |Aaron_Rodgers|Aaron_Rodgers| .

According to Lamonica, the  |1965|1965_Buffalo_Bills_Season|  team had a new emphasis: In 64 we had depended a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us.  .  .But that all changed in 65. The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the  |Denver_Broncos|1965_Denver_Broncos_Season| . So we went to a pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our  |running_backs|Running_Back| . And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year. In  |1965|1965_Afl_Season| , the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Maiorana , p. 125. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions.  In the  |1965_AFL_Championship_Game|1965_American_Football_League_Championship_Game| , Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team.  Kemps role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver  |Elbert_Dubenion|Elbert_Dubenion|  playing only three games earned him a share of the  |AFL_MVP|American_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Players|  awards that he split with former Charger teammate,  |Paul_Lowe|Paul_Lowe| .   Kemp also won the  |Associated_Press|Associated_Press|  award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award. Maiorana , p. 126. Gruver, p. 151.       Following the championship game, Saban resigned to coach the  |University_of_Maryland|Maryland_Terrapins_Football|  and  |defensive_coordinator|Defensive_Coordinator| |_Joe_Collier|Joe_Collier|  was promoted to head coach for the  |1966|1966_Buffalo_Bills_Season|  season. Maiorana , p. 127. Kemp led the Bills to their third consecutive division title with a 9–4–1 record. However, in the  |AFL_championship_game|1966_American_Football_League_Championship_Game| , which was played for the right to represent the AFL in  |Super_Bowl_I|Super_Bowl_I| , the Bills lost to the  |Kansas_City_Chiefs|1966_Kansas_City_Chiefs_Season|  31–7. Maiorana , pp. 136–37. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star for the sixth consecutive year.

During the scrimmage,  |Ron_McDole|Ron_Mcdole|  fell on Kemps right knee and injured it, forcing Kemp to sit out the entire  |1968|1968_Buffalo_Bills_Season|  season. Maiorana , p. 148. The Bills went 1–12–1 without Kemp. Maiorana , p. 157.

Maiorana , pp. 158–66. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in  |1969|1969_Afl_Season|  for the seventh time in the leagues 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied  |Pete_Rozelle|Pete_Rozelle|  to have AFL teams wear an  |AFL_patch|Ten_Year_Afl_Patch|  to honor it. In 1969, the  |Erie_County|Erie_County_New_York| |_Republican_Party|Republican_Party|  approached him about running for the  |United_States_Congress|United_States_Congress| . After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics. Maiorana , p. 174.

But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress.       Kemp led Buffalo to the AFL playoffs four straight years , three consecutive Eastern Division titles and two straight AFL Championships .  He led the league in career passes attempted, completions, and yards gained passing.  He played in five of the AFLs 10 Championship Games, and holds the same career records for championships.

He was the only AFL quarterback to be listed as a starter all 10 years of the leagues existence and one of only 20 players to serve all 10 of those years. His number 15 was retired by the Bills in 1984.  In 2012, the  |Professional_Football_Researchers_Association|Professional_Football_Researchers_Association|  named Kemp to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2012      However, despite his success and important AFL records, he is most prominently listed in the NFL record book for less flattering accomplishments, including his place as a former record holder for most  |quarterback_sacks|Quarterback_Sack|  in a game.   Despite Kemps many records,  |Joe_Namath|Joe_Namath|  and  |Len_Dawson|Len_Dawson|  were selected as the quarterbacks for the All-time AFL team. Kemp is a member of the  |Greater_Buffalo|Greater_Buffalo|  Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame.     Kemp co-founded the AFL Players Association with  |Tom_Addison|Tom_Addison|  of the  |Boston_Patriots|Boston_Patriots| , and was elected its president five times.  His founding of and involvement in the players union contributed to his frequent siding with the  |Democrats|Democratic_Party|  on labor issues later in his career.     The  |NCAAs|Ncaa|  highest honor, the  |Theodore_Roosevelt_Award|Theodore_Roosevelt_Award| ,  was presented to Kemp in 1992,  and he was named one of the Associations 100 most influential student-athletes in 2006.

He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality which came from playing football with black teammates as Kemp said, I wasnt there with  |Rosa_Parks|Rosa_Parks|  or  |Dr_King|Martin_Luther_King_Jr_|  or  |John_Lewis|John_Lewis| . But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do. Kemps football colleagues confirmed this influence:  |John_Mackey|John_Mackey|  explained that the  |huddle|Huddle|  is colorblind.                 As a self-described bleeding-heart conservative , Kemp represented a part of the suburban  |Buffalo|Buffalo_New_York|  region known as the  |Southtowns|Southtowns|  in the  |United_States_House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives|  from 1971 to 1989.

As a supply-sider, he was not a proponent of  |balanced_budget|Balanced_Budget| ing and trivialized it while speaking of growth as an economic goal.      The  |Erie_County_New_York|Erie_County_New_York|  Republicans had drafted Kemp after incumbent congressman  |Richard_D_McCarthy|Richard_D_Mccarthy|  decided to run for the  |United_States_Senate|United_States_Senate| . During his inaugural campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and  The New York Times  described him as a  |John_F_Kennedy|John_F_Kennedy|  throwback who campaigned on  |family_values|Family_Values| , patriotism, sports, and defense. Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomers—along with  |Ronald_Dellums|Ronald_Dellums| ,  |Bella_Abzug|Bella_Abzug| ,  |Louise_Day_Hicks|Louise_Day_Hicks| ,  |Robert_Drinan|Robert_Drinan| , and  |Pete_du_Pont|Pete_Du_Pont| —discussed in  Time . The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser  |Robert_Finch|Robert_Finch|  and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixons director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the  |Cambodian_invasion|Operation_Menu|  and to oppose criticism of Nixons war policies in order to firm up Kemps support from military hawks.      Kemp championed several  |Chicago_school|Chicago_School|  and  |supply_side_economics|Supply_Side_Economics|  issues, including economic growth,  |free_markets|Free_Markets| ,  |free_trade|Free_Trade| ,  |tax_simplification|Tax_Simplification|  and lower  |tax_rates|Tax_Rate|  on both employment and investment income. He was a long-time proponent of the  |flat_tax|Flat_Tax| .  He also defended the use of  |anti_Communist|Anti_Communist| |_contra|Contras|  forces in Central America,  supported the  |gold_standard|Gold_Standard| , spoke for  |civil_rights|Civil_Rights|  legislation, opposed abortion, and was the first lawmaker to popularize  |enterprise_zones|Enterprise_Zone| , which he supported to foster  |entrepreneur|Entrepreneur| ship and  |job_creation|Job_Creation|  and expand homeownership among public housing tenants.  During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal  |Democrat|Democratic_Party| ; he supported  |affirmative_action|Affirmative_Action|  and rights for  |illegal_immigrants|Illegal_Immigrant| . The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since  |Robert_Kennedy|Robert_Kennedy| . He differed from  |Rockefeller_Republicans|Rockefeller_Republicans|  and earlier combatants such as  |Lyndon_Johnson|Lyndon_Johnson|  by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs. For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party,  |David_Gergen|David_Gergen|  heralded him as a courageous voice in the wilderness.  Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain  |gay_rights|Gay_Rights|  such as the right to teach in schools. Kemp at times felt his role was that of freewheeling,  |entrepreneur|Entrepreneur| ial, wildcatting  |backbench|Backbench| er.      Time identified 38-year-old second-term congressman Kemp as a future leader in its 1974 Faces for the Future feature.  Another early-career notable magazine appearance was in a 1978 issue of  Esquire . The article explained allegations of homosexual activity among staffers in Ronald Reagans Sacramento office in 1967; Kemp was not implicated. Kemp considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1980 and  |Hugh_Sidey|Hugh_Sidey|  mentioned him as a contender to unseat  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  in the  |1980_presidential_election|1980_United_States_Presidential_Election|   and was a front runner for the  |vice_presidency|United_States_Vice_President|  at the  |1980_Republican_National_Convention|1980_Republican_National_Convention| ,  where he received 43  votes from conservative detractors of George H. W. Bush. After he was reelected for a sixth term in 1980, his Republican peers elected him to a party leadership position,  and he served seven years as chairman of the House Republican Conference. This promotion occurred immediately after Kemp and  |David_Stockman|David_Stockman|  urged Reagan by memorandum to dedicate his first 100  days to working on an economic package with Congress.   Kemp considered running for  |Governor_of_New_York|Governor_Of_New_York|  in 1982 but ultimately decided to stay in the House. By 1984, many viewed Kemp as Reagans heir apparent.         Kemp had his first encounter with supply-side economics in 1976, when  The Wall Street Journal s Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his Congressional office. Kemp questioned Wanniski all day and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer s supply-side discipline. Thereafter, Kemp espoused supply-side economics freely, and in 1978 he and Sen. Bill Roth of Delaware proposed tax-cutting legislation. Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply-side economics inclusion in President Reagans economic plan, although at the time of Robert Mundell s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell, Laffer, Robert Bartley , and Wanniski. In 1979, Kemp wrote An American Renaissance , to deliver his message that A rising tide lifts all boats. Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan, they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp–Roth Tax Cut legislation. Reagans budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of United States House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski .     During the Reagan years, Kemp and his followers ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990,  which by 1996 had become one of the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker s success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming , prisons, medical treatment , and credit card use.     An early Kemp tax reform attempt was an unsuccessful 1979 proposal to index tax brackets for cost of living fluctuations, which was incorporated in Reagans 1980 package. Kemp co-sponsored a legislative attempt at enterprise zones in 1980. One of Kemps more trying times as a congressman came in 1982 when Reagan decided to reverse the tax cuts and promote tax increases. The reversal was controversial and stimulated opposition by Kemp. Nonetheless, the revised taxes passed. In 1983, Kemp opposed the policies of chairman Volcker on multiple occasions. The debates included domestic monetary involvement and roles in funding the International Monetary Fund .     Kemp delivered speeches at several Republican National Convention s. He addressed the convention on July 15 at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan and on August 21 at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas . Kemp, Jack, An American Idea: Ending Limits to Growth, Goodrich, 1985 During the 1984 Convention, with Trent Lott as Republican Party Platform Committee chairman, Congressmen Kemp and Newt Gingrich claimed control of the party platform to the consternation of G.O.P. senators Bob Dole and Howard Baker . Kemps official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy. However, the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes, the gold standard and the role of the Federal Reserve . Despite Kemps official role, his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes. By 1985, Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 Presidential nomination. He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston , Texas. Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain, Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress.     Kemp was a critic of association football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup , Kemp proclaimed: I think it is important for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football , where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport. Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin s 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his tongue was firmly planted in cheek when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccers main problem is it doesnt have a quarterback . Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have changed his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger , although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a boring game .         thu , on October 3, 1987. William Daroff is standing directly behind Kemps left shoulder.   In 1988, if Kemp had won his campaign for the United States Presidency, it would have made him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield . When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins , Reagans 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemps leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in his campaign. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemps free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize governments role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.     After the May 1987 Gary Hart – Donna Rice scandal, a questionnaire by  |The_New_York_Times|The_New_York_Times|  requested things such as psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates. Candidates from each party expressed opinions on both sides of the personal privacy issue, and Kemp rejected the Times inquiry as beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate . His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire, but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York. Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters, Kemps campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red, which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques. To offset his socially moderate stances, Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion, his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State George Shultz . To position himself as Reagans successor, Kemp called for Shultzs resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighter s in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on SDI. In an attempt to highlight his stands on key Reagan Era foreign policy initiatives, Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan—a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists. He was accompanied on the trip by 50-plus US conservative leaders.     Despite a platform covering the full range of political subjects, Kemps primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts. As part of his fiscal policy, he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending. Some viewed Kemps supply-side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit . In late 1987, political pundits saw that Kemp needed to gain support from the far right on non-social issues. Kemp was among the majority of Republican candidates in opposition to Reagans INF Treaty agreement with the Soviet Union s Mikhail Gorbachev despite general Republican voter approval of the treaty. With aspirations of support from right-wing voters, all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same sabre-rattling stand. By early 1988, the moderates were clearly the front-runners and Kemp was battling with Pat Robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates.     He used a somewhat negative advertising campaign that seemed to have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemps campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday , in which his 39  delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg , New York to Bethesda, Maryland , their residence at the time of his death. In 1994, Kemps 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire , and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.       thu Dean.   As a so-called bleeding-heart conservative , Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , whose job would be to foster public sector and private sector methods to meet the demands of public housing. However, the scandals of Reagans Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership. The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives. Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUDs director, he cleaned up HUDs reputation, and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration . He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive, which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett . He supported Operation Clean Sweep and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.     Although Kemp coaxed Bush to support a $4  billion housing program that encouraged public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361  million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman , who opposed Kemps pet project HOPE . The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemps proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as did most of the Cabinet , but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh , encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemps Economic Empowerment Task Force. However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemps new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton , and Vin Weber . The budget left him with $256  million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemps Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.     President Bush avoided federal antipoverty issues, and instead used Kemp as a mouthpiece to speak on the administrations low priority conservative activist agenda. Bushs contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his Points of Light theme, and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from presidential candidate Bill Clinton . By the time of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones, tenant ownership and welfare reform: Mort Zuckerman compared Bushs vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car. Nonetheless, the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration, even though at first, Kemp had been overlooked. However, Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemps success in advance best when he said in 1989, Good ideas with money can do a whole lot. Good ideas without money arent probably going to do a whole lot, and the issue here was the decision not to fund Kemps ideas. Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions, he was among the administrations leading users of first class corporate jet s. He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary.     Generally, his time as housing secretary was considered unsuccessful. However, although he could not get federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5  billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a vice presidential candidate.     Kemp was partly at fault for not achieving either of his primary goals because he did not get along with the rest of the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker , White House Chief of Staff , that Bushs best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention , Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemps reference to parts of the Presidents economic policy as gimmicks after the 1992 State of the Union Address . Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bushs administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a domestic policy czar. The letter, highlighting Kemps energy, enthusiasm and national clout , insulted Bush. Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the Bush Cabinet for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands. Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992, and some pundits agreed with him.       Kemp gave public speeches for $35,000 apiece between his time as Housing Secretary and his Vice Presidential nomination. By 1994, Kemp had embarked on 241  fund-raising dinners to raise $35  million for a 1996 Presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts. After stepping down from his $189,000 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development job, Kemp personally earned $6.9  million in the next three years, primarily for speaking on behalf of local Republican candidates. During the Super Bowl XXVIII festivities, Kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series.     Kemp was considered the star of the 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp was considered the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections , Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement by the end of the year. In January 1995, Kemps stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limit s, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America . Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell , Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.     Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich appointed Kemp to head a tax reform commission, , in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deduction s, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.     During the campaign, Kemps endorsement was highly coveted. Forbes had tried to get Kemp to run in the 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar . Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Doles campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.     Kemp was also outspoken on immigration on around this time: according to Kemps interpretation of a scientific index that he and Bennett support, immigrants are a blessing, not a curse. In 1994, Kemp and Bennett opposed California ballot Proposition 187 , a measure to bar illegal immigrants from obtaining public services, in direct opposition to first-term Republican California Governor Pete Wilson , one of its endorsers who was running for re-election. Republican Senate candidate Michael Huffington had also endorsed the proposition. Kemp supported rights for illegal immigrants, and opposed Lamar Smith and Alan Simpson s proposed restrictions on legal immigration.         thu and Kemp were featured on the cover of Time , but were nearly displaced by a story about Mars   Kemp had a reputation as the highest-profile progressive Republican. When Dole declined an invitation to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , he suggested Kemp as a substitute even before Kemp had become the vice presidential nominee. On August 5, 1996, Dole announced a 15% across-the-board tax cut in response to both the Forbes campaign and Kemps tax reform commission. Several of Doles other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennetts Empower America , which had Jeane Kirkpatrick , Weber, Forbes and Alexander as principals. For example, Dole borrowed Kirkpatricks tough foreign policy , Bennetts right conduct and even Alexanders school choice interest.     Bennett declined the offer to be Doles running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Doles antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential nominee , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp was seen as a means to attract conservative and libertarian -minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan . Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack , John McCain , and Carroll Campbell , and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Doles senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemps tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Doles running mate in 1996, they appeared on the cover of the August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine , but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars , which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.     The two politicians had a storied history stemming from alternative perspectives and objectives. Dole was a longstanding conservative deficit hawk who had even voted against John F. Kennedy s tax cuts, while Kemp was an outspoken supply-sider. In the early 1980s, according to David Stockman , Kemp persuaded Reagan to make a 30% across-the-board tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature. Once Reagan was elected, Dole was the Senate Finance Committee chairman who Kemp claims resisted the plan every step of the way. Dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan. The big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms. Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op-ed piece in The New York Times, which enraged Dole. Reagan supported the reforms at Doles request, causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act, which eventually passed in 1982. At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Kemp, along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott, added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases. Gingrich called this action Dole proofing the platform, and the plank passed over Doles opposition. Then, in 1985, Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote. In meetings with the president that excluded Dole, Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks. This is said to have been Doles most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the Republican loss of control of the Senate. During the 1988 presidential election, the two antagonized each other. After Bush won and Kemp left Congress for the Cabinet, the two did not really cross paths again until 1996, when Kemp endorsed Doles opponent Forbes on the eve of the New York Primary in March.     Dole despised Kemps economic theories, but he felt Kemp-like tax cuts offered his best chance at electoral success. For his part, Kemp had to make concessions as well: he had to back expelling the children of illegal immigrants from public schools despite his longstanding opposition to Proposition 187 and mute his opposition to abolishing affirmative-action programs in California. Some derided Kemp for his compromise and referred to him as a con artist . From the outset of their campaign, Dole-Kemp trailed, and they faced skeptics even from within the party. However, Kemp was able to use the nomination to promote his opposition to Clintons partial birth abortion ban veto. During the campaign, Kemp and Forbes advocated for a stronger stand on tax cutting than Dole used. However, in general, the opinion was that Kemp was helpful to the tickets chances of catching Bill Clinton , and Kemps advocacy gave a clear picture of the tax reforms that would likely occur on the condition of a successful campaign. Kemp was seen as likely to influence several types of swing voter s, especially those of his native state of California, and even the Democrats feared Kemp might lure voters.     After receiving the nomination, Kemp became the tickets spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to agreement on the self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March , Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic , and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described as if he was the presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemps style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as  |U_S_News_World_Report|U_S_News_World_Report|  writer Steven V. Roberts , criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills . During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemps voice on minority issues, Colin Powells support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer , school voucher s and criminal justice , the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.     Both Al Gore and Kemp had Presidential aspirations, which induced pursuit of debate on a higher plane. In addition, Gore and Kemp were long-time friends, unlike Gore and his previous vice presidential opponent Dan Quayle . Thus, as debaters they avoided personal attacks. However, some felt Kemp failed to counter substantive attacks. In the final October 9, 1996 Vice Presidential Debate against Al Gore , Kemp was soundly beaten, and Al Gores performance is considered one of the best modern debate performances. The debate topics ranged broadly from the usual such as abortion and foreign policy to the unusual such as an incident preceding the then-current baseball playoffs, in which Roberto Alomar , the Baltimore Orioles second baseman , cursed and spat on an umpire . The Mexico policy debate was one of the more interesting topics for critical review. The Gore victory was not a surprise since Kemp had been outmatched by Gore in previous encounters, and Gore had a reputation as an experienced and vaunted debater.       thu , Phil English and Mike Turner   In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and financial backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded the free market advocacy group Empower America , which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works . Empower America represented the populist wing of the party: while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights, it promoted free markets and growth over balancing the budget and cutting the deficit. He resigned as Co-Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein . Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial. Also, FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election.     By 1996, Kemp had been named a director of six corporate board s. He was a director for Hawk Corporation, IDT Corporation , CNL Hotels and Resorts, InPhonic , Cyrix Corporation and American Bankers Insurance Group. Kemp briefly served on the board of Oracle Corporation , whose CEO was his friend Larry Ellison , in 1996, but resigned when he ran for Vice President; he was named to the board of Six Flags, Inc. in December 2005. Kemp opted not to stand for re-election to IDTs board in 2006. He also served on the Habitat for Humanity board of directors, and served on the board of Atlanta -based software maker EzGov Inc. Kemp also served on the board of directors of Election.com, which was the private company that ran the worlds first election on the internet , the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary. Kemp was also a business partner with Edra and Tim Blixseth promoting membership in the elite private ski and golf Yellowstone Club . Kemp also partnered with the Blixseths in a failed anti-terrorism software venture called Blxware which was investigated for conning the federal government out of $20  million in contracts for software which fraudulently claimed to detect secret messages from Al-Qaeda in television broadcast signals. Sydney Morning Herald, February 22, 2011. Kemp was the founder and chairman of Kemp Partners, a strategic consulting firm that helps clients achieve both business and public policy goals.     In addition to corporate boards of directors , Kemp served on several advisory boards such as the UCLA School of Public Policy Advisory Board, and the Toyota Diversity Advisory Board as well as the Howard University Board of Trustees, on which he served since 1993. On March 25, 2003, Kemp was selected as chairman of the board of Directors of USA Football , a national advocacy group for amateur football created by the National Football League and the NFL Players Association . The organization supports Pop Warner , American Youth Football , Boys and Girls Clubs of America , National Recreation and Park Association , Police Athletic League , YMCA , and the Amateur Athletic Union . He was also vice president of NFL Charities .     thu , and Eleanor Holmes Norton at DC Vote rally on Capitol Hill   In the late 1990s, Kemp remained outspoken on political issues: he was critical of Clintons International Monetary Fund lax policies toward South Korea. In early 1998, he was a serious contender for the 2000 United States presidential election , but his campaign possibilities faltered, and he instead endorsed eventual winner George W. Bush. Kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation, Social Security and education. When a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked for debt repayment, Kemp opposed the plan in favor of tax cuts. Along with John Ashcroft and Alan Krueger , he endorsed reform of payroll taxes to eliminate double taxation . In addition to his fiscal and economic policies, Kemp advocated against abortion when Congress was considering a bill banning intact dilation and extraction s. He also advocated for retired NFL veterans on issues such as cardiovascular screening, assisted living , disability benefits, and the 2007 joint replacement program.
