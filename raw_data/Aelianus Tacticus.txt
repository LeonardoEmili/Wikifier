      Aelianus Tacticus , also known as Aelian , was a  |Greek|Hellenistic_Greece| |_military|Military|  writer who lived in  |Rome|Ancient_Rome| .       Aelians military treatise in fifty-three chapters on the tactics of the Greeks, titled On Tactical Arrays of the Greeks , is dedicated to the  |Emperor|Roman_Emperor| |_Hadrian|Hadrian| , though this is probably a mistake for  |Trajan|Trajan| , and the date 106 has been assigned to it. It is a handbook of Greek, i.e.  |Macedon|Macedon| ian,  |drill|Parade|  and  |tactics|Military_Tactics|  as practiced by the  |Hellenistic|Hellenistic_Greece|  successors of  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| . The author claims to have consulted all the best authorities, the most important of which was a lost treatise on the subject by  |Polybius|Polybius| . Perhaps the chief value of Aelians work lies in his critical account of preceding works on the art of  |war|War| , and in the fullness of his technical details in matters of drill.      Aelian also gives a brief account of the constitution of a Roman army at that time. The work arose, he says, from a conversation he had with the emperor  |Nerva|Nerva|  at  |Frontinuss|Frontinus|  house at  |Formiae|Formiae| . He promises a work on Naval Tactics also; but this, if it was written, is lost.      Critics of the 18th century   Guichard Folard and the Prince de Ligne   were unanimous in thinking Aelian greatly inferior to  |Arrian|Arrian| , but Aelian exercised a great influence both on his immediate successors, the  |Byzantines|Byzantine_Empire| , and later on the  |Arabs|Arab| , . The author of the  |Strategikon|Strategikon_Of_Maurice|  ascribed to the Emperor  |Maurice|Maurice|  selectively used Aelians work as a conceptional model, especially its preface. P. Rance,  in P. Rance and N.V. Sekunda , Greek Taktika. Ancient Military Writing and its Heritage 217-255. Emperor  |Leo_VI_the_Wise|Leo_Vi_The_Wise|  incorporated much of Aelians text in his own  |Taktika|Tactica_Of_Emperor_Leo_Vi_The_Wise| . The Arabic version of Aelian was made about 1350. It was first translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza, published at Rome in 1487. The Greek editio princeps was edited by Francesco Robortello and published at Venice in 1552.     In spite of its academic nature, the copious details to be found in the treatise rendered it of the highest value to the army organisers of the 16th century, who were engaged in fashioning a regular military system out of the semi- |feudal|Feudal|  systems of previous generations. The  |Macedonian_phalanx|Macedonian_Phalanx|  of Aelian had many points of resemblance to the solid masses of  |pikemen|Pikemen|  and the  |squadrons|Squadron|  of  |cavalry|Cavalry|  of the  |Spanish|Spain|  and  |Dutch|Netherlands|  systems, and the translations made in the 16th century formed the groundwork of numerous books on drill and tactics.     The first significant reference to the influence of Aelian in the 16th century is a letter to  |Maurice_of_Nassau_Prince_of_Orange|Maurice_Of_Nassau_Prince_Of_Orange|  from his cousin  |William_Louis_Count_of_Nassau_Dillenburg|William_Louis_Count_Of_Nassau_Dillenburg|  on December 8, 1594. The letter is influential in supporting the thesis of the early-modern  |Military_Revolution|Military_Revolution| . In the letter, William Louis discusses the use of ranks by soldiers of Imperial Rome as discussed in Aelians Tactica. Aelian was discussing the use of the counter march in the context of the Roman sword  |gladius|Gladius|  and spear  |pilum|Pilum| . William Louis in a crucial leap realised that the same technique could work for men with firearms. Parker, Geoffrey Military Revolutions, Past and Present in Recent Themes in Military History .
