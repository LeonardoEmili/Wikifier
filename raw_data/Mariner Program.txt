     The Mariner program was a 10-mission program conducted by the American space agency  |NASA|Nasa|  in conjunction with  |Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|  . The program launched a series of  |robotic|Robotic_Spacecraft| |_interplanetary_probes|Space_Probe| , from 1962 to 1973, designed to investigate  |Mars|Mars| ,  |Venus|Venus|  and  |Mercury|Mercury| . The program included a number of firsts, including the first  |planetary_flyby|Planetary_Flyby| , the first planetary  |orbiter|Orbiter| , and the first  |gravity_assist|Gravity_Assist|  maneuver.     Of the ten vehicles in the Mariner series, seven were successful, forming the starting point for many subsequent NASA/JPL space probe programs. The planned Mariner Jupiter-Saturn vehicles were adapted into the  |Voyager_program|Voyager_Program| , while the  |Viking_program|Viking_Program|  orbiters were enlarged versions of the  |Mariner_9|Mariner_9|  spacecraft. Later Mariner-based spacecraft include the  |Magellan|Magellan_Spacecraft|  probe and the  |Galileo|Galileo_Spacecraft|  probe, while the second-generation  |Mariner_Mark_II|Mariner_Mark_Ii|  series evolved into the  |Cassini–Huygens|Cassini–Huygens|  probe.     The total cost of the Mariner program was approximately $554 million.      The name of the Mariner program was decided in May 1960-at the suggestion of Edgar M. Cortright to have the planetary mission probes ... patterned after nautical terms, to convey the impression of travel to great distances and remote lands. That decision was the basis for naming Mariner, Ranger, Surveyor, and Viking probes.             All Mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal  |bus|Bus|  , which housed all of the electronics, and to which all components were attached, such as antennae, cameras, propulsion, and power sources.  |Mariner_2|Mariner_2|  was based on the  |Ranger|Ranger_Program|  Lunar probe. All of the Mariners launched after Mariner 2 had four solar panels for power, except for  |Mariner_10|Mariner_10| , which had two. Additionally, all except  |Mariner_1|Mariner_1| , Mariner 2 and  |Mariner_5|Mariner_5|  had TV cameras.     The first five Mariners were launched on  |Atlas_Agena|Atlas_Agena| |rockets|Rocket| , while the last five used the  |Atlas_Centaur|Atlas_Centaur| . All Mariner-based probes after  |Mariner_10|Mariner_10|  used the  |Titan_IIIE|Titan_Iii| ,  |Titan_IV|Titan_Iv|  unmanned rockets or the  |Space_Shuttle|Space_Shuttle|  with a solid-fueled  |Inertial_Upper_Stage|Inertial_Upper_Stage|  and multiple planetary flybys.     ;Mariners:    |Mariner_1|Mariner_1| , first spacecraft of the Mariner program, designed for a planetary flyby of Venus - Launched on July 22, 1962    |Mariner_2|Mariner_2| , space probe to Venus, the first robotic space probe to conduct a successful planetary encounter - Launched on August 27, 1962    |Mariner_3|Mariner_3| , one of two identical deep-space probes designed for close-up observations of Mars - Launched on November 5, 1964     |Mariner_4|Mariner_4| , second of two identical deep-space probes designed for close-up observations of Mars - Launched on November 28, 1964    |Mariner_5|Mariner_5| , spacecraft to measure magnetic fields and various emissions of the Venusian atmosphere - Launched on June 14, 1967     |Mariner_6_and_7|Mariner_6_And_7| , two unmanned NASA space probes that completed the first dual mission to Mars - Launched on February 25, 1969    |Mariner_8|Mariner_8| , one of two probes designed to orbit Mars and return images and data - Launched on May 9, 1971 but lost in a vehicle malfunction    |Mariner_9|Mariner_9| , second of two probes designed to orbit Mars and return images - Launched successfully on May 30, 1971    |Mariner_10|Mariner_10| , last of the Mariner probes; designed to fly by Mercury and Venus - Launched on November 3, 1973                   |Mariner_1|Mariner_1|  and  |Mariner_2|Mariner_2|  were two deep-space probes making up NASAs Mariner-R project. The primary goal of the project was to develop and launch two spacecraft sequentially to the near vicinity of Venus, receive communications from the spacecraft and to perform radiometric temperature measurements of the planet. A secondary objective was to make  |interplanetary_magnetic_field|Interplanetary_Magnetic_Field|  and/or particle measurements on the way to, and in the vicinity of, Venus. Mariner 1 was launched on July 22, 1962, but was destroyed approximately 5 minutes after liftoff by the Air Force  |Range_Safety_Officer|Range_Safetyrange_Safety_Officer|  when its malfunctioning  |Atlas_Agena|Atlas_Agena|  rocket went off course. Mariner 2 was launched on August 27, 1962, sending it on a 3½-month flight to Venus. The mission was a success, and Mariner 2 became the first spacecraft to have flown by another planet.

Sisterships  |Mariner_3|Mariner_3|  and  |Mariner_4|Mariner_4|  were Mars flyby missions.     Mariner 3 was lost when the launch vehicles nose fairing failed to jettison.     Mariner 4, launched on November 28, 1964, was the first successful flyby of the  |planet|Planet| |_Mars|Mars|  and gave the first glimpse of  |Mars|Mars|  at close range.

The  |Mariner_5|Mariner_5|  spacecraft was launched to  |Venus|Venus|  on June 14, 1967 and arrived in the vicinity of the planet in October 1967. It carried a complement of experiments to probe  |Venus|Venus| |_atmosphere|Atmosphere|  with  |radio_waves|Radio_Waves| , scan its brightness in  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet_Light| , and sample the solar particles and  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field|  fluctuations above the planet.

Mariner 9 was launched in May 1971 and became the first artificial satellite of Mars. It entered Martian orbit in November 1971 and began photographing the surface and analyzing the atmosphere with its infrared and ultraviolet instruments.

It was also the first spacecraft to encounter two planets at close range, and for 33 years the only spacecraft to photograph Mercury in closeup.   Mission: plasma, charged particles, magnetic fields, radio occultation and celestial mechanics   Status: Mariner 10 – Defunct. Now in a  |Heliocentric_orbit|Heliocentric_Orbit| .          Mariner Jupiter-Saturn was approved in 1972 after the cancellation of the  |Grand_Tour_program|Grand_Tour_Program| , which proposed visiting all the outer planets with multiple spacecraft. The Mariner Jupiter-Saturn program proposed two Mariner-derived probes that would perform a scaled back mission involving flybys of only the two gas giants, though designers at JPL built the craft with the intention that further encounters past Saturn would be an option. Trajectories were chosen to allow one probe to visit Jupiter and Saturn first, and perform a flyby of Saturns moon  |Titan|Titan|  to gather information about the moons substantial atmosphere. The other probe would arrive at Jupiter and Saturn later, and its trajectory would enable it to continue on to  |Uranus|Uranus|  and  |Neptune|Neptune|  assuming the first probe accomplished all its objectives, or be redirected to perform a Titan flyby if necessary. The programs name was changed to  |Voyager|Voyager_Program|  just before launch in 1977, and after  |Voyager_1|Voyager_1|  successfully completed its Titan encounter,  |Voyager_2|Voyager_2|  went on to visit the two  |ice_giants|Ice_Giants| .
