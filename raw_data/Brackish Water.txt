      Brackish water is water having more  |salinity|Salinity|  than  |freshwater|Freshwater| , but not as much as  |seawater|Seawater| . It may result from mixing seawater with fresh water together, as in  |estuaries|Estuary| , or it may occur in brackish fossil  |aquifers|Aquifer| . The word comes from the Middle Dutch root  |brak|:Wikt:Brakdutch|  . Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the  |salinity_gradient_power|Osmotic_Power|  process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment .     Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30  grams of  |salt|Salt|  per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30  |parts_per_thousand|Parts_Per_Thousand|  , which is a  |specific_gravity|Specific_Gravity|  of between 1.0004 and 1.0226. Thus, brackish covers a range of  |salinity_regimes|Salinitysystems_Of_Classification_Of_Water_Bodies_Based_Upon_Salinity|  and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space or time.                Brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets seawater. In fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are  |estuaries|Estuary| , where a river meets the sea.     The  |River_Thames|River_Thames|  flowing through  |London|London|  is a classic river estuary. The town of  |Teddington|Teddington|  a few miles west of London marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as  |Battersea|Battersea|  insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as  |roach|Rutilus| ,  |dace|Common_Dace| ,  |carp|Carp| ,  |perch|Perch| , and  |pike|Pike| . The  |Thames_Estuary|Thames_Estuary|  becomes brackish between Battersea and  |Gravesend|Gravesend,_Kent| , and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace;  |euryhaline|Euryhaline|  marine species such as  |flounder|Flounder| ,  |European_seabass|European_Seabass| ,  |mullet|Mullet| , and  |smelt|Smelt|  become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  and includes both euryhaline and  |stenohaline|Stenohaline|  marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.  , The-River-Thames.co.uk   The-River-Thames.co.uk     This type of  |ecological_succession|Ecological_Succession|  from a freshwater to marine  |ecosystem|Ecosystem|  is typical of river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of  |anadromous_and_catadromous|Fish_Migration|  fish species, such as  |salmon|Salmon| ,  |shad|American_Shad| , and  |eels|Eel| , giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as nursery grounds for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere.  |Herring|Herring|  and  |plaice|Plaice|  are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.     Estuaries are also commonly used as fishing grounds, and as places for fish farming or ranching.   For example,  |Atlantic_salmon|Atlantic_Salmon|  farms are often located in estuaries, although this has caused controversy, because in doing so, fish farmers expose migrating wild fish to large numbers of external  |parasites|Parasitism|  such as  |sea_lice|Sea_Lice|  that escape from the pens the farmed fish are kept in.           Another important brackish water habitat is the  |mangrove_swamp|Mangrove_Swamp|  or mangal. Many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. Among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are  |mudskippers|Mudskippers| , fish that forage for food on land, and  |archer_fish|Archer_Fish| , perch-like fish that spit at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as  |snappers|Lutjanidae| ,  |halfbeaks|Halfbeak| , and  |tarpon|Tarpon|  spawning or maturing among them. Besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such species as the  |saltwater_crocodile|Saltwater_Crocodile| ,  |American_crocodile|American_Crocodile| ,  |proboscis_monkey|Proboscis_Monkey| ,  |diamondback_terrapin|Diamondback_Terrapin| , and the  |crab-eating_frog|Crab-Eating_Frog| , Fejervarya cancrivora . Mangroves represent important nesting site for numerous birds groups such as herons, storks, spoonbills, ibises, kingfishers, shorebirds and seabirds.     Although often plagued with  |mosquito|Mosquito| es and other insects that make them unpleasant for humans, mangrove swamps are very important buffer zones between land and sea, and are a natural defense against hurricane and tsunami damage in particular.  , Science and Development Network, December 30, 2004     The  |Sundarbans|Sundarbans|  and  |Bhitarkanika_Mangroves|Bhitarkanika_Mangroves|  are two of the large mangrove forests in the world, both on the coast of the  |Bay_of_Bengal|Bay_Of_Bengal| .       Some seas and lakes are brackish. The  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  is a brackish sea adjoining the  |North_Sea|North_Sea| . Originally the  |confluence|Confluence|  of  |two_major_river_systems|Eridanos|  prior to the  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene| , since then it has been flooded by the North Sea but still receives so much freshwater from the adjacent lands that the water is brackish. Because the salt water coming in from the sea is denser than freshwater, the water in the Baltic is stratified, with salt water at the bottom and freshwater at the top. Limited mixing occurs because of the lack of tides and storms, with the result that the fish fauna at the surface is freshwater in composition while that lower down is more marine.  |Cod|Cod|  are an example of a species only found in deep water in the Baltic, while  |pike|Northern_Pike|  are confined to the less  |saline|Saline_Water|  surface waters.     The  |Caspian_Sea|Caspian_Sea|  is the worlds largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal  |seawater|Seawater| . The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals  and the great  |sturgeons|Sturgeon| , a major source of  |caviar|Caviar| .     The  |Hudson_Bay|Hudson_Bay|  is a brackish  |marginal_sea|Marginal_Sea|  of the  |Arctic_ocean|Arctic_Ocean| , it remains brackish due its limited connections to the open ocean, very high levels freshwater  |surface_runoff|Surface_Runoff|  input from the large  |Hudson_Bay_drainage_basin|Hudson_Bay_Drainage_Basin| , and low rate of evaporation due to being completely covered in ice for over half the year.     In the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  the surface water is brackish with an average salinity of about 17-18 parts per thousand compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans. Lüning, K., Yarish, C. & Kirkman, H. Seaweeds: their environment, biogeography, and ecophysiology. Wiley-IEEE, 1990. p. 121.  The deep,  |anoxic|Anoxic_Event|  water of the Black Sea originates from warm, salty water of the  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean| .      |Lake_Texoma|Lake_Texoma| , a reservoir on the border between the U.S. states of  |Texas|Texas|  and  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma| , is a rare example of a brackish lake that is neither part of an  |endorheic_basin|Endorheic_Basin|  nor a direct arm of the ocean, though its salinity is considerably lower than that of the other bodies of water mentioned here. The reservoir was created by the damming of the  |Red_River_of_the_South|Red_River_Of_The_South| , which receives large amounts of salt from natural seepage from buried deposits in the upstream region. The salinity is high enough that  |striped_bass|Striped_Bass| , a fish normally found only in salt water, has self-sustaining populations in the lake.  . Retrieved 25 December 2018.  .
