Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic when the transducer is angled obliquely. This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.       Anisotropy, in materials science, is a materials directional dependence of a physical property. This is a critical consideration for materials selection in engineering applications. For monocrystalline material, anisotropy is associated with the crystal symmetry.  Tensor descriptions of material properties can be used to determine the directional dependence of that property. When a material is polycrystalline, the directional dependence on properties is often related to the processing techniques it has undergone. A material with randomly oriented grains will be isotropic, whereas materials with texture will be often be anisotropic. Textured materials are often the result of processing techniques like hot rolling, wire-drawing, and heat treatments.

The Youngs modulus relates stress and strain when an isotropic material is elastically deformed; to describe elasticity in an anisotropic material, stiffness tensors are used instead. In metals, anisotropic elasticity behavior is prevalent in all single crystals, with the exception of Tungsten, due to the fact there are only two independent stiffness coefficients in the stiffness tensor . For face centered cubic materials like Copper, the elastic modulus is highest along the direction, normal to the close packed planes.     The anisotropy ratio is a value computed to compare elastic anisotropy in materials. It is given by the following expression:             where the C values are stiffness coefficients in Voight notation. For an isotropic material, the ratio is one.
