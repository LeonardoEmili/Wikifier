                       Edson Arantes do Nascimento,  |KBE|Order_Of_The_British_Empire|  , known as Pelé , is a Brazilian retired professional  |footballer|Association_Football|  who played as a  |forward|Forward| . He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1999, he was voted  |World_Player_of_the_Century|Fifa_Player_Of_The_Centuryiffhs|  by the  |International_Federation_of_Football_History_Statistics|International_Federation_Of_Football_History_Statistics|  , and was one of the two joint winners of the  |FIFA_Player_of_the_Century|Fifa_Player_Of_The_Century|  award. That same year, Pelé was elected Athlete of the Century by the  |International_Olympic_Committee|International_Olympic_Committee| . According to the IFFHS, Pelé is the most successful domestic league goal-scorer in football history scoring 650 goals in 694 League matches, and in total 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and is a  |Guinness_World_Record|Guinness_World_Records| . During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world.     Pelé began playing for  |Santos|Santos_Fc|  at age 15 and the  |Brazil_national_team|Brazil_National_Football_Team|  at 16. During his international career, he won three  |FIFA_World_Cups|Fifa_World_Cup| :  |1958|1958_Fifa_World_Cup| ,  |1962|1962_Fifa_World_Cup|  and  |1970|1970_Fifa_World_Cup| , being the only player ever to do so. Pelé is the  |all_time_leading_goalscorer|Brazil_National_Football_Teamtop_Goalscorers|  for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games. At club level he is the record goalscorer for Santos, and led them to the  |1962|1962_Copa_Libertadores|  and  |1963_Copa_Libertadores|1963_Copa_Libertadores| . Known for connecting the phrase  |The_Beautiful_Game|The_Beautiful_Game|  with football, Pelés electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals made him a star around the world, and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. Since retiring in 1977, Pelé has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the Honorary President of the  |New_York_Cosmos|New_York_Cosmos| .     Averaging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pelé was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also drop deep and take on a  |playmaking|Playmaker|  role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would also use his  |dribbling|Dribblingassociation_Football|  skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pelé received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport.          Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940, in  |Três_Corações|Três_Corações| , Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of  |Fluminense|Fluminense_Fc|  footballer  |Dondinho|Dondinho|  and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American inventor  |Thomas_Edison|Thomas_Edison| . His parents decided to remove the i and call him Edson , but there was a mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as Edison , not Edson , as he is called.  He was originally nicknamed Dico by his family.  He received the nickname Pelé during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local  |Vasco_da_Gama|Cr_Vasco_Da_Gama|  goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and that it is  |Hebrew|Hebrew|  for miracle , the word has no known meaning in  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language| .      Pelé grew up in poverty in  |Bauru|Bauru|  in the state of  |São_Paulo|São_Paulo| . He earned extra money by working in tea shops as a servant. Taught to play by his father, he could not afford a proper football and usually played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with a string or a grapefruit.   He played for several amateur teams in his youth, including Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, São Paulinho, and Amériquinha. Pelé led Bauru Athletic Club juniors  to two  |São_Paulo|São_Paulo|  state youth championships. In his mid-teens, he played for an indoor football team called Radium. Indoor football had just become popular in Bauru when Pelé began playing it. He was part of the first  |Futebol_de_Salão|Futebol_De_Salão|  competition in the region. Pelé and his team won the first championship and several others.     According to Pelé, indoor football presented difficult challenges; he said it was a lot quicker than football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14 years old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. That gave me a lot of confidence , Pelé said, I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come .                 In 1956, de Brito took Pelé to  |Santos|Santos| , an industrial and port city located near  |São_Paulo|São_Paulo| , to try out for professional club  |Santos_FC|Santos_Fc| , telling the directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be the greatest football player in the world.  Pelé impressed Santos coach  |Lula|Luis_Alonso_Perez|  during his trial at the  |Estádio_Vila_Belmiro|Estádio_Vila_Belmiro| , and he signed a professional contract with the club in June 1956. Pelé was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against  |Corinthians_Santo_Andre|Corinthians_Santo_Andre|  and had an impressive performance in a 7–1 victory, scoring the first goal in his prolific career during the match.      When the 1957 season started, Pelé was given a starting place in the first team and, at the age of 16, became the top scorer in the league. Ten months after signing professionally, the teenager was called up to the  |Brazil_national_team|Brazil_National_Football_Team| . After the  |1958|1958_Fifa_World_Cup|  and the  |1962_World_Cup|1962_Fifa_World_Cup| , wealthy European clubs, such as  |Real_Madrid|Real_Madrid| ,  |Juventus|Juventus|  and  |Manchester_United|Manchester_United_F_C_| ,  tried to sign him in vain; in 1958  |Inter_Milan|Inter_Milan|  even managed to get him a regular contract, but  |Angelo_Moratti|Angelo_Moratti|  was forced to tear the contract up at the request of Santos chairman following a revolt by Santos Brazilian fans.  However, in 1961 the  |government_of_Brazil|Government_Of_Brazil|  under President  |Jânio_Quadros|Jânio_Quadros|  declared Pelé an official national treasure to prevent him from being transferred out of the country.         Pelé won his first major title with Santos in 1958 as the team won the  |Campeonato_Paulista|Campeonato_Paulista| ; Pelé would finish the tournament as top scorer with 58 goals,  a record that stands today. A year later, he would help the team earn their first victory in the  |Torneio_Rio_São_Paulo|Torneio_Rio_São_Paulo|  with a 3–0 over Vasco da Gama.  However, Santos was unable to retain the Paulista title. In 1960, Pelé scored 33 goals to help his team regain the Campeonato Paulista trophy but lost out on the Rio-São Paulo tournament after finishing in 8th place.  In the 1960 season, Pelé scored 47 goals and helped Santos regain the Campeonato Paulista. The club went on to win the  |Taça_Brasil|Taça_Brasil|  that same year, beating  |Bahia|Esporte_Clube_Bahia|  in the finals; Pelé finished as top scorer of the tournament with 9 goals. The victory allowed Santos to participate in the  |Copa_Libertadores|Copa_Libertadores| , the most prestigious club tournament in the Western hemisphere.         Santoss most successful Copa Libertadores season started in  |1962|1962_Copa_Libertadores| ; the team was seeded in Group One alongside  |Cerro_Porteño|Cerro_Porteño|  and Deportivo Municipal Bolivia, winning every match of their group but one . Santos defeated Universidad Católica in the semi-finals and met  |defending_champions|1961_Copa_Libertadores| |_Peñarol|C_A_Peñarol|  in the finals. Pelé scored twice in the playoff match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club.  Pelé finished as the second top scorer of the competition with four goals. That same year, Santos would successfully defend the Campeonato Brasileiro and the Taça Brasil . Santos would also win the  |1962_Intercontinental_Cup|1962_Intercontinental_Cup|  against  |Benfica|S_L_Benfica| . . FIFA. 15 January 2015 Wearing his  |number_10_shirt|Squad_Number| , Pelé produced one of the best performances of his career, scoring a  |hat_trick|Hat_Trick|  in Lisbon as Santos won 5–2.     As the defending champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final stage of the  |1963_Copa_Libertadores|1963_Copa_Libertadores| . The ballet blanco, the nickname given to Santos for Pelé, managed to retain the title after victories over  |Botafogo|Botafogo_De_Futebol_E_Regatas|  and  |Boca_Juniors|Boca_Juniors| . Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained Brazilian legends such as  |Garrincha|Garrincha|  and  |Jairzinho|Jairzinho|  with a last-minute goal in the first leg of the semi-finals which made it 1–1. In the second leg, Pelé scored a hat-trick in the  |Estádio_do_Maracanã|Estádio_Do_Maracanã|  as Santos won, 0–4, in the second leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3–2, in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1–2, in  La Bombonera . It was a rare feat in official competitions, with another goal from Pelé.  Santos became the first Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pelé finished the tournament with 5 goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but went on to win the Rio-São Paulo tournament after a 0–3 win over  |Flamengo|Clube_De_Regatas_Do_Flamengo|  in the final, with Pelé scoring one goal. Pelé would also help Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Taça Brasil against  |Milan|A_C_Milan|  and  |Bahia|Esporte_Clube_Bahia|  respectively.        In the  |1964_Copa_Libertadores|1964_Copa_Libertadores| , Santos were beaten in both legs of the semi-finals by  |Independiente|Club_Atlético_Independiente| . The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pelé netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil for the fourth consecutive year. In the  |1965_Copa_Libertadores|1965_Copa_Libertadores| , Santos reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie.  Unlike 1962, Peñarol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2–1. Pelé would, however, finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals.  This proved to be the start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-São Paulo. In 1966, Pelé and Santos also failed to retain the Taça Brasil as Pelés goals were not enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by  |Cruzeiro|Cruzeiro_Esporte_Clube|   in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pelé scored his 1000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal, popularly dubbed O Milésimo , occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pelé scored from a  |penalty_kick|Penalty_Kick| , at the Maracanã Stadium.      Pelé states that his most memorable goal was scored at  |Rua_Javari_stadium|Estádio_Rua_Javari|  on a Campeonato Paulista match against São Paulo rival Clube Atlético Juventus on 2 August 1959. As there is no video footage of this match, Pelé asked that a computer animation be made of this specific goal.  In March 1961, Pelé scored the gol de placa , against  |Fluminense|Fluminense_Football_Club|  at the Maracanã. Pelé received the ball on the edge of his own penalty area, and ran the length of the field, eluding opposition players with  |feints|Dummy_Association_Football| , before striking the ball beyond the goalkeeper.  A plaque was commissioned with a dedication to the most beautiful goal in the history of the Maracanã .     In 1967, the two factions involved in the  |Nigerian_Civil_War|Nigerian_Civil_War|  agreed to a 48-hour  |ceasefire|Ceasefire|  so they could watch Pelé play an  |exhibition_game|Exhibition_Game|  in  |Lagos|Lagos| .  During his time at Santos, Pelé played alongside many gifted players, including  |Zito|José_Ely_De_Miranda| ,  |Pepe|José_Macia| , and  |Coutinho|Antônio_Wilson_Vieira_Honório| ; the latter partnered him in numerous one-two plays, attacks, and goals.  FIFA. 23 April 2007. Retrieved 5 May 2011          After the 1974 season , Pelé retired from Brazilian club football although he continued to occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches. Two years later, he came out of semi-retirement to sign with the  |New_York_Cosmos|New_York_Cosmos|  of the  |North_American_Soccer_League|North_American_Soccer_League|  for the  |1975_season|1975_North_American_Soccer_League_Season| .  Though well past his prime at this point, Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the United States.  During his first public appearance in Boston, he was injured by a crowd of fans who had surrounded him and was evacuated on a stretcher.  Pelé made his debut for the Cosmos on 15 June 1975 against the  |Dallas_Tornado|Dallas_Tornado|  at Downing Stadium, scoring one goal in a 2–2 draw.         In 1975, one week before the  |Lebanese_Civil_War|Lebanese_Civil_War| , Pelé played a friendly game for the Lebanese club  |Nejmeh|Nejmeh_Sc|  against a team of  |Lebanese_Premier_League|Lebanese_Premier_League|  stars,  scoring two goals which were not included in his official tally.   On the day of the game, 40,000 spectators were at the stadium from early morning to watch the match.     Hoping to fuel the same kind of awareness in the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic| , he and the Cosmos team played in an exhibition match against  |Haiti|Haiti| an team,  |Violette_AC|Violette_Ac| , in the  |Santo_Domingo_Olympic_Stadium|Estadio_Olímpico_Félix_Sánchez|  on 3 June 1976, where over 25,000 fans watched him score a winning goal in the last seconds of the match, leading the Cosmos to a 2–1 victory.  He led the Cosmos to the  |1977_NASL_championship|1977_North_American_Soccer_League_Season| , in his third and final season with the club.     On 1 October 1977, Pelé closed out his career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. Santos arrived in New York after previously defeating the  |Seattle_Sounders|Seattle_Sounders|  in New Jersey, 2–0. The match was played in front of a sold-out crowd at  |Giants_Stadium|Giants_Stadium|  and was televised in the United States on ABCs  |Wide_World_of_Sports|Wide_World_Of_Sports|  as well as throughout the world. Pelés father and wife both attended the match, as well as  |Muhammad_Ali|Muhammad_Ali|  and  |Bobby_Moore|Bobby_Moore| .       Pelés first international match was a 2–1 defeat against  |Argentina|Argentina_National_Football_Team|  on 7 July 1957 at the Maracanã.   In that match, he scored his first goal for Brazil aged 16 years and nine months, and he remains the youngest goalscorer for his country.            Pelé arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection.  His first match was against the  |USSR|Ussr_National_Football_Team|  in the third match of the first round of the  |1958_FIFA_World_Cup|1958_Fifa_World_Cup| , where he gave the assist to Vavás second goal.  He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. Against  |France|France_National_Football_Team|  in the semi-final, Brazil was leading 2–1 at halftime, and then Pelé scored a  |hat_trick|Hat_Trick| , becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.         On 29 June 1958, Pelé became the  |youngest_player_to_play_in_a_World_Cup_final_match|Fifa_World_Cup_Records|  at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in  |that_final|1958_Fifa_World_Cup_Final|  as Brazil beat  |Sweden|Sweden_National_Football_Team|  5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before  |volleying|Volley|  into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup.  FIFA. 30 May 2002. Retrieved 5 May 2011 Following Pelés second goal, Swedish player  |Sigvard_Parling|Sigvard_Parling|  would later comment; When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding . When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha.  He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker  |Just_Fontaine|Just_Fontaine| , and was named best young player of the tournament.     It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pelé began wearing a jersey with number 10. The event was the result of disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not send the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt to Pelé who was a substitute on the occasion.  The press proclaimed Pelé the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind  |Didi|Valdir_Pereira| .       Pelé also played in the  |South_American_Championship|Copa_America| . In the  |1959_competition|1959_South_American_Championship|  he was named best player of the tournament and was top scorer with 8 goals, as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the tournament.  He scored in five of Brazils six games, including two goals against  |Chile|Chile_National_Football_Team|  and a hat-trick against  |Paraguay|Paraguay_National_Football_Team| .

In the first match of the 1962 World Cup in  |Chile|Chile| , against  |Mexico|Mexico_National_Football_Team| , Pelé assisted the first goal and then scored the second one, after a run past four defenders, to go up 2–0.  He injured himself in the next game while attempting a long-range shot against  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia_National_Football_Team| .  This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach  |Aymoré_Moreira|Aymoré_Moreira|  to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was  |Amarildo|Amarildo_Tavares_Da_Silveira| , who performed well for the rest of the tournament. However, it was  |Garrincha|Garrincha|  who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title, after beating Czechoslovakia at the final in Santiago.        Pelé was the most famous footballer in the world during the  |1966_World_Cup|1966_Fifa_World_Cup|  in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like  |Garrincha|Garrincha| ,  |Gilmar|Gilmar|  and  |Djalma_Santos|Djalma_Santos|  with the addition of other stars like  |Jairzinho|Jairzinho| ,  |Tostão|Tostão|  and  |Gérson|Gérson| , leading to high expectations for them. . FIFA. Retrieved 16 January 2015 Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for brutal fouls on Pelé that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.      Pelé scored the first goal from a free kick against  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria_National_Football_Team| , becoming the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against  |Hungary|Hungary_National_Football_Team| . His coach stated that after the first game he felt every team will take care of him in the same manner .

Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender  |João_Morais|João_Morais|  fouled Pelé, but was not sent off by referee  |George_McCabe|George_Mccabe| ; a decision retrospectively viewed as being among the worst refereeing errors in World Cup history. Pelé had to stay on the field limping for the rest of the game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time.  After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.          Pelé was called to the national team in early 1969, he refused at first, but then accepted and played in six  |World_Cup_qualifying|1970_Fifa_World_Cup_Qualification|  matches, scoring six goals.  The  |1970_World_Cup|1970_Fifa_World_Cup|  in Mexico was expected to be Pelés last. Brazils squad for the tournament featured major changes in relation to the 1966 squad.

The front five of Jairzinho, Pelé, Gerson, Tostão and Rivelino together created an attacking momentum, with Pelé having a central role in Brazils way to the final.  All of Brazils matches in the tournament were played in  |Guadalajara|Guadalajara_Mexico| , and in the first match against  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia_National_Football_Team| , Pelé gave Brazil a 2–1 lead, by controlling Gersons long pass with his chest and then scoring.

Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1, and Pelé assisted Rivelino for the 3–1. During that match, Pelé made  |one_of_his_most_famous_plays|Pelé_Runaround_Move| . Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguays goalkeeper  |Ladislao_Mazurkiewicz|Ladislao_Mazurkiewicz|  took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before Pelé. However, Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a  |feint|Pelé_Runaround_Move|  by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right. Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.

Pelé has also been known for connecting the phrase  |The_Beautiful_Game|The_Beautiful_Game|  with football.  A prolific goalscorer, he was known for his ability to anticipate opponents in the area and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful shot with either foot.  Pelé was also a hard-working team-player, and a complete forward, with exceptional vision and intelligence, who was recognised for his precise passing, and ability to link-up with teammates and provide them with  |assists|Assist| .        In his early career, he played in a variety of  |attacking_positions|Forward| . Although he usually operated inside the penalty area as a main  |striker|Forward_Striker|  or  |centre_forward|Forward_Centre_Forward| , his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an  |inside_forward|Inside_Forward|  or  |second_striker|Forward_Second_Striker| , or out  |wide|Forward_Winger| .  In his later career, he took on more of a deeper  |playmaking|Playmaker|  role behind the strikers, often functioning as an  |attacking_midfielder|Midfielderattacking_Midfielder| .  Pelés unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate  |feints|Dummy_Association_Football|  in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca.  Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.     Despite his relatively small stature, 5 feet 8 inches ,  he excelled in the air, due to his heading accuracy, timing, and elevation.  Renowned for his  |bending|Curl|  shots, he was also an accurate  |free_kick|Direct_Free_Kick|  taker, and  |penalty|Penalty_Kick|  taker, although he often refrained from taking penalties, stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score.
