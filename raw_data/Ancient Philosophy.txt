Genuine philosophical thought, depending upon original individual insights, arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously.  |Karl_Jaspers|Karl_Jaspers|  termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century BCE an  |Axial_Age|Axial_Age|  in human thought.             Chinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in China and other countries within the  |East_Asian_cultural_sphere|East_Asian_Cultural_Sphere|  that  |share_a_common_language|Adoption_Of_Chinese_Literary_Culture| , including Japan,  |Korea|Korea| , and  |Vietnam|Vietnam| .              The Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BCE, , Encyclopædia Britannica, accessed 4/6/2014 an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China. Even though this period – known in its earlier part as the  |Spring_and_Autumn_period|Spring_And_Autumn_Period|  and the  |Warring_States|Warring_States|  period – in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it is also known as the Golden Age of  |Chinese_philosophy|Chinese_Philosophy|  because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced  |lifestyles|Lifestyle|  and  |social_consciousness|Social_Consciousness|  up to the present day in East Asian countries. The  |intellectual|Intellectual|  society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of  |government|Forms_Of_Government| ,  |war|War| , and  |diplomacy|Diplomacy| . This period ended with the rise of the  |Qin_Dynasty|Qin_Dynasty|  and the subsequent  |purge|Burning_Of_Books_And_Burying_Of_Scholars|  of dissent. The  |Book_of_Han|Book_Of_Han|  lists ten major schools, they are:    |Confucianism|Confucianism| , which teaches that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. A main idea of Confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection. Confucianism holds that one should give up ones life, if necessary, either passively or actively, for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of  ren  and  yi .     |Legalism|Legalism| . Often compared with  |Machiavelli|Machiavelli| , and foundational for the traditional Chinese bureaucratic empire, the Legalists examined administrative methods, emphasizing a realistic consolidation of the wealth and power of autocrat and state.    |Taoism|Taoism| , a philosophy which emphasizes the  |Three_Jewels_of_the_Tao|Three_Treasures| |compassion|Compassion| ,  |moderation|Moderation| , and  |humility|Humility| , while Taoist thought generally focuses on  |nature|Nature| , the relationship between humanity and the cosmos;  |health|Health|  and  |longevity|Longevity| ; and  |wu_wei|Wu_Wei|  . Harmony with the  |Universe|Universe| , or the source thereof , is the intended result of many Taoist rules and practices.    |Mohism|Mohism| , which advocated the idea of universal love: Mozi believed that everyone is equal before heaven , and that people should seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love. His epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist  |empiricism|Empiricism| ; he believed that human cognition ought to be based on ones perceptions   ones sensory experiences, such as sight and hearing   instead of imagination or internal logic, elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction. Mozi advocated frugality, condemning the Confucian emphasis on ritual and music, which he denounced as extravagant.   Naturalism, the  |School_of_Naturalists|School_Of_Naturalists|  or the Yin-yang school, which synthesized the concepts of  |yin-yang|Yin-Yang|  and the  |Five_Elements|Five_Elements| ;  |Zou_Yan|Zou_Yan|  is considered the founder of this school.    Agrarianism, or the  |School_of_Agrarianism|School_Of_Agrarianism| , which advocated peasant  |utopian|Utopian| |communalism|Communalism|  and  |egalitarianism|Egalitarianism| .  The Agrarians believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king  |Shen_Nong|Shen_Nong| , a folk hero which was portrayed in Chinese literature as working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached.   The  |Logicians|School_Of_Names|  or the School of Names, which focused on  |definition|Definition|  and  |logic|Logic| . It is said to have parallels with that of the Ancient Greek  |sophists|Sophists|  or  |dialecticians|Dialectician| . The most notable Logician was  |Gongsun_Longzi|Gongsun_Longzi| .   The  |School_of_Diplomacy|School_Of_Diplomacy|  or School of Vertical and Horizontal which focused on practical matters instead of any moral principle, so it stressed political and diplomatic tactics, and debate and lobbying skill. Scholars from this school were good orators, debaters and tacticians.   The Miscellaneous School, which integrated teachings from different schools; for instance,  |Lü_Buwei|Lü_Buwei|  found scholars from different schools to write a book called  |Lüshi_Chunqiu|Lüshi_Chunqiu|  cooperatively. This school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws.   The School of Minor-talks , which was not a unique school of thought, but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street.   Another group is the School of the Military that studied strategy and the  |philosophy_of_war|Philosophy_Of_War| ;  |Sunzi|Sunzi|  and  |Sun_Bin|Sun_Bin|  were influential leaders. However, this school was not one of the Ten Schools defined by Hanshu.       The founder of the  |Qin_Dynasty|Qin_Dynasty| , who implemented Legalism as the official philosophy,  |quashed_Mohist_and_Confucianist_schools|To_Burn_The_Classics_And_To_Bury_The_Scholars| . Legalism remained influential until the emperors of the  |Han_Dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  adopted Daoism and later Confucianism as official doctrine. These latter two became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of Buddhism.     Confucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest  |thinker|Intellectual|  was  |Dong_Zhongshu|Dong_Zhongshu| , who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language  that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.     The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the  Xuanxue  , also called Neo-Taoism. The most important philosophers of this movement were  |Wang_Bi|Wang_Bi| ,  |Xiang_Xiu|Xiang_Xiu|  and  |Guo_Xiang|Guo_Xiang| . The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being . A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the  |Seven_Sages_of_the_Bamboo_Grove|Seven_Sages_Of_The_Bamboo_Grove| , was the concept of  feng liu  , a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.      |Buddhism|Buddhism|  arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the  |Northern_and_Southern|Southern_And_Northern_Dynasties| ,  |Sui|Sui_Dynasty|  and  |Tang|Tang_Dynasty|  Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about  |Laozi|Laozi| , founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to  |Buddha|Buddha| .  |Mahayana_Buddhism|Mahayana_Buddhism|  was far more successful in China than its rival  |Hinayana|Hinayana| , and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were  |Sengzhao|Sengzhao|  and  |Daosheng|Daosheng| . But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the  |Chan|Chan_Buddhism|  sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the  |Zen|Zen|  sect.        |Taoism|Taoism| |Laozi|Laozi| |Zhuangzi|Zhuangzi| |Zhang_Daoling|Zhang_Daoling| |Zhang_Jue|Zhang_Jue| |Ge_Hong|Ge_Hong| |Confucianism|Confucianism| |Confucius|Confucius| |Mencius|Mencius| |Xun_Zi|Xun_Zi| |Legalism|Legalism| |Li_Si|Li_Si| |Li_Kui|Li_Kui| |Han_Fei|Han_Fei| |Shang_Yang|Shang_Yang| |Shen_Buhai|Shen_Buhai| |Shen_Dao|Shen_Dao| |Mohism|Mohism| |Mozi|Mozi| |Logicians|School_Of_Names| |Deng_Xi|Deng_Xi| |Hui_Shi|Hui_Shi| |Gongsun_Long|Gongsun_Long| |Agrarianism|School_Of_Agrarianism| |Naturalism|School_Of_Naturalists| |Zou_Yan|Zou_Yan| |Neotaoism|Neotaoism| |Wang_Bi|Wang_Bi| |Guo_Xiang|Guo_Xiang| |Xiang_Xiu|Xiang_Xiu| |School_of_Diplomacy|School_Of_Diplomacy| |Guiguzi|Guiguzi| |Su_Qin|Su_Qin| |Zhang_Yi|Zhang_Yi| |Yue_Yi|Yue_Yi| |Li_Yiji|Li_Yiji|    Military strategy    |Sunzi|Sunzi| |Sun_Bin|Sun_Bin| |Milesian_School|Milesian_School|    : |Thales|Thales|    : |Anaximander|Anaximander|    : |Anaximenes_of_Miletus|Anaximenes_Of_Miletus| |Pythagoreans|Pythagoreanism|    : |Pythagoras|Pythagoras|    : |Philolaus|Philolaus|    : |Alcmaeon_of_Croton|Alcmaeon_Of_Croton|    : |Archytas|Archytas| |Heraclitus|Heraclitus| |Eleatic_School|Eleatic_School|    : |Xenophanes|Xenophanes|    : |Parmenides|Parmenides|    : |Zeno_of_Elea|Zeno_Of_Elea|    : |Melissus_of_Samos|Melissus_Of_Samos| |Pluralists|Pluralist_School|    : |Empedocles|Empedocles|    : |Anaxagoras|Anaxagoras| |Atomists|Atomism|    : |Leucippus|Leucippus|    : |Democritus|Democritus|    : |Metrodorus_of_Chios|Metrodorus_Of_Chios| |Pherecydes_of_Syros|Pherecydes_Of_Syros| |Sophists|Sophism|    : |Protagoras|Protagoras|    : |Gorgias|Gorgias|    : |Antiphon|Antiphon|    : |Prodicus|Prodicus|    : |Hippias|Hippias|    : |Thrasymachus|Thrasymachus|    : |Callicles|Callicles|    : |Critias|Critias|    : |Lycophron|Lycophron| |Diogenes_of_Apollonia|Diogenes_Of_Apollonia| |Socrates|Socrates| |Euclid_of_Megara|Euclid_Of_Megara| |Antisthenes|Antisthenes| |Aristippus|Aristippus| |Plato|Plato| |Speusippus|Speusippus| |Diogenes_of_Sinope|Diogenes_Of_Sinope| |Xenocrates|Xenocrates| |Aristotle|Aristotle| |Stilpo|Stilpo| |Theophrastus|Theophrastus| |Pyrrho|Pyrrho| |Epicurus|Epicurus| |Metrodorus_of_Lampsacus|Metrodorus_Of_Lampsacus| |Zeno_of_Citium|Zeno_Of_Citium| |Cleanthes|Cleanthes| |Timon|Timon| |Arcesilaus|Arcesilaus| |Menippus|Menippus| |Archimedes|Archimedes| |Chrysippus|Chrysippus| |Carneades|Carneades| |Clitomachus|Clitomachus| |Metrodorus_of_Stratonicea|Metrodorus_Of_Stratonicea| |Philo_of_Larissa|Philo_Of_Larissa| |Posidonius|Posidonius| |Antiochus_of_Ascalon|Antiochus_Of_Ascalon| |Aenesidemus|Aenesidemus| |Agrippa|Agrippa_The_Sceptic| |Academic_skepticism|Academic_Skepticism| |Cynic|Cynicism| ism    |Cyrenaicism|Cyrenaics| |Eclecticism|Eclecticism| |Epicureanism|Epicureanism| |Middle_Platonism|Middle_Platonism| |Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonism| |Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagoreanism| |Peripatetic_School|Peripatetic_School| |Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonism| |Stoicism|Stoicism| |Sophism|Sophism|.
