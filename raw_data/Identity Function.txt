     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an identity function, also called an identity relation or identity map or identity transformation, is a  |function|Function|  that always returns the same value that was used as its argument. That is, for  being identity, the  |equality|Equality|   holds for all .       Formally, if  is a  |set|Set| , the identity function  on  is defined to be that function with  |domain|Domain_Of_A_Function|  and  |codomain|Codomain|   which satisfies   :    for all elements  in .      In other words, the function value  in  is always the same input element  of  . The identity function on  is clearly an  |injective_function|Injective_Function|  as well as a  |surjective_function|Surjective_Function| , so it is also  |bijective|Bijection| .      The identity function  on  is often denoted by .     In  |set_theory|Set_Theory| , where a function is defined as a particular kind of  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation| , the identity function is given by the  |identity_relation|Identity_Relation| , or diagonal of .       If  is any function, then we have  . In particular,  is the  |identity_element|Identity_Element|  of the  |monoid|Monoid|  of all functions from  to .     Since the identity element of a monoid is  |unique|Unique| , one can alternately define the identity function on  to be this identity element. Such a definition generalizes to the concept of an  |identity_morphism|Identity_Morphism|  in  |category_theory|Category_Theory| , where the  |endomorphisms|Endomorphism|  of  need not be functions.       The identity function is a  |linear_operator|Linear_Map| , when applied to  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space| .    The identity function on the positive  |integers|Integer|  is a  |completely_multiplicative_function|Completely_Multiplicative_Function|  , considered in  |number_theory|Number_Theory| .    In an -dimensional  |vector_space|Vector_Space|  the identity function is represented by the  |identity_matrix|Identity_Matrix|  , regardless of the  |basis|Basis| .    In a  |metric_space|Metric_Space|  the identity is trivially an  |isometry|Isometry| . An object without any  |symmetry|Symmetry|  has as  |symmetry_group|Symmetry_Group|  the trivial group only containing this isometry . , Hyperbolic Geometry, Springer 2005,    In a  |topological_space|Topological_Space| .
