     Case is a special  |grammatical_category|Grammatical_Category|  of a  |noun|Noun| ,  |pronoun|Pronoun| ,  |adjective|Adjective| ,  |participle|Participle|  or  |numeral|Numeral|  whose value reflects the  |grammatical_function|Grammatical_Function|  performed by that word in a  |phrase|Phrase| ,  |clause|Clause|  or  |sentence|Sentence| . In some languages, nouns, pronouns, adjectives,  |determiners|Determiners| , participles, prepositions, numerals, articles and their  |modifiers|Modifier|  take different  |inflected|Inflection|  forms, depending on their case. As a language evolves, cases can merge , a phenomenon formally called  |syncretism|Syncretism| .      |English|English_Language|  has largely lost its inflected case system although personal pronouns still have three cases, which are simplified forms of the  |nominative|Nominative_Case| ,  |accusative|Accusative_Case|  and  |genitive_cases|Genitive_Case| . They are used with  |personal_pronouns|Personal_Pronoun| :  |subjective_case|Subjective_Case|  ,  |objective_case|Objective_Case|  and  |possessive_case|Possessive_Case|  . Forms such as I, he and we are used for the  |subject|Subject|  , and forms such as me, him and us are used for the  |object|Object|  .     Languages such as Ancient Greek,  |Armenian|Armenian_Language| ,  |Assamese|Assamese_Language| , most  |Balto-Slavic_languages|Balto-Slavic_Languages| ,  |Basque|Basque_Language| , most  |Caucasian_languages|Caucasian_Languages| ,  |German|German_Language| ,  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language| ,  |Japanese|Japanese_Language| ,  |Korean|Korean_Language| ,  |Latin|Latin| ,  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit| ,  |Tamil|Tamil_Language| ,  |Tibetan|Standard_Tibetan|  , the  |Turkic_languages|Turkic_Languages|  and the  |Uralic_languages|Uralic_Languages|  have extensive case systems, with nouns, pronouns,  |adjectives|Adjective| , and  |determiners|Determiner|  all inflecting  to indicate their case. The number of cases differs between languages:  |Persian|Persian_Language|  and  |Esperanto|Esperanto|  have two; modern English has three but for pronouns only; German and Icelandic have four; Romanian has five; Latin, Slovenian, Russian and Turkish each have at least six; Armenian, Czech, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovak and Ukrainian have seven; Sanskrit and Tamil have eight; Estonian has 14; Finnish has 15; Hungarian has 18 and  |Tsez|Tsez_Language|  has 64 cases.     Commonly encountered cases include  |nominative|Nominative| ,  |accusative|Accusative| ,  |dative|Dative|  and  |genitive|Genitive| . A role that one of those languages marks by case is often marked in English with a  |preposition|Preposition| . For example, the English prepositional phrase with foot might be rendered in Russian using a single noun in the  |instrumental_case|Instrumental_Case|  or in Ancient Greek as   with both words  changing to dative form.     More formally, case has been defined as a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their  |heads|Head|  . Blake, Barry J. Case. Cambridge University Press: 2001.  Cases should be distinguished from  |thematic_roles|Thematic_Relation|  such as  agent  and  patient . They are often closely related, and in languages such as Latin, several thematic roles have an associated case, but cases are a  |morphological|Morphology|  notion, and thematic roles a  |semantic|Semantics|  one. Languages having cases often exhibit  |free_word_order|Free_Word_Order| , as thematic roles are not required to be marked by position in the sentence.       It is widely accepted that the Ancient Greeks had a certain idea of the forms of a name in their own language. A fragment of  |Anacreon|Anacreon|  seems to prove this. Nevertheless, it cannot be inferred that the  |Ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greeks|  really knew what grammatical cases were. Grammatical cases were first recognized by the  |Stoics|Stoics|  and from some philosophers of the  |Peripatetic_school|Peripatetic_School| .   The advancements of those philosophers were later employed by the philologists of the  |Alexandrian_school|Alexandrian_School| .        The English word case used in this sense comes from the Latin , which is derived from the verb , to fall , from the  |Proto-Indo-European_root|Proto-Indo-European_Root|   .  The Latin word is a  |calque|Calque|  of the Greek , , lit. falling, fall . L.  used to translate Gr.  lit. falling, fall. By  |Aristotle|Aristotle|   was applied to any derived, inflected, or extended form of the simple  or  , such as the oblique cases of nouns, the variations of adjectives due to gender and comparison, also the derived adverb , the other tenses and moods of the verb, including its interrogative form. The grammarians, following the  |Stoics|Stoics| , restricted  to nouns, and included the nominative under the designation .  The sense is that all other cases are considered to have fallen away from the nominative. This imagery is also reflected in the word  declension , from Latin , to lean , from the PIE root  .     The equivalent to case in several other European languages also derives from casus, including  in French,  in Spanish and  in German. The Russian word   is a  |calque|Calque|  from Greek and similarly contains a root meaning fall , and the German  and Czech  simply mean fall , and are used for both the concept of grammatical case and to refer to physical falls. The Finnish equivalent is , whose main meaning is position or place .            Although not very prominent in modern English, cases featured much more saliently in  |Old_English|Old_English_Language|  and other ancient  |Indo-European_languages|Indo-European_Languages| , such as  |Latin|Latin| ,  |Old_Persian|Old_Persian| ,  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek| , and  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit_Language| . Historically, the Indo-European languages had eight morphological cases, though modern languages typically have fewer, using prepositions and word order to convey information that had previously been conveyed using distinct noun forms. Among modern languages, cases still feature prominently in most of the  |Balto-Slavic_languages|Balto-Slavic_Languages|  , with most having six to eight cases, as well as  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language| ,  |German|German_Language|  and  |Modern_Greek|Modern_Greek| , which have four. In German, cases are mostly marked on articles and adjectives, and less so on nouns. In Icelandic, articles, adjectives, personal names and nouns are all marked for case, making it, among other things, the living  |Germanic_language|Germanic_Languages|  that could be said to most closely resemble  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic_Language| .     The eight historical Indo-European cases are as follows, with examples either of the English case or of the English syntactic alternative to case:          All of the above are just rough descriptions; the precise distinctions vary significantly from language to language, and as such they are often more complex. Case is based fundamentally on changes to the noun to indicate the nouns role in the sentence – one of the defining features of so-called fusional languages . Old English was a fusional language, but Modern English does not work this way.       Modern English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of Proto-Indo-European in favor of analytic constructions. The personal pronoun s of Modern English retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class . For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by word order , by preposition s, and by the Saxon genitive .     Taken as a whole, English personal pronouns are typically said to have three morphological cases:     The nominative case , used for the subject of a finite verb and sometimes for the complement of a copula .   The oblique case , used for the direct or indirect object of a verb, for the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for the complement of a copula.   The genitive case , used for a grammatical possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see .     Most English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the possessive case, which has both a determiner form and a distinct independent form , and a distinct reflexive or intensive form . The interrogative personal pronoun who exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms .     Though English pronouns can have subject and object forms , nouns show only a singular/plural and a possessive/non-possessive distinction . Note that chair does not change form between the chair is here and I saw the chair , a distinction made by word order and context.         Cases can be ranked in the following hierarchy, where a language that does not have a given case will tend not to have any cases to the right of the missing case:     : nominative → accusative or ergative → genitive → dative → locative or prepositional → ablative and/or instrumental → others.     This is, however, only a general tendency. Many forms of Central German , such as Colognian and Luxembourgish , have a dative case but lack a genitive. In Irish nouns, the nominative and accusative have fallen together, whereas the dative–locative has remained separate in some paradigms; Irish also has genitive and vocative cases. In Punjabi , the accusative, genitive, and dative have merged to an oblique case, but the language still retains vocative, locative, and ablative cases. Old English had an instrumental case, but not a locative or prepositional.       The traditional case order was expressed for the first time in The Art of Grammar in the 2nd century BC:   The Russian language uses a similar case order.     Latin grammars, such as Ars grammatica , followed the Greek tradition, but added the ablative case of Latin. Later other European languages also followed that Graeco-Roman tradition.     However, for some languages, such as Latin, due to case syncretism the order may be changed for convenience, where the accusative or the vocative cases are placed after the nominative and before the genitive. For example:         In the most common case concord system, only the head-word in a phrase is marked for case. This system appears in many Papuan languages as well as in Turkic , Mongolian , Quechua , Dravidian , Indo-Aryan , and other languages. In Basque and various Amazonian and Australian languages , only the phrase-final word is marked for case. In many Indo-European , Finnic , and Semitic languages , case is marked on the noun, the determiner, and usually the adjective. Other systems are less common. In some languages, there is double-marking of a word as both genitive and another case such as accusative .           Declension is the process or result of altering nouns to the correct grammatical cases. Languages with rich nominal inflection typically have a number of identifiable declension classes, or groups of nouns with a similar pattern of case inflection or declension. Sanskrit has six declension classes, whereas Latin is traditionally considered to have five , and Ancient Greek three declension classes . Frank Beetham, Learning Greek with Plato, Bristol Phoenix Press, 2007. For example, Slovak has fifteen noun declension classes , five for each gender .     In Indo-European languages, declension patterns may depend on a variety of factors, such as gender , number , phonological environment, and irregular historical factors. Pronouns sometimes have separate paradigms. In some languages, particularly Slavic languages , a case may contain different groups of endings depending on whether the word is a noun or an adjective . A single case may contain many different endings, some of which may even be derived from different roots. For example, in Polish, the genitive case has -a, -u, -ów, -i/-y, -e- for nouns, and -ego, -ej, -ich/-ych for adjectives. To a lesser extent, a nouns animacy or humanness may add another layer of complexity. For example, in Russian:         vs.   .   and   .             Assamese has ten cases.         An example of a Belarusian case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Belarusian term for country, which belongs to Belarusians first declension class.   country   countrys / country   country   country   country/ country/ country   country       In German , grammatical case is largely preserved in the articles and adjectives, but nouns have lost many of their original endings. Below is an example of case inflection in German using the masculine definite article and one of the German words for sailor .     the sailor   the sailors / the sailor   the sailor   the sailor     An example with the feminine definite article with the German word for woman.     die Frau the woman   der Frau the womans / the woman   der Frau the woman   die Frau the woman     An example with the neuter definite article with the German word for book.     das Buch the book   des Buchs the books/ the book   dem Buch the book   das Buch the book       Modern Greek has four cases: nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative. For neuters and most groups of feminines and plural masculines, the genitive case differs from the other three. Below is an example of the declension of , which has a different form in the singular of all four cases, together with the appropriate article in both the singular and the plural:     Nominative –   Genitive –   Accusative –   Vocative –     Ancient Greek had one additional case, the dative. At some point, it was replaced with the preposition , followed by the accusative. This became necessary when pronunciation simplified, merging the two long vowels eta and omega to short. The result was that dative did not sound much different from the accusative in the singular of the first two groups. However, the dative case is still used in many expressions.     With time, only the sigma of was left and got attached to the article, except when an article is not used and it becomes instead. Note that this is not a different case from the accusative.     Below is an example with the dative case of the word :     Nominative –   Genitive –   Dative –   Accusative –   Vocative –       Cases in Japanese are marked by particles placed after the nouns. A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases, which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the sentence topic , the other representing the subject. The most important case markers are the following:     Nominative - for subject, for the topic   Genitive -   Dative -   Accusative -   Lative - , used for destination direction   Ablative - , used for source direction   Instrumental -       Cases in Korean are marked by particles placed after the nouns, similar to Japanese. Like Japanese, the nominative case has two distinctions, one representing the topic of a sentence and the other the subject. In informal speech, nominative and accusative particles are often omitted, while dative and ablative are shortened to simply 에, if the meaning of the sentence can easily be inferred from context. Most common case markers are the following:     Nominative - for the subject, for the subject with being respectful, for the subject of multitude or organism   Genitive -   Dative - , 한테   Accusative -   Lative - , used for destination direction   Ablative - , used for source direction   Instrumental -   Vocative -       An example of a Latin case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Latin term for cook, which belongs to Latins second declension class .     cook   cooks / cook   cook   cook   cook   the cook           Latvian nouns have seven grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative. The instrumental case is always identical to the accusative in the singular and to the dative in the plural. It is used as a free-standing case only in highly restricted contexts in modern Latvian.     An example of a Latvian case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Latvian term for man, which belongs to the first declension class.     Nominative:   Genitive:   Dative:   Accusative:   Instrumental:   Locative:   Vocative:       In Lithuanian , only the inflection usually changes in the seven different grammatical cases:     Nominative : – – This is a dog.   Genitive : – – Tom took the dogs bone.   Dative : – – He gave the bone to another dog.   Accusative : – – He washed the dog.   Instrumental : – – He scared the cats with the dog.   Locative : – – Well meet at the White Dog .   Vocative : – – He shouted: Hey, dog!       Vocative forms are given in parentheses after the nominative , as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds Malayalam grammarPersonal pronouns .           An example of a Polish case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Polish terms for human and monkey     Nominative :   Genitive :   Dative :   Accusative :   Instrumental :   Locative :   Vocative : ,       Hungarian declension is relatively simple with regular suffixes attached to the vast majority of nouns. The following table lists a few of the many cases used in Hungarian.             |Romanian|Romanian_Language|  is the only modern major  |Romance_language|Romance_Languages|  with a case system for all nouns, whereas all other Romance languages dropped the cases for nouns replacing them by prepositions. An example of Romanian case inflection is given below, using the singular form of the word boy :       boy      boy      boys / of a/the boy      to a/the boy      Boy!             An example of a  |Russian|Russian_Language|  case inflection is given below , using the singular forms of the Russian term for sailor, which belongs to Russians first declension class.     sailor      sailors / sailor      sailor      sailor      sailor      sailor      Up to ten additional cases are identified by linguists, although today all of them are either incomplete or degenerate . The most recognized additional cases are locative , partitive , and two forms of vocative — old  and neo-vocative . Sometimes, so called count-form is considered to be a sub-case.  |See_details|Russian_Grammarnouns| .       Grammatical case was analyzed extensively in  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit| . The grammarian  |Pāṇini|Pāṇini|  identified six semantic  |roles|Theta_Role|  or kāraka, Pieter Cornelis Verhagen, https://books.google.com/books?id5vmaXJQzc4C & pgPA281 Handbook of oriental studies: India. A history of Sanskrit grammatical literature in Tibet, Volume 2, BRILL, 2001, , p. 281. which by default are related to the following eight Sanskrit cases in order:  W.D. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar           For example, in the following sentence leaf is the agent , tree is the source , and ground is the locus . The  |declensions|Sanskrit_Nounsbasic_Noun_And_Adjective_Declension|  are reflected in the morphemes -āt, -am, and -au respectively.        However, the cases may be deployed for other than the default thematic roles. A notable example is the passive construction. In the following sentence, Devadatta is the kartā, but appears in the instrumental case, and rice, the karman, object, is in the nominative case . The  |declensions|Sanskrit_Nounsbasic_Noun_And_Adjective_Declension|  are reflected in the morphemes -ena and -am.              The  |Tamil|Tamil_Language|  case system is analyzed in native and missionary grammars as consisting of a finite number of cases.   The usual treatment of Tamil case Arden, A. H. 1942, repr. 1969. A Progressive Grammar of the Tamil Language. Madras: Christian Literature Society. is one in which there are seven cases: nominative , accusative , instrumental , dative , ablative , genitive , and locative . In traditional analyses, there is always a clear distinction made between post-positional morphemes and case endings. The vocative is sometimes given a place in the case system as an eighth case, but vocative forms do not participate in usual morphophonemic alternations and do not govern the use of any postpositions. Modern grammarians, however, argue that this eight-case classification is coarse and artificial and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.              |Telugu|Telugu_Language|  has eight cases.          As languages evolve, case systems change. In early  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek| , for example, the genitive and ablative cases became combined, giving five cases, rather than the six retained in Latin. In modern  |Hindi|Hindi| , the Sanskrit cases have been reduced to three: a direct case and  |oblique_case|Oblique_Case| , and a  |vocative_case|Vocative_Case| . R. S. McGregor, Outline of Hindi Grammar, Oxford University Press, 1972. Spencer, A. . Case in Hindi. In Proceedings of the LFG05 Conference. Retrieved from  In English, apart from the pronouns discussed above, case has vanished altogether except for the possessive/non-possessive dichotomy in nouns.     The evolution of the treatment of case relationships can be circular.   |Adpositions|Adposition|  can become unstressed and sound like they are an unstressed syllable of a neighboring word. A postposition can thus merge into the stem of a head noun, developing various forms depending on the phonological shape of the stem. Affixes can then be subject to various phonological processes such as  |assimilation|Assimilation| , vowel centering to the  |schwa|Schwa| , phoneme loss, and  |fusion|Fusion| , and these processes can reduce or even eliminate the distinctions between cases. Languages can then compensate for the resulting loss of function by creating adpositions, thus coming full circle.     Recent experiments in agent-based modeling have shown how case systems can emerge and evolve in a population of language users. Remi van Trijp,   . In: Steels, Luc , Experiments in Cultural Language Evolution, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2012, p. 169-205. The experiments demonstrate that language users may introduce new case markers to reduce the cognitive effort required for semantic interpretation, hence facilitating communication through language. Case markers then become generalized through analogical reasoning and reuse.                Languages are categorized into several case systems, based on their morphosyntactic alignment—how they group verb  |agents|Agent|  and  |patients|Patient|  into cases:      Nominative–accusative   nominative case , with the patient of a transitive verb being in the  accusative case .    Ergative–absolutive   absolutive case , with the agent of a transitive verb being in the  ergative case .    Ergative–accusative  , separate from that of the agent or patient of a transitive verb .    Active–stative  agent, as in He ate, then it is in the same case as the agent of a transitive verb , and if it is a patient, as in He tripped, then it is in the same case as the patient of a transitive verb .    Trigger  |trigger_case|Trigger_Case| , and information elsewhere in the sentence  specifies the role of the trigger. The trigger may be identified as the agent, patient, etc. Other nouns may be inflected for case, but the inflections are overloaded; for example, in Tagalog, the subject and object of a verb are both expressed in the  |genitive_case|Genitive_Case|  when they are not in the trigger case.     The following are systems that some languages use to mark case instead of, or in addition to, declension:   Positional |Adposition|Adposition| al: Nouns are accompanied by words that mark case.       With a few exceptions, most languages in the  |Uralic|Uralic_Languages|  family make extensive use of cases.  |Finnish|Finnish_Language|  has 15 cases according to the traditional description .  However, only 12 are commonly used in speech .  |Estonian|Estonian_Language|  has 14  and  |Hungarian|Hungarian_Language|  has 18, both with additional archaic cases used for some words.    |Turkic|Turkic_Languages| ,  |Mongolic|Mongolic_Languages| , and  |Tungusic|Tungusic_Languages|  languages also exhibit complex case systems. Since the abovementioned languages, along with  |Korean|Korean_Language|  and  |Japanese|Japanese_Language| , shared certain similarities, linguists proposed an  |Altaic|Altaic_Languages|  family and reconstructed its case system; although the hypothesis had been largely discredited.   The  |Tsez_language|Tsez_Language| , a  |Northeast_Caucasian_language|Northeast_Caucasian_Languages| , has 64 cases.   The original version of John Quijadas  |constructed_language|Constructed_Language| |Ithkuil|Ithkuil|  has 81 noun cases,  and its descendent  |Ilaksh|Ilaksh|  and Ithkuil after the 2011 revision both have 96 noun cases.       The  |lemma|Lemma|  form of words, which is the form chosen by convention as the canonical form of a word, is usually the most  |unmarked|Markedness|.
