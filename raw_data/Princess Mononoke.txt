       is a 1997 Japanese  |animated|Anime| |fantasy_film|Fantasy_Film|  written and directed by  |Hayao_Miyazaki|Hayao_Miyazaki| , animated by  |Studio_Ghibli|Studio_Ghibli|  for  |Tokuma_Shoten|Tokuma_Shoten| ,  |Nippon_Television_Network|Nippon_Television_Network|  and  |Dentsu|Dentsu| , and distributed by  |Toho|Toho| . The film stars the voices of  |Yōji_Matsuda|Yōji_Matsuda| ,  |Yuriko_Ishida|Yuriko_Ishida| ,  |Yūko_Tanaka|Yūko_Tanaka| ,  |Kaoru_Kobayashi|Kaoru_Kobayashi| ,  |Masahiko_Nishimura|Masahiko_Nishimura| ,  |Tsunehiko_Kamijo|Tsunehiko_Kamijo| ,  |Akihiro_Miwa|Akihiro_Miwa| ,  |Mitsuko_Mori|Mitsuko_Mori|  and  |Hisaya_Morishige|Hisaya_Morishige| .     Princess Mononoke is set in the late  |Muromachi_period|Muromachi_Period|  of Japan with fantasy elements. The story follows the young  |Emishi|Emishi|  prince Ashitakas involvement in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term  or  is not a name, but a Japanese word for a spirit or monster: supernatural, shape-shifting beings.     The film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. It was a critical and commercial  |blockbuster|Blockbuster| , becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japans box office record for domestic films until 2001s  Spirited Away , another Miyazaki film. It was  |dubbed|Dubbing|  into English and distributed in North America by  |Miramax|Miramax| , and despite a poor box office performance there, it sold well on DVD and video, greatly increasing Ghiblis popularity and influence outside Japan.       In  |Muromachi|Muromachi_Period|  Japan, an  |Emishi|Emishi|  village is attacked by a demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but its corruption curses his right arm. The curse gives him superhuman strength, but will eventually spread through his body and kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The villages wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago came from, but he cannot return to his homeland. Before Ashitaka leaves, his younger sister Kaya gives him her crystal dagger so that he would not forget her.     Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo , an opportunist Buddhist monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant  |nightwalker|Daidarabotchi|  by night. Nearby, men herd oxen to Irontown , led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men and carries them through the forest, where he encounters many  |kodama|Kodama|  and glimpses the Forest Spirit. In Irontown, Ashitaka learns that Eboshi built the town by  |clearcutting|Clearcutting|  forests to claim  |ironsand|Ironsand|  and produce iron, leading to conflicts with the forest gods and Asano, a local  |daimyō|Daimyō| . Irontown is a refuge for social outcasts, including  |lepers|Leprosy_In_Japan|  employed to manufacture firearms; it was one of these guns that had wounded Nago. Eboshi also explains that San was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.     San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious. As he leaves, he is  |unintentionally_shot|Unintentional_Discharge|  by a villager, but the curse gives him the strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life. A boar clan, led by the blind boar god Okkoto, plans to attack Irontown to save the forest. Eboshi prepares for battle and sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo, who is working for the government; she intends to give the gods head to the  |Emperor|Emperor_Of_Japan|  in return for protection from Lord Asano. According to legend, the Forest Spirits head grants immortality.     Ashitaka recovers from his wound but remains cursed; he returns to Irontown to find it besieged by  |samurai|Samurai| , and heads out to warn Eboshi. The boar clan is annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is corrupted by his wounds. Jigos men disguise themselves in boar skins and trick the rampaging Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto, but is swept up in his demonic corruption. Moro intervenes and Ashitaka dives into the corruption, saving San. The Forest Spirit euthanizes Okkoto and Moro. As it transforms into the nightwalker, Eboshi decapitates it. It bleeds ooze which spreads over the land, killing anything it touches as the nightwalker searches for its head, which Jigo steals. The forest and kodama begin to die; Moros head comes alive and bites off Eboshis right arm, but she survives.     After the samurai flee and Irontown is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies as the sun rises, but its form washes over the land and heals it, and Ashitakas curse is lifted. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Irontown, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi reunites with the townspeople and vows to build a better town. The forest begins to regrow, and a kodama emerges from the undergrowth.        |Yōji_Matsuda|Yōji_Matsuda|  voices , the last prince of the Emishi tribe whose traveling companion is , a , more similar to a red  |Lechwe|Lechwe|  than an  |elk|Elk| . Miyazaki did not want Ashitaka to be a typical hero, saying that he is a melancholic boy who has a fate and also stated that Ashitakas curse is similar to the lives of people .  Ashitakas English voice actor  |Billy_Crudup|Billy_Crudup|  stated that he liked Ashitaka as an unexpected hero. He’s not your usual wild, brave guy. He’s really just a young, earnest man who’s trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village.     |Yuriko_Ishida|Yuriko_Ishida|  voices , a young woman who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans, but eventually comes to care for Ashitaka.

Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film. Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives. He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperors authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she wouldnt hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams. Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a  |shirabyōshi|Shirabyōshi| .  Eboshis English voice actress  |Minnie_Driver|Minnie_Driver|  stated that she was interested in the challenge of playing woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed.  Driver viewed Eboshi as a warrior, an innovator and a protector.     |Kaoru_Kobayashi|Kaoru_Kobayashi|  provides the voice of , a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a  |ninja|Ninja| , a member of a religious group or a very good guy. He eventually decided to give him elements of the above groups. In the English version, Jigo is voiced by  |Billy_Bob_Thornton|Billy_Bob_Thornton| .    |Masahiko_Nishimura|Masahiko_Nishimura|  voices , an ox driver;  |John_DeMita|John_Demita|  voices Kohroku in the English version.    |Tsunehiko_Kamijō|Tsunehiko_Kamijō|  provides the voice of , Eboshis bodyguard; he is voiced by  |John_DiMaggio|John_Dimaggio|  in the English version.    |Akihiro_Miwa|Akihiro_Miwa|  voices , a giant wolf god and Sans adopted mother;  |Gillian_Anderson|Gillian_Anderson|  provides her voice in the English version.    |Mitsuko_Mori|Mitsuko_Mori|  provides the voice of , the wise woman of Ashitakas village.

In the late 1970s, Miyazaki drew sketches of a film about a princess living in the woods with a beast. Miyazaki began writing the films plotline and drew the initial storyboards for the film in August 1994.   He had difficulties adapting his early ideas and visualisations, because elements had already been used in  My Neighbor Totoro  and because of societal changes since the creation of the original sketches and image boards. This writers block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the  On Your Mark  promotional music video for the  |Chage_and_Aska|Chage_And_Aska| |song_of_the_same_title|On_Your_Mark| . According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of Princess Mononoke. In April 1995, supervising animator  |Masashi_Ando|Masashi_Ando|  devised the character designs from Miyazakis storyboard. In May 1995, Miyazaki drew the initial storyboards. That same month, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of  |Yakushima|Yakushima| , of  |Kyushu|Kyushu| , an inspiration for the landscape of  Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind , and the mountains of  |Shirakami-Sanchi|Shirakami-Sanchi|  in northern  |Honshu|Honshu|  for  |location_scouting|Location_Scouting|  along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days. Animation production commenced in July 1995. Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000  |cels|Cel|  in the film,  and is estimated to have redrawn parts of 80,000 of them.   The final  |storyboards|Storyboard|  of the films ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.      Inspired by  |John_Ford|John_Ford| , an Irish-American director best known for his  |Westerns|Western_Film| , Miyazaki created Irontown as a tight-knit frontier town and populated it with characters from outcast groups and oppressed minorities who rarely, if ever, appear in Japanese films. He made the characters yearning, ambitious and tough.  Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of  |Medieval_Japan|Medieval_Japan| , and wanted to portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization.  The landscapes appearing in the film were inspired by Yakushima.  Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of Princess Mononoke depicts a symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races .           Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of  |¥|Yen| 2.35 billion .   It was mostly hand-drawn, but incorporates some use of  |computer_animation|Computer-Generated_Imagery|  during five minutes of footage throughout the film.  The computer animated parts are designed to blend in and support the traditional  |cel|Cel|  animation, and are mainly used in images consisting of a mixture of computer generated graphics and traditional drawing. A further 10  minutes uses  |inked-and-painted|Traditional_Animationink_And_Paint| , a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films. Most of the film is colored with traditional paint, based on the  |color_schemes|Color_Schemes|  designed by Miyazaki and  |Michiyo_Yasuda|Michiyo_Yasuda| . However, producers agreed on the installation of computers to successfully complete the film prior to the Japanese premiere date.  |TMS_Kyokuichi_Corporation|Tms_Entertainment|  helped animate the film.  |DR_Movie|Dr_Movie|  helped with the painting process.     Two titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as Princess Mononoke. The other title can be translated into English as either The Story of Ashitaka or The Legend of Ashitaka. In a  |Tokyo_Broadcasting_System|Tokyo_Broadcasting_System|  program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Hayao Miyazaki had preferred The Legend of Ashitaka as the title while Suzuki himself favoured Princess Mononoke. Suzuki also mentioned that Miyazaki had created a new  |kanji|Kanji|  to write his preferred title.   The English dub contains minor additional voice overs to explain nuances of Japanese culture to western audiences.                A central theme of Princess Mononoke is the  |environment|Environment| .  The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi. Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters . In the case of the deer gods destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources . They also characterized Eboshi as a business-woman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshis intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain embodies environmentalist evil .     Two other themes found in the plot of Princess Mononoke are  |sexuality|Human_Sexuality|  and  |disability|Disability| . Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansens Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma , after visiting the  |Tama_Zenshoen_Sanatorium|Tama_Zenshoen_Sanatorium|  near his home in Tokyo.  Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to cure poor lepers .  Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the  |University_of_Wyoming|University_Of_Wyoming| , and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Womens Studies at the  |University_of_Wisconsin–Madison|University_Of_Wisconsin–Madison| , said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that embraces modern  |social_systems|Social_System| , such as  |industrialization|Industrialization| , gendered division of labor,  |institutionalization|Institutionalization|  of people with diseases, and  |militarization|Militarization|  of men and women. They likened Lady Eboshi to a  |monarch|Monarch| . Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshis disregard of ancient laws and curses towards prostitutes and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints. Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshis supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and prostitutes into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Iron Town still support the stigmatization of lepers and prostitutes.     An additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankinds growth and development and Natures need for preservation. According to the  Chicago Sun-Times s Roger Ebert , It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order. Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted. Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: Its one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. Its all about how you harmonize it all. Anime historian Susan Napier said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in Princess Mononoke, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple point of views the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until films end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.     Dan Jolin of  |Empire|Empire|  said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film,  |Porco_Rosso|Porco_Rosso| , and the wars in the former Yugoslavia , which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as  |Kikis_Delivery_Service|Kikis_Delivery_Service| , where he has been quoted as saying It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that were happy?     Duality is central to Eboshis characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at Brigham Young University , said Eboshi does not fully understand the harm she does to the spirits. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for prostitutes and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontowns inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the films villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general. Thevenin, Benjamin. Princess Mononoke and Beyond: New Nature Narratives for Children. Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture, vol. 4, no. 2, Oct. 2013, pp. 147-170. EBSCOhost, .     Another theme in this film is between individualism and societal conformity . According to University of Bristol professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Iron Town by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Iron Town have a cohesive ideology and agree with Eboshi to protect Iron Town at the cost of the environments destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because “even though there is an envisioned culture at which an organization abides to, achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature”. The different viewpoints of San and Lady Eboshi eventually leads to a physical altercation where they both aim to kill one another. This dynamic between them represents the struggle to find a balance between the needs of individualism and those of conformity.       Princess Mononoke was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997. The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both anime fans and arthouse moviegoers in English-speaking countries. Since the Walt Disney Company made a distribution deal with Tokuma Shoten for Studio Ghiblis films in 1996, it was the first Studio Ghibli movie along with Kikis Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky to have been dubbed into English by Disney; in the case of this film, subsidiary Miramax Films was assigned to release the movie in America. In response to demands from Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein to edit the film, one of Miyazakis producers sent Weinstein a katana with the message: No cuts. Possibly as a result of this, the movie only had a limited theatrical release in the United States.     On April 29, 2000, the English-dub version of Princess Mononoke was released theatrically in Japan along with the documentary Mononoke hime in U.S.A.. The documentary was directed by Toshikazu Sato and featured Miyazaki visiting the Walt Disney Studios and various film festivals.

It was the top-grossing anime film in the United States in January 2001, but despite this the film did not fare as well financially in the country when released in December 1997. It grossed $2,298,191 for the first eight weeks. It showed more strength internationally, where it earned a total of $11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to $159,375,308 at the time. The films limited US re-release in 2018 grossed $1,423,877 over five days, bringing its US total to $3,799,185 and worldwide total to $160,799,185.

In July 2000, Buena Vista Home Entertainment announced plans to release the film on VHS and DVD in North America on August 29. Initially, the DVD version of Princess Mononoke did not include the Japanese-language track at the request of Buena Vistas Japan division, citing concerns that a foreign-released DVD containing the Japanese language track will allow for the importation of such a DVD to Japan, which could seriously hurt the local sales of a future release of the . The fansite Nausicaa.net organized an email campaign for fans to include the Japanese language track, while DVD Talk began an online petition to retain the Japanese language track. The DVD release of Princess Mononoke was delayed as a result. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the DVD in July 2000 with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors. The film was released on Blu-ray disc in Japan on December 4, 2013.     Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Princess Mononoke on Blu-ray Disc on November 18, 2014.

The Daily Yomiuris Aaron Gerow called the film a powerful compilation of Miyazakis world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns. Leonard Klady of  |Variety|Variety|  said that Princess Mononoke is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script and the film has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinemas most grand canvases . Roger Ebert of the  |Chicago_Sun-Times|Chicago_Sun-Times|  called Princess Mononoke a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year. You won’t find many Hollywood love stories so philosophical. Ty Burr of  |Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment_Weekly|  called the film a windswept pinnacle of its art and that it has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story . However, Stephen Hunter of  |The_Washington_Post|The_Washington_Post|  stated that the film is as spectacular as it is dense and as dense as it is colorful and as colorful as it is meaningless and as meaningless as it is long. And its very long. Kenneth Turan of the  |Los_Angeles_Times|Los_Angeles_Times|  said that the film brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes. In his review, Dave Smith from Gamers Republic called it one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999.     Roger Ebert placed Princess Mononoke sixth on his top ten movies of 1999. It ranked 488th on  |Empire|Empire| s list of the 500 greatest films. Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films. It also ranked 26 on  |Total_Film|Total_Film| s list of 50 greatest animated films.     James Cameron cited Princess Mononoke as an influence on his 2009 film  |Avatar|Avatar| . He acknowledged that it shares themes with Princess Mononoke, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora .       Princess Mononoke is the first animated feature film to win Best Picture in the Japan Academy Prize. For the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, Princess Mononoke was the Japanese submission to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film , but was not successfully nominated. Hayao Miyazaki was also nominated for an Annie Award for his work on the film.               The film score of Princess Mononoke was composed and performed by Joe Hisaishi , the soundtrack composer for nearly all of Miyazakis productions, and Miyazaki wrote the lyrics of the two vocal tracks, The Tatara Women Work Song and its title song. The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by Milan Records on October 12, 1999.

The symphonic suite features longer compositions, each encompassing several of the movie themes, performed by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mario Klemens.           In 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theatre company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing Princess Mononoke to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work. The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghiblis Toshio Suzuki .
