A duopoly  is a type of  |oligopoly|Oligopoly|  where two firms have dominant or exclusive control over a market. It is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity. Duopolies sell to consumers in a competitive market where the choice of an individual consumer can not affect the firm. The defining characteristic of both duopolies and oligopolies is that decisions made by sellers are dependent on each other.       There are two principal duopoly models,  |Cournot_duopoly|Cournot_Duopoly|  and  |Bertrand_duopoly|Bertrand_Duopoly| |Cournot|Antoine_Augustin_Cournot|  model, which shows that two firms assume each others output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this.   The  |Bertrand|Joseph_Louis_Fran√ßois_Bertrand|  model, in which, in a  |game|Game_Theory|  of two firms, each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a  |Nash_equilibrium|Nash_Equilibrium| .       Existence of only two sellers   Independence   Presence of monopoly elements: so long as products are differentiated, the firms enjoy some monopoly power, as each product will have some loyal customers   There are two popular models of duopoly, i.e., Cournots Model and Chamberlains Model.          Modern  |American_politics|Politics_Of_The_United_States| , in particular the  |electoral_college_system|Electoral_College| , has been described as duopolistic since the  |Republican|Republican_Party|  and  |Democratic|Democratic_Party|  parties have dominated and framed  |policy|Policy|  debate as well as the public discourse on matters of national concern for about a century and a half.  |Third_Parties|Third_Party|  have encountered various blocks in  |getting_onto_ballots|Ballot_Access|  at different levels of government as well as other electoral obstacles, such as denial of access to general election debates. Since 1987, the  |Commission_on_Presidential_Debates|Commission_On_Presidential_Debates| , established by the Republican and Democratic parties themselves, supplanting debates run since 1920 by the  |League_of_Women_Voters|League_Of_Women_Voters| . The League withdrew its support in protest in 1988 over objections of alleged stagecraft such as rules for camera placement, filling the audience with supporters, approved moderators, predetermined question selection, room temperature and others.  The Commission maintains its own rules for admittance and has yet to admit a third party candidate to a televised debate.          A commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving  |Visa|Visa_Inc.|  and  |MasterCard|Mastercard| , who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a  |U.S._Department_of_Justice|United_States_Department_Of_Justice| |antitrust|Sherman_Antitrust_Act|  lawsuit.   An appeal was upheld in 2004.      Examples where two companies control a large proportion of a market are:    |Woolworths|Woolworths_Limited|  and  |Coles|Coles_Supermarkets|  in the  |Australia|Australia| n supermarket market  Weeklytimesnow.com.au - Coles, Woolworths still dominate    |Norfolk_Southern_Railway|Norfolk_Southern_Railway|  and  |CSX_Transportation|Csx_Transportation|  operate a duopoly on freight rail traffic in the  |Eastern_United_States|Eastern_United_States| |Apples|Apple_Inc.| |iOS|Ios|  and  |Googles|Google| |Android|Android|  make up over 99% of the  |mobile_operating_system|Mobile_Operating_System|  market . The Verge. 16 February 2017. . GlobalStats Statcounter. Aug 2018 - Aug 2019.       In Finland, the state-owned broadcasting company  |Yleisradio|Yleisradio|  and the private broadcaster  |Mainos-TV|Mtv3|  had a legal duopoly from the 1950s to 1993. No other broadcasters were allowed. Mainos-TV operated by leasing air time from Yleisradio, broadcasting in reserved blocks between Yleisradios own programming on its two channels. This was a unique phenomenon in the world. Between 1986 and 1992 there was an independent third channel but it was jointly owned by Yle and MTV; only in 1993 did MTV get its own channel.     In the United Kingdom, the  |BBC|Bbc|  and  |ITV|Itv|  formed an effective duopoly  until the development of multichannel from the 1990s onwards.      |Safaricom|Safaricom|  mobile service provider and  |Airtel|Airtel|  in Kenya are perfect examples of Duopoly market in the African telecommunication industry.           |Duopoly|Duopoly|  is also used in the United States broadcast television and radio industry to refer to a single company owning two outlets in the same city.     This usage is technically incompatible with the normal definition of the word and may lead to confusion, inasmuch as there are generally more than two owners of broadcast television stations in markets with broadcast duopolies. In Canada, this definition is therefore more commonly called a  |twinstick|Twinstick|.
