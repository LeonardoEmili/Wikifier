         De Benneville Bert Bell was the  |National_Football_League|National_Football_League|  commissioner from 1946 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the leagues commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States . He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the  |Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame|Pro_Football_Hall_Of_Fame| .     Bell played football at the  |University_of_Pennsylvania|University_Of_Pennsylvania| , where as  |quarterback|Quarterback| , he led his team to an appearance in the  |1917_Rose_Bowl|1917_Rose_Bowl| . After being drafted into the US Army during World War I, he returned to complete his collegiate career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the  |Quakers|Penn_Quakers_Football|  in the 1920s. During the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , he was an assistant coach for the  |Temple_Owls|Temple_Owls_Football|  and a co-founder and co-owner of the  |Philadelphia_Eagles|Philadelphia_Eagles| .     With the Eagles, Bell led the way in cooperating with the other NFL owners to establish the  |National_Football_League_Draft|National_Football_League_Draft|  in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the  |Pittsburgh_Steelers|Pittsburgh_Steelers| . During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the wars conclusion.     After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling policy, negotiated a merger with the  |All-America_Football_Conference|All-America_Football_Conference|  , and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on enhancing the dramatic effect of late-season matches. During the  |Golden_Age_of_Television|Golden_Age_Of_Television| , he tailored the games rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amid criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from  |Congress|United_States_Congress| , he unilaterally recognized the  |NFLPA|National_Football_League_Players_Association|  and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for the players. He survived to oversee the  |Greatest_Game_Ever_Played|1958_Nfl_Championship_Game|  and to envision what the league would become in the future.       Bell was born de Benneville Bell, Didinger with Lyons: 6; cf. Claassen: 163, Yost: 54 on February 25, 1895, MacCambridge: 41; cf. Didinger with Lyons: 6, Rothe: 34, King: 20, Lyons: 1 in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  to  |John_C._Bell|John_C._Bell|  and Fleurette de Benneville Myers. Lyons: 1; cf. Didinger with Lyons: 6 His father was an attorney who served a term as the  |Pennsylvania_Attorney_General|Pennsylvania_Attorney_General| . Lyons: 3 His older brother,  |John_C.,_Jr.|John_C._Bell,_Jr.| , was born in 1892. Berts parents were very wealthy, MacCambridge 2005: 41; cf. Lyons: 1–3 and his mothers lineage predated the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| . Lyons: 2 His father, a  |Quaker|Penn_Quakers|  of the  |University_of_Pennsylvania|University_Of_Pennsylvania|  during the  |early_days_of_American_football|History_Of_American_Football| ,  accompanied him to his first football game when Bell was six years old. Sullivan: 23–24 Thereafter, Bell regularly engaged in football games with childhood friends. Lyons: 3–4.     In 1904, Bell matriculated at the  |Episcopal_Academy|Episcopal_Academy| , the  |Delancey_School|Delancey_School|  from 1909 to 1911 and then the  |Haverford_School|Haverford_School|  until 1914. About this time, his father was installed as athletics director at Penn and helped form the  |National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|  . Lyons: 2–3, 5. At Haverford, Bell captained the schools football, basketball, and baseball teams, Lyons: 4; cf. King: 21. and was awarded The Yale Cup The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in the school.  Although he excelled at baseball, his devotion was to football. Lyons: 5 His father, who was named a trustee at Penn in 1911, Marquis: 286 said of Bells plans for college, Bert will go to Penn or he will go to hell.          Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined  |Phi_Kappa_Sigma|Phi_Kappa_Sigma| . Lyons: 5–7 Rothe: 34 In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penns coach  |George_H._Brooke|George_H._Brooke| . On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt returner.  After the teams 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season, Lyons: 6–7 as Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2. MacCambridge 2009: 1080     Prior to Penns 1916 season, his mother died while he was en route to her bedside. Lyons:7-8 Nevertheless, he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach  |Bob_Folwell|Bob_Folwell| , but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season. Penn finished with a record of 7–2–1. However, the Quakers secured an invitation to the  |1917_Rose_Bowl|1917_Rose_Bowl|  against the  |Oregon_Ducks|Oregon_Ducks| . King: 21; cf. Lyons: 9 Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20–14 loss to Oregon was a 20-yard run by Bell, he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception. Lyons: 10     In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9–2 record. Afterwards, he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and was deployed to  |France|France|  in May 1918. Lyons: 11–15 As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from  |General|General_Officer| |John_J._Pershing|John_J._Pershing| , and Bell was promoted to  |first_sergeant|First_Sergeant| . Lyons: 16–20. After the war, Bell returned to the United States in March 1919. He returned to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically. The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6–2–1 record. Academically, his aversion to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree in early 1920. ; cf. Lyons: 20–21, MacCambridge 2005: 42, Willis: 310–311 His collegiate days ended with his having been a borderline  |All-America|All-America| n, Lyons: 20; cf. Umphlett: 143–144 but this period of his life had proven that he possessed the qualities of a leader. ; cf.        Bell assembled the  |Stanley_Professionals|Stanley_Professionals|  in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the  |Black_Sox_Scandal|Black_Sox_Scandal| . ; cf.  He joined  |John_Heismans|John_Heisman|  staff at Penn as an assistant coach in 1920, and Bell would remain there for several years. Lyons: 22–23. At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities. At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing Lyons: 23–29 and frequenting  |Saratoga_Race_Course|Saratoga_Race_Course| , where he counted as friends  |Tim_Mara|Tim_Mara| ,  |Art_Rooney|Art_Rooney| , and  |George_Preston_Marshall|George_Preston_Marshall| . Lyons writes, against all common sense, it was Jack Mara, Tims son, as the person he befriended. Lyons: 23, 29 In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by  |Lud_Wray|Lud_Wray| , a fellow assistant coach. Lyons: 25–27 Bells resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season.     Bell was then an employee of the  |Ritz-Carlton|Ritz-Carlton|  in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000  during the  |Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929|Wall_Street_Crash_Of_1929| . Lyons: 30–32 His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the  |Temple_Owls_football|Temple_Owls_Football|  team. ; cf. Rothe: 34, Lyons: 28, Willis: 310 In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. Lyons: 49 When  |Pop_Warner|Glenn_Scobey_Warner|  was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go. Lyons: 28; cf. MacCambridge 2009: 1081           By early 1933, Bells opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 56, 95. After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the  |Pennsylvania_Blue_Laws|Blue_Law|  would have to be mollified, Westcott: 101; cf. Willis: 303–304, Algeo: 13–15, Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 95 he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from  |Frances_Upton|Frances_Upton| , partnered with Wray, Lyons: 46–47; cf. Claassen: 336, MacCambridge 2005: 42, Peterson: 112, Westcott: 101 and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the  |Philadelphia_Eagles|Philadelphia_Eagles| . Lyons: 47; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 42     After the inaugural  |1933_Philadelphia_Eagles_season|1933_Philadelphia_Eagles_Season| , Willis: 310–311; cf. Coenen: 237, Didinger with Lyons: 255 Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Lyons: 33–38, 41. Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the  |Ed_Thorp_Memorial_Trophy|Ed_Thorp_Memorial_Trophy|  was affirmed. Willis: 327–328 In  |1934|1934_Nfl_Season| , the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, Didinger with Lyons: 255 The Eagles inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, Lyons: 54 and his failure to sign a talented college prospect Lyons: 56; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 43 led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. Peterson: 119; cf. Williams: 41 In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, Willis: 341–343; cf. Lyons: 57–58, DeVito: 84, Didinger with Lyons: 256 and in February 1936, the  |first_draft|1936_Nfl_Draft|  kicked off, at which he acted as  |Master_of_Ceremonies|Master_Of_Ceremonies| . Williams: 41–42; cf. Peterson: 119 Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born. Lyons: 60     In the Eagles first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 , MacCambridge 2005: 43; cf. Lyons: 63 and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $4,500 . MacCambridge 2005: 43; cf. Claassen: 335, Lyons: 63 Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles, Lyons: 63; cf. Claassen: 342 wherein Bell led the Eagles to a 1–11 finish, their worst record ever. ;Didinger with Lyons: 256 In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and  |Pittsburgh_Steelers|Pittsburgh_Steelers|  owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. Willis: 355 During the Eagles 2-8-1  |1937_season|1937_Nfl_Season| , Didinger with Lyons: 257 his second child,  |John_Upton|Upton_Bell| , was born. Lyons: 70 In the Eagles first profitable season,  |1938|1938_Nfl_Season| , they posted a 5–6 record. Lyons: 72–73. The Eagles finished 1–9–1 in  |1939|1939_Nfl_Season|  and 1–10 in  |1940|1940_Nfl_Season| . Didinger with Lyons: 258       In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of Rooneys Steelers to  |Alexis_Thompson|Alexis_Thompson| , Algeo: 16 and then Rooney acquired half of Bells interest in the Eagles. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 183–184; cf. Herskowitz: 149, Lyons: 81–82 In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka, Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh. Lyons: 87; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 187 Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 303; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 45 Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager. Ruck; with Patterson and Weber: 187; cf. Lyons: 88, MacCambridge 2005: 45     During the training camp of the Pittsburghs inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the teams prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the me old Steelers . ; cf. Claassen: 247, Lyons: 90, Leblanc: 62 After losing the first two games of the  |1941_season|1941_Nfl_Season| , Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach. Lyons: 90–91 Bells coaching career ended with a 10–46–2 record, his 0.179 winning percentage is second lowest in NFL history to only  |Phil_Handlers|Phil_Handler|  0.105 for coaches with at least five seasons. And at 36 games under .500 he held the record for futility until  |John_McKay|John_Mckay|  passed him in 1983 and  |Marion_Campbell|Marion_Campbell|  passed him in 1988.  Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 225; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 45 His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months after the seasons conclusion. Lyons: 92     By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the  |United_States_Armed_Forces|United_States_Armed_Forces|  for  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Algeo: 29, 35, 46. The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since  |Major_League_Baseball|Major_League_Baseball|  was continuing unabated, then they should also. DeVito: 103     Throughout Bells affiliation with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him. Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 71 Compounding Bells problems,  |Arch_Ward|Arch_Ward|  organized the  |All-America_Football_Conference|All-America_Football_Conference|  in 1944 to displace the NFLs sovereignty in professional football. MacCambridge 2005: 13; cf. Davis 2005: 196–197 Wards AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league, Davis 2005: 199; cf. Piascik: 11, Littlewood 166, Staudohar: 56 which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 228; cf. Davis 2005: 200–201 In  |Bill_Dudleys|Bill_Dudley|  contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bells anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC. Whittingham: 229 Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history. Claassen: 251–252            |Elmer_Layden|Elmer_Layden|  was appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring. Littlewood: 133 Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 1946. Davis 2005: 199; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 15, Peterson: 159 Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh, Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 225; cf. Davis 2005: 201 was elected to replace him. Williams: 41; cf. Lyons: 116–117, MacCambridge 2005: 15 He received a three-year contract at $20,000  per year,  and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney, Lyons: 114 albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value. Lyons: 166–167 He was then immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied  |Dan_Reeves|Dan_Reeves|  permission to relocate the  |Cleveland_Rams|History_Of_The_Cleveland_Rams|  to  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| . MacCambridge 2005: 15–16; cf. Davis 2005: 201–202, Yost: 57–58: Lyons: 117–118 Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the  |Los_Angeles_Rams|Los_Angeles_Rams|  were formed. As a precondition to the Rams leasing the  |Los_Angeles_Coliseum|Los_Angeles_Coliseum| , they signed  |Kenny_Washington|Kenny_Washington| , which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field, but also caused all hell to break loose amidst the owners. Rathet; Brown: 210     The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the leagues inception. Willis: 302, 303, 308, 371, 383 The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their teams win-loss record. Yost: 61; cf. Sullivan: 26. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the leagues schedule. MacCambridge 2005: 40; cf. Maule: 242, Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 248 He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. Sullivan: 26; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 248 His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.     On the eve of the  |1946_championship_game|1946_Nfl_Championship_Game| , Bell was notified that  |Merle_Hapes|Merle_Hapes|  and  |Frank_Filchock|Frank_Filchock|  of the  |New_York_Giants|New_York_Giants|  had been implicated in a bribing scandal. ; cf. Coenen: 127, Peterson: 159–160, MacCambridge 2005: 48, Pervin: 15, Lyons: 130 Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended. Lyons: 130–131; cf. Pervin: 16, Davis 2005 p. 207 At the next NFL owners meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing.  However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Lyons: 129 Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs. Lyons: 289; cf. DeVito: 83, Willis: 301, Maule: 242     Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into the league constitution, Lyons: 131–132; cf:  which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed. Lyons: 203–204; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 48–49 Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Lyons: 134–135; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 48–49 Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events Lyons: 142 and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams. Yost: 60; cf. Daley: 193       The NFLs struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages, Lyons: 129; cf. Davis 2005: 203–204 attendance, Coenen: 125–126 marketing, Coenen: 125 and by  |1949|1949_Nfl_Season| , it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years. Lyons: 171 Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. Piascik: 125; cf. Lyons: 146 In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets. Coenen: 154 Nevertheless, he actualized the NFLs first television contract Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 290 —the  |1949_championship_game|1949_Nfl_Championship_Game| . Lyons: 156–157 Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from  |Bill_Radovich|Bill_Radovich| , who had been  |blacklisted|Hollywood_Blacklist|  for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Lyons and the New York Times incorrectly list Radovich for playing with the  |Los_Angeles_Seals|San_Francisco_Seals| . U.S. House Committee III, 1957, pp. 2778–2779; cf. Piascik: 27, Carrol with Gersham, Neft, and Thorn: 1197, Lyons: 154 Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell. Lyons: 154–155     One of the primary impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of territorial rights claimed by Marshall.  Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC. Davis 2005: 229 In late 1949, the leagues merged, Lyons: 150, 163; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 52 and Bell would stay on as commissioner with his contract extended from five to ten years Lyons: 147 as three AAFC teams  were subsumed. Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized exquisite dramatic and business sense and allocated the  |1950|1950_Nfl_Season|  opening game to a contest between the  |1949_champion_Eagles|1949_Philadelphia_Eagles_Season|  versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns. Peterson: 191–192; cf: Brown with Clary: 197 Feeling financially secure after the merger, he purchased his first home for himself and his family in  |Narberth,_Pennsylvania|Narberth,_Pennsylvania| .       In 1950, Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75-mile radius of their stadium – except for the Rams. Coenen: 154; cf. Davis 2005: 259–260, 266, 268–269, LaBlanc p. 10. Consequently, the  |United_States_Department_of_Justice|United_States_Department_Of_Justice|  opened an investigation into a violation of the  |Sherman_Antitrust_Act|Sherman_Antitrust_Act| . Coenen: 157. Ensuingly, the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50%, Peterson: 197; cf. Hessions: 45, MacCambridge 2005: 70 and this signaled a potential financial disaster. Rader: 86–87 In 1951, he licensed the  |DuMont_Television_Network|Dumont_Television_Network|  to air the championship games for the next five years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently. ; cf. , MacCambridge 2005: 73, 480, Rader: 86–87; contra: The  |Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette|Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette| , Lyons and Patton report the title game receipts were only $75,000 for the  |1951_NFL_Championship_Game|1951_Nfl_Championship_Game| . , Lyons: 179, Patton: 35     However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league. Davis 2005: 271; cf. MacCambridge, 2005: 73 The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, You cant give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark ; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952. Coenen: 157–158 After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL. Rader: 86; cf. Peterson: 197 He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week, ; cf. Lyons: 196 and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams. Coenen; 156, 162; cf. Lyons: 196 In the DOJs case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract; Patton: 55; cf. Peterson: 198, Lyons: 199–200 Bell was ecstatic. Rader: 86 Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns football games. Brown with Clary: 230–232 Although he hated to fly, Patton: 48 at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league. U.S. House Committee III, 1957, p. 2587; cf. Summerall with Levin: 36–37     Bell authorized a  |Pro_Bowl|Pro_Bowl|  to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players. Brown with Clary: 214 But in the early 1950s, on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline assault and battery Ratterman; with Deindorfer: 125 with teams star players being viciously targeted by opposing players. ; cf. Piascik: 155 He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I dont believe there are any.  Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were salesman for professional football we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football. King: 37; cf.      Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product. Lyons: 282 After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956, Patton: 37; cf Rader: 87 he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give us our greatest opportunity to sell the NFL and everyone must present to the public the greatest games  ... combined with the finest sportsmanship. Maraniss: 168–169 This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFLs rise to becoming Americas most popular sport. Lomax: 16       In  |Radovich_v._National_Football_League|Radovich_V._National_Football_League| , the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States|  ruled in Radovichs favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws, Coenen: 182; cf. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 293 and the implication was that the legality of the draft and  |reserve_clause|Reserve_Clause|  were dubious. Coenen: 182; cf. Lyons: 255–256 Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business.
